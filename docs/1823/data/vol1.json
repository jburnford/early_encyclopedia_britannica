[{"h":"ACOSTA","t":"(Jos\u00e9ph D.), a celebrated Spanish author, was born at Medina del Campo, about the year 1539. In 1571, he went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERU\">Peru</a> as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCIAL\">Provincial</a> of the Jesuits, having entered into that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> in his fourteenth year. After a residence in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a> of seventeen years, he returned to his native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, and became in succession visitor for his order of Arragon and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANDALUSIA\">Andalusia</a>, superior of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VALLADOLID\">Valladolid</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECTOR\">rector</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALAMANCA\">Salamanca</a>; in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> he died in February 1600.\n\nAbout ten years before his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, he published at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEVILLE\">Seville</a>, in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> quarto, his valuable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> entitled Historia <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">Natural</a> y Moral de las Indias. The two first books of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> were written during his residence in Peru, and were published separately after his return to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, in the Latin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, with this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a>: De Natura <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVI\">Novi</a> Orbis, libri duo. He afterwards translated them into Spanish, and added to them other five books, the whole composing a connected work, under the first mentioned title. This work, which has been translated into all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> languages of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, is written <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> and comprehensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>. The five first books are employed upon the physical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">geography</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\">natural history</a> of that portion of America which had been conquered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> discovered by the Spaniards; the fifth and sixth upon the manners, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> and civil institutions of the inhabitants; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a>, upon the history of the Mexicans, from their origin till the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of their subjugation. Dr Robertson pronounces Acosta, \"an accurate and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a>-informed writer.\" Among other things, he treats the subject of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> in a more philosophical manner, than could have been expected in a writer of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, and of his order. \"He was the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>,\" says the eminent author <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> quoted, \"who endeavoured to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> for the different degrees of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> in the old and new...\"\ncontinents, by the agency of the winds which blow in each;\u2014a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> which was afterwards adopted by Buffon, and supported with his usual powers of copious and eloquent illustration. In the course of these discussions, Acosta frequently comments upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>, and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> philosophers, that the middle zone of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> was so much scorched by the rays of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, as to be destitute of moisture and verdure, and totally uninhabitable. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> seems to have held its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">Schools</a>, even after the discovery of South America had disclosed the magnificent scenery and stupendous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> of the tropical regions. It appears to have been thought a sort of impiety to question a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOGMA\">dogma</a> of such ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a>, and sanctioned by the assent of all the school divines. We learn, from a curious passage in Osborne's Miscellany of Essays, Paradoxes, and Letters, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> of this ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> in geography, was one of the circumstances which brought upon the famous Sir Walter Ralegh the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> scepticism and atheism. Acosta mentions, that, when he went to America, his mind was deeply imbued with frightful notions of this supposed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> zone, and that his surprise was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a>, when he beheld it so different from what it had been represented in the \"ancient and received <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>.\"\n\n\"What could I do then,\" says he, \"but laugh at Aristotle's meteors and his philosophy?\"\n\nHaving said thus much in regard to one of the most curious and valuable of the earlier accounts of the new world, it may be proper to add, that, in speaking of the conduct of his countrymen, and the propagation of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>, Acosta is in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> respect superior to the other prejudiced and fanatical writers of his country and age. Though he acknowledges that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAREER\">career</a> of Spanish conquest was marked by the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> cruelty and oppression, he yet represents this people as the chosen instruments of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEITY\">Deity</a>, for spreading the truths of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOSPEL\">gospel</a> among the nations of America. He accordingly recounts a variety of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MIRACLES\">miracles</a>, as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the constant interposition of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAVEN\">Heaven</a>, in favour of these merciless and rapacious invaders. It <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> appear from the following curious passage, that he even makes the great enemy of mankind himself, a co-operator in that scheme of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVERSION\">conversion</a> for which he represents the Spaniards to have been predestined. \"That\" says he, \"which is difficult in our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a> to believe, has been made easy among the Indians; because the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEVIL\">Devil</a> had made them comprehend even the self same things, which he had stolen from our evangelical law\u2014as their manner of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CONFESSION\">confession</a>, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADORATION\">adoration</a> of three in one, and such like; the which, against the will of the enemy, have holpen for the easy receiving of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>.\"\n\nBesides his History, Acosta wrote the following works: 1. De Promulgatione Evangelii apud Barbaros.\u20142. De Christo Revelato.\u20143. De Temporibus Novissimis, libros vi.\u20144. Concionum, tomos iii. All of these works were, in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, frequently reprinted; but it is only by his history that his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> is now known in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LITERARY\">literary</a> world. The English translation, from which we have taken the preceding extracts, was published at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, in quarto, in the year 1604, and is now rather a scarce book.\n\nACOUSTICS. The doctrine of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> is unquestionably the most subtle and abstruse in the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANGE\">range</a> of physical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>. It has given occasion, in recent times, to much controversy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a>, and has eventually called forth all the mighty resources of a refined and elaborate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CALCULUS\">calculus</a>. Yet an evident obscurity still remains to overcloud the subject. The discrepancies between theory and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> have been made entirely to disappear from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a>, which has at last attained a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a> befitting the sublimity of the science. But some latent suspicions pervade the structure of acoustics, sufficient to disturb that feeling of confidence which is calculated to invigorate our pursuits. The general theory of sound, and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> to a variety of curious philosophical amusements, have been explained in the body of the work. We purpose, however, to reconsider the subject at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>, and to examine closely the bases on which it rests. But we must content ourselves at present with a few sketches, reserving our extended remarks for their several distinct heads, in hopes that, during the progress of this Supplement, we shall be able to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLECT\">collect</a> more accurate and complete materials.","sp":260,"ep":261},{"h":"ADEN","t":"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the Arabian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a>, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EAST\">east</a> of the straits of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BABELMANDEL\">Babelmandel</a>, the position of which only is mentioned, and that not very accurately, in the body of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>.

Suppose a polished glass plate to be suspended horizontally from one extremity of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a>, and to be exactly counterpoised by weights put into the opposite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> we bring this plate in contact with the surface of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a>, we shall find that a certain additional <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> must be placed in the opposite scale, in order to separate the glass from the mercury. The force which kept the two bodies in contact is called adhesion. Three sets of experiments <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> this subject have been published by different philosophers.\n\nDr Brook Taylor in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNETISM\">magnetism</a>, inserted in the Philosophical Transactions for 1721, describes the result of his trials to determine the weight necessary to separate fir-boards of different sizes from the surface of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>. The result of his experiments was,\u2014that the weight necessary is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to the surface of the fir-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOARD\">board</a> to be raised.\n\nIn the year 1773, Guyton-Morveau ascertained experimentally the force of adhesion of eleven different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a> to mercury. The metals which he employed were pure. The surface of each was an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a> (French) in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a>, and polished. The following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> exhibits the weight in French grains, necessary to separate each metal from the mercury.\n\n| Metal     | Weight (French grains) |\n|-----------|-----------------------|\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">Gold</a>      | 446                   |\n| Silver    | 429                   |\n| Tin       | 418                   |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">Lead</a>      | 397                   |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BISMUTH\">Bismuth</a>   | 372                   |\n| Platinum  | 282                   |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZINC\">Zinc</a>      | 204                   |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COPPER\">Copper</a>    | 142                   |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTIMONY\">Antimony</a>  | 126                   |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">Iron</a>      | 115                   |\n| Cobalt    | 8                     |\nM. Morveau ascertained likewise, that the adhesive force is not diminished by removing the pressure of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>.\n\nA <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of experiments on the same subject were made at a still later <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, by Mr Achard of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BERLIN\">Berlin</a>. He measured the force of adhesion between various substances and water. He found, that when the temperature was increased, the adhesion proportionally diminished. He even attempted to determine the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIMINUTION\">diminution</a> occasioned by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELEVATION\">elevation</a> of temperature, amounting to a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of the thermometer; and gives us a formula denoting that diminution. But it is not necessary to enter into any details respecting his experiments here, for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> appear immediately.\n\nBesides these three philosophers, many others have examined the rise of liquids in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CAPILLARY\">capillary</a> tubes, a phenomenon which is nothing else than a peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of adhesion; though we cannot with propriety treat of it here. Laplace published a dissertation on the subject in the year 1805, in which he has given us an historical detail, which however is far from accurate. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> appears to us in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> correct; though several very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a> are rather obscured than elucidated by his mathematical demonstrations.\n\nWhen we make experiments on the adhesion of solids to liquids, and endeavour to ascertain the force requisite to separate them from each other, two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> may occur. The solid body may separate from the liquid, dry; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> its surface may be covered with a thin coating of the liquid which it retains. If a surface of tallow be placed in contact with water, and separated from it by weights successively introduced into the opposite scale, we shall find, after the separation has taken <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, that the surface of the tallow is dry, or that it has not carried along with it a thin coating of the water. But when we employ a fir-board as Dr Brook Taylor did in his experiments, and as Mr Achard did in many of his, the case is very different. We shall find the whole surface of the board thoroughly wetted; that is to say, a thin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-FILM\">film</a> of the liquid remains adhering to the wood. Now, it is only the first of these two cases that can be considered as exhibiting the true force of adhesion. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> case, it is not the solid which separates from the liquid; but one portion of the liquid which separates from the other. Such experiments therefore really show the force of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COHESION\">cohesion</a> between the particles of the liquid; not the force of adhesion between the solid and the liquid. Now, as the experiments of Brook Taylor and Achard belong all to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> case, it is obvious that they cannot be considered as experiments on adhesion. We must therefore leave them out of our consideration at present. The cohesion of the particles of liquids is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> known to diminish as the temperature increases; till at a certain temperature this cohesion disappears altogether, and the liquids assume the state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a>, the particles of which repel each other. Hence, the reason why, in Achard's experiments, the adhesive force diminished as the temperature increased.\n\nAdhesion is obviously an attractive force, by which the two surfaces are kept in contact. It must evidently increase as the surfaces adhering, because the number of adhering particles increase in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a>. This force is insensible, when the two surfaces are at any perceptible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> from one another; so that it acts only at insensible distances. From Morveau's experiments it appears, that it differs very much in intensity when different solids are made to adhere to the same liquid. Thus gold adheres to mercury, with a force more than twice as great as zinc does, and almost fifty-six times as great as cobalt does. Now these two properties, namely, acting only at insensible distances, and varying in intensity in different bodies, characterize that peculiar force known by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of chemical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a>. But there is one particular in which chemical affinity appears at first sight to differ from adhesion. Chemical affinity is confined to the ultimate particles or atoms of bodies; whereas, adhesion takes place between surfaces of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> whatever.\n\nBut, if we consider that these surfaces consist each of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONGERIES\">congeries</a> of atoms united into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> by the force of cohesion; that adhesion is not sensible at any perceptible distance, however great the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of surfaces may be; and that its strength increases in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to the surfaces\u2014if we consider these phenomena, we shall find reason to conclude, that adhesion is a force which acts only between the atoms or integrant particles of bodies. It is therefore merely a case of chemical affinity.\n\nThe phenomena of adhesion depend upon the strength of affinity between the adhering bodies. If the affinity be weak, the two surfaces will separate by a small force applied, and the solid will retain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> of the liquid whatever. This happens when cobalt is brought in contact with mercury, or tallow with water. If the affinity be strong, a considerable force will be requisite to separate the two surfaces. This is the case when gold or silver is brought in contact with mercury. So great is the affinity indeed in these cases, that if the adhesion continue for a short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> actually takes place between the two metals. In that case the gold comes away <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>, or coated over with a film of mercury; the experiment is no longer an example of the force of adhesion between mercury and gold, but exhibits the cohesive force of the particles of mercury to each other. We have even found that this holds with platinum, though it be a metal which has a much weaker affinity for mercury than gold has. If a clean surface of platinum be kept for some time in contact with that of mercury, a very evident amalgamation takes place.\n\nWhen a surface of wood, marble or metal, comes in contact with water, on removing it we find that surface moist; that is to say, it has carried with it a thin film of water. This shews us, that the adhesive force of water, or the affinity of water to these different bodies, is greater than the cohesive force of the particles of water for each other. Yet this force is not sufficiently strong to produce a chemical combination between the respective bodies. When a surface of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> comes in contact with water, this surface is not merely wetted. If the contact be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> for a sufficient time the solid loses its cohesion, and is dissolved by the liquid. This is a complicated case. The water by capillary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> insinuates itself through the pores of the sugar.

Of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of Admiral there are three degrees\u2014Admiral, Vice-Admiral, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REAR\">Rear</a>-Admiral. Each of those degrees consists of three divisions, which are distinguished by as many different colours or flags; hence all admirals assume the common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAG\">flag</a>-officers, and take rank and command in the following order:\n\nAdmirals of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">Red</a>, of the White, of the Blue Squadrons, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> their respective flags at the main-top-gallant-mast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>; Vice-Admirals of the Red, of the White, of the Blue Squadrons, bearing their respective flags at the fore-top-gallant-mast head; Rear-Admirals of the Red, of the White, of the Blue Squadrons, bearing their respective flags at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MIZEN\">mizen</a>-top-gallant-mast head.\n\nIt may be remarked, that for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a> nearly we had no Admiral of the Red <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUADRON\">squadron</a>; that flag, according to a vulgar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>, having been taken from us by the Dutch in one of those arduous struggles for naval superiority which that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> was once able to maintain against the naval power of England. But the fact is, the red flag was laid aside on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNION\">union</a> of the two crowns of England and Scotland, when the Union flag was adopted in its place, and usually hoisted by the Admiral commanding in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a>. The red flag, however, has recently been revived, on an occasion worthy of the event; namely, on the promotion of naval officers which took place in November 1805, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the memorable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VICTORY\">victory</a> before <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-TRAFALGAR\">Trafalgar</a>.

An <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> officer of high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> in the state, in whom not only the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">navy</a> is vested, but who, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> before any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> navy existed in England, presided over a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOVEREIGN\">sovereign</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">court</a>, with authority to hear and determine all causes relating to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, and to take cognizance of all offences committed thereon.\n\nThere can be little doubt of the Asiatic origin of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> given to this officer, which does not appear to have been known in the languages of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of the holy wars. Amir, in Arabic, is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> commander of forces; it is the same word as the ameer of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENINSULA\">peninsula</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>, (as ameer ul omrah, the chief of lords or princes,) and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMIR\">emir</a> of the Turks or Saracens, who had, and still have, their emir or ameer'l durcea, commander of the sea; amir't asker durcea, commander of the naval armament. The incorporation of the article with the noun appears, we believe, for the first time in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANNALS\">annals</a> of Eutychius, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRIARCH\">patriarch</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALEXANDRIA\">Alexandria</a>, in the tenth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, who calls the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CALIPH\">Caliph</a> Omar Amirul munimium, seu, Imperator fidilium. Spelman says, \"In regno Saracenorum quatuor pretiores statuit, qui Admirali vocabantur.\" The d is evidently impertinent, and is omitted by the French, who say Amiral. The Spanish write Almirante; the Portuguese the same. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILTON\">Milton</a> would seem to have been aware of the origin of the word, when he speaks of \"the mast of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> Amiral.\" It is obvious, then, that the supposed derivations of Almirante from the Greek, ameer from the French, and am mereal from the Saxon, are fanciful and unauthorized etymologies.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of time about which this officer first makes his appearance in the governments of European nations, corroborates the supposition of its having been adopted in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a> powers, at the return of the Christian heroes from the holy wars. According to Moreri, Florent de Valenue, in the year 1270, was the first Admiral known in France; but by the most approved writers of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> was unknown till, in 1284, Enguerand de Coussy was constituted Admiral. The first Admiral by name that we know of in England was W. de Leybourne, who was appointed to that office by Edward I. in the year 1286, under the title of Admiral de la <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MER\">mer</a> du roy d'Angleterre. Mariana, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, says that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DON\">Don</a> Sancho, having resolved to make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the barbarians, (Moors,) prepared a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a>; and as the Genoese were at that time very powerful by sea, and experienced and dexterous sailors, he sent to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENOA\">Genoa</a> to invite, with great offers, Benito Zacharias into his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>; that he accepted those offers, and brought with him twelve ships; that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> named him his Admiral, (Almirante,) and conferred on him the office for a limited time. This happened in the year 1284. Several Portuguese authors observe, that their office of Almirante was derived from the Genoese, who had it from the Sicilians, and these from the Saracens; and it appears from Souza's Historia Genealogica da <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CASA\">Casa</a> Real, that, in 1392, Micer Manuel Picagow was invited from Genoa into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PORTUGAL\">Portugal</a>, and appointed to the office of Almirante, with a salary of three thousand pounds (livras) a-year, and certain lands, &c., on condition that he should furnish, on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a>, twenty men of Genoa, all experienced in sea affairs, and qualified to be alcaldes (captains) and arraisers (masters).\nAdmiral of ships; all of which terms, *almirante*, *alc\u00e1di*, and *arrais*, are obviously of Arabic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DERIVATION\">derivation</a>.\n\nEdward I., who began his reign in 1272, went to the Holy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">Land</a>, and visited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SICILY\">Sicily</a> on his return. He must therefore have had an opportunity of informing himself concerning the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> and naval <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> of the various countries bordering on the Mediterranean\u2014an opportunity which so able and warlike a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> would not neglect; but whether the title and office of Admiral existed in England before his time, as some are inclined to think, or whether W. de Leybourne was first created to that office in 1286, as before mentioned, we believe there is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> authentic record to enable us to decide. Supposing him, however, to be the first, Edward may either have adopted the office and title from the Genoese, or the Sicilians, or the Spaniards, or the French; or even had it directly from the Saracens, against whom he had fought, and with whom he had afterwards much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMICABLE\">amicable</a> intercourse. It would seem, however, that the office was, in Edward's time, merely honorary; for that monarch, in 1307, orders the Lord Mayor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, at his peril and without delay, to provide a good ship, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> equipped, to carry his pavilions and tents; and, in the same year, another order is addressed to the *Vicecomes Kantiae*, to provide, for immediate passage across the seas, \"tot et tales pontes et claias,\" as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTABLE\">constable</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOVER\">Dover</a> Castle should demand; without one word being mentioned of the admiral. (Rymer, Vol. III. p. 32.)\n\nFrom the 34th Edward II. we have a regular and uninterrupted succession of Admirals. In that year he appointed Edward <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> Admiral of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">North</a>, from the mouth of the river <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THAMES\">Thames</a> northward, and Ger-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VASE\">vase</a> Allard Admiral of the West, from the mouth of the Thames westward; and these two Admirals of the North and the West were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to the 34th Edward III., when John de Beauchamp, Lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARDEN\">Warden</a> of the Cinque Ports, constable of the Tower of London, and of the Castle of Dover, was constituted *High Admiral of England*; but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> years afterwards, the office was again divided into north and west, and so continued until the 10th Richard II., when Richard, son of Alain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARL\">Earl</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARUNDEL\">Arundel</a>, was appointed Admiral of England. Two years after this, it was again divided as before; and in the fifteenth year of the same reign, Edward Earl of Rutland and Cork, afterwards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">Duke</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALBEMARLE\">Albemarle</a>, was constituted *High Admiral of the North and West*; and after him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARQUIS\">Marquis</a> of Dorset, and Earl of Somerset, son of John of Gaunt, Duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANCASTER\">Lancaster</a>; then Percy Earl of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WINCHESTER\">Winchester</a> next succeeded to the same title, which once more was dropped in the 2d of Henry IV., and divided as before. But in the sixth of the same reign, the office of Admiral of England became permanently vested in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a>. In the 14th Henry VI., John <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a> Duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXETER\">Exeter</a> was created Admiral of England, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>, and Aquitain, for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>; and in the third year of Edward VI., John <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUDLEY\">Dudley</a> Earl of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARWICK\">Warwick</a> was constituted High Admiral of England, Ireland, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CALAIS\">Calais</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOLOGNA\">Bologna</a>, the marches of the same, Normandy, Gascony, and Aquitain, also <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> of the navy and seas of the king, &c. In the 27th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a>, Charles Lord Howard had all the aforesaid titles, with the addition of Captain-general of the navy and seas of the said kingdoms.\n\nOn the 20th November 1632, the office of High Admiral was, for the first time, put in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a>, all the great officers of state being the commissioners. During the Commonwealth, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMITTEE\">committee</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> managed the affairs of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMIRALTY\">Admiralty</a>. At the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESTORATION\">Restoration</a>, in 1660, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HIGHNESS\">Highness</a> James Duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a> was constituted *Lord High Admiral of England*. The commission was revoked on the 22d May 1684, and King Charles II. held the Admiralty in his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, and managed it by the great officers of his Privy-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> until his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. He took this occasion of reserving for his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> all the droits and perquisites claimed by the Lord High Admiral. King James II. declared himself in council *Lord High Admiral and Lord General*; and he managed the affairs of the Admiralty and navy by Mr Secretary Pepys all the time of his reign. In the 1st William and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>, the Admiralty was again put in commission. In the 6th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANNE\">Anne</a>, (1707,) his Royal Highness George Prince of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DENMARK\">Denmark</a> was appointed *High Admiral of Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>*, (in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNION\">union</a> of the two crowns,) with a council to assist him; and at his death the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a> acted in the office by Mr Burchett. On the 29th November 1708, it was again put in commission, or rather, the Earl of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEMBROKE\">Pembroke</a> was constituted High Admiral, with a council to assist him; since which time, the office of Lord High Admiral has continued to be executed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty.\n\nPrince George of Denmark, when Lord High Admiral, having surrendered, by a formal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a>, all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a>, profits, perquisites, and advantages whatsoever, appertaining to the office, for the benefit and use of the public, with the exception of the sum of L. 2500 a-year, to be disposed of in such manner, and for such particular uses, as her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJESTY\">Majesty</a>, under her sign <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANUAL\">manual</a>, should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a>; the salary of the Lord High-Admiral, which had hitherto been no more than 300 marks, was now fixed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARRANT\">warrant</a> under privy-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEAL\">seal</a>, at L. 7000 a-year; which sum, by 1st George II. was divided equally among seven commissioners, and continued to be so down to the present time, the part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSIONER\">commissioner</a> who stood first in the patent having, however, been made up, from other funds, to L. 3000 a-year, and, in the year 1806, further increased by Lord Howick, then first lord-commissioner, to L. 5000 a-year. Since the surrender above mentioned, all the *droits de Admiralty*, as they are called, with all the fees, emoluments, perquisites, &c. whatsoever, have been taken from the Admiral, and applied to public purposes.","sp":280,"ep":281},{"h":"ADMIRAL OF THE FLEET","t":"is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> honorary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a>, which gives <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> command, but an increase of half-pay, his being three guineas a-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, and that of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ADMIRAL\">Admiral</a> two guineas.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of preventing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> at least checking that escape, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> of a proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VARNISH\">varnish</a>, was yet unknown. The prospect was so discouraging, that our experimenters had recourse to another scheme, more analogous to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a>, and it rewarded their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> efforts with the most complete success. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of November 1782, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a> Montgolfier, happening, in the course of his frequent excursions, to be then at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVIGNON\">Avignon</a>, procured a small silk bag, of the form of a parallelopipedon, open below, like a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a>'s hoop, and having a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a> of about forty-five cubic feet; under its orifice he burnt some paper, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a>, with inexpressible transport, the bag quickly swell, and mount rapidly to the height of seventy-five feet, where it remained, till by cooling it lost its buoyancy. Returning to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANNONAY\">Annonay</a>, he communicated the happy result to his brother, and it was resolved by them to prosecute the experiment on a larger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a>. Having provided a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of coarse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a>, they formed it into the shape of a globe, about thirty feet in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a>, which they lined with paper. On lighting a fire within its cavity, to warm and expand the air, they had the delightful satisfaction of seeing the bag ascend, with a force <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to 500 pounds.\n\nIt was very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a>, that the brothers should now desire an occasion, for exhibiting this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> experiment in their native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWN\">town</a>. They invited the members of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCIAL\">provincial</a> meeting of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">States</a> of the Vivarais, then assembled at Annonay, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WITNESS\">witness</a> the first public aerial ascent. On the 5th June 1783, amidst a vast concourse of spectators, the spherical bag Ascend of a Balloon, consisting of different pieces of linen, merely buttoned together, was suspended from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-POLES\">poles</a>; two men kindled a fire under it, and kept feeding the flames with small bundles of chopped straw; the loose bag gradually swelled, assuming a graceful form, and, in the space of five minutes, it was completely distended, and made such an effort to escape, that eight men were required to hold it down. On a signal being given, the stays were slipped, and the balloon instantly rose with an accelerating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, till it reached some height, when its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a> continued uniform, and carried it to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELEVATION\">elevation</a> of more than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILE\">mile</a>. All was admiration and transport. Amidst the shouts of unbounded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCLAMATION\">acclamation</a>, the progress of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> cloud retiring from sight arrested every eye. It was hurried along by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>; but, its buoyant force being soon spent, it remained suspended only ten minutes, and fell gently in a vineyard, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> of about a mile and a half from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of its ascension. So memorable a feat lighted up the glow of national vanity, and the two Montgolfiers were hailed and exalted by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPONTANEOUS\">spontaneous</a> impulse of their fellow-citizens.\n\nOf this splendid experiment, a very hasty and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> was transmitted to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, and quickly circulated over <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. In those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HALCYON\">halcyon</a> days, during the transient calm of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> turmoils, and the happy absence of all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> events, the prospect of navigating the atmosphere excited a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERMENT\">ferment</a>, and engrossed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVERSATION\">conversation</a> of all ranks. Yet the tale appeared so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a>, as to leave some doubts of its veracity. In many places, and especially in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, the more ignorant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a> of men, and those who affected superior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>, both agreed in considering the relation of Montgolfier's discovery as nothing but an imposition practised on the public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-CREDULITY\">credulity</a>. To dispel the suspicions which infected the subject, it was necessary to repeat the experiment in every large capital.\n\nWhen the intelligence of the first ascent of a balloon reached St Petersburgh, it found the venerable Euler in a state of great debility, worn out with years and unremitting intellectual toil. Having lost, in the middle of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAREER\">career</a>, the sight of an eye, he had been, for several years, visited with total <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BLINDNESS\">blindness</a>. But, in this afflicting situation, his mind was still entire, and found delightful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> in his former habits of calculation. It was in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TRAINING\">training</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> as his amanuensis, that this great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> now condescended to dictate, in the German <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, to his humble pupil, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of the highest merit.\u2014The Elements of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALGEBRA\">Algebra</a>. During his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> illness, Euler made an expiring effort, and applied his favourite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a> to determine the ascending motion of a bal-\nHe dictated the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRELIMINARY\">preliminary</a> steps of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a> to one of his grandchildren; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> was already stretched over the patriarch\u2014no farther could he proceed with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>\u2014and composing himself for nobler scenes, he calmly expected the moment of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a>.\n\nThe virtuosi at Paris were eager to repeat the experiment of the ascension of a balloon. M. Faujas de St Fond, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> and zealous naturalist, set on foot a subscription for defraying the expense, which was soon filled up. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of the machine was entrusted to the skill of two brothers of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of Robert, under the superintendence of M. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a>, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> lecturer in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\">natural <a class=\"</a>xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>. It had at first been proposed merely to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of Montgolfier, but Charles preferred the application of hydrogen gas; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> which afterwards occasioned much difficulty and delay. The balloon consisted of thin silk or tiffany, varnished with a solution of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUM\">gum</a>, disposed into a globular shape, of about thirteen feet in diameter. The hydrogen gas was procured from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DILUTE\">dilute</a> sulphuric acid upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>-filings, and was introduced through leaden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PIPES\">pipes</a>. But this gas, being rapidly formed, without having been made to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> through a body of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, entered the cavity of the balloon excessively hot, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> with acid fumes, which afterwards condensed against the inside of the bag, injuring its texture, and loading it with superfluous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HUMIDITY\">humidity</a>. Not fewer than 500 pounds of sulphuric acid were used, and twice this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of iron filings. Yet several days were spent in abortive attempts to fill the balloon completely. At last it rose, and was kept suspended at the height of 100 feet above the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>. In this state, it was conveyed with acclamations to the Place des Victoires, where it rested, and underwent some repair. About midnight, it was thence transported in silent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESSION\">procession</a>, preceded by torch lights, and guarded by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DETACHMENT\">detachment</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> and foot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a>, to the Champ de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARS\">Mars</a>, at the distance of near two miles. The few passengers found at that still <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> on the streets, gazed with astonishment at the floating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>, and the very coachmen, filled with a sort of awe, respectfully saluted it as they passed.\n\nNext <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, being the 27th of August 1783, an immense concourse of people, covered the Champ de Mars, and innumerable spectators had planted themselves along the banks of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEINE\">Seine</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMPHITHEATRE\">amphitheatre</a> of Passy. By three o'clock, every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVENUE\">avenue</a> was filled with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARRIAGES\">carriages</a>, and all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> and fashion of Paris flocked towards the Ecole Militaire. The preparations being finished, a cannon was discharged, as the signal of ascent. The balloon, liberated from its stays, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a> upwards with such rapidity, as in two minutes to reach, according to calculation, the height of 3000 feet, where it seemed lost in a dark cloud; it reappeared at a greater elevation, but was soon obscured again amidst other clouds; and after performing a flight of about fifteen miles, in the space of three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of an hour, it sunk to the ground in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a> near Ecouen, where the peasants secured it, having noticed a rent in the upper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the bag, to which its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> might be imputed. The success of the experiment was complete. The incredulous were sadly mortified; but every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINOR\">minor</a> reflection was drowned in the tumult of excessive joy and exultation.\n\nIt began to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> immediately after the balloon was launched, yet this unlucky circumstance had no effect to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABATE\">abate</a> the curiosity of the spectators. Regardless of the torrents that fell, they were wholly absorbed, in following with eager gaze the progress of the machine through the air. Even elegant ladies, dressed in their finest attire, stood exposed, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> intently the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, and were drenched to the skin. This small balloon weighed only thirty pounds, and had at first a buoyant force of forty pounds avoirdupois.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> we employ the formula before given, the terminal velocity would be $\\frac{40}{13} \\sqrt{40} = 19\\frac{6}{13}$ feet in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, or 1168 feet each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a>; which appears to correspond very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> with fact.\n\nAbout this time, Joseph Montgolfier visited Paris, and was invited by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> Academy of Sciences, to repeat his experiment of Annonay on a larger scale. He constructed, with coarse linen and a paper lining, a balloon of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PEAR\">pear</a> shape, and Paris, about forty-three feet wide and seventy-five feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a> of fifty pounds of dry straw, in small bundles, joined to that of twelve pounds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a>, was found sufficient to fill it, in the space of ten minutes. The bag duly swelled, and made an effort to rise, equivalent to the weight of 500 pounds; but being reserved for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXHIBITION\">exhibition</a> the next day, it was totally destroyed, by its exposure, during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>, to incessant and violent rain. It became necessary, therefore, to prepare another balloon, and such was the expedition of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a>, that in five days he got the whole completed. Early on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> of the 19th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEPTEMBER\">September</a>, it was placed upon an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCTAGON\">octagon</a> scaffold, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSAILLES\">Versailles</a>. It had a very showy appearance, being painted with ornaments in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> colours. By ten o'clock, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> from Paris was crowded with carriages of all descriptions. Every person of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> or fashion, hurried from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a> to view the experiment; ladies of distinguished <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> filled the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol0.html#article-WINDOWS\">windows</a>; and the spacious courts and walks, and even the tops of the houses, were covered with impatient spectators. The royal family and their attendants came forth, and examined the details of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a>. About one o'clock, the discharge of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTAR\">mortar</a> gave notice that the filling of the balloon was to commence. In eleven minutes, another discharge announced, that it was completely inflated; and on the third discharge of the mortar, the cords were cut, and the balloon instantly liberated. After balancing at first in a moment of anxious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a> to the spectators, it rose majestically, in an oblique <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>, under the impulse of the wind, till it reached the height of 1500 feet, where it appeared for a while suspended, but in the space of eight minutes it dropped to the ground, at the distance of two miles from the point of its ascent. A sheep, a cock, and a duck, which had been put into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BASKET\">basket</a>, the first animals ever carried up into the air, were found perfectly safe and unhurt by the journey, and the sheep even feeding at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> ease.\n\nThis successful experiment encouraged Montgolfier to prepare, on a more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> construction, another balloon, of a spheroidal form, 45 feet wide, and 75\nfeet high. While it was filling with smoke, Pilatre de Rozier, a young naturalist, of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a>, and full of ardour and courage, leaped into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-CAR\">car</a>, and was borne up to the height of 300 feet, where he continued some minutes suspended, the balloon being held down by long cords till it gently descended. The dangers of navigating the balloon being thus brought to a more correct estimate, it was resolved speedily to attempt the daring but sublime experiment. The badness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, however, at this late season of the year, made the project be deferred several days. At last, on the 21st of November, every thing was ready for the ascent in the spacious gardens of the chateau of Muette, belonging to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of the Dauphin. The sky had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOWERING\">lowering</a> aspect, being loaded with heavy clouds, driven about by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> winds. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ADVENTURERS\">adventurers</a> were not to be easily discouraged.\n\nAfter a first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>, which had nearly proved fatal to them, the balloon was again filled; and Rozier, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARQUIS\">Marquis</a> d'Arlandes, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJOR\">major</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANTRY\">infantry</a>, who had volunteered to accompany him, took their seats in the car, having a store of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALLAST\">ballast</a>, and a provision of straw to supply the fire. About two o'clock, the machine was launched, and it mounted with a steady and majestic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PACE\">pace</a>. Wonder, mingled with anxiety, was depicted in every countenance; but when, from their lofty station in the sky, the navigators calmly waved their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-HATS\">hats</a>, and saluted the spectators below, a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHOUT\">shout</a> of acclamation burst forth on all sides. As they rose much higher, however, they were no longer discernible by the naked eye.\n\nThis balloon soared to an elevation of more than 3000 feet, and traversed, by a circuitous and irregular course, the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of Paris, whose gay inhabitants were all absorbed in admiration and amazement.\n\nA curious circumstance occurred during the passage of the floating mass: To the gazers planted on the towers of the metropolitan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> of Notre Dame, it chanced to intercept the body of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, and thus gave them, for a few seconds, the spectacle of a total <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECLIPSE\">eclipse</a>.\u2014It has been alleged, that when the balloon had reached so high, that the objects on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> were no longer distinguishable, the Marquis d'Arlandes began to think that his curiosity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-AMBITION\">ambition</a> were sufficiently gratified. He was therefore anxious to descend, and murmured against his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a>, who still kept feeding the fire. At last, on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEARING\">hearing</a> some cracks from the top of the balloon, and observing holes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> in the sides, the Major became outrageously alarmed at his imminent danger, and applying wet sponges to stop the progress of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMBUSTION\">combustion</a>, he compelled the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a> to desist from his officious operations. As they now descended too fast, however, M. d'Arlandes was not less anxious and diligent in throwing fresh straw upon the fire, in order to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> such an elevation, as would clear the different obstacles. The navigators dexterously avoided the lofty buildings of Paris, by supplying <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a> as occasion required; and, after a journey of 20 or 25 minutes, they safely alighted beyond the Boulevards, having described a track of six miles.\n\nSuch was the prosperous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> of the first aerial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a> ever achieved by mortals. It was a conquest of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> which all the world could understand; and it flattered extremely the vanity of that ingenious people, who hailed its splendid progress, and enjoyed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIUMPH\">triumph</a>. The Montgolfiers had the annual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIZE\">prize</a> of six hundred livres adjudged to them by the Academy of Sciences; the elder brother was invited to Court, decorated with the badge of St Michael, and received a patent of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a>; and on Joseph a pension was bestowed, with the further sum of forty thousand livres, to enable him to prosecute his experiments with balloons.\n\nThe facility and success, however, of the smoke, or fire balloons, appeared to throw into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a> the attempts made by the application of hydrogen gas. M. Charles, the promoter of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>, was keenly reproached by M. Faujas de St Fond, for departing from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> practised by the original inventor; and he was moreover, with his associates the Roberts, held up to public derision in the smaller <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEATRES\">theatres</a> of Paris. To silence the cavils and insinuations of his antagonists, he resolved, therefore, on making some new efforts. A subscription was opened to defray the expense of a globe twenty-eight feet in diameter, and formed of tiffany, with elastic varnish. After repeated accidents and delays, this balloon was planted, on the 1st of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> 1783, at the entrance of the great alley of the Tuileries, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFUSE\">diffuse</a> fluid was this time introduced into it from a sort of gazometer. The dilute sulphuric acid and the iron filings being put into wooden casks, disposed round a large cistern, the gas was conveyed in long leaden pipes, and made to pass through the water under a glass <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELL\">bell</a> plunged in it. The whole apparatus cost about L. 400 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">Sterling</a>, one half of which was expended on the production of the gas alone. An immense concourse of spectators had collected from all parts. The discharge of a cannon at intervals announced the progress in filling the balloon. To amuse the populace, and quiet their impatience, M. Montgolfer was desired to let off a small fire-balloon, as a mark of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRECEDENCE\">precedence</a>. At last, the globe being sufficiently inflated, and a quantity of ballast, consisting of small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> bags, lodged in the car, leaving only 22\u00bd pounds for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of the buoyant force, MM. Charles and Robert placed themselves in the appended <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a> or car, and the machine was immediately disengaged from its stays. It mounted with a slow and solemn motion. According to the formula given, the terminal velocity cent of ascent must have been only about 400 feet each minute, or at the rate of somewhat less than five miles in the hour. \"The car, ascending amidst profound silence and admiration,\" to borrow the warm and exaggerated language of the reporter, \"allowed, in its soft and measured progress, the bystanders to follow with their eyes and their hearts two interesting men, who, like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEMI\">demi</a>-gods, soared to the abode of the immortals, to receive the reward of intelligence, and carry the imperishable name of Montgolfer. After the globe had reached the height of 2000 feet, it was no longer possible to distinguish the aerial navigators; but the coloured pennants which they waved in the air testified their safety and their tranquil feelings.\" All\nfears were now dissipated; enthusiasm succeeded to astonishment; and every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a> was given of joy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLAUSE\">applause</a>.\" The balloon, describing a tortuous course, and rising or sinking according to the fancy of its conductors, was, after a flight of an hour and three quarters, made to alight on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEADOW\">meadow</a> of Nesle, about twenty-five miles from Paris. For the space of an hour, the buoyancy of the machine had been sensibly augmented, by the sun's rays striking against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a> of the bag, and heating up the contained gas to the temperature of 55 degrees by Fahrenheit's scale.\n\nAfter this prosperous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a>, the globe, though become rather flaccid and loose by its expenditure, yet still retained a great buoyant force, when relieved from the weight of the travellers. The sun had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> set, and the night was beginning to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a>; but M. Charles formed the resolution of making alone another aerial excursion. His courage was rewarded by the spectacle of one of the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVEL\">novel</a> and enchanting appearances in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>. He shot upwards with such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CELERITY\">celerity</a>, as to reach the height of near two miles in ten minutes. The sun rose again to him in full orb; and, from his lofty station in the heavens, he contemplated the fading luminary, and watched its parting beams, till it once more sunk below the remote <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZON\">horizon</a>. The vapours rising from the ground collected into clouds, and covered the earth from his sight. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">moon</a> began to shine, and her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> rays scattered gleams of various hues over the fantastic and changing forms of those accumulated masses. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> had all the impressive solemnity of the true sublime. No wonder, that the first mortal eye that ever contemplated such awful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a> could not refrain from shedding tears of joy and admiration. The region in which M. Charles hovered was now excessively cold; and as he opened the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VALVE\">valve</a> occasionally during his ascent, to prevent the violent distention of the balloon, the hydrogen gas, not having time to acquire the temperature of the exterior air, rushed out like misty vapour, with a whistling noise. But <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a> forbade the voyager to remain long at such an elevation, while darkness was gathering below. He therefore descended slowly to the earth, and, after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAPSE\">lapse</a> of 35 minutes, alighted near the wood of Tour du Lay, having, in that short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a>, travelled about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> miles.\n\nThis balloon, with its passengers and ballast, weighed at first 680 pounds; but, notwithstanding the care taken in filling it, the hydrogen gas must have been mixed with a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> of common air, since it was only $5\\frac{1}{2}$ times lighter than this fluid. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAROMETER\">barometer</a>, which stood at 29.24 English inches at the surface of the ground, subsided to 20.05 at the greatest elevation to which M. Charles had reached. This gives, by calculation, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ALTITUDE\">altitude</a> of 9,770 feet. The thermometer, which was at 41\u00b0 by Fahrenheit's scale at the first ascent, fell to 21\u00b0 at the highest flight; giving a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> for every 488$\\frac{1}{2}$ feet of ascent.\n\nThe next voyage through the air was performed in the largest balloon ever yet constructed. The elder Montgolfier had been persuaded to open a subscription at Lyons for the sum of L. 180 Sterling, to construct an aeronautic machine, capable of upholding a great weight, and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> a horse, or other A\u00e9ronautics quadruped. It had an elongated shape, 109 feet wide, and 134 feet high, and was formed of two folds of linen, having three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAYERS\">layers</a> of paper laid between them, and quilted over with ribbands. It showed at first enormous buoyant power. A truss of straw, moistened with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of wine, was found, when set on fire, to yield humid smoke sufficient to inflate the balloon, and the burning of five pounds weight of alder faggots kept it in full action. Though loaded with a ballast of eighteen tons, it yet lifted up six persons from the ground. Unfortunately, it was very much damaged one night, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of being exposed to rain, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FROST\">frost</a>, and snow. However, on the 19th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1784, the balloon was charged in seventeen minutes, by the combustion of 550 pounds of alder. Joseph Montgolfier, accompanied by the ardent Pilatre de Rozier, and four other persons of note, with the proper ballast, took their seats in a wicker <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GALLERY\">gallery</a>, and were launched into the atmosphere. They maneuvered over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Lyons, and near the course of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHINE\">Rhine</a>, for the space of forty minutes; but a large rent having been observed in the upper part of the balloon, they were compelled to descend abruptly, though without any farther <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCIDENT\">accident</a>.\n\nThe difficulties and dangers of aerial navigation being at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> surmounted, the ascents of balloons were now multiplied in all quarters. It <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a>, therefore, be sufficient, henceforth, to notice very succinctly some of the more distinguished attempts of that kind.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEVALIER\">Chevalier</a> Paul Andreani of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILAN\">Milan</a> had a spherical balloon, of 70 feet in diameter, formed after Montgolfier's plan, at his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a>, in which, accompanied by two companions, he ascended from that capital on the 25th February, 1784. The machine rose to the height of 1300 feet; but after having described, in twenty minutes, a very circuitous track, it settled upon a large tree, from which, however, the voyagers, by applying fresh fuel, extricated themselves, and alighted on clear ground, without receiving any hurt.\n\nOn the 2d of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a>, Blanchard, who had been, for some years before, occupied with the chimerical project of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a> in the air, and who fancied that the same principles and contrivances might be applied to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> the motion of balloons, mounted alone, and with great intrepidity, at Paris, in a silk balloon, 40 feet in diameter, constructed by subscription, and filled with hydrogen gas. He darted rapidly to the height of above a mile, and after being driven about by cross winds for an hour and three quarters, he descended in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> of Billancourt.\n\nOn the 28th of June in the same year, an ascent was made at Lyons before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">King</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a>, who then travelled under the name of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> Haga, with a fire-balloon, having somewhat of a pear shape, and 75 feet in height. Two passengers, M. Fleurant and a Fleurant young lady, Madame Thibl\u00e9, the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> that ever adventured on such a daring voyage, entered the car, and ascended with great velocity. In four minutes the noise of the multitude was no longer audible, and in two more the eye could not distin-\nIt was inferred, from a trigonometrical calculation, that they reached the altitude of 13,500 feet. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAG\">flag</a>, with its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAFF\">staff</a> of 14 pounds weight, being thrown down, took <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> minutes to fall to the ground. The thermometer had dropped to 45\u00b0 on Fahrenheit's scale; and to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a> of cold which they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> was joined that of a ringing in the ears. Different currents were found to occupy distinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRATA\">strata</a> of the atmosphere; and in passing from one stratum to another, the balloon was affected by a sensible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNDULATION\">undulation</a>. The travellers continued to feed their fire with the loppings of vines, till this provision being nearly spent, they safely alighted in a corn-field, having traversed about six miles in three quarters of an hour.\n\nAbout a fortnight afterwards, the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> was gratified by a more splendid ascent, commanded for his entertainment by the French monarch. A large fire-balloon, carrying the naturalists, Rozier and Proust, was launched from the outer court of Versailles. It soared to the height of 12,520 feet, and might appear to float in a vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONGREGATION\">congregation</a> of extended and towering <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> clouds. The thermometer stood at 21\u00b0 of Fahrenheit, and the flakes of snow fell copiously on the voyagers, while it only rained below. Descending again from that chaotic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABYSS\">abyss</a>, they were charmed with the lively aspect of a rich and populous district. They alighted at the entrance of the forest of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHANTILLY\">Chantilly</a>, about thirty-six miles from Versailles, after a flight of an hour and five minutes.\n\nWe omit the relation of a prosperous ascent performed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RHODES\">Rhodes</a>, on the 6th of August, by the Abb\u00e9 Carnus and his companion, with a fire-balloon, of a globular shape, and 57 feet in diameter.\u2014The longest aerial journey yet made was accomplished at Paris, on the 19th of September. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">Duke</a> de Chartres, afterwards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORLEANS\">Orleans</a> and the noted Egalit\u00e9, employed Roberts to construct for him a silk balloon, which should be filled with hydrogen gas. It had 56 feet in height, and 36 feet diameter, being composed of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a>, terminated by two hemispheres; a construction which was rightly supposed to give much additional <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOLIDITY\">solidity</a> to the machine. A small bag, on Meusnier's plan, had been introduced within it, and the boat was, besides, furnished with a helm and four oars. This balloon, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> the Duke himself, the two artists, and another companion, and having 500 pounds of ballast, was allowed to rise very slowly, with a buoyancy of only 27 pounds. At the height of 1400 feet, the voyagers perceived, not without uneasiness, thick dark clouds gathering along the horizon, and threatening the approach of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a>-storm. They heard the distant claps, and experienced something like the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGITATION\">agitation</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHIRLWIND\">whirlwind</a>, although they had felt not the slightest concussion in the air from the discharge of cannon. The thermometer suddenly dropped from 77\u00b0 by Fahrenheit to 61\u00b0; and the influence of this cold caused the balloon to descend within 200 feet of the tops of the trees near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEAUVAIS\">Beauvais</a>. To extricate themselves, they now threw out more than forty pounds of ballast, and rose to an elevation of 6000 feet, where it was found that the confined gas had so obstinately retained its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, as to be no less than 42\u00b0 warmer than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> air.\n\nThe Duke became alarmed, and betrayed such impatience to return again to the earth, that he is said to have pierced the lower part of the silk bag in holes with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>. After narrowly escaping the dangers from wind and thunder, the balloon at last descended in safety near Bethune; having performed a course of 135 miles in the space of five <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a>.\n\nOn the 25th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a>, in the same year, the celebrated chemist, Guyton-Morveau, with the Abb\u00e9 Bertrand, ascended from Dijon in a balloon, nearly of a globular shape, twenty-nine feet in diameter, composed of the finest varnished tiffany, and filled with hydrogen gas. They did not start till five o'clock in the evening, the barometer being at 29.3 inches, and the thermometer at 57\u00b0 on Fahrenheit's scale; and, after surmounting some accidents, they rose to an altitude of 10,465 feet, or very nearly two English miles, where the barometer had sunk to 19.8 inches, and the thermometer to 25\u00b0. They felt no inconvenience however, except from the pinching of their ears with cold. They saw an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCEAN\">ocean</a> of clouds below them, and in this situation they witnessed, as the day declined, the beautiful phenomenon of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARHELION\">parhelion</a>, or mock-sun. The real luminary was only ten degrees above the horizon, when, all at once, another sun appeared to plant itself within six degrees of the former: It consisted of numerous prismatic rings, delicately tinted on a ground of dazzling whiteness. At half past six o'clock, after a voyage of an hour and a half, they safely alighted near Magny, about fifteen miles distant from Dijon.\n\nWith the same balloon, M. Guyton-Morveau made his second ascent, on the 12th of June, accompanied by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">President</a> de Virly. It was launched at seven o'clock in the morning, the barometer being then at 29.5 inches, the thermometer at 66\u00b0, and Saussure's hygrometer at 83\u00bd. It swelled very fast, however, owing to the effect of the sun's increasing heat; and the upper valve being at intervals opened, to give vent to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a> of the gas, this escaped with a noise like the rushing of water. As the voyagers did not mount to any very great elevation, they enjoyed an agreeable temperature, and could easily, by observing the situation of the different villages scattered below them, trace out their tortuous route on the surface of the map. By nine o'clock, they had reached the height of 6030 feet, the barometer now standing at 24.7 inches, the thermometer at 70\u00b0, and the hygrometer at 65\u00bd. Three quarters of an hour afterwards, they descended at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VILLAGE\">village</a> of Etavaux, only twelve miles from Dijon, having described at least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> this distance in the air. The heat had increased so much since the morning, that notwithstanding the loss of elastic fluid, the balloon seemed yet nearly inflated, on touching the ground.\n\nAn aerial voyage, most remarkable for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> and its adventures, was performed on the 18th June, 1786, from Paris, by M. Testu, with a balloon 29 feet in diameter, constructed by himself of glazed tiffany, furnished with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AUXILIARY\">auxiliary</a> wings, and filled, as usual, with hydrogen gas. It had been much injured by wind and rain during the night before its ascension; but having undergone a slight repair, it was finally launched, with its conductor, at four o'clock in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFTERNOON\">afternoon</a>. The barometer then stood at 29.68\ninches, and the thermometer as high as 84\u00b0; though the day was cloudy and threatened rain. The balloon had at first been filled only five-sixths, but it gradually swelled as it became drier and warmer, and acquired its utmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTENSION\">distension</a> at the height of 2800 feet. But to avoid the waste of gas, or the rupture of the silk, the navigator endeavoured to descend by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REACTION\">reaction</a> of his wings. This force being insufficient, however, he threw out some ballast; and, at half past five o'clock, he softly alighted on a corn-field in the plain of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTMORENCY\">Montmorency</a>. Without leaving the car, he began to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLECT\">collect</a> a few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> for ballast; when he was surrounded by the proprietor of the field and a troop of peasants, who insisted on being indemnified for the damage occasioned by his idle and curious visitors. Anxious now to disengage himself, he persuaded them, that, his wings being broken, he was wholly at their mercy; they seized the stay of the balloon, which floated at some height, and dragged their prisoner through the air in a sort of triumph towards the village. But M. Testu, finding that the loss of his wings, his cloak, and some other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a>, had considerably lightened the machine, suddenly cut the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CORD\">cord</a>, and took an abrupt leave of the clamorous and mortified peasants. He rose to the region of the clouds, where he observed small frozen particles floating in the atmosphere. He heard thunder rolling beneath his feet, and, as the coolness of the evening advanced, the buoyant force diminished, and, at three quarters after six o'clock, he approached the ground, near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABBEY\">Abbey</a> of Royaumont. There he threw out some ballast, and in the space of twelve minutes rose to a height of 2400 feet, where the thermometer was only 66 degrees. He now heard the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLAST\">blast</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORN\">horn</a>, and descried huntsmen below in full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHASE\">chase</a>. Curious to witness the sport, he pulled the valve, and descended, at eight o'clock, between Etouen and Varville, when, rejecting his ears, he set himself to gather some ballast. While he was thus occupied, the hunters galloped up to him. He mounted a third time, and passed through a dense body of clouds, in which thunder followed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a> in quick succession.\n\nWith fresh alacrity and force renew'd,\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">Springs</a> upward, like a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYRAMID\">pyramid</a> of fire,\nInto the wild expanse, and through the shock\nOf fighting elements, on all sides round\nEnvirons' wins his way.\n\nThe thermometer fell to 21\u00b0, but afterwards regained its former point of 66\u00b0, when the balloon had reached the altitude of 5000 feet. In this region, the voyager sailed till half past nine o'clock, at which time he observed from his \"watch-tower in the sky\" the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SETTING\">setting</a> of the sun. He was now quickly involved in darkness, and enveloped in the thickest mass of thunder-clouds. The lightnings flashed on all sides, and the loud claps were incessant. The thermometer, seen by the help of a phosphoric light which he struck, pointed at 21\u00b0; and snow and sleet fell copiously around him. In this most tremendous situation the intrepid adventurer remained the space of three hours, the time during which the storm lasted. The balloon was affected by a sort of undulating motion upwards and downwards, owing, he thought, to the electrical action of the clouds. The lightning appeared excessively vivid, but the thunder was sharp and loud, preceded by a sort of crackling noise. A calm at last succeeding, he had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> to see the stars, and embraced this opportunity to take some necessary refreshment. At half past two o'clock, the day broke in; but his ballast being nearly gone, and the balloon again dry and much elevated, he resolved to descend to the earth, and ascertain to what point he had been carried. At a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> before four o'clock, having already seen the sun rise, he safely alighted near the village of Campremi, about 63 miles from Paris.\n\nAt this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, ascents with balloons had been Balloons in multiplied, not only through France, but all over England. Europe. They were very seldom, however, directed to any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> than amusement, and had soon degenerated into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> exhibitions for gain. The first balloon seen in England, was constructed by an ingenious Italian, the Count Zambecari. It consisted of oiled silk, in a globular shape, about ten feet in diameter, and weighed only eleven pounds. It was entirely gilt, which not only gave it a beautiful appearance, but rendered it less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERMEABLE\">permeable</a> to the gas. On the 25th of November 1783, it was filled about three-fourths, and launched at one o'clock from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTILLERY\">Artillery</a> Ground, and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a> of a vast concourse of spectators. At half-past three in the afternoon, it was taken up at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PETWORTH\">Petworth</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUSSEX\">Sussex</a>, about the distance of forty-eight miles. It was not till the following year, on the 21st of September, that a countryman of his, named Lunardi, first mounted Lunardi in a balloon at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>. He afterwards repeated the experiment in different parts of England, and during the following year in Scotland. This active person took an expeditious but careless method to fill his balloon with gas. He had two large casks sunk into the ground, for their better security, in which he deposited 2000 pounds of the borings of cannon, divided by layers of straw, to present a larger surface. An equal weight of sulphuric acid, or common oil of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VITRIOL\">vitriol</a>, diluted with six times as much water, was poured upon the iron, and the hydrogen gas now formed, without being cooled or washed, was immediately introduced into the balloon. To Lunardi succeeded Blanchard, who possessed just as little Blanchard-science, but had greater pretensions, and some share of dexterity and skill. This adventurer is said to have performed not fewer than thirty-six voyages through the air, and to have acquired a large sum of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> by those bold and attractive exhibitions. His most remarkable journey was across the British Channel, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> with Dr Jeffries, an American <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>. On the 7th of January 1785, in a clear frosty day, the balloon was launched from the cliff of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOVER\">Dover</a>, and, after a perilous course of two hours and three quarters, it alighted in safety on the edge of the forest of Guernes, not far beyond <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CALAIS\">Calais</a>. By the magistrates of this town were the two aerial travellers treated with the utmost kindness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITALITY\">hospitality</a>; and their wondrous arrival was welcomed as a happy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OMEN\">omen</a>, alas! how fallacious, of the lasting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a> to subsist between rival nations, now cemented by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONCLUSION\">conclusion</a> of the famous Commercial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREATY\">Treaty</a>.\n\nThe original smoke balloon of Montgolfier ap-\npears to have gradually fallen into disrepute, and the more elegant and expensive, but far more powerful construction, which employs varnished silk to contain hydrogen gas, came to be generally preferred. With due precaution and management, the sailing through the atmosphere is perhaps scarcely more dangerous than the navigating of the ocean. Of some hundred ascents made at different times with balloons, not above two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> are recorded to have had a fatal termination. The first was rendered memorable by the shocking death of the accomplished and interesting Rozier, who perished a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARTYR\">martyr</a> to his ardent zeal for the promotion of science. Being anxious to return the visit which Blanchard and Jeffries had paid to the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a>, by crossing the channel again and descending in England; he transported his balloon, which was of a globular shape, and forty feet in diameter, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOULOGNE\">Boulogne</a>; and after various delays, occasioned chiefly by adverse winds, he mounted on the 15th June 1785, with his companion, M. Romain. From some vague idea of being better able to regulate the ascent of the balloon, he had most cautiously suspended below it a small smoke one of ten feet diameter; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a>, to which may be imputed the disastrous issue. Scarcely a quarter of an hour had elapsed, when the whole apparatus, at the height of above three thousand feet, was observed to be on fire; and its scattered fragments, with the unfortunate voyagers, were precipitated to the ground. They fell near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>-shore, about four miles from Boulogne, and were instantly killed by the tremendous shock, their bodies being found most dreadfully mangled.\u2014The next fatal accident with balloons, happened in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, several years later, when a Venetian nobleman and his lady, after having performed successfully various ascents, fell from a vast height, and perished on the spot.\n\nBalloonists have, no doubt, been often exposed, in their aerial excursions, to the most imminent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAZARD\">hazard</a> of their lives. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> danger consists in the difficulty of preventing sometimes a rapid and premature descent. To <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a>, in some degree, against the risks arising from the occurrence of such accidents, the Parachute was afterwards introduced; being intended to enable the voyager, in cases of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALARM\">alarm</a>, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a> his balloon in mid-air, and drop, without sustaining injury, to the ground. The French language, though not very copious, has yet supplied this convenient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a>, signifying a guard for falling, as it has likewise furnished the words of analogous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>, parapluie, paravent, and parasol, to denote an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UMBRELLA\">umbrella</a>, a shade for the sun, and a door-screen. The parachute very much resembles the ordinary umbrella, but has a far greater extent. The umbrella itself, requiring such strength to bear it up against a moderate wind, might naturally have suggested the application of the same principle to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> the force of a fall. Nothing was required but to present a surface having <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIMENSION\">dimension</a> sufficient to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> from the air a resistance equal to the weight of descent, in moving through the fluid with a velocity not exceeding that of the shock which a person can sustain without any danger. Accordingly, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EAST\">East</a>, where the umbrella, or rather the parasol, has been, from the remotest ages, in familiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>, this implement appears to be occasionally employed by vaulters, for enabling them to jump safely from great heights. Father Louhere, in his curious account of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIAM\">Siam</a>, relates that a person famous, in that remote country, for his dexterity, was accustomed to divert exceedingly the king and the royal court, by the prodigious leaps which he took, having two umbrellas, with long slender handles, fastened to his girdle. He generally alighted on the ground, but was sometimes carried by the wind against trees or houses, and not unfrequently into the river.\u2014Not many years since, the umbrella was at least, on one occasion, employed in Europe, with similar views, but directed to a very different purpose. In the early part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAMPAIGN\">campaign</a> of 1793, the French general, Beurnonville, having been sent by the National <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVENTION\">Convention</a>, with four more commissioners, to treat with the Prince of Sax-Cobourg, was, contrary to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> or courtesy heretofore preserved in the fiercest wars that have raged among civilized nations, detained a prisoner with his companions, and sent to the fortress of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OLMUTZ\">Olmutz</a>, where he suffered a rigorous confinement. In this cruel situation, he made a desperate attempt to regain his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>. Having provided himself with an umbrella, he jumped from a window at the height of forty feet; but being a very large heavy man, this screen proved insufficient to check his precipitate descent; he struck against the opposite wall, fell into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DITCH\">ditch</a>, and broke his leg, and was carried in this condition back again to his dungeon.\n\nBlanchard was the first who constructed parachutes, and annexed them to balloons, for the object of affecting his escape in case of accident. During the excursion which he undertook from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LISLE\">Lisle</a>, about the end of August 1785, when this adventurous aeronaut traversed, without halting, a distance not less than 300 miles, he let down a dog from a vast height in the basket of a parachute, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> animal, falling gently through the air, reached the ground unhurt. Since that period, the practice and management of the parachute have been carried much farther by other aerial travellers, and particularly by M. Garnerin, who has dared repeatedly to descend from the region of the clouds with that very slender machine. This ingenious and spirited Frenchman visited London during the short peace of 1802, and made two fine ascents with his balloon, in the second of which he threw himself from an amazing elevation with a parachute. This consisted of thirty-two gores of white <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CANVASS\">canvass</a> formed into a hemispherical case of twenty-three feet diameter, at the top of which was a truck or round piece of wood ten inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, and having a hole in its centre, admitting short pieces of tape to fasten it to the several gores of the canvas. About four feet and a half below the top, a wooden hoop of eight feet in diameter was attached by a string from each seam; so that when the balloon rose, the parachute hung like a curtain from this hoop. Below it was suspended a cylindrical basket covered with canvas, about four feet high, and two and a quarter wide. In this basket, the aeronaut, dressed in a close jacket and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of trousers, placed himself, and rose majestically from an inclosure near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">North</a> Audley Street at six o'clock in the evening of the 2d of September. After ho-\nvering seven or eight minutes in the upper region of the atmosphere, he meditated a descent in his parachute. Well might he be supposed to linger there in dread suspense, and to\n\nPondering his voyage; for no narrow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>\nHe had to choose;\nHe views the breadth, and, without longer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PAUSE\">pause</a>,\nDownward into the world's first region throws\nHis light precipitant, and winds with ease,\nThrough the pure marble air, his oblique way.\n\nHe cut the cord by which his parachute was attached to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">net</a> of the balloon; it instantly expanded, and for some seconds it descended with an accelerating velocity, till it became tossed extremely, and took such wide oscillations, that the basket or car was at times thrown almost into an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> position. Borne along likewise by the influence of the wind, the parachute passed over <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>-le-bone and Somers-Town, and almost grazed the houses of St Pancras. At last it fortunately struck the ground in a neighbouring field, but so violent was the shock as to throw poor Garnier on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a>, by which accident he received some cuts, and bled considerably. He seemed to be much agitated, and trembled exceedingly at the moment he was released from the car. One of the stays of the parachute had chanced to give way, which untoward circumstance deranged the apparatus, disturbed its proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a>, and threatened the adventurer, during the whole of his descent, with immediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a>. The feeling of such extreme peril was too much for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> nature to bear.\n\nFrom the principles before explained, we may easily determine the descent of a parachute. When, with its attached load, it is abandoned in the air, it must, from the continued action of gravity, proceed at first with an accelerated motion, till its increasing velocity comes to oppose a resistance equal to the force of attraction, or to the combined weight of the whole apparatus. After this counterpoise has taken place, there existing no longer any cause of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ACCELERATION\">acceleration</a>, the parachute should descend uniformly with its acquired rapidity. This perfect equilibrium will not, however, be attained at once. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCUMULATION\">accumulation</a> of swiftness produced by the unceasing operation of gravity, is not immediately restrained by the corresponding increased resistance of the atmosphere. The motion of a parachute must hence, for some short time, be subject to a sort of interior oscillation, alternately accelerating and retarding. It first shoots beyond the terminal velocity, and then, suffering greater resistance, it relaxes, and contracts within the just limits. This unequal and undulating progress which a parachute exhibits, subsequent to the commencement of its fall, is calculated to excite disproportionate alarms of insecurity and danger.\n\nThe terminal velocity of a parachute, or the uniform velocity to which its motion tends, would, according to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a>, be equal, if its surface were flat, to the velocity that a heavy body must acquire in falling through the altitude of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> of air <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCUMBENT\">incumbent</a> on that surface, and having, under the usual circumstances, the same weight as the whole apparatus. But we have already seen, that a cylinder of air, one foot in diameter and height, weighs only, in ordinary cases, the seventeenth part of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> avoirdupois. Wherefore, if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> of the diameter of a parachute be divided by 17, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUOTIENT\">quotient</a> will give the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of pounds equivalent to the weight of an atmospheric column of one foot; and the weight of the apparatus being again divided by this quotient, the result will express the entire altitude of an equi-ponderant column. Of this altitude, the square root multiplied by 8, will denote the final velocity, or that with which the parachute must strike the ground.\n\nSuppose, for example, that the diameter of the parachute were 25 feet: Then $25 \\times 25 = 625$, and this, divided by 17, gives $36\\frac{1}{4}$. Consequently, if the parachute with its load weighed only $36\\frac{1}{4}$ pounds, the shock received at the surface of the earth would be precisely the same as that which is felt in dropping from an elevation of one foot. Had the weight of the apparatus, therefore, been four times greater, or $147\\frac{1}{4}$ pounds, the shock sustained would be the same as that from a fall of four feet; which is near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIMIT\">limit</a>, perhaps, of what a person can bear without suffering injury from the violence of concussion. The velocity of descent, on this latter supposition, would be $8\\sqrt{4}$, or sixteen feet each second.\n\nBut the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> resistance of the air is rather greater than what theory would give; and it is besides augmented by the concavity of the opposing surface, which occasions an accumulation of the fluid. Let $a$ denote the diameter of a parachute, and $f$ the total weight of the apparatus abandoned to its gravity in the atmosphere; if we take Dr Hutton's valuable experiments for the basis of the calculation, the terminal velocity of descent may be expressed in round numbers, by $\\frac{26}{a}\\sqrt{\\frac{f}{a}}$, in feet each second, and consequently the length of fall which would occasion the same shock, is $\\left(\\frac{13}{120}\\<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>)^2 f$, or very nearly $\\frac{10\\frac{1}{4}}{a^2} f$. Thus, if the parachute had thirty feet in diameter, and weighed, together with its appended load, 225 pounds; then $\\frac{26}{30} \\times \\frac{26}{30} \\times 15 = \\frac{13}{15} \\times 15 = 13$ feet, or the velocity with which it would strike the ground; and $\\left(\\frac{13}{120}\\right)^2 225 = 2\\frac{3}{8}$ feet, being the height from which a person dropping freely would receive the same shock.\n\nSince the resistance which air opposes to the passage of a body is diminished by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAREFACTION\">rarefaction</a>, it is evident, that the parachute disengaged from a balloon, in the more elevated regions of the atmosphere, will at first acquire a greater velocity than it can afterwards maintain as it approaches the ground. Resuming the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOTATION\">notation</a> employed before, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol7.html#article-DENSITY\">density</a> of the air at the surface, and at any given height being expressed by $n:m$, then the velocity of counterpoise at that elevation, would be $\\frac{26}{a}\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{n}} \\cdot f$, or it would be equal to what is accumulated in falling freely a height of $\\frac{10\\frac{1}{4}}{a^2} \\cdot \\frac{m}{n} \\cdot f$ feet.\n\nIt is the final velocity, however, that must be chiefly\nconsidered in parachutes, being what determines the shock sustained in alighting. The violence of the rushing through the air will seldom be attended with any serious inconvenience. If we suppose the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> velocity with which a parachute descends to be twelve feet each second, this will correspond to the rate of a mile in $7\\frac{1}{2}$ minutes; not more than that of a very gentle trot. We are not told from what height Garnerin dropped; but if he took four minutes in his descent, it was probably about half a mile.\n\nThe practice of a\u00e9ronautics has not realized those expectations of benefit to mankind which sanguine projectors were at first disposed to entertain. It was soon found, that a balloon, launched into the atmosphere, is abandoned, without guidance or command, to the mercy of the winds. To undertake to direct or impel the floating machine by any exertion of human strength, was evidently a chimerical attempt. All the influence which the a\u00e9ronaut really possesses, consists in a very limited power of raising or depressing it, according to circumstances. He cannot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">hope</a> to shape his course, unless by skilfully adapting his elevation to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CATCH\">catch</a> the prevailing currents.\n\nAlmost the only purpose to which balloons have hitherto been applied with success, had for its object that of military reconnaissance. In the early part of the French revolutionary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, when ingenuity and science were so eagerly called into active <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>, a balloon, prepared under the direction of the A\u00e9ros- tatic Institute in the Polytechnic School, and entrusted to the command of two or three experienced officers, was distributed to each of the republican armies. The decisive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VICTORY\">victory</a> which General Jourdan gained, in June 1794, over the Austrian forces in the plains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLEURUS\">Fleurus</a>, has been ascribed principally to the accurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> of the enemy's movements before and during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a>, communicated by telegraphical signals from a balloon which was sent up to a moderate height in the air. The a\u00e9ronauts, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of whom was the celebrated Guyton-Morveau, mounted twice in the course of that day, and continued, about four hours each time, hovering in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REAR\">rear</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> at an altitude of 1300 feet. In the second ascent, the enterprise being discovered by the enemy, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATTERY\">battery</a> was opened against them; but they soon gained an elevation above the reach of the cannon. Another balloon, constructed by the same skilful artist, M. Cont\u00e9, was attached to the army sent on the memorable expedition to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>. What service it rendered the daring invader in the wide plains and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a> deserts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>, we are not informed; but, after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITULATION\">capitulation</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CAIRO\">Cairo</a>, it was brought back, with the remains of the army, to France, and employed in the sequel, as we shall find, more innocently in philosophical research. These balloons, being calculated for duration, were of a more solid and perfect construction than usual. Originally they were filled with hydrogen gas, obtained from the decomposition of water on a large scale. For this purpose, six iron cylinders had been fixed by masonry in a simple kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FURNACE\">furnace</a>, each of their ends projecting, and covered with an iron lid. Two sets of metal tubes were also inserted, the one for conveying hot water, and the other for carrying off the gas which was formed. The cylinders being charged with iron-turnings, and brought to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>-heat, the humidity was instantly converted into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEAM\">steam</a> and decomposed, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OXYGEN\">oxygen</a> uniting with the iron, while the hydrogen gas was discharged, and made to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEPOSIT\">deposit</a> any carbonic gas that might adhere to it, by passing through a reservoir filled with caustic lye before it entered the balloon. By this method, there was procured, at a very moderate expense, and in the space of about four hours, a quantity of hydrogen gas sufficient to inflate a balloon of thirty feet in diameter.","sp":296,"ep":305},{"h":"AFRICA","t":"an estimate of the knowledge of the Arabian geographers compared with that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMY\">Ptolemy</a>.

Generally speaking, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANGE\">range</a> was wider, as it was not hemmed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> every side by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> antipathies. The Arabs had a different and more limited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPHERE\">sphere</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>; but within it, their knowledge is more copious, precise, and satisfactory. Ptolemy's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of central Africa are good; but he does not afford the means of fixing a single position; while the materials furnished by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDRISI\">Edrisi</a> have been familiarly used by the best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> geographers in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of maps of Africa. This does not, however, arise from any merit in the astronomical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">geography</a>, which, on the contrary, is extremely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFECTIVE\">defective</a>. But they investigated very diligently the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> from another, by the reports of the caravan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a>\u2014a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of intercourse which had already been established in Africa to such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, and conducted in so systematic a manner, as to afford very ample means of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a>. Edrisi's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, in this view, is particularly valuable. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJOR\">Major</a> Rennell observes, that it is surprising how nearly his distances agree with those furnished by modern observations and inquiries.\n\nThe Arabs made little progress along the western <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of Africa; nor did their knowledge on that side equal that of the ancients. But the eastern coast, to an extent beyond any supposed limits of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> discovery, was not only explored, but colonized by them. Flourishing settlements were established at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MELINDA\">Melinda</a>, Mombaza, and at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOFALA\">Sofala</a>, called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GOLDEN\">Golden</a> Sofala. Vakvak, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Ouac Ouac, forms here the indistinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIMIT\">limit</a> of knowledge. The Arabs not only had never passed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> of Good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">Hope</a>, but had not even any idea of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a>. It appears, on the contrary, from the curious map of Edrisi, published by Dr Vincent, that, like Ptolemy, he extended it to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EAST\">east</a>, till it became contemporaneous with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHINA\">China</a>. This explains his placing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a> of Vakvak in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> of China\u2014a circumstance which causes much perplexity to Hartmann.\n\nIII. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> from the tenth to the fourteenth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, may be considered as the most flourishing era of Arabian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>. From that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> downwards, geographical discovery has been exclusively the boast of Europeans. The fifteenth century was a splendid era in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARITIME\">maritime</a> enterprise. Africa was then circumnavigated, its form ascertained, and its coasts visited and colonized. But the geography of its interior, instead of advancing, became decidedly retrograde. The Portuguese, who almost wholly engrossed this department of inquiry, penetrated only at the two opposite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABYSSINIA\">Abyssinia</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONGO\">Congo</a>. By applying their observations upon these regions to almost the whole of Africa, and combining them with the often misunderstood notices of Edrisi, they formed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> materially erroneous. The Nile, instead of being traced, as in Ptolemy, to its real source, was supposed to rise in Abyssinia, and its southern and largest, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as longest branch, which descends from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">Mountains</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">Moon</a>, was thus overlooked. They did not, however, on that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a>, abridge in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> the course of that celebrated river. They had extended Abyssinia immensely, so as to make it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> the southern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONTIER\">frontier</a> of Congo and Monomotapata, while the Mountains of the Moon were fixed mid-way between the tropic of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPRICORN\">Capricorn</a> and the Cape of Good Hope. The lake Zambre (Dembca) was thus placed about 30\u00b0 (upwards of 2000 miles) south of its real position,\u2014was made the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> source of the Nile, the Congo, and the Zambezi,\u2014and was described as \"the great mother and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a> of all the African waters.\"* The Nile being thus derived from sources far beyond the equator, was considered as holding the longest course of any river in the known world. (Ramusio, I. 261.) The Niger still retained a mighty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> among the streams of this continent; but no part of it had yet been exposed to European observation. Proceeding on the principles of Leo and Edrisi, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAMBIA\">Gambia</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENEGAL\">Senegal</a> were generally believed to be the two mouths, by which, after traversing nearly the whole breadth of Africa, it fell into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCEAN\">ocean</a>. Some, following Edrisi's idea of its common source with the Nile, fixed upon the lake <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEMBEA\">Dembea</a>; the greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, with Leo, derived it from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> lake to the south of Bornou; while some \"holy men\" are said to have numbered it as one of the branches of the Gion, which took this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> after issuing out of Paradise. (Ludolfi Hist. Ethiop. Cadamosto in Ramusio.)\n\nAbout the commencement of the eighteenth century, the English and French began to form settlements on the Gambia and Senegal, and to ascend these rivers. This afforded to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> a new channel of information relative to the interior of Africa. The most noted English traveller into the interior during that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> was Francis Moore, an intelligent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, who, about 1720, spent several years on the Gambia. Fully impressed with the above-mentioned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> relative to the Niger, he pretends to find even on the Gambia, Edrisi's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> stations. Ulil is Joally, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> at the mouth of the river, which, it seems, really supplies its banks with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SALA\">Sala</a> is Barsally; Gana is Yani; and Wangara alone is higher than Europeans have yet reached. He was much disconcerted, however, by the intelligence brought <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> Stibbs, who had sailed sixty miles above Barraconda. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> reported, that the Senegal above Gallam became very small, while, as to the Gambia, twelve days above Barraconda, the natives assured him that \"fowls walked over it.\" He therefore infers, that the source of these rivers is \"nothing near so far in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> as by the geo-\n\n* See Map in Purchas's Pilgrims, IV. p. 738; also descriptions of Lopez, Merolla, &c. Ibid IV. 773, 774; II. 1021. It is remarkable that Sanson's map, 1696, is constructed nearly on the above principles.\ngraphers has been represented.\" As for the Niger, on being closely pressed, he fairly stated his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, \"that there was no Niger at all.\" This decision, however, is very ill received by Moore, who asks if it is probable that both Leo and Edrisi \"should affirm that there was so great a river as the Niger when there was no such river.\" (Moore's Travels, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, 1738, p. 298\u2014306. App. p. 6.)\n\nThe French meanwhile were more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> both in forming settlements and in making discoveries. Before 1714, they had gained such intelligence, as induced Delisle to construct his map of the world, with the Niger as a separate river from the Senegal, and flowing westwards. But it is to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> of D'Anville, read before the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences, about the year 1754, that we are to look for the first approaches to correct geography, in regard to the rivers of interior Africa. By combining the scanty notices of Ptolemy and Edrisi, with the narratives of modern travellers, he succeeded in forming an almost correct outline of African <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HYDROGRAPHY\">hydrography</a>. He showed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> into which the moderns had fallen, of conceiving the river of Abyssinia to be the Nile, and proved, both from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a> of the stream, and from ancient authority, the superior claims of the Bahr-el-Abiad. With regard to the Niger, instead of one great stream, running across Africa from east to west, and falling into the Atlantic, he recognizes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-THREE_RIVERS\">three rivers</a>, 1. The Senegal, well known, and distinct from the Niger; 2. The Niger itself; of which he says,\u2014\u201cWe are actually informed, that the river of Senegal, considered hitherto as the lower part of the Niger, and its outlet into the ocean, is different from another river that lies deeper in the interior of Africa; and it is even inferred, from the report of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NEGROES\">negroes</a>, that this river flows in a direction contrary to that of the Senegal, or from west to east.\u201d He finds no ancient authority upon which to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> this opinion, except the single testimony of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERODOTUS\">Herodotus</a>. Upon this principle, however, he constructs his map, fixing the commencement of the Niger at the Nigritis Palus of Ptolemy, and its termination at the lake of Reghebil, in Wanga.\n\n3. Another river, flowing in a contrary direction, on the opposite side of Africa, known now as the river of Bornou,\u2014the Gir of Ptolemy, and, as D'Anville erroneously supposes, the \u201cNile of the Negroes\u201d of Edrisi. He seems strongly impressed with the idea of a communication between this river and the Egyptian Nile, which, however, Browne's route has proved to be a mistake. D'Anville fails chiefly in regard to the geography of the Arabians, none of whose writings, except those of Edrisi, had been at that time translated. He unaccountably supposed that Edrisi describes two rivers under the names of the Niger, and the Nile of the Negroes; whereas, in fact, the latter is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> by which he designates the former; the word Niger nowhere occurring in his work. Hence, while D'Anville has designated one river (that of Bornou) as Edrisi's Nile of the Negroes, he has placed upon another all the countries and cities appropriated to it by that writer. Upon the whole, however, his map of central Africa is an admirable performance, and formed a new era in the geography of this continent.\n\nFrom this time, D'Anville's system, both with regard to the Nile and the Niger, was generally adopted by the higher <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a> of geographers. Differences of opinion, however, still prevailed, and, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> particularly, a stand was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> made for the system, which made the Gambia and Senegal the channels by which the Niger fell into the ocean. Kitchin, nevertheless, composed his map upon D'Anville's basis. In 1788, we find a Mr Barnes reporting to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMITTEE\">Committee</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNCIL\">Council</a> on Africa, that \u201cthe Niger rises on the eastern extremity of the mountains of Govinea, and discharges itself into a large lake, the name of which he does not recollect.\u201d He was then asked as to \u201cthe transport of European goods up the Senegal and down the Niger, or of African goods up the Niger and down the Senegal\u201d (Reports concerning the Trade to Africa, and particularly the Trade in Slaves, 1788. Part I. Slaves); and thus it appears that the real state of this question was perfectly understood by the committee. During this period, however, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APATHY\">apathy</a> prevailed respecting the exploration of interior Africa; nor were any important contributions made to it, except those afforded by the travels of Mr Bruce. In this respect the African <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">Association</a> operated a most auspicious change, not only by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> exertions, which were great, but by the enthusiasm which they kindled, and which led even private individuals to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLECT\">collect</a> and communicate information on the subject. At the time when our former article was written, the result of this new impulse had already appeared in the travels of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARK\">Park</a>, Hornemann, and Browne, of which we there gave so copious an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a>, as to render any repetition unnecessary. It only remains to take a view of the discoveries, by no means unimportant, which have been since made; after which we shall be prepared to investigate those points of African geography which still remain unsettled and obscure.\n\nIV. 1. Some interesting information has been recently laid before the public concerning that part of coeries in Africa which lies northwards from the Cape of Good Hope, beyond the country of the Hottentots and Ca\u00efres. It was first visited by two gentlemen of the names of Trutter and Sommerville, the substance of whose observations is given by Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARROW\">Barrow</a> in the Appendix to his Voyage to Cochinchina. The next visitor was Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LICHTENSTEIN\">Lichtenstein</a>, who communicated the result of his observations, first in the Weymar Ephemerides, and since more fully in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of his Travels in Africa. Lastly, Dr Campbell, a missionary traveller, who penetrated to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEETAKOO\">Leetakoo</a>, has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> given to the public a volume of travels in these regions.\n\nThe Boshuanas, Bectjuanas, or Bootchuanas, are a Boshuanas, very numerous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>, stated by Dr Lichtenstein to extend from the 25th to the 20th degree of south <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LATITUDE\">latitude</a>, or, as he elsewhere expresses it, thirty or forty journeys <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> from the river Kuruhman. In fact, however, the northern limit has never been explored. They are evidently of the same stock with the Ca\u00efres, but do not quite equal them in bodily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> and strength. On the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, they are much superior in civilization and the arts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. They reside in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> of considerable magnitude. Leetakoo, ca-\npital of the Matchappin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a>, has been most particularly described. Mr Barrow's informants reckoned the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> at from 10,000 to 15,000 souls. Lichtenstein mentions, that, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the secession of part of the tribe, it had been reduced to less than half that number, and did not exceed 5000. Mr Campbell, however, counted 1500 houses, which, at five to each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, would give 7500, besides 1000 houses situated in the outposts. This calculation seems to have been very carefully made.\n\nThe Boshuanas are governed by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a>, whose power is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a>, and not subjected to any regular limits, though it is very mildly exercised. Quarrels are commonly decided by single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBAT\">combat</a>, without his interference; but if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> is referred to him, he not only takes cognizance of it, but inflicts the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> with his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>. He commands in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, and his sons are employed in all the embassies to neighbouring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>.\n\nThe Boshuanas pay considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>; their fields are commonly fenced round; they cultivate the Caffre millet, two sorts of beans, gourds, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> melons. The labour, however, as usual among barbarous tribes, is performed by the women, who dig the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> spades; the men merely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> the flocks, hunt, and go to war. Fish, though abundant, are viewed with abhorrence as an article of food. Their clothing consists entirely of the skins of animals, carefully tanned; and the greatest part of their body is covered. Their houses are circular, formed of the trunks and branches of the Mimosa, cemented within by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> of clay and cow-dung. There is an inner apartment for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, and an outer one for slaves and domestics. Polygamy is generally practised; and it is common for the rich to have four or five wives. Mr Barrow asserts that there are no slaves; but this is expressly contradicted by Lichtenstein, who states that they are in considerable numbers, and assist the women in their labours, but are mildly treated.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> among themselves seem tranquil, mild, and courteous; but they are fond of war, which they carry on with ferocity. Their great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> is to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> the cattle of their neighbours. Mr Campbell having, with a view to religious instruction, asked, \"For what end man had been made?\" the answer was, \"For plundering expeditions.\" After having killed an enemy, they carry off a small part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>, which, at a solemn festival, they afterwards devour.\n\nThe tribe immediately south of Leetakoo, is the Wanketzens, said by Campbell to be more numerous, and to carry agriculture to higher <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a>. Lichtenstein gives rather an opposite statement. The Morolongs, the Chojas, and the Marootzees, are also numbered among the most powerful and numerous of the Boshuan tribes. The Macquanas, however, the most distant, appear to surpass all the rest. They were described to Lichtenstein as like the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> in multitude, and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> is said by Mr Campbell to be three times the size of Leetakoo. They are particularly skilled in works in iron, and in the manufacture of arms. It was through them that the inhabitants of Leetakoo had first heard of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> men;\u2014probably the Portuguese on the east coast.\n\nOn the first news of these interesting discoveries, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Caledon, then governor of the Cape of Good Hope, took <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> to extend them. With laudable zeal, he sent a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PARTY\">party</a>, consisting of Dr Cowan and Mr Denovan, and twenty other persons, to explore Africa as far as Mosambique. The first accounts from them were favourable; but a silence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> years afforded room for apprehensions, which were confirmed by the information collected by Mr Campbell at Leetakoo. After leaving that place, they had proceeded into the country of the Wanketzens, by whom they were at first well received. That people, however, whose character seems marked by ferocity and treachery, were only watching the opportunity of attack. Dr Cowan and Mr Denovan having imprudently gone to bathe, leaving part of their companions at the waggons, and another to guard the cattle, the natives took advantage of their separation; they attacked, first the party at the waggons, then those who guarded the cattle, and, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> of all, the two chiefs of the expedition. The whole perished on the spot, with the exception of one, who also was afterwards taken and put to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>.\n\nIn returning from Leetakoo, Mr Campbell crossed to the west coast, along the banks of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">Orange</a> river, a tract which had hitherto remained unexplored. He found it another Sahara, a complete desert of sand and rock. The rocks rise often in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> form resembling walls. One wall extended about thirty miles without interruption. A few kraals of Coranas are thinly scattered over this desolate region. The river seems on no occasion to overflow its banks, so as to communicate any fertility to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a> waste. The country, for an unknown extent northwards, exhibits a similar aspect.\n\n2. The recent work of Mr Salt has thrown considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> upon the geography of Eastern Africa, respecting which nothing authentic had been published for several centuries. That traveller visited the Portuguese settlements of Mosambique, Mesuril, and Sofala, which appear to have greatly declined from the importance which they once possessed. Mosambique is situate upon a small island, lying directly across the mouth of a deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a>. The situation is advantageous, and the place must have been once very strong; but the eighty pieces of cannon by which it is now defended are marked with the rust of antiquity; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GARRISON\">garrison</a> consists of a few confined felons, and invalids. The population of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWN\">town</a> of Mosambique is reckoned by Mr Salt at 2800, of whom 500 are Portuguese, 800 the descendants of Arab settlers, and Banians, and the rest Negroes. So slender and mixed a population is altogether inadequate to preserve the colony in a respectable state. The appointments of the governor and inferior officers are greatly too small, and expose them to the temptation of engaging in traffic, and other transactions ill suited to their station. Upon the whole, the state of affairs is such, that a trader at Mocha declared, that, with a hundred stout Arabian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a>, he could dispossess the Portuguese of the colony.\n\nThere is also a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>-house at Mesuril, a pleasant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VILLAGE\">village</a>, situated on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENINSULA\">peninsula</a> of Caboceiro, which lies opposite to the island of Mosam-\nbique; and supplies the town with most of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> consumed in it.\n\nSofala is described as a miserable village; but the country round is extremely fertile, and supplies exquisite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> to the inhabitants of Mosambique. Small forts are also kept up at Inhambane and Cape Corrientes, for the purpose of collecting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IVORY\">ivory</a>, which is abundantly supplied in the neighbouring forests.\n\nThe native race in the immediate neighbourhood of Mosambique is that of the Makooa, or Makoonana, already alluded to. It comprises a number of very powerful tribes, extending southwards to Melinda, and north to the mouth of the river Zambezi. They are described as an athletic race of people, very warlike, and extremely hostile to the Portuguese. They sometimes carry their incursions even into the peninsula of Caboceiro. The Portuguese maintain their ground chiefly by alliances with other native tribes who are hostile to the Makoonana.\n\nThe principal settlements of the Portuguese in the interior are on the great river Zambezi, the mouth of which is three or four days' sail from Mosambique. Sena, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of these settlements, lies about two hundred and forty-seven miles up the river, on its southern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a>. It contains about two thousand inhabitants, and is protected by a strong fort. The principal mart for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>, however, is at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANICA\">Manica</a>, about twenty days' journey south-west from Sena. About sixty leagues above Sena is Tete, which contains a depot for merchandise, and is considered the best regulated settlement on the Zambezi. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>'s journey beyond Tete is Zumbo, the remotest settlement of the Portuguese, and where it is only by the permission of the natives that they maintain a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-FACTORY\">factory</a>.\n\nThe trade of Mosambique has declined. Its exports consist of gold, ivory, and slaves. The annual number of the latter is stated at four thousand. This traffic, however, has diminished, in consequence of the British prohibition, which has shut the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARKETS\">markets</a> of the Cape of Good Hope, the Isles of France and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOURBON\">Bourbon</a>, and Batavia. Ivory and gold bear very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> prices. The former is stated at from Ls. 24 to Ls. 21, 15s. per hundred. Gold dust is at Ls. 3, 5s. the ounce avoirdupois. Provisions are in abundance, and at a moderate rate. The imports consist of what is usually required in a tropical colony; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of dress, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FURNITURE\">furniture</a>, and ornament; arms and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMMUNITION\">ammunition</a>; teas; and cloths. Four or five vessels come annually from the Portuguese settlements in Malabar; and it was thought that a small British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARGO\">cargo</a> might also be disposed of in the months of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a>, May, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a> on imports is twenty per cent. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-AD\">ad</a> valorem; with other charges, which amount to about five per cent. more.\n\nWe were informed by Mr Salt, that the present maps and descriptions of the eastern part of the continent in general are almost wholly imaginary. Thus, the great empire of Monomujii, or Nimeamay, which is made to fill nearly the whole breadth of Africa, is derived from a tribe behind Mosambique, called the Monjous. That <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a> of mountains, which makes so conspicuous a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> in our maps, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of the Spine of the World, is not believed by Mr Salt to exist. He <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> persons who came from the lake Maravi, without having encountered any mountains on their route. In general, Mr Salt observed that it was usual in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> to extend every district far beyond its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> limits. The names of small towns and villages are currently transferred to a vast extent of territory behind them. In this manner have been formed the kingdoms of Sofala, Inhambane, Mosambique, and Querimba. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADEL\">Adel</a>, which makes so conspicuous a figure in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> and geography of Africa, does not appear to have any existence. Its alleged site is occupied by the tribes of the Somauli, concerning whom Mr Salt obtained much information, and who appear to have made considerable advances in civilization. The name of Adel seems derived from the tribes of the Adiel, who inhabit, not the place assigned to that kingdom, but a more northern position on the shores of the bay of Zeila. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTIGUOUS\">Contiguous</a> to them, on the west, is the kingdom of Hurur, which seems generally associated with the Somauli in the wars carried on against Abyssinia.\n\n3. Dr Seetzen, a German physician residing at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALEXANDRIA\">Alexandria</a>, had lately an opportunity of receiving some information from two natives of the interior of Africa, who were on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PILGRIMAGE\">pilgrimage</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECCA\">Mecca</a>.* One of them, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-ABDALLAH\">Abdallah</a>, was a native of Bornou; the other, named Hassan, was from the western part of Darfoo. The former gave a very magnificent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>, probably a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> exaggerated, of his native country. The city of Bornou he represented to be of such magnitude, that \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CAIRO\">Cairo</a> was a trifle compared to it;\" and that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> was insufficient to travel from one end to the other. This great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> is probably produced by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> mode of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>, not in streets, but by single houses, with gardens, and even fields intervening. The mosques are innumerable, built of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, and mounted with towers, seven of which appear on the principal one. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a> are numerous in all the cities, particularly in Bornou. They are held in the mosques, and are supported at the expense of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SULTAN\">Sultan</a>. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> is of immense extent, and he goes every Friday in state to the principal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOSQUE\">mosque</a>, where he distributes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALMS\">alms</a> to the indigent. Within a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> of Bornou there flows a river, which Abdallah described to be as large as the Nile, and, like it, to overflow its banks. It is navigated by vessels of considerable dimensions, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> sails and oars. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> is sandy, and requires <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IRRIGATION\">irrigation</a>; but it produces in abundance <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICE\">rice</a>, and a great variety of vegetable productions. The forests are very extensive, and contain lions, orang-outangs, camelopards, and other wild animals. There are numerous negro and Abyssinian slaves, who, whenever they arrive, are converted to the Mahometan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>. This is effected by flagellation, which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> until the person cries out, \"Mahomet is the prophet of God;\" when he is immediately ranked among <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> Musulmen. Abdallah asserted also, that there were a few Christian slaves at Bornou.\n\nAlthough Abdallah shews an evident disposition\n\n* See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MALTE_BRUN\">Malte-Brun</a> Annales des Voyages, XIX. 164\u2014184. XXI. 145\u2014179.\nto exalt his native country, there seems no doubt that Bornou is the most extensive and powerful kingdom of central Africa. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BERGOO\">Bergoo</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BEGHERME\">Begherme</a>, Wangars, and Cashna, are tributaries to its Sultan. He appears however, to boast of sway over regions to which his dominion has never really extended; as Hassan mentions among his subject countries Darfoor, Senaar, and part of Barbary.\n\nFrom the native of Darfoor, some information was received concerning Bergoo, (which he called Mobba,) an extensive country between Bornou and Darfoor. It appears to be considerably inferior, both in populousness and civilization, to Bornou. The capital, Hara, or Wara, is about three times the size of Bulak, a suburb of Cairo. The houses are built of wood and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>; only some of the Darfoor merchants have them of stone. The inhabitants are chiefly Mahometan negroes. Natron and sal gem are produced in considerable quantities, and exported to Cairo. No grain is raised, except durra and millet, with each of which they make an intoxicating liquor. Three days' journey to the west of Wara, there passes a river, (doubtless the Misselad of Browne,) said to be larger than the Nile, and, like it, to overflow its banks.\n\nBegherme is an extensive country, situated to the west of Bergoo, and, till of late, governed by its own Sultan, though dependent upon that of Bornou. According to the statement of Hassan, this monarch had espoused his sister. The Sultan of Bornou, scandalized by this incestuous connexion, sent orders to renounce it, or to await his vengeance. An insulting answer being returned, the offended <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOVEREIGN\">sovereign</a> immediately ordered his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VASSAL\">vassal</a>, the Sultan of Mobba, (Bergoo,) to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">march</a> his troops into Begherme, and annex it to his territories. The enterprize succeeded; the Sultan of Begherme was taken prisoner, and his dominions annexed to those of Bergoo.\n\n4. The account of the Gold coast, published by Mr Meredith in 1812, exhibits a view of some important changes in the aspect of that part of Africa. The Fantees were known to be the principal people upon this coast; but immediately behind are the Ashantees, a more numerous and powerful nation, hitherto known only by report. It appears that they had long entertained a desire to open a communication with the coast, for which an opportunity was at last afforded. In 1806, two chiefs belonging to the kingdom of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ASSIN\">Assin</a>, a dependence upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASHANTEE\">Ashantee</a>, rebelled, and, being defeated, took refuge in the Fantee country. The Ashantee monarch pursued them; at the same time intimating, that he entertained no hostile views against the natives. The Fantees, however, joined their force to that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUGITIVE\">fugitive</a> chiefs; and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> ensued, in which they were completely routed. The Ashantees marched down in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIUMPH\">triumph</a> upon Anamaboe, where the English have one of their principal forts. In their way they destroyed the town of Cormantine, and possessed themselves of the Dutch fort there. The Anamahoes, meanwhile, used no means of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>, and suffered the Ashantee <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> to approach within three miles. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALARM\">alarm</a> being then given, all their forces were hastily collected; and the English, from the fort, witnessed, with no little anxiety, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> which followed. It quickly appeared that the Fantees were inferior, both in numbers and skill; and their army fled into the town in the utmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a>. The Ashantees followed, and pursued them to the beach, where they vainly endeavoured to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> their vessels. A dreadful slaughter ensued, in which upwards of eight thousand are supposed to have perished. The English had imagined, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> discharge of a few cannon over their heads would have intimidated and deterred the Ashantees from entering the town; but, after accomplishing its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a>, these barbarians, undismayed, and upwards of twenty thousand strong, turned their arms against the fort. The garrison did not exceed fourteen men, and was soon reduced to eight. Yet such was the good condition of the fort, and the firmness of this small body, that, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of the day, they were still able to oppose a stout resistance; and the enemy, overawed by this vigorous defence, did not renew the attack on the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, nor even oppose the entrance of a small reinforcement from Cape Coast. A negociation having been opened, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a> was soon concluded, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMICABLE\">amicable</a> visits interchanged. The Ashantees were found to be a people greatly superior to the Fantees, both in numbers and in civilization; and they seemed particularly anxious to open a commercial intercourse with the English. Want of provisions, and the inroads of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>, obliged them soon to return to their own country. They have since made several inroads, and particularly one, on a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a>, in 1811; but the Fantees, though always routed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a>, have hitherto succeeded, by their knowledge of the country, and other causes, in preventing them from forming any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> establishment.\n\n5. The fullest description which has yet appeared of the great central city of Tombuctoo and its vicinity, is that appended to Mr Grey Jackson's Account of the Empire of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOROCCO\">Morocco</a>. This narrative, perhaps too highly rated by some eminent critics, is regarded by others as utterly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FABULOUS\">fabulous</a>. The able editor of the lately published account of Park's last unfortunate expedition has wholly rejected Mr Jackson's details, upon the ground that they are solely derived from native travellers and merchants; and he broadly lays down the principle, that African <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> is not to be admitted in geographical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISQUISITION\">disquisition</a>. Were this rule admitted, all modern knowledge of central Africa, and, in particular, all the information collected by the African Association, with the single exception of Mr Park's communications, would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> to be thrown entirely aside; but we confess, that we cannot discover any good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> for such a sweeping proscription. The travelling merchants of Africa, though destitute of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>, yet visiting a variety of countries, and being frequently placed in critical exigencies, acquire a cultivation of mind superior to that possessed by the same class in Europe. The general tests of evidence are, no doubt, to be carefully applied in regard to their communications. Attention must be paid to the qualifications of the narrator, to his means of knowledge, and to his having no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> in disguising the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>. It must be very desirable also to have more than one independent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WITNESS\">witness</a> to the same fact. But, upon the whole, we scarcely recollect an instance in which the testimony\nof respectable Africans has proved materially erroneous.\n\nTombuctoo, according to the information collected by Mr Jackson, is situated on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, surrounded by sandy eminences. The houses are spacious, and built in the quadrangular form. They have no upper apartments, nor even any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol0.html#article-WINDOWS\">windows</a>, being lighted by throwing open the doors, which are wide and lofty.\u2020 The inhabitants are said to possess an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEGANCE\">elegance</a> and suavity of manners not known in the north of Africa; and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to their country is such, that they never fail to return to it as soon as circumstances permit. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-POLICE\">police</a> is excellent; it is managed by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVAN\">divan</a> of twelve Alemma, who are elected every three years, and then fall into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of the people. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOLERATION\">Toleration</a> is said to be exercised towards every class except the Jews, who are either excluded from the city, or obliged, while in it, to adopt the outward profession of Mahometanism.\n\nAmong the commodities brought to Tombuctoo, Mr Jackson mentions gold rings of Wangara\u2014the first modern notice that has occurred to us of a trade so celebrated in the time of the Arabians. Mr Jackson mentions the countries of Lamlam and Melli, not in the erroneous position of Leo, but as fixed by the Arabs; and adds, that they are reported to be inhabited by one of the lost tribes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISRAEL\">Israel</a>. This report, which certainly savours of the marvellous, derives, however, some sort of countenance from the statements of Kircher and Edrisi,\u2014purporting that a colony of Jews, which first settled on the shores of the Niger, afterwards removed to this country; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a> probably before the arms of the Saracens. (Hartmann, 37.)\n\nIn regard to the sovereignty of Tombuctoo, Mr Jackson has committed at least an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANACHRONISM\">anachronism</a>. He states, that, in 1800, it was subject to Woolo, king of Bambarra. But from Park it appears, that, in 1796 and 1805, the king of Bambarra was Mansong, and Tombuctoo independent. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a>'s journal, to be afterwards noticed, indeed mentions, that Woolo (or Wolloo) was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREDECESSOR\">predecessor</a> to Mansong, and a distinguished <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WARRIOR\">warrior</a>; so that he may at one time have held Tombuctoo in subjection; but it could not be in 1800.\n\nWe shall conclude this part of our subject with some account of the last expedition of the great explorer of the interior of Africa. After a number of delays, occasioned by ministerial changes and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OFFICIAL\">official</a> difficulties, Mr Park set sail on the 30th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1805. On the 28th March he arrived in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> of Goree, and having made the necessary preparations, and engaged a body of men from the garrison to accompany him, he set out from Kayee on the 27th April following. He was obliged to remain six days at Pisania, in order to procure some articles, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of which had not been foreseen. Proceeding thence on the 11th of May, he reached Madina, capital of the kingdom of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WOOLI\">Wooli</a>, and on the 15th was on the banks of the Gambia. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> had as yet been favourable; and no obstacle presented itself, unless from the eagerness of the natives to obtain a larger share than he could prudently give, of the valuable articles which he carried along with him. By a happy mixture, however, of firmness and moderation, he always succeeded in extricating himself from these embarrassments without coming to extremities. He left Bammakoo on the 13th of May, and for some time held a prosperous course. The men continued in good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, and two who had been affected with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DYSENTERY\">dysentery</a>, were fast recovering. But the rainy season at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> approached, and those who were on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a> speedily relapsed. In a few days twelve were on the sick <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIST\">list</a>. No sooner was the expedition perceived to be in a sickly state, than the natives conceived hopes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> it to their advantage. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">Clouds</a> of thieves hovered round, and, at every moment of distress, rushed forward to snatch whatever had been left exposed. By the 6th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> the whole party were in a state of sickness, and several affected with mental derangement. On the 27th July four men lay down, and refused to go farther. Mr Park was himself very sick and faint, and seems to have been on the point of yielding to despair, when he was cheered with the view of some distant mountains to the south-east. \"The certainty that the Niger washed the southern base of these mountains made him forget his fever; and he thought of nothing but how to climb over their blue summits.\" Three weeks more of incessant effort and distress brought him to the wished for object; for coming to the brow of a hill, he once more saw the Niger \"rolling its immense stream along the plain.\"\n\nIn this journey, Mr Park, after leaving the village of Fankia, changed his former route for one more to the north, through Konkodoo and Fooladoo, near the southern frontier of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KAARTA\">Kaarta</a>. He does not state the reason, but his editor conjectures, with great likelihood, that it was to avoid the Jallonka wilderness. This new route gave him an opportunity of observing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of washing for gold. A woman collected in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CALABASH\">calabash</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of sand and water; and having cleared it of the large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEBBLES\">pebbles</a>, agitated the whole with a rotatory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>. The baser particles being thus thrown out, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> substance remained, resembling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a>; this is called gold rust. On its being further agitated, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> specks began to appear, which were the grains of gold. In two pounds of sand, twenty-three of these particles were found. The quantity of gold rust is in general forty times that of the gold. It was stated that pieces were sometimes obtained as large as the fist. Mr Park had afterwards an opportunity of seeing the mode of smelting and forming it into rings. It was performed by the mere action of fire, without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLUX\">flux</a> or mixture whatever.\n\nThis, of course, applies only to facts which have fallen under their sphere of observation; not to opinions, (such as that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IDENTITY\">identity</a> of the Nile and the Niger,) which relate to distant objects, and would require a large mass of evidence to enable them to decide.\n\n\u2020 Captain Blankett states, on the contrary, that they are two or three stories high. Report of Committee of Council on Africa, &c. 1788.\nMr Park was particularly struck with the scenery of Dindikoo. The villages on the mountains, he says, are romantic beyond anything he ever saw. \"They are built in the most delightful glens; and while the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a> rolls in awful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a> over their heads, they can look from their tremendous precipices over all the wild and woody plain, which extends from the Falme to the Black river.\"\n\nMr Park arrived on the Niger in a situation, and with prospects, far different from those which he had fondly anticipated. Of forty-four persons whom he had brought with him from Pisania, there remained only six soldiers, and one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARPENTER\">carpenter</a>, all in the most infirm state of health, and one of them deranged. Such circumstances might well have deterred the boldest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> from plunging farther into the depths of unknown and hostile regions. But Park never seems to have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> a moment's hesitation. As soon as a canoe could be hired, he set sail for Marraboo, where he arrived on the 23rd. He then sent forward his guide Isaaco to Sego, to request of Mansong, king of Bambarra, permission to pass through his territories. Mansong immediately dispatched his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIME\">prime</a>-minister Modibinne, to ask his motives for coming into Bambarra. Park made a very judicious reply, in which he particularly set forth the advantages which Bambarra would receive from the direct importation of English goods, instead of receiving them by the circuitous route of Morocco and Tombuctoo. Mansong, whose whole conduct seems to have been liberal, soon returned an answer, in which he gave full permission to travel through his dominions in any direction, and to build boats at whatever point might be deemed most advisable.\n\nNo wish, however, being expressed for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> interview, Park immediately proceeded to Sansanding, which he fixed upon for the construction of his vessel. Here he resided for two months, and enjoyed a better opportunity than had ever before occurred, of observing the economy of an African city, and the mode of conducting trade in this part of the continent. The result exhibits a favourable view of its progress in civilization. The arrangements for the convenience of trade, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of employments, appear to be carried to greater perfection, than in any European town of the same magnitude. The market-place is a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>, and the stalls on which the different articles are exposed, are shaded by mats from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>. In general, each stall is appropriated to a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMODITY\">commodity</a>. Some contain beads; others <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIGO\">indigo</a>; others wood-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASHES\">ashes</a>; and one was observed with nothing but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTIMONY\">antimony</a> in small bits. Other articles enumerated are salt, scarlet, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOBACCO\">tobacco</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMBER\">amber</a>, silks from Morocco, sulphur, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>, and silver rings, and bracelets. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> is also given of the prices which different goods bore at this market, and it is so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVEL\">novel</a> and curious, that we shall make some extracts from it.\n\n| Value in Cowries. |\n|------------------|\n| A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSKET\">musket</a>,        | 6 to 7000 |\n| A cutlass,       | 1500 to 2000 |\n| A flint,         | 40 |\n| Gunpowder, one bottle, | 3000 |\n| Amber, No. 1 to 6, | 60 to 1000 |\n\nCoral each stone, 60\nAn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> haft, 20,000\nScarlet cloth, 10 spans, 20,000\nIf sold to the Karankeas in retail, 30,000\nLight yellow cloth, nearly the same as scarlet; blue, not so high.\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">Paper</a>, per sheet, 40","sp":315,"ep":322},{"h":"AFRICAN PRODUCE","t":"A minkalli of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> (12s. 6d. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">Sterling</a>) 3000\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IVORY\">Ivory</a>, the very largest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>, each, 10,000\nIvory, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDIUM\">medium</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIZE\">size</a>, 7000\n\u2014the smaller, 3 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> 4000\n\nMr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARK\">Park</a> here learned, that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> river called the Ba Nimma, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-KONG\">Kong</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>, falls into the lake Dibbie. It is not quite half the size of the Joliba, and receives a smaller stream, called the Ba Miniana. Jimmie is not situated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGER\">Niger</a>, but at the confluence of the Nimma and Miniana. He learned that the northern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a> of the river was occupied by the Moors at Tombuctoo only, and in other places by native tribes, called the Soorks, Mahinga, and Tuarick.\n\nIn the course of his residence here, five more of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PARTY\">party</a> died, among whom was Mr Alexander Anderson, his near relation and intimate friend, whose fate he deplores in the most pathetic terms. \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a> event,\" says he, \"which took <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> during the journey, ever threw the smallest gloom over my mind, till I laid Mr Anderson in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a>. I then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> myself as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> left a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> lonely and friendless among the wilds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>.\" He had now with him only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">Lieutenant</a> Martyn, and three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a>, of whom one was deranged; yet he writes to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Camden: \"Though all the Europeans who are with me should die, and though I were myself half dead, I would still persevere.\"\u2014\"I shall set sail to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EAST\">east</a> with the fixed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> to discover the termination of the Niger, or perish in the attempt.\" One circumstance which tended to confirm him in this enthusiastic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a>, was an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> which he had eagerly imbibed, that the Niger was the same river with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONGO\">Congo</a>, and that a few months <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> its stream would bring him to the Atlantic.\n\nPark sailed from Sansanding; and accounts of his progress were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> anxiously looked for. It was not till 1806, that some unfavourable rumours reached the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> by means of the native traders. As these gradually increased, Governor Maxwell, with a laudable anxiety, began to consider the means of inquiring into their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>; and he was fortunate enough to engage the guide Isaaco, to proceed on an expedition of inquiry. It so happened, that Isaaco, near Sansanding, met with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> named Amadi Fatouma, whom Park had taken with him as a guide down the Niger. From him he received a journal containing the particulars of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Mr Park. The correctness of this narrative, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as the fidelity of the guide, have been called in question on very plausible grounds. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> of time which has now elapsed, renders it vain to doubt that this illustrious traveller must have perished on his voyage down the Niger.\n\nV. We shall now take a view of the questions of the\nwhich yet remain to be solved in regard to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">geography</a> of this continent. These may be chiefly classed under the three following heads: 1. The course of the Niger beyond Tombuctoo, and its termination. 2. The course of the river, called by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMY\">Ptolemy</a>, the Gir. 3. The precise source of the Egyptian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NILE\">Nile</a>, and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a>, if any, with the Niger.\n\n1. The Niger, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> of Mr Park and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJOR\">Major</a> Houghton, rises at Sankari, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONTIER\">frontier</a> of Manding. Thence it is ascertained, by ocular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>, to pursue a course of about three hundred miles to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILLA\">Silla</a>. Then, by undoubted information, it flows four hundred miles farther to Houssa. Positive testimony here deserts us, unless at the single point of the ferry in Cassina; but all accounts, both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a>, seem to agree in stating, that there is a continuous river-course from thence to the eastern extremity of Wangara, being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> hundred and seventy geographical miles; which makes an entire course of sixteen hundred and seventy. (Rennell, Illustrations of Park, chap. vi.) In Wangara it forms several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>, and that country is entirely surrounded and intersected by its branches. It would appear from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDRISI\">Edrisi</a>, as if there were a communication between these waters and the lake of Kauga, undoubtedly the same described to Mr Browne under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of Fitr\u00e9.\n\nThere is thus no doubt of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> stream from the source of the Niger in Manding, to the eastern extremity of Wangara. The next question is as to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> in which it flows. This is established to be from west to east, by ocular observation, as far as Silla; by highly probable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> as far as Houssa; and Major Rennell undertakes to prove that it follows the same course as far as Wangara. He quotes the testimony of a Moorish merchant, who had visited Houssa, and told Mr Beaufoy, that persons sailed thence to Ghinny (Gana) still with the stream. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> given by Edrisi, of Wangara, and partly also of Gana, is that of a country environed, intersected, and, during the rainy season, inundated by the waters of the Niger. These waters, therefore, spread over this extensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a>, and partly formed into lakes, may, he conceives, be entirely evaporated. It is possible, however, that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> may flow still farther eastward, and be lost in the lake of Fitr\u00e9. (Illustrations of Hornemann, chap. 3.)\n\nThis opinion, at one time generally received, has of late been strongly controverted, and other conjectures of a very opposite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> brought forward. One, which seems very prevalent in Africa, is, that the Niger flows eastward, till it joins the Egyptian Nile, with which it forms one and the same river. We shall reserve, till we treat of the Nile itself, the reasons which seem to throw <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> discredit upon this opinion. But another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>, which has just attracted great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, is that so zealously adopted by Mr Park,\u2014the hypothesis that it joins the Congo, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-ZAIRE\">Zaire</a>. This opinion certainly deserves consideration, both from the great name by which it is supported, and from the influence it may have upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> enterprizes of discovery. We may premise, that Mr Park's opinion was not derived from any facts observed by himself, but was adopted from a Mr Maxwell, an African trader, who had examined the Congo, and made a chart of its lower extremity.*\n\nThe first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> on which the Congo is identified with the Niger is its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a>, which seems indeed to be stupendous. It is stated to be ten miles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> near its mouth, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOD\">flood</a> which it discharges into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> to freshen the waters for upwards of thirty miles. These facts, which had been nearly forgotten in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, were well known and repeated, even with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXAGGERATION\">exaggeration</a>, by the Portuguese, during their era of discovery. Lopez and Merolla describe it as almost thirty miles broad at its entrance, and as freshening the waters to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> sometimes of eighty miles. (Atley's Collection, III. 296.) It is farther stated by Mr Maxwell, that it swells considerably, some time after the Niger is in flood, and before any rains have fallen to the south of the equator. Hence, he infers, that its sources <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> far to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>; and this, combined with its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> magnitude, and the mystery which involves the termination of the Niger, is conceived to establish a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>, that the two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> are one and the same.\n\nTo this hypothesis it is objected by the able editor Objections of Park's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> Journal, that we should thus assign to this Hypothesis the Niger a course of upwards of 4000 miles; a highly improbable length, and which would make it by much the largest river in the known world. But this argument does not appear to us decisive, since a great river, once formed, must continue to flow till it finds a receptacle. We attach much more importance to the next observation,\u2014that the Niger could not reach the Congo but by crossing that great central <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a> of mountains, which, according to various concurrent testimonies, extends across the whole breadth of Africa.\u2020 It cannot be denied indeed, that so powerful an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a> might effect a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREACH\">breach</a> even in the most formidable mountain wall. Both the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDUS\">Indus</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GANGES\">Ganges</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> the liminary chains of Indostan in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCEAN\">ocean</a>. But the important consideration appears to us to be, that so great a chain as that which crosses Africa is always found to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> on a very elevated base. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> rivers have their rise and early course along the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>, which leaves only the mountain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARRIER\">barrier</a> to penetrate. It seems inconceivable, how the Niger, after descending for more than a thousand miles along the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NIGRITIA\">Nigritia</a>, should ever reach the elevated\n\n---\n\n* For a full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of this hypothesis, and the observations and reasonings by which it is supported, see Quarterly Review, Vol. XIII. p. 120-51.\n\n\u2020 The observations of Mr Park, corroborated by the succession of rivers from the south falling into the Joliba and Dibbie, extend it from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIERRA_LEONE\">Sierra Leone</a> to nearly opposite Tombuctoo. Thence the evidence collected by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">Association</a>, (1790, ch. 8.) carry it west as far as Cassina. Ptolemy, Leo, and Edrisi, unite in describing Wangara as barred on the south by very lofty mountains. We are thus led to that portion, the most elevated of all, which gives rise to the Nile, and extends through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABYSSINIA\">Abyssinia</a> to the Arabian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GULF\">Gulf</a>.\nplateau on which such a chain must rest. We may likewise observe, that there is a total absence of all testimony, even the faintest rumour, in favour of this hypothesis. Yet both Ptolemy and the Arabians were well acquainted with the rivers of Wangara, and the extensive knowledge possessed by the former renders his silence, of itself, nearly decisive as to this question.\n\nLet us now consider, whether this hypothesis is calculated, or is necessary, to account for the flooding of the Congo. It supposes, that the autumnal swell of this river is produced, like that of the Nile, by the rains of the northern tropic. Congo, too, being about the same distance with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a> from the region of these rains, (which are bounded on one side by the equator, on the other by the tropic) it follows, that the Niger, in Congo, ought to exhibit very nearly the same phenomena as the Nile in Egypt. The magnitude of the rise, and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, ought to be as nearly as possible the same. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> rise of the Nile is stated at thirty feet, which is also that of the Ganges, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENEGAL\">Senegal</a>, and, we believe, of all the great rivers fed by the rains of the northern tropic. The Niger-Congo, which has three-fourths of its immense course through the region of these rains, ought unquestionably to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> an equal rise. We learn, on the contrary, from Mr Maxwell himself, that it never exceeds nine feet, not a third of that which takes place in the other streams. It thus produces no remarkable effect on the aspect of the river, which in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEPTEMBER\">September</a>, when at the lowest, exhibits all the appearances of full flood. There seems no conceivable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a>, why the same cause, acting in circumstances so nearly similar, should produce an effect so greatly different.\n\nLet us now consider the period. The tropical rains commence early in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a>. On the 17th the Nile begins to rise, and by the beginning of August all Egypt is laid under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>. The Niger-Congo, indeed, would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> the length of the Nile, and, though both its portions are much more rapid, we are willing to allow it double the period. The current of the Congo exceeds six miles an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>,\u2014the usual rate, we believe, of flood current. This would carry the rise, from its source to its embouchure, in somewhat less than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>. The fact, however, is, according to Mr Maxwell's statement, that not the slightest rise takes place till the end of September, nearly four months after the northern rains have set in, at a period when these rains have entirely ceased, and when the Nile, after three months of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INUNDATION\">inundation</a>, has begun to retire. The discrepancy, therefore, is as complete with regard to the period as to the magnitude; and the Congo, instead of exhibiting, as has been imagined, phenomena which imply a connection with the Niger, presents none that do not run directly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTER\">counter</a> to such a supposition.\n\nHaving thus proved that the floods of the Congo bear no correspondence to those of any river passing through the northern tropic, it can scarcely be required, that, with such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> means, we should attempt to investigate their real causes. Were we called upon to form a conjecture, we should, with great diffidence, state the following: The perennial fulness of the Congo may easily be accounted for by supposing it to be fed from the region of perpetual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> immediately under the line. In fact, its direction from the E. N. E. would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> our views to this very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>, and particularly to the southern side of that mighty chain, which pours down the Abiad, the Misselad, and other great streams of northern Africa. This would give also a very long course to account for its magnitude. The floods and tornadoes, which, in the region above mentioned, are never wholly intermittent, experience an increase of violence, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> passes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EQUINOX\">equinox</a>, which seems sufficient to account for the slight swells which, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> and September, take place upon the Congo. Their period and magnitude do not seem to indicate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> even of the south tropical rains. The Portuguese, indeed, describe the main branch of the Congo as flowing from the south; but probably upon very imperfect information; perhaps solely from their erroneous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> relative to the position of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEMBEA\">Dembea</a>, its imagined source. D'Anville, in his map prefixed to Labat's Ethiopic Occidentale, observes, that the course of all the rivers which combine in forming the Congo or Zaire, is extremely uncertain.\n\nUpon the whole, then, when we consider that this hypothesis rests upon no evidence whatever, but is contradicted by the statements of well-informed writers; that it is inconsistent with the probable structure of the African continent, and completely so with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> phenomena of the Congo, as reported by the author of the hypothesis himself; we cannot see any ground on which it can be retained, even as a plausible conjecture, in geographical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>.\n\nAnother hypothesis, nearly similar, is advanced by M. Reichard, an eminent German geographer, who makes the Niger to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> into the sea, through a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of estuaries, not yet explored, in the Gulf of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENIN\">Benin</a>. But this, though a more plausible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a>, is wholly destitute of any positive evidence in its favour; it is equally liable with the former hypothesis to the objections arising from the direction of the great central chain of mountains; and besides, the supposition that the estuaries in question form branches of one great river, is purely conjectural.\n\nReverting then to Major Rennell's hypothesis: He supposes, that the Niger, after a long easterly course from Tombuctoo, loses itself among the lakes of Wangara. To this account of its termination it has been strongly objected, that there is no receptacle or lake in Wangara, sufficient for the vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of waters which must thus be supposed to flow into it. But that lakes do exist in that country, is made certain by the accounts of the Arabian writers; and as none of these writers, whatever M. Reichard may imagine, give any precise statements as to their magnitude, there is thus room to suppose, that some of them may be large enough to receive the waters of this mighty river. Were we therefore obliged to make a choice among these hypotheses, we should undoubtedly prefer Major Rennell's, as on the whole, the most probable. Our researches, however, have led us to form a hypothesis of our own; and we shall now proceed to explain it, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">hope</a> of at least being able to bring into view some curious facts which seem to have been overlooked in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a> of this interesting question.\nBriefly, then, our idea is this\u2014That the great river-course which stretches across Africa consists in fact of two rivers, to both of which the name of Niger has been given; that one of these flows eastward by Sego and Tombuctoo, the other westward through Wangara and Cassina; and that these two rivers, at some intermediate point, not far from the modern position of Houssa, unite in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> receptacle.\n\nThe first question, then, relates to the course of that portion of the Niger which passes through Cassina, a country whose limits include the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> so celebrated by the Arabians, under the appellation of Gana. The flourishing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> which the Arabs had founded in these regions, and the extensive trade which they carried on, gave them copious means of information. Now, these writers decidedly and repeatedly state, conformably to our hypothesis, that the great river flowing through this part of Africa, and which they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CALL\">call</a> \"the Nile of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NEGROES\">Negroes</a>,\" runs westward. Major Rennell indeed supposes, that this idea may have been formed by unduly extending some rivers to the west of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUBIA\">Nubia</a>. But we have already shewn, that Nubia was very imperfectly, and the countries to the west of it scarcely at all, known to the Arabians. Gana, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a> of their empire, the emporium of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>, itself situated on the Niger, was doubtless the central point whence their information respecting that river would be derived. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-ABULFEDA\">Abulfeda</a> uniformly calls it the Nile of Gana. It appears, therefore, very improbable that they should not have been aware how the fact stood at Gana; and we cannot see that it ought to discredit their authority, though they should make it flow in the same direction, through countries not Mahometan, and thus lying beyond their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPHERE\">sphere</a> of observation.\n\nThe only modern testimony of an eye-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WITNESS\">witness</a>, to the course of the Niger through Cassina, is that of the Shereef Imhammed, from whose information chiefly Mr Beaufoy compiled his account of Bornou and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUDAN\">Soudan</a>, published in the Proceedings of the African Association, 1790. From the circumstances there mentioned, as well as from the coincidence of his statements with the most authentic of those received from other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>, there seems every reason to consider his authority as respectable. As this person travelled in the countries south of the Niger, he must have passed it at least twice, in going and returning; and the prodigious rapidity which he ascribes to the current, would render a mistake as to its direction <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a>. His report is decided, that its course is from east to west.\n\nNiebhur, while in Egypt, collected some valuable information from the mouth of a native African, which he published in the German <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSEUM\">Museum</a>; but as that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> does not seem to have reached this country, we know it only by the extracts of Hartmann. It appears, however, that he is referred to only for the eastern part of the Niger, and that he states, as beyond all doubt, the western course of that river.\n\nTo this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of ocular and historical testimony, nothing stands opposed, except the hearsay, somewhat vague, of a Moorish merchant, who had not travelled beyond Houssa. The Niger probably flows east for some distance after passing that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a>; a circumstance which might easily give rise to the report which the merchant received.\n\nIn support, however, of his opinion, that the Niger flows eastward through Cassina to the lakes of Wau-gara, Major Rennell urges an argument which certainly calls for consideration. If this river of Cassina flows westward, there must be a common receptacle between that place and Tombuctoo; and \"we have not,\" says he, \"heard of any such.\" (Illustrations of Park, chap. 2.) It may first be observed, that the tract is so completely unknown, that a receptacle might very well be supposed to exist there without any report of it being received. But we are moreover convinced, that, by diligently comparing ancient and modern accounts, we shall arrive at almost complete evidence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a>, in this quarter, of a great lake, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INLAND\">inland</a> sea, sufficient to form such a receptacle. The subject being curious, both in itself, and as connected with the question of the Niger, our readers may not be displeased to see these testimonies collected.\n\nIt seems to be now a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> opinion among the best informed geographers of the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, that the sea of the Arabians, into which they describe the Nile of the Negroes to fall, must have been a great lake, (Hartmann, 30. Pinkerton, II. 773.) In fact, the Arabic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> rendered sea, signifies merely great water. It may therefore have been used in the latter signification, and was certainly so understood by one Arabian writer, (Scheabeddin, Notices, II.\n\n---\n\n\u2022 Edrisi, and Abulfeda, passim. Scheabeddin in Notices, Vol. II. 156.\n\n\u2020 A very recent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> has been afforded in the concurrence of his description of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASHANTEE\">Ashantee</a>, or Asente, with that contained in the valuable work of Mr Meredith.\n\n\u2021 This person's testimony would fall entirely, if it should prove true, that there is no such city as Houssa. (See Rennell on Hornemann, 185.) We must confess, however, our own opinion to be in favour of its existence, which seems supported by ocular testimony, while it is denied only by persons at a distance. But whenever Houssa is mentioned in this discussion, the site fixed by Major Rennell is meant, whether there be a city upon it or not.\n\n\u00a7 To conceal nothing, we incline to suspect that this was not the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> with Edrisi, but that, finding a great expanse of water at the extremity of African knowledge, he concluded it to be the ocean. He says, the Niger flows to the extremity of the west, p. 12. See also Dr Vincent's map. Ulil, a point situated on the opposite coast, might then be mistaken for an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> agree with Ibn-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-AL\">al</a>-Vardi, a subsequent writer, who makes it a great city on the shore of the sea (or lake). It is certain that Edrisi gives land and caravan routes from Ulil to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> cities of Africa. But, as he was not a person of very great\nThere has not hitherto, however, been any attempt made to fix the position of this lake, according to the materials furnished by the Arabians, although their information seems sufficiently clear and precise. As Edrisi has given the routes from Ulil to several of the great cities of Africa, this will furnish the means of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROXIMATION\">approximation</a> to its site. The route from Gana, westward, is given as follows:\u2014To Berissa, twelve days' journey; to Tocurur and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SALA\">Sala</a>, twelve; to Ulil, sixteen; in all, forty. Ulil is also said to be at the distance of a day's sail (or 100 miles) * from the mouth of the Nile. (Edrissi, 29-35.) The forty days from Gana, extended in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> line, would reach to the vicinity of Tombuctoo, but would fall short of the eastern point of the lake Dibbie, much more of a day's sail beyond it. But a variety of details given by the Arabian writers fix the position much farther to the east, and even somewhat short of the reported site of Houssa. Ulil is said to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of Maghara, or Mekzara, an extensive tract of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a>, south of the Niger, immediately bordering on Lamlam, and even on Gana.\u2020 Schebebeddin states the Niger to flow not to the ocean, but to the extremity of the inhabited part of Djennawa (Gana.) At this point, accordingly, Major Rennell, in his map 1790, has laid down a desert of ten journeys or more, on the authority of Imhammed. Ulil, however, is still more precisely fixed by the assigned distance (Edrissi, 40) from Audagost (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGADES\">Agades</a>) of one month, which, in the most direct line, would not reach beyond Houssa, and supposing a probable deflexion to the south, would fall several days short of it. There remains, indeed, the difficulty of the forty days from Gana, which, as already observed, would, in a direct line, reach considerably farther west. But routes along rivers are naturally winding; and the present being apparently a land route, must, in that case, have made a considerable circuit round the shores of the lake. Agades being an ascertained position,\u2021 the distance from it appears to be decisive.\n\nFrom these collected statements, we may consider it as the clear and united testimony of the Arabian writers, that, in an extensive tract of desert, immediately to the east of the modern position of Houssa, there exists a great lake, or inland sea, which receives the eastern branch of the Niger.\u00a7 We shall now advert to the modern authorities. Down to the period of the African Association, report is silent, which cannot at all be wondered at, as no traveller ever approached that part of Africa; and it was only learned by imperfect rumour that Tombuctoo was still in existence. It is remarkable, however, that, in the old maps by Purchas and Dapper, (followed in this respect by Sanson, and by Delisle in his earlier maps) there is uniformly laid down, at the very point we have traced, an immense lake, under the appellation of the Lake of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUARDA\">Guarda</a>. Upon what authority this lake is so placed, has completely eluded our research. It certainly was not that of the Arabians, whose sea was then universally understood to be the ocean. It therefore must have been originally laid down by the Portuguese, and it seems improbable that they should have done so without some kind of authority.\n\nIn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of discovery which has been roused by the Association, more distinct notices have begun to be received. Ben <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALI\">Ali</a>, from whose information partly, the report 1790 was drawn up, heard it stated at Tombuctoo, that the Niger terminated in \"a lake in the desert;\" which is elsewhere expressed by saying that it was \"lost in the sands to the south of Tombuctoo.\" (Report 1790, p. 222, and 1798, p. 143.) Major Rennell endeavours, consistently with his hypothesis as to the termination of the Niger, to apply this to Wangara; but no country on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> bears so little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> or desert; and it is far too distant to make the term \"south of Tombuctoo\" at all applicable. The report, on the contrary, agrees exactly with the Arabian notices.\n\nMr Jackson expressly states, that \"fifteen journeys to the east of Tombuctoo, (that is, three or four beyond Houssa) there is an immense lake called the '<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAHAR\">Bahar</a> Soudan, or Sea of Soudan.'\" In describing the boundaries of Tombuctoo, he again mentions it as \"a lake formed by the waters of the Nile Abeede, of which the opposite shore is not visible.\" He mentions a number of particulars respecting it; describes it as inhabited by a particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of people, to be presently noticed, who navigate it with large decked vessels, containing from 100 to 150 men, which have sometimes made their appearance at Tombuctoo.\n\n---\n\n* So understood by D'Herbelot, Biblioth\u00e8que Orientale, art. Ulil. See also Hartmann, Introd. 119.\n\u2020 Edrissi, 28, 36, 41. Ibn-al-Vardi, Notices, II. 351.\n\u2021 See the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATA\">data</a> on which Major Rennell fixes it, Afric. Assoc. 1790, p. 119, 120.\n\u00a7 The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>-pits of Ulil have been a subject of perplexity to modern geographers, as Nigritia has always been dependent for that article upon the interior of the desert. Considering that the knowledge of the Arabians expired here, it appears to us a very easy supposition, that Ulil, a great commercial city, (as it is described by Ibn-al-Vardi) might, in consequence of becoming a mart for the salt of the desert, be supposed to produce it. Cadamosto, in fact, describes a great salt trade upon this very line, from Tegazza, by Tombuctoo, towards Melli. Ramusio, I. 100. He adds, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a> was conducted on the bank of a great water, which might have been supposed the sea, had it been salt; that large boats came from certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>, &c. The period of thirty days' travelling from Tombuctoo is too great; but when we consider that the salt was carried on men's shoulders under a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> sun, they may well be supposed not to exceed half the rate of camel travelling. There seems, therefore, on the whole, a great coincidence with Edrisi.\n\n|| The barche grandi of Cadamosto? We find no mention of any other kind of vessels than canoes on any other part of the Niger.\nMr Park, during his first journey, received no accounts of any lake beyond the Dibbie. But during his last residence of two months at Sansanding, he obtained the following information: \"One month's travel south of Baedoo, through the kingdom of Gotto, will bring the traveller to the country of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>, who have their houses on the banks of the Ba Sea Feena; this water they describe as incomparably larger than the Dibbie, and that it flows sometimes one way, and sometimes another.\" (p.168).\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> \"south of Baedoo\" must either be a mistake, or understood in a very qualified <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, as the kingdom of Gotto extends eastward along the course of the Niger. Now, from Sansanding to Silla, two days; to Tombuctoo, fourteen; to the sea of Soudan, according to Jackson, fifteen; in all thirty-one: thus, we have Park's month; and the two statements coincide surprisingly.\n\nOur readers are probably startled by the expression \"country of the Christians.\" Jackson, however, makes a similar report. He says, \"On its eastern bank (of the sea of Soudan) begins the territory of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> people, denominated by the Arabs, (N'sirrath) Christians, or followers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAZARETH\">Nazareth</a>.\" He adds some peculiarities of their dress and customs, and observes, that they are neither Arabs, Moors, Negroes, Sheliuhs, nor Berebbers. Considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> is thrown upon this subject by Hornemann, who, it appears, had heard much of a white and Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> as being in the vicinity of Soudan and Tombuctoo. He ridicules the idea of their being actually Christian; and states, that though the word Nazari has properly that signification, yet the Arabs familiarly give it to all who are not Mahometans. The nation in question he describes to be a branch of the Tuarick, called Tagama, who are white, (this term is probably comparative), and Pagans. (p. 110\u201419.) Upon Hornemann's data, Major Rennell has placed the Tagama Tuarick near the very point where Jackson places his Sea of Soudan. It is thus clear that there is, in this very quarter, a nation known in Africa by the term usually appropriated to Christians, which removes every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FABULOUS\">fabulous</a> appearance from the statements of Jackson and Park, and establishes a striking coincidence between them.*\n\nNeither of these travellers mention any particular eye-witnesses; but their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> implies, that they had met with such, and both allude to the existence of this inland sea, as a fact of complete certainty and notoriety. So <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> and obvious a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> feature, which required only eyes to see it, seems to leave no room for mistake. Neither Park nor Jackson had the least idea of any coincidence between their respective statements, and still less with the Arabian writers; so that we have thus three independent testimonies from opposite quarters, meeting exactly in the same point. Nor does there, so far as we know, exist any evidence at all respectable to the contrary.\n\nApplying then the existence of this lake to the question of the course of the Niger, we may observe, that every one who describes it, seems to labour for words to express its magnitude; which is farther manifested by its having been repeatedly mistaken for the ocean. If the sail of a hundred miles to Ulil, be supposed to give the breadth, this will equal it to the Caspian; even half that space will place it on a level with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARAL\">Aral</a>. These seas, though placed in a comparatively <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a> must be less active, receive, however, some of the greatest rivers of Europe and Asia. In the present instance, the power of evaporation must be extraordinary, as every account represents the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> to be intolerable, even to those who are accustomed to the burning sands of the Sahara. (Afric. Assoc. 1790, p. 124. Cadamosto, as above.) There seems, therefore, sufficient provision made for disposing, by evaporation, of the two great rivers, which, under the common name of Niger, seem to discharge themselves into this receptacle.\u2020\n\n2. The river, to which Ptolemy has given the name of Gir, has not attracted the same attention among modern geographers, as among the ancient. Mr Pinkerton supposes it to be the Bahr Kulla of Browne, or the river, which, flowing from the westward, meets the Niger, and is lost in the same receptacle. On examining, however, the map, and descriptions of Ptolemy, we do not find that he considers these rivers as forming one line of stream, or even as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> together; but as quite distinct, both in their source and termination. This circumstance, joined to their relative position, appears to leave no room for hesitation in adopting the opinion of D'Anville and Rennell, who identify the Gir with the river of Bornou. To this, we apprehend, must now be added the Misselad, which, from its relative course, must certainly communicate with the other. Mr Beaufoy's informants, indeed, clearly identify them, by stating the river of Bornou to rise from the same source i.e. vicinity with the Egyptian Nile. Major Rennell seems to sup-\n\n* Mr Barnes, formerly quoted, states, that the Niger discharges itself into a large lake; that he has heard from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> traders, that there are white inhabitants upon the borders of this lake; and has been told by people who have seen them, that they dress in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a> of Barbary Moors, and wear turbans (which agrees with Jackson, p. 262.) but do not speak Arabic. Report of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMITTEE\">Committee</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNCIL\">Council</a>, 1788.\n\n\u2020 We have not included Ptolemy among our authorities, for reasons already stated; but it may be expected that we should prove that he advances nothing inconsistent with the above hypothesis. We observe, that the Lake of Lybia, which D'Anville and Rennell make the termination of the Niger, is not placed by Ptolemy upon the Niger at all, but upon one of its derivations or adjuncts, IV. 6. He gives nothing, therefore, which can be a termination, except the lake of Nigritia, to reach which it must flow westward. If this lake be supposed to be the Sea of Soudan, then the northern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DERIVATION\">derivation</a>, on which is placed Tuccaba (Tombuctoo?) will be the Niger known to Europeans. We repeat, that we lay very little stress upon this interpretation; but if anything can be made of Ptolemy, it seems to be this.\n\n\u2021 Generally speaking, all rivers which arise in the same chain of mountains, are considered, in Africa, as having one source.\npose that they run in different directions, and meet in the lake of Fittr\u00e9. But the informants, both of Mr Beaufoy and Dr Seetzen, state distinctly that the river of Bornou flowed from south to north; to which the former added, that it was lost in the sands of the desert of Bilma. We have here the testimony of three respectable eye-witnesses, to which nothing stands opposed. The lake Fittr\u00e9, besides, being in its permanent state only sixty or seventy miles in circumference (Hornemann), is ill fitted to be the receptacle of two such rivers. Considering then the whole as one, it will form a course from S. E. to N. W. of not much less than a thousand miles in direct distance. No portion of this mighty stream has ever been explored by any European; yet its course, and above all its termination, must be an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of great geographical curiosity. All that seems now ascertained, is, that, after traversing the empire of Bornou, it enters the vast desert of Bilma, out of which it never issues.\n\n3. With regard to the question whether the Niger and the Nile form a junction, Mr Hornemann mentions, that all the persons with whom he conversed, informed him, that the Niger flowed by Darfoo into the Nile, or Bahr-el-Abid, and was, in fact, the same river: \"he could not find a single person who said to the contrary.\" (p. 115\u201417.) Mr Jackson says still more pointedly: \"In the interior of Africa, there is but one opinion as to the Nile of Egypt and the Nile of Tombuctoo, and that opinion is, that they are one and the same river.\" He adds: \"The Africans express their astonishment whenever the Europeans dispute the connection of these two rivers.\" (p. 264.) Notwithstanding such positive assurances, it seems incontrovertibly proved by Major Rennell, that the opinion in question is totally erroneous. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERODOTUS\">Herodotus</a>, indeed, mentions it, but Ptolemy, whose information was greatly superior, clearly fixes the source of the Nile among the mountains of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">Moon</a>, in a direction nearly south from Egypt. The same information was received by Mr Browne, during his residence in Darfoo, at a few hundred miles from these sources. He learned also, that all the rivers, for a great distance southwards, flowed, not east towards the Nile, but quite in the opposite direction. What is still more important,\u2014his route intersected the only line by which there was any likelihood of the Niger joining its waters to those of the Nile. A very little way south, the country begins to rise into the great chain of the Jibbel-el-Kumri, forming a complete barrier to the passage of a river which must previously have descended to the lowest level of the plain of Soudan.\n\nBut, although this point may be considered as settled, it remains still an interesting question, whether the two rivers may not communicate, by some intermediate channel, so as to form a continued navigation from Tombuctoo to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CAIRO\">Cairo</a>. Mr Jackson positively asserts, that he knew a credible witness, who boasted of having actually performed this voyage. It is probable, that both the Misselad and the Kulla rise very near to the Nile, and afterwards communicate with the Niger; and it is possible, that at some point, particularly during the wet season, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNION\">union</a> may take place. It is possible also, and perhaps more probable, that the two streams, like the Senegal and the Niger, may be considered as one, merely from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a> very near to each other. More precise testimony is necessary, in order to determine the question.\n\nIn taking leave of these disputed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of African geography, we may observe, that the tract which extends southwards from the Mountains of the Moon, to the vicinity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> of Good Hope, forms the greatest mass of terra incognita which now exists on the surface of the globe. Reckoning from the southern frontier of Darfoo and Abyssinia, we find an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of nearly forty degrees, or two thousand four hundred miles in length, and nearly half that average breadth, which not only has not been visited by any European, but concerning which no detailed or authentic particulars have ever been received. Yet there is no reason to suppose, that it is either very thinly inhabited, or by people in the lowest stage of civilization. On the contrary, most of the limiter districts <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> with the most civilized and populous portions of this continent. On the west are the kingdoms of Loango, Congo, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGOLA\">Angola</a>; on the east are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONOMOTAPA\">Monomotapa</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ZANGUEBAR\">Zanguebar</a>, and the Somalics. Even the heights of the Jibbel-el-Kumri are found, when crossed by the Ashantee Caravan, to abound in cattle, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>, and people. The immediate vicinity of the Cape is barren and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a>; but, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> as we advance northward, an improvement takes place. The tribes of Boshuanas recently visited, and still more those lying more remote, hold a high rank among the nations of Africa. Doubtless, there are deserts here also, and particularly a very extensive one, reaching north from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">Orange</a> river. But there appears no probability that they should bear any proportion to those which exist on the northern side of the continent.\n\nVI. We shall conclude this article, with some miscellaneous details, regarding the present state and future prospects of this quarter of the globe. There is scarcely any question involved in greater uncertainty than the extent of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">Population</a>. The few estimates which have been attempted are founded chiefly on random conjecture, and exhibit an extraordinary discrepancy of results. M. Golberry, who seems to have particularly attended to this subject, hesitates not to carry the amount to one hundred and sixty millions. (Voyage en Afrique.) Mr Beaufoy seems to have entertained nearly the same idea, as he estimates the interior at a hundred millions. (African Assoc. 1790.) Mr Pinkerton, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, does not conceive that it can exceed thirty, perhaps not twenty millions. M. Malte Brun names seventy millions as the utmost conceivable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIMIT\">limit</a>. (Precis de la Geographie. II. 560).\n\nThe only principle on which any thing like an approximation can be founded seems to be this,\u2014that the state of industry and civilization throughout cultivated Africa is so nearly the same, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a> of the ascertained <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol7.html#article-DENSITY\">density</a> of any one portion may be extended to the whole. Golberry has\nformed a calculation, apparently pretty correct, by which he makes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> surface of Africa to amount to one million six hundred thousand square leagues, of twenty-five to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, which is equal to upwards of nine millions of square geographical miles. These, at a moderate European rate, would give a population of four or five hundred millions. There are many circumstances, however, which must materially reduce the African standard. The most prominent is the immense extent of its deserts. The Sahara, with all its adjuncts, equals perhaps the whole of Europe. Its Oases, even the larger ones of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEZZAN\">Fezzan</a> and Darfour, though they relieve the aspect of sterility, do not materially change its general character. The former is calculated to contain only seventy-five thousand souls, the latter two hundred thousand; which will not exceed four or five to the square <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILE\">mile</a>. Even the most fertile regions of Barbary and Nigritia are deeply indented with desert. We cannot, therefore, consider as exaggerated the estimate of Mr Pinkerton, that a full third of its extent is of this description. Of the remaining six millions, we think we may allow a third for those savage tracks, which, being devoid of cultivation, do not materially affect the general populousness of the continent. There will then remain four millions of square miles for cultivated Africa.\n\nMr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PENNY\">Penny</a>, a trader, who was intimately acquainted with every part of the African coast, being asked, in the Committee of Council (Report on Africa and the Slave Trade, 1788,) his ideas upon its populousness, answered as follows: He thought every one who had visited Africa and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a> must have been struck with the appearance of nearly an equal population on the coast of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUINEA\">Guinea</a>, and in the State of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGINIA\">Virginia</a>. Virginia contained then eight hundred thousand inhabitants, upon thirty thousand square miles, which is $26\\frac{3}{4}$ to the square mile.\n\nM. Golberry is the only African traveller who has furnished any precise data upon this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>. In the course of his work, he gives the population of a number of states upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAMBIA\">Gambia</a> and Senegal, as ascertained by the French colonial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMINISTRATION\">administration</a>; and we shall throw the results into the following table:\n\n| Districts | Vol. p. | Sq. Leagues | Inhabitants |\n|-----------|---------|-------------|------------|\n| Cayor     | II. 102 | 2000        | 180,000    |\n| Sin       | II. 109 | 140         | 60,000     |\n| Salum     | II. 112 | 1500        | 300,000    |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARRA\">Barra</a>     | II. 158 | 252         | 200,000    |\n| Bambouk   | I. 432  | 1000        | 60,000     |\n\nThis gives 163 to the square <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a>, or $26\\frac{3}{4}$ to the square mile;\u2014a result, the coincidence of which with the estimate of Mr Penny, is somewhat remarkable. Probably, therefore, we may not err very widely in fixing this as the average amount of population along the coast of Guinea, nor even in extending it to the whole of cultivated Africa. If some districts fall short of this standard, there are others of considerable extent,\u2014as Egypt, Houssa, Tombuctoo, Whydah,\u2014which must greatly exceed it. Four millions, then, of square miles, at the above rate, would give a population of a hundred and six millions; to which some addition must be made, though it would be difficult even to form a guess as to its amount, for the more desert and savage districts.\n\nThe Commerce of Africa has always presented Commerce some peculiar features. The first and most prominent is the immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a> of land conveyance. Africa is perforated by no arms of the sea; and her rivers, though large, are imperfectly navigable, and do not flow in a convenient direction. It is by land chiefly that the merchant must find his means of exchange; and his route must lie, not on smooth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a> through smiling countries, but over an immeasurable expanse of trackless desert, where whirlwinds of sand threaten to overwhelm him at every step. To <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> against these dangers, as well as to enliven the dreary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> were naturally led to form themselves into companies, which are known under the appellation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CARAVANS\">Caravans</a>. The camel, an animal which nature seems to have formed expressly for travelling through the desert, is universally employed. The rate of progress is three miles an hour, and seldom more than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> or eight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a> in the day. At each of the oases, a stay of at least two days is made, for the purpose of obtaining fresh supplies of water and provisions. The following are some of the principal routes pursued by these caravans: 1. From Mourzouk, the capital of Fezzan, to Cairo; a route of about forty days. The halting places are Siwah, Augila, and Temissa. 2. From Mourzouk to Boronou; a journey of fifty days. The track is through the deserts of Bilma and Tibesti; and the principal halts are at Temissa, Domboo, and Kanem. 3. From Mourzouk to Cashna. This occupies sixty days, through Hiatts, Ganatt, and Agades. 4. From <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEZ\">Fez</a> to Tombuctoo, a journey of fifty-four days; but as sixty-five besides are spent in rest, the whole number of days required is one hundred and twenty-nine. The stations are Akka or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TATTA\">Tatta</a>, the general rendezvous; Tegazza, and Arawan, or Arean. Another route, along the sea-coast, leads to the same point by Wedinoum, Cape <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOJADOR\">Bojador</a>, and Guatala. 5. and 6. The caravans from Sennaar and Darfour to Egypt. These do not travel so regularly as the others; and an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> of two or three years often elapses. The caravan with which Mr Browne travelled consisted of five hundred camels; but the number often reaches two thousand.\n\nWith regard to the objects of trade, and particularly of export, these have presented a remarkable similarity, in all ages, and over every part of this continent. The first, and by far the most considerable, has always unhappily been the trade in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>. Africa has in all ages been ransacked for those unfortunate beings, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEGRADATION\">degradation</a> was to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> or avarice to the lords of the other portions of the globe. Besides the European part of this atrocious traffic, (ere long, it is to be hoped, to be fully, and for ever relinquished,) there has long been a similar trade for the supply of Barbary and some countries of the East.*\n\n* The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> and actual state of the trade in slaves, for European purposes, will be given under the head Slave Trade in this Supplement.\nAfrica. times are drawn chiefly from the barbarous tribes inhabiting the central <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANGE\">range</a> of mountains. The whole number for this supply is estimated at twenty thousand. Part of these captives undergo a shameful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTILATION\">mutilation</a>, with the view of being placed in the seraglios of the East. In other respects, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOT\">lot</a> is much milder than that of their West Indian brethren. They are used as domestics, are well treated, and often raised to posts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a>.\n\nNext to the human species, the article of exchange which Africa produces most abundantly, is gold. It seems probable that its mountains contain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> of this coveted metal, more ample even than those of the new world. All the rivers which descend from the Jibbel-el-Kumri, on both sides, and throughout its whole extent, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROLL\">roll</a> down sands of gold. The great repositories are Wangara, the country near the sources of the Senegal and Niger, and that immediately behind the Gold Coast. Its abundance in the districts along the Niger is said almost to surpass <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a>. Mr Jackson states, we suspect with exaggeration, that at Tombuctoo, it is often exchanged for its weight in salt, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOBACCO\">tobacco</a>, or other valuable commodities, (p. 260.) About the beginning of the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, the value of that exported from the gold coast, is said to have amounted to between two and three hundred thousand pounds. (Wadstrom on Colonization.) We have not been able to obtain precise information respecting the present state of this trade; for the prejudices of the mercantile <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> prevent gold from being classed with other commodities in the amount of exports and imports. The slave captains in their examinations before the Committee of Council, (1788) generally state, that it was too costly to be an object of trade; that it sold at L.4. an ounce, and that they did not find it their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> to procure it, unless as a medium for the purchase of slaves. They admit, however, that the Dutch exported it; and the truth seems merely to be, that they found the other trade more profitable.\n\nIvory. Next to gold, ivory has always been the great subject of African export. Like gold, it is produced almost solely in the interior, and thence brought down to the coast. Where those vast meadows lie which feed such herds of elephants, has never been ascertained; but Europe derives from Africa its whole supply of this valuable article.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUM\">Gum</a>. Gum, particularly Gum Senegal, forms an important branch of trade. The southern parts of the desert of Sahara contain vast forests of that species of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACACIA\">acacia</a>, from which this substance exudes. In the month of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a>, a dry and piercing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> bursts the bark, and the juice flows out. The neighbouring Moorish tribes then leave their habitations, and employ themselves for six weeks in collecting it; after which they repair to the banks of the Senegal, to exchange it for European commodities. The price is first fixed by a meeting of the merchants with their kings and chiefs. This point being settled, in a few days the Moors appear in vast bands, with their wives, children, and cattle; and for some days, a tumultuous market is held. M. Golberry calculates, that two millions of pounds of gum may be drawn from this part of Africa. (Travels, chap. vi.)\n\nAmong the valuable productions of this country, we may also mention <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HIDES\">hides</a> and skins, particularly goatskins dyed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a>. These are brought by the caravans from central Africa to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOROCCO\">Morocco</a>, whence they are exported to Europe, chiefly from the port of Mogador. Africa exports likewise ornamental and dye woods, particularly red or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAM\">cam</a> wood, to a very considerable extent. Raw hides and bees wax have, within the last few years, become considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a>.\n\nThere are doubtless many other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINOR\">minor</a> and local objects; but those now enumerated may be considered as forming the basis of African export. It is remarkable that, with the exception of a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a>, the whole consists, not merely of the unmanufactured, but of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPONTANEOUS\">spontaneous</a> produce of the land. So small is the progress yet made by cultivation throughout this great continent. The imports are limited, by the limited wants of the climate and state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a> most in demand are checked cottons, light coarse cloths, red woollen caps, a few linens and silks, and a large proportion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> piece-goods. Spirits, chiefly rum, are too much in demand; guns and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a>, hardware, chiefly in the form of knives, sabres, blades; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a>, which is manufactured into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EAR\">ear</a>-rings; coral, beads, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a>-glasses, and other articles of ornament. The scarcity of salt causes a certain import from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, even of that bulky article.\n\nThe following tables are made up from information laid before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">House</a> of Commons, 13th June 1812:\n\n| ARTICLES          | 1805   | 1806   | 1807   | 1808   | 1809   | 1810   |\n|-------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Elephants' Teeth  | 10,285 | 11,331 | 10,693 | 14,314 | 16,270 | 16,488 |\n| Gum Arabic        | 3,947  | 4,190  | 4,333  | 6,203  | 3,536  | 8,420  |\n| \u2014\u2014 Senegal        | 16,223 | 17,797 | 14,455 | 12,270 | 21,550 | 46,384 |\n| Hides, raw and tanned | 1,257 | 990    | 2,472  | 2,308  | 4,143  | 12,714 |\n| Skins and Furs    | 10,838 | 8,318  | 34,124 | 36,401 | 23,800 | 76,437 |\n| Wax, Bees         | 2,009  | 3,436  | 8,297  | 13,817 | 20,436 | 12,996 |\n| Red Wood          | 51,311 | 52,160 | 27,753 | 15,908 | 47,791 | 26,058 |\n| All other articles| 10,960 | 17,926 | 19,921 | 42,055 | 47,125 | 57,790 |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OFFICIAL\">Official</a> value     | 106,845| 115,948| 122,948| 143,276| 184,651| 257,387|\n| Real Value        | 193,034| 226,396| 242,747| 374,306| 383,926| 535,577|\n\n11\n### EXPORTS\n\n| ARTICLES          | 1805   | 1806   | 1807   | 1808   | 1809   | 1810   |\n|-------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Brass and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COPPER\">Copper</a>  | 12,085 | 10,315 | 6,496  | 6,979  | 3,755  | 3,231  |\n| Cotton Manufactures| 285,408| 456,661| 303,106| 168,910| 305,652| 196,214|\n| Gunpowder         | 27,154 | 38,179 | 21,092 | 6,567  | 8,453  | 7,887  |\n| Guns              | 48,500 | 57,685 | 35,698 | 7,452  | 14,251 | 6,393  |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">Iron</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">Steel</a>    | 17,703 | 44,464 | 26,870 | 28,721 | 30,302 | 19,139 |\n| Woollens          | 78,394 | 124,510| 58,788 | 51,955 | 76,430 | 68,402 |\n| India Piece Goods | 324,087| 390,605| 175,963| 72,444 | 84,472 | 59,967 |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRANDY\">Brandy</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENEVA\">Geneva</a> | 8,490  | 38,109 | 15,853 | 5,453  | 7,499  | 1,722  |\n| Rum               | 56,181 | 43,855 | 10,636 | 12,066 | 11,663 | 7,551  |\n| All other articles| 182,573| 298,769| 143,308| 172,894| 163,522| 113,579|\n| Official value    | 990,575| 1,433,152| 797,740| 532,841| 705,979| 484,082|\n| Real value        | 1,156,985| 1,655,042| 1,022,745| 820,194| 976,872| 693,911|\n\nOn adverting to the future prospects of Africa, it is proper to say something, in the first place, as to the means of its more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> exploration. It seems, then, to be now universally admitted, that no reliance can be placed on the common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of solitary enterprise, or where the traveller has only one or two attendants. Nor is the device of assuming the character of a Mahometan likely to be repeated. Mahometanism is not a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> creed; it is a system, which regulates the whole train of thoughts and habits, and which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOULDS\">moulds</a> from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANCY\">infancy</a> even the outward aspect and deportment. It is vain to expect, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of Arabic at an European seminary, or even a few months residence in the East, could mould all the habits of an European into a shape, which would enable him to deceive the watchful eyes of Musulmen. It appears also, that, while the character of a professed Christian is sufficiently detested, that of one who assumes a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSE\">false</a> semblance of Mahometanism is viewed with a much higher degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REPROBATION\">reprobation</a>. To the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISGUISE\">disguise</a>, therefore, which Hornemann assumed, it is probable that this unfortunate traveller was partly indebted for his melancholy fate. The only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a>, then, it would appear, of penetrating into Africa, with any prospect of success, is to carry an armed force, which shall not be so large as to excite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALARM\">alarm</a>, and yet sufficient to guard against desultory or sudden attack. Such an expedition would the less tend to excite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JEALOUSY\">jealousy</a>, that Africa is habitually traversed by parties of this description for commercial purposes. Yet it is remarkable, that the two attempts which have been made upon this plan have terminated still more fatally than those in which no such precautions had been taken,\u2014we allude to the last expedition of Park, and that sent by Lord Caledon from the Cape of Good Hope. These failures, however, we regret to say, seem to have been the result of such obvious imprudence, as not to authorize any inference against the general superiority of this plan. Park, by unluckily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> his party to be destroyed by the rainy season, reduced himself to the same unprotected state with former travellers. The expedition from the Cape was too small; and yet, till they gave way to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUPINE\">supine</a> security, and sacrificed all the advantages of their strength by dividing it, no hostile attempt appears to have been made.\n\nThe editor of Park's last journal recommends an expedition on a large scale, to be composed chiefly of African soldiers enlisted at Sierra Leone; but we cannot help feeling some doubts as to the safety of an expedition, in which the majority should be Africans. And as this writer suggests the propriety of employing a traveller from the East, we would add, that his attendants should rather be Scapoys than Africans.\n\nThe plan upon which the main reliance for the civilization of this region seems at present to be placed is, that of an extensive system of colonization. It is observed by Mr Macaulay, Ex-secretary of the African <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">Institution</a>, that it is \"necessary to the rapid growth of improvement, that men should be brought together in considerable bodies; that they should be protected by just laws; and that they should enjoy the means of instruction.\" This, he conceives, can only be effected in Africa by means of a colony, of some extent, composed of natives. The difficulty of collecting a large native population is admitted, indeed, to be very great. The Africans, from many causes, and particularly from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a>, will not voluntarily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a> to such a colony. A plan had, therefore, been suggested, in reference to the co-\n\n---\n\n*These tables exhibit a curious view of the effects of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABOLITION\">abolition</a>. Almost all the articles of import have remarkably increased, and their general amount has more than doubled. The exports have necessarily suffered a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a>, which, however, has taken place almost wholly in the articles of guns, spirits, and (we know not exactly why,) of India piece-goods; while British manufactures maintain nearly their former amount.*\nAFRICAN ASSOCIATION. See Association, African, in the Encyclopedia.\n\nAFRICAN <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">COMPANY</a>. The reader will find, under the head Company, in the body of the Work, an account of the formation of this establishment, and the footing on which it at present stands. Though instituted for commercial purposes, it is now prohibited from trading in its corporate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a>; and its functions are limited to maintaining the forts on the Gold Coast; a sum for that purpose being annually allowed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">Government</a>. In the Report of the Commissioners appointed to inquire into the state of the African Settlements, in 1812, the following is stated to be the annual expense of each of these forts:\n\n| Fort          | Expense (\u00a3) |\n|---------------|-------------|\n| Appolonia     | 879         |\n| Dixcove       | 926         |\n| Succondee     | 429         |\n| Commenda      | 842         |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CAPE_COAST_CASTLE\">Cape Coast Castle</a> | 4,768    |\n| Annamaboe     | 1,885       |\n| Tantumquery   | 771         |\n| Winnebah      | 776         |\n| Accra         | 1,328       |\n| Whydah        | 587         |\n\nTotal: \u00a313,195\n\nThe whole annual expenses of the Company in Africa, for forts, salaries of officers, &c. is stated to be \u00a325,327, 18. 5\u00bdd.\n\nIt further appears from this Report, that the trade of the coast is chiefly in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of the Governors of the forts, to each of whom it affords a perquisite of from \u00a3800 to \u00a31,000 a year. Their local knowledge and influence give them an advantage, with which ships coming from a distance cannot compete. Cape Coast forms the only exception, as there are several European agents residing there. The number of forts appeared to the Committee to be much greater than is necessary for maintaining the British influence upon this coast; and in consequence, Winnebah and Whydah were abandoned, which has so far reduced the annual expense.\n\nThe Company were recently called upon to explain the reason of their sending out goods, which did not appear necessary for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of their settlements. To this they answered, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> 23 Geo. II. ch. 31, by which they were constituted, expressly authorizes them to make their African payments in goods; that the remittance of the salaries of their servants in any other form would be attended with great inconvenience, both to the Company and to individuals; and that the profit made upon these goods enables the Company, with an annual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> of \u00a323,000, to support an expenditure in Africa of \u00a325,000, and to defray the expenses of management at home.\n\nThe Company's charges at home, consist of \u00a3100 to each of the nine members of the committee; and \u00a3300 to the secretary; in all \u00a31,200. The number of persons in their employ, at Christmas 1813, consisted of 47 Governors and subordinate officers; 450 soldiers and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MENIALS\">menials</a>; and they had thirty seven Negro chiefs in their pay. (n.)\n\nAFRICAN INSTITUTION. This Institution was formed in 1807, for purposes which, to use the words of a celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LITERARY\">Literary</a> Journal, \"certainly render it one of the most interesting, and most creditable to the feelings and character of our country, that ever found support within its bounds.\" (Edinb. Review, Vol. XV. p. 485.) Its general objects, and the views which influenced its formation, are clearly stated in the following resolutions adopted, at the constituent meeting, held on the 14th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a> 1807.\n\n\"1. That this meeting is deeply impressed with a sense of the enormous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-WRONGS\">wrongs</a> which the natives of\nAfrican Institutions in promoting any of the purposes of the institution.\" (First Report, p. 4.)\n\nThe management of the affairs of this institution is vested in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">president</a>, twenty vice-presidents, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURER\">treasurer</a>, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOARD\">board</a> of thirty-six directors. These officers are chosen annually from among that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a> of the subscribers who are called governors of the institution. Those who subscribe sixty guineas at one time become <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> governors; but thirty guineas subscribed at one time, make the subscriber a governor for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>; or three guineas annually, a governor during the continuance of this annual subscription. Every subscriber of one guinea becomes an ordinary member, and continues so during the continuance of his subscription.\n\nIt is much to be regretted, that the funds of this noble institution are far too limited to enable it to pursue with vigour those great objects which it was intended to promote. Its annual income does not exceed \u00a3400; and, including donations, its whole receipts, of every kind, from its first formation to the commencement of the present year (1815), have amounted to only \u00a39350. With such scanty means, it is impossible to do much in a direct way towards the advancement of civilization. A single fact will suffice to show this. To a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> teacher lately sent to Sierra Leone, the society allows a salary of \u00a3300 a-year, and this sum, moderate as it is, exhausts three-fourths of its annual income. But though the Institution has not hitherto been enabled to commence any extended plans of civilization in Africa, it has happily been able to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-AID\">aid</a> materially in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PAVING\">paving</a> the way for such plans, by exerting its influence to effect a thorough abolition of the slave trade. This is the first great and indispensable step towards the improvement of Africa; and the vigilant attention of the society to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIMARY\">primary</a> object has been of the greatest importance, both by enforcing a rigorous execution of the abolition laws enacted in this country, and by animating and directing the public call upon other nations to follow our example.\n\nThe proceedings of the society are fully detailed in its annual Reports, which are regularly published. These Reports are written with great ability, and contain much valuable and interesting information in regard to Africa, and the means of civilizing it. It may be proper to add, that the conduct of the directors has been severely attacked, and their Reports criticised, in a pamphlet lately published by Dr Thorpe, who, for sometime, held the office of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">Chief</a> Judge in the colony of Sierra Leone. The directors have replied to his accusations with great temper, and, in so far as we can judge, with complete success, in a Special Report, read at a general meeting in April last (1815), and since published.","sp":322,"ep":335},{"h":"AGNESI","t":"an Italian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a>, who may be justly pronounced one of the greatest wonders and ornaments of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEX\">sex</a>, was born at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILAN\">Milan</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the 16th of May 1718.

At <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, she not only spoke the Latin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> with precision, but even composed and delivered an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORATION\">oration</a> in that language, intended to prove that the cultivation of letters is not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a> with the female character.

When yet very young, she had also acquired some of the languages of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EAST\">East</a>; and, in a word, her acquisitions as a linguist were such, as to procure for her the appellation of a Walking Polyglott. But her aptitude for acquiring languages, however <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a>, was by no means the only, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> the most striking feature of her intellectual character. We have seen how early she essayed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> question affecting the mental capacities of her sex, and the vigour and acuteness displayed in this aspiring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSAY\">essay</a> were, ere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, exerted with ardour and success in scientific inquiries. Having gone through the elementary branches of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a>, she proceeded with alacrity to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\"><a class=\"xref\" hr</a>ef=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>; and she seems also to have carried her researches into the obscurer regions of metaphysical speculation.\n\nAbout the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> when she reached her fifteenth year, her father formed a select <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a> of the learned of Milan, and at these meetings, which were held in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, at stated times, for several years, Agnesi maintained a succession of Theorems on various <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of speculation and philosophy. The ability which she displayed on these occasions seems to have been altogether surprising; and the effect was not the less, that her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> was agreeable, and her whole deportment gentle and prepossessing. We are indebted to the learned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">President</a> De Brosse for the following account of one of these conferences, at which he assisted during his travels in Italy, through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-INTRODUCTION\">introduction</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> Belloni. \"I had conceived,\" says he, \"when I went to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVERSATION\">conversation</a>, that it was only to talk with this young lady in the usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>, though on learned subjects; but to my surprise, Belloni addressed her in a fine Latin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARANGUE\">harangue</a>, with all the formality of an academic oration. She replied in the same language, with prompt-\n\nness and ability; and they proceeded, still in Latin, to discuss the origin of fountains, and the causes of the ebbs and flows observed in some of them. She spoke like an angel on this subject, and I never heard it treated so much to my satisfaction. We then discoursed with her concerning the manner in which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> receives impressions from outward objects, and their conveyance to the general sensorium, the brain; and afterwards upon the propagation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, and the prismatic colours. The conversation afterwards became general, every one speaking to her in the language of his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, and she answering in the same.\" (Lettres sur l'Italie, Tom. I. p. 243.) But Agnesi seems to have taken but little delight in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> which she acquired as a philosophical disputant. Her temper was retired and devout, and she appears to have acted this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> more to gratify her father than herself. About her twentieth year, she accordingly withdrew from these assemblies, and for a long period devoted the greater part of her time to mathematical studies. The Theses which she had maintained with so much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLAUSE\">applause</a> were published in a quarto <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a>, under the following title: Propositiones Philosophice quas crebris disputationibus domi habitis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CORAM\">coram</a> clarissimis viris explicabit extempore et <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">ab</a> objectis vindicabat Maria Gaetana de Agnesii Mediolanensis, Med. 1738.\n\nThe first fruit of her mathematical studies was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMENTARY\">Commentary</a> on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONIC_SECTIONS\">Conic Sections</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARQUIS\">Marquis</a> de l'<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">Hospital</a>; but this piece she would never consent to publish, though Mazzucchelli says that it was greatly praised by many who had perused the manuscript. In the course of a few years, however, she gave to the world a mathematical work, which must ever secure her a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> among the most distinguished cultivators of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>. This work, entitled Instituzioni Analitiche <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-AD\">ad</a> uso della Giovent\u00f9 Italiana, was published at Milan in 1748, in two volumes quarto. The first volume treats of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a> of finite quantities; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, of the analysis of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFINITESIMALS\">infinitesimals</a>. These two volumes contain a full and satisfactory view of this branch of mathematical science in the state at which it had then arrived; and though improvements have since that time been introduced, the treatise of Agnesi, according to a very competent authority, may still be regarded as perhaps the best introduction that is to be found to the works of Euler, and the other mathematicians of the Continent. (Edinb. Review, Vol. III. p. 408.)\u2014An English translation of this work was long ago executed by the late Professor Golson of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>, but the manuscript lay buried in obscurity for many years, and was only published in 1801, through the care and at the expense of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARON\">Baron</a> Maseres.\n\nBesides other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LITERARY\">literary</a> honours which followed the publication of the Analytical Institutions, Agnesi was, in 1750, appointed Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy in the university of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOLOGNA\">Bologna</a>.

His father, at that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTENDANT\">Intendant</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUEDOC\">Languedoc</a>, and afterwards a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNSELLOR\">Counsellor</a> of State; was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> worth and abilities. He seems to have taken the sole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of his son's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>; and having destined him for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">Bar</a>, he took uncommon pains to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> him in every branch of knowledge which could contribute to his success in that profession. His care was rewarded with the happiest success. Young D'Aguesseau gave early indications of uncommon abilities; and such was his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THIRST\">thirst</a> for knowledge, and his habits of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a>, that he soon acquired the reputation of an almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> scholar. He had a particular relish for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a>, which he used to say, \"was the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YOUTH\">youth</a>;\" but this passion was so far from withdrawing him from severer studies, that it was allied in his mind with a nearly equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a>. He studied <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a> with the zeal of an antiquary, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>; and, in order to form his taste as a pleader, he employed a whole year in repeated perusals of the most esteemed productions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> eloquence. After this thorough course of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a>, he became an advocate in 1690; and, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> of his father, who now resided in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, he was soon furnished with opportunities of distinguishing himself, and of rising to the highest honours of the profession. When little more than twenty-one years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, he was appointed one of the three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ADVOCATES\">Advocates</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a>\u2014an office which imposed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a> of assisting in those causes where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> the public were concerned. The king, (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> XIV.) in appointing him, yet untried, to this D'Aguesseau situation, acted solely upon the recommendation of the elder D'Aguesseau, \"who was incapable,\" said Louis, \"of deceiving him, even to advance his own son.\" D'Aguesseau's first appearances as an advocate-general were such as amply to fulfil the expectations of his father, and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARRANT\">warrant</a> the appointment which he had obtained from the king. Denis Talon, an old lawyer, who had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> officiated, with great reputation, in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a>, was heard to say, \"that he should have been glad to have finished his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAREER\">career</a> as that young man had begun.\"\n\nD'Aguesseau held this office for ten years; during which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> he greatly distinguished himself, both for learning in his profession, and for a superior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a> of forensic eloquence. He was, indeed, one of the first reformers of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of the French bar, which had not yet taken much polish from the national improvements in taste and literature. His diction, both in his pleadings and in his juridical compositions, was that of a mind expanded by a liberal course of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a>, and refined by a familiar acquaintance with classical models. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> which he chiefly frequented was also <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> adapted to improve his taste; for the chosen companions of his leisure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a> were Racine and Boileau; the latter of whom has frequently mentioned him with praise in his writings.\n\nIt was D'Aguesseau's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> one could rise to distinguished <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMINENCE\">eminence</a> as an orator, who did not labour to enlarge and polish his mind by the study of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, and by exercises of literature; and he accordingly employed several of those stated discourses, which the usages of France required from the advocates-general at the opening of the sessions,\nto impress this doctrine upon the minds of the younger members of the bar. Such, in particular, was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of his discourse, pronounced in 1695, *Sur l'<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNION\">Union</a> de la Philosophie et de l'Eloquence*. The same subject is treated at greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>, and in a more systematic and preceptive manner, in a treatise, written at a later period, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of *Instructions sur l'Etude et les Exercices qui peuvent preparer aux Fonctions d'Avocat du Roi*. These pieces (*\u0152uvres*, Tom. I.) are written in a clear, manly, and harmonious style, and are well worthy the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of the general scholar, for their critical strictures on those authors whom he recommends to the students of law.\n\nIn the year 1700 he was appointed *Procureur-general*\u2014an office of higher <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>, and imposing more various and extensive duties, than that of advocate-general. He filled this office for seventeen years with the most splendid reputation; adding, by his lenity in criminal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, and by his care of the public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOSPITALS\">hospitals</a>, the praise of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a> to his other claims to the admiration of his countrymen. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> philosopher of the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> probably, however, be inclined to question the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTNESS\">justness</a> of the encomiums bestowed upon his exertions during the severe scarcity of 1709; on which occasion, he appears to have instituted the most rigorous proceedings against those who were held up as enemies of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> and of mankind, under the names of forestallers and monopolists. But, in alluding to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his conduct, it may be proper to mention, that his opposition, at an after period, to the delusive projects of the famous John Law, and his elaborate treatise upon the subject of *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">Money</a>*, (*\u0152uvres*, Tom. X.) afford undeniable proofs of the soundness of his views, in regard to some of the most important principles of political economy.\n\nIt had been early predicted of D'Aguiseau, that he would one day fill the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of Chancellor; and this prediction was at length realized in 1717, upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Voisin, who then held the seals. Though he was yet little more than forty-eight years of age, his nomination to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> dignity gave general satisfaction; and was, indeed, intended as a popular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">Duke</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORLEANS\">Orleans</a>, who had lately assumed the regency. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> Valjouan, a man of abilities, but slothful and a humorist, was the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> who spoke with indifference on the occasion. \"Rather you than I, brother,\" was his only remark when the new Chancellor hastened to him to announce his appointment. In fact, D'Aguiseau was soon made to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> the storms attendant upon this lofty station; for he had not been installed above a year, when he was deprived of the seals, and exiled to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESTATE\">estate</a>. His steady opposition to the extravagant projects of Law, with which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGENT\">regent</a> and his ministers were wholly intoxicated, was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> cause of this first reverse of his fortune. In 1720, when the ruinous consequences of these schemes had filled the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> with distress and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALARM\">alarm</a>, the chancellor was recalled from banishment; and he contributed not a little, by the firmness and sagacity of his counsels, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CALM\">calm</a> the public murmurs, and repair the mischief which had been committed.\n\nLaw himself had acted as the messenger of his recall; and it is said, that D'Aguiseau's consent to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RE\">re</a>-accept the seals from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> of this adventurer, was much blamed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LITERARY\">literary</a> corps, with which he had hitherto stood in high favour, as well as by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a>. But his reputation appears to have sustained a much severer shock, when he endeavoured to prevail with the latter body, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGISTER\">register</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECLARATION\">declaration</a> of the late king in favour of the famous bull *Unigenitus*\u2014a measure which they held in great abhorrence, and which he had himself firmly opposed during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEWIS\">Lewis</a>. The regent's favourite Dubois, then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">Archbishop</a> of Cambrai, had moved his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> to insist upon this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of registration, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">hope</a> that he might thereby obtain for himself a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARDINAL\">Cardinal</a>'s hat; and it seems to have been thought, that the Chancellor had yielded his better opinion in compliance with the wishes of this worthless minion. Be this as it may, it is certain that he opposed the favourite with firmness, when he attempted, after being made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIME\">prime</a> minister, to take <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRECEDENCE\">precedence</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a>; and he was in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, in 1722, sent a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> time into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol8.html#article-EXILE\">exile</a>.\n\nHe now passed five years on his estate at Fresnes; and he always spoke with delight of this tranquil period, when he was left free from the cares of professional duty, and the distractions of public life, to cultivate his mind. The Scriptures, which he read and compared in various languages, and the laws of his own and other countries, formed the subjects of his more serious studies; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> of his time was devoted to philosophy and literature, and the improvement of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARK\">park</a>, where he was sometimes to be seen employed with a spade.\n\nFrom these noble and congenial occupations he was again recalled, by the advice of Cardinal Fleury, in 1727; but the seals were not restored to him till ten years thereafter. During the intervening period, he had endeavoured to mediate in the new disputes which had arisen between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">court</a> and the parliament; but his interference seems to have given satisfaction to neither <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PARTY\">party</a>; the one reproaching him with desertion from their cause, and the other with too great a leaning towards it. When the seals were at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> restored to him, he completely withdrew from all affairs of state, and devoted himself entirely to his duties as Chancellor, and to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-INTRODUCTION\">introduction</a> of those reforms which had long occupied his inquiries and meditations.\n\nBesides some important enactments regarding Testaments, Successions, and Donations, he introduced various regulations for improving the forms of procedure,\u2014for ascertaining the limits of Jurisdictions,\u2014and for effecting a greater uniformity in the execution of the laws throughout the several provinces. These reforms constitute a sort of epoch in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JURISPRUDENCE\">jurisprudence</a> of France, and have associated his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> with those illustrious benefactors of her Civil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CODE\">Code</a>,\u2014L'Hopital and Lamoignon. The Duke de Saint-Simon however, alleges, that the Chancellor's reforms did not go so far as they would have gone, had he had less affection for his own order. He once, says this writer, confessed to a nobleman who spoke to him upon the propriety of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> off certain lucrative abuses, that he could not bring his mind to a step which would so grievously diminish the profits of the law.\nIn 1750, when upwards of eighty-two years of age, he besought the king to accept his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESIGNATION\">resignation</a>; and he was accordingly permitted to retire, the king continuing to him the honours of his office as a special mark of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROBATION\">approbation</a>. He died in the following year; and was interred, according to his own request, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BURIAL\">burial</a>-place of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VILLAGE\">village</a> of Auteuil, where the remains of his wife, who died there in 1735, had been deposited. The name of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a>, whom he married in 1694, and by whom he had several children, was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANNE\">Anne</a> Le Fevre d'Ormesson.\n\nThis great man has not, in all respects, been equally praised by those, who have, in their writings, transmitted his character to posterity. Saint-Simon and others reproach him with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of tardiness and indecision in his judgments, which sometimes greatly obstructed the course of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>. His own answer to this charge has been recorded by Duclos, and is worthy of notice: \"When I recollect,\" said he, \"that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECREE\">decree</a> of a Chancellor is a law, I think myself warranted in taking a long time for consideration.\" Saint-Simon and D'Argenson also impute to him some defects as a statesman; but his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELEVATION\">elevation</a> of mind and extensive knowledge, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a>, probity, and disinterestedness, have been universally admitted and extolled. In his magisterial capacity, he was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a> and dignified, without any approach to haughtiness; in private society, his manners were mild, equal, and even playful. He was particularly remarkable for the tenaciousness of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>, and for the facility with which he could <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> his attention to the most diversified exercises of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTELLECT\">intellect</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>. At eighty years of age, he has been heard to repeat whole poems, which he had never perused since the days of his early youth; and when fatigued with professional duties, he could turn with equal alacrity to Euclid or to Racine. In summing up his character, all must agree with La Harpe, that he was \"a man who did <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> to France, to the magistracy, and to letters, by his virtues, his talents, his profound and various learning, and his enlightened views in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> of jurisprudence.\" (Cours de Litterature, Tom. XIV. c. 1.)\n\nHis published writings form a collection of thirteen volumes quarto; of which the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> was published at Paris in 1759, and the last in 1789. The far greater part of these volumes relate to matters connected with his professional character and studies; but they also contain a variety of pieces upon miscellaneous subjects. We have already mentioned his discourses on the studies befitting the students of law, and his treatise on Money; and besides these, and some theological pieces, there is a Life of his Father, interesting from the view which it affords of his own early education under that excellent person; together with \"Metaphysical Meditations,\" written in vindication of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, that, independently of all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVELATION\">revelation</a>, and all positive law, there is that in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> mind which renders man a law to himself.\n\nSee Histoire des Hommes Illustres de Regnes de Louis XIV. et de Louis XV. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAR\">par</a> le Duc de Saint-Simon. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> Secreces, par Duclos.

See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">Atmosphere</a>.","sp":429,"ep":460},{"h":"ALBANIA","t":"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> of considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, which, though in fact nearly independent, forms nominally one of the provinces of the Turkish empire. It extends from the thirty-ninth to the forty-third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LATITUDE\">latitude</a>, for the space of about 250 miles, along the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GULF\">Gulf</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a>. The extent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INLAND\">inland</a> nowhere exceeds one hundred miles; and is, in the southern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a>, not more than thirty. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a> of Pindus, called now the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> of Sagori, of Metzovo, and of Suli, separate it, by an ill defined line, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACEDONIA\">Macedonia</a> and Thessaly. The Turks divided it into Pashalics; of which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> are those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SCUTARI\">Scutari</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OCHRIDA\">Ochrida</a>, Vallenia, and Butrinto; but these distinctions, in its present state of independence, are in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> obliterated. The divisions chiefly recognized are those formed by the varieties of the native tribes. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJOR\">Major</a> Leake, who is allowed to be the best informed traveller <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, divides them into the Ngeze, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Ghegides, whose principal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> are Dulcigno, Scutari, and Durazzo; the Toske, or Toskides, who occupy Berat and Elbasan; the Liapce, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> and predatory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>, who inhabit the mountains between the Toske and Delvino; and the Tsami, who inhabit the most southerly district, and whose principal towns are Suli and Paramithia. There are, besides, a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of smaller divisions, too tedious to enumerate. (Leake's Researches in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>.)\n\nAlbania nearly coincides with the country known to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of Epirus. This country was then, as now, distinguished by the rude valour of its inhabitants. Its remote situation, and the want of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNION\">union</a> among its tribes, generally prevented it from acting any conspicuous part in Grecian politics. The only remarkable exception occurs in the reign of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYRRHUS\">Pyrrhus</a> II., who was justly ranked with the greatest captains of antiquity. After his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, the country was again split into a number of petty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, which were unable to resist the united strength of Macedon; and to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>, Epirus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> subject, till both were alike subdued by the Roman arms.\n\nIt was during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of the Greek empire, that the name of Albania was first given to this district. During the decline of the empire, the Albanians gradually rose to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a>, and at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> to independence. Their valour enabled them to maintain their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> against the Bulgarians, who had occupied all the neighbouring districts of Greece. Nor were they less successful against the Turks, a more formidable enemy. Under the command of the celebrated George Castriot, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCANDERBEG\">Scanderbeg</a>, they baffled all the efforts of Mahomet II., the conqueror of Constantinople. That powerful monarch entered Albania only to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> a succession of defeats, and was at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> compelled to acknowledge its independence by a formal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a>. On the death\nof Scanderbeg, the Turks redoubled their efforts against Albania, which was at length reduced to a state of nominal subjection. The siege of Scutari, in 1478, formed the termination of this memorable struggle. The subjection, however, was always <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a>; revolts were frequent, and the inhabitants of the mountainous districts still preserved their independence. It was by the motives of pay and plunder, rather than by compulsion, that these hardy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> were allured into the Turkish ranks. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> as the Ottoman empire declined in vigour, its hold of Albania became less and less firm; and the vigorous and enterprising <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALI\">Ali</a> Pasha, has now again converted this dependency into what may almost be called a separate kingdom.\n\nAli was born at Tepellene, a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWN\">town</a> in the interior of Albania. His father held the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of a Pasha of two tails, but was not possessed of any extensive power; and he died when Ali was only fifteen. In a district so turbulent, and filled with warlike and hostile leaders, the young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> was necessarily placed in a very critical situation. He is himself accustomed to boast, that he began his fortune with sixty paras and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSKET\">musket</a>; and an Albanian who attended a late traveller (Mr Hobhouse) declared, that he remembered to have seen Ali with his jacket out at elbows. Ali was ere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> driven from Tepellene, his native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, and was abandoned by almost every follower. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> was next formed for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a>, by the inhabitants of Gardiki, a neighbouring town; and for this purpose, they surrounded, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a> time, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VILLAGE\">village</a> where he had taken refuge. Ali escaped through a garden, but his mother and sister fell into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of the Gardikiotes, and were treated with every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of indignity; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-WRONGS\">wrongs</a> for which he afterwards took a dreadful vengeance. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> enabled him gradually to repair his fortunes. He insinuated himself into the favour of Coul Pasha, then the principal chief of Albania, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> he at length married. Having thus been enabled to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLECT\">collect</a> some followers, he succeeded in surprising his present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a>, Joannina, and in prevailing upon the Porte to recognize him as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PACHA\">Pacha</a> of that important district. From this time, he took the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> among the Albanian chiefs; employing sometimes force, sometimes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, and sometimes treachery, to increase his authority, and add to the extent of his dominions.\n\nThe most formidable adversaries with whom Ali had to contend, were the Suliotes, a people placed in the southern extremity of Albania. They inhabit an almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INACCESSIBLE\">inaccessible</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANGE\">range</a> of mountains, beneath whose gloomy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a> winds a river, which Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a> conjectures, on very plausible grounds, to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACHERON\">Acheron</a> of the ancients. (Travels in the Ionian Isles and Albania.) The strength of their native bulwarks, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, and contempt of death, made them the terror of Albania, which they frequently invaded; while <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> foreign power had ever ventured to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a> the tremendous barriers by which they were guarded. Ali at length succeeded, partly by force, and partly by bribery, in gaining the passes which led into their country; and the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, after a furious resistance, was reduced to subjection, and partly extirpated.\n\nIn 1811 and 1812, Ali attacked and defeated the Pashas of Berat and Delvino; by which means he gained possession of some of the finest parts of Albania, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> of between 200,000 and 300,000 souls. Tepellene, his native place, now fell into his power; and now also it was, that he obtained the means of inflicting signal vengeance on Gardiki. With his accustomed duplicity, he pretended a complete oblivion of all grounds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESENTMENT\">resentment</a>, until he had surrounded and enclosed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> with his troops; when upwards of 700 of those of the inhabitants who were supposed to have been most deeply involved in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> guilt, were dragged into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> khan near the city, and bound together with cords. On a signal given by Ali, the Albanian soldiery, who were stationed on the walls of the khan, began a discharge of musketry, which continued until the destruction of the whole 700 was completed.\n\nIt seems <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to define with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> precision, either the extent of Ali's dominions, or the degree of authority which he possesses. Even within Albania, the Pachalic of Scutari remains still independent. The tract over which he bears sway, is bounded on the north by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> line, extending from Durazzo to the Gulf of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SALONICA\">Salonica</a>. It comprehends the mountainous district of Macedonia, nearly the whole of Thessaly, and great part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIVADIA\">Livadia</a>. On the eastern side, he is kept in check by Ismael <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEY\">Bey</a>, who possesses an authority nearly as independent over the plains of Macedonia. In Albania, his power is almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a>; and while little regard is paid to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERIAL\">imperial</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIRMAN\">firman</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIGNATURE\">signature</a> of Ali commands implicit obedience. The Albanians are enthusiastically attached to him; they view him as a native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOVEREIGN\">sovereign</a>; they admire the energy of his character, and when they hear of any other chief, commonly remark, that \"he has not a head like Ali.\"\n\nIn the relations between Ali and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of Constantinople, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> fear has hitherto preserved an outward good understanding. The progress of this enterprising chief has been long viewed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JEALOUSY\">jealousy</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALARM\">alarm</a>; but the Porte was never in a condition to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAZARD\">hazard</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRIVING\">driving</a> him into open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REBELLION\">rebellion</a>. It has been found prudent, therefore, to invest him, by its firman, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of those provinces which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a> had already placed in his possession. Ali, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, pays an outward deference to the Porte; and remits to it some portion of the revenue which he collects. He has also uniformly supported that power with nearly his whole force, against the foreign enemies with which it has had to contend. He even marched against Paswan Oglou, and was present at the siege of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-WIDDIN\">Widdin</a>; and his son Mouctar Pasha, distinguished himself greatly in the late war against the Russians. In all other respects, whether as to the internal government of Albania, or its foreign relations, he acts completely as an independent monarch. The Porte has omitted no means of inducing him to repair to Constantinople, and has even proffered to him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> Vizier; but Ali has uniformly resisted every such invitation, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> knowing that his arrival at that capital would be the immediate signal for striking off his head. Buonaparte is also\nbelieved to have courted his favour, and to have offered him the dignity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">King</a> of Albania; but the Pasha always viewed the ambitious designs of that conqueror with alarm, and attached himself to England; with the politics and interests of which country, it appears from his conversations with Dr Holland, he was tolerably well acquainted.\n\nThe natives estimate Ali's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> force so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> as fifty, sixty, or even 100,000 men. This could only apply to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> levy en masse, in the event of invasion. It does not appear that Ali has ever brought into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a> a greater disposable force than 15,000. His standing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> is supposed to be about 10,000, of whom 4,000 or 5,000 are stationed round his capital Joannina. The amount of his revenues is still more uncertain. They arise from the following sources: 1. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> tax, amounting generally to about 10 per cent of the produce. 2. A tax on cities and towns, levied in the form of requisition. 3. The customs, which he has raised to six per cent. 4. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INHERITANCE\">inheritance</a> of all who die without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> heirs. There are several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINOR\">minor</a> sources; and besides his public revenue, Ali is supposed to possess private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> to the amount of 4,000,000 piastres, or L. 200,000 per annum. It seems impossible to conjecture, either what may be the amount of his entire revenue, or what proportion he remits to Constantinople; but it is generally believed, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURE\">treasure</a> which he has accumulated is very considerable.\n\nAli is now (1815) sixty or sixty-one years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>; his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> is corpulent and unwieldy, his neck short, his stature about five feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> inches. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> of his countenance is striking and majestic; and his features give no indications of those terrible qualities by which he is characterized. His abilities are certainly of no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> order. He displays that union of deep thought and contrivance, with prompt and decisive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, which indicates a mind equally formed for politics and for war. He is remarkable for his address, both in gaining friends, and in lulling asleep the suspicions of his bitterest enemies. But, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> his abilities are of a superior order, his dispositions are of a kind which render him an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of fear and detestation. His cruelty rather resembles that of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a>, than of even the least civilized European. Impaling, and roasting alive, are among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> punishments reserved for those who have unhappily offended him. The fierceness of his cruelty is only exceeded by the depth of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISSIMULATION\">dissimulation</a>. It is impossible for the most skilful observer to conjecture, from his outward deportment, the real sentiments with which he regards any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a>. The only observable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a>, consists in a peculiar kindness of manner, towards those unfortunates, whose cruel doom he has silently and unrelentingly sealed.\n\nAli's ordinary residence is near Joannina, in an immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>, which combines the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> and a fortress. The outer courts are irregularly crowded with Albanian soldiers, and with persons of all descriptions, who attend upon, or have petitions to present to him. Each petitioner, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a>, kneels and kisses his garment. He exercises in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> the whole judicial authority; and his decisions, though necessarily given too promptly, are however said to be guided by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> wish of arriving at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, and of doing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>. It may be supposed that this employment, joined to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to every other part of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMINISTRATION\">administration</a>, must fully occupy his time. Accordingly, he rises at six in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, and with the exception of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DINNER\">dinner</a>, and an hour at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUPPER\">supper</a>, spends the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> in business. His habits at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> are extremely temperate, though he is not so strict a Musulman as to decline the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of wine. His haram contains three hundred females of various descriptions. It forms an edifice entirely distinct from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERAGLIO\">seraglio</a>, and is said to be furnished in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a> of the most gorgeous magnificence; but no European has hitherto found admission into it.\n\nAlthough the government of Ali is completely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESPOTICAL\">despotical</a>, yet, viewed comparatively, it appears to be better for Albania, than the terrible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANARCHY\">anarchy</a> to which it was formerly exposed. He has freed that country from a race of petty tyrants, and from perpetual scenes of internal warfare. His vigorous administration has nearly extirpated those numerous predatory hordes, who found shelter in the mountainous districts, and spread terror and desolation over the plains.\n\nThe inhabitants of Albania are estimated at twelve hundred thousand; those of Ali's whole dominions at two millions. Albania contains a considerable proportion of Turks and Greeks; but the basis of the population, and that in which Ali places his chief confidence, consists of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> race. This remarkable people differ completely from every other included within the limits of the Turkish empire. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVERSION\">conversion</a> to Mahometan tenets has been very imperfect, and chiefly induced by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> motives. In every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> the males usually go to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOSQUE\">mosque</a>, the females to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>; and some members of a family are seen in the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMICABLE\">amicable</a> manner eating from the same table, and even from the same plate, meats forbidden to the others. With the Turks, accordingly, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFIDEL\">infidel</a> and Albanian are terms nearly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYNONYMOUS\">synonymous</a>. Ali himself, does not appear to make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> a ground of any the slightest distinction between the different classes of his subjects.\n\nThe native Albanian is of a middle stature; his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a> is oval, with high cheek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a>; his neck long, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEST\">chest</a> full and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> is erect and majestic, to a degree which never fails to surprise the traveller. He holds in utter contempt that dissimulation which is characteristic of the Greek, and piques himself upon giving utterance to every sentiment without the smallest reserve. Equally remote from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a> and sluggish deportment of the Turk, he is gay, lively, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a>. Averse, however, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> industry, his whole delight is in arms and plunder. He goes constantly armed; and there are few Albanians who, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIME\">prime</a> of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, have not belonged to some of the numerous bands of robbers, who infest the mountains of their native country, of Thessaly, and of Macedonia. This profession carries with it no disgrace; it is common for the Albanian to mention circumstances which occurred, \"when he was a robber.\" In proportion as the trade of robbing becomes overstocked, part of those engaged in it seek employment in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SULTAN\">Sultan</a>, and of the different Pashas throughout the Turkish empire; by\nall of whom the Albanians are regarded as the most valuable of their troops.\n\nAn Albanian military force, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of Dr Holland, cannot so properly be called an army, as a tumultuous assemblage of armed men. There is no regular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a> into corps; nor is much regard paid to the authority of any officer, with the single exception of the Pasha himself. Yet, such is their activity and intrepidity, that they have sometimes proved formidable to the best disciplined European armies. Whatever was done in the last Turkish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAMPAIGN\">campaign</a> against the Russians, is said to have been achieved by Albanian troops.\n\nThis fierce and haughty race display a greater degree of contempt for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEX\">sex</a>, than is usual even among the most barbarous nations. The females are literally regarded as inferior animals, and treated as such; but, in the country districts, they are not confined, or veiled, as is customary in Mahometan countries.\n\nThe dress of the Albanian consists of a cotton shirt, a jacket, a mantle, sandals, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>; to which is added, a large capote, or great coat, as a shelter from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>. Every part, except the shirt, consists of woollen. As they have usually only one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a>, which they wear day and night, it soon becomes a dreadful assemblage of dirt and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VERMIN\">vermin</a>; and at length literally falls to pieces. The dress of the females is more various, and often fantastical. A singular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> prevails among the girls, of stringing together the pieces of money which they have collected for their portion, and wearing them upon their heads. Some of them have their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> hanging <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> in braids to a great length, loaded with this species of ornament.\n\nJoannina, the present capital, is beautifully situated on the banks of a small lake, enclosed within a circuit of lofty mountains. The houses, in general, are not externally either splendid or elegant; and they are built in the most irregular manner, with scarcely any approach to the form of streets. The intermixture however of gardens and trees, gives to the city a fine appearance from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a>; particularly when combined with the magnificent back-ground, which everywhere crowns the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANDSCAPE\">landscape</a>. There is a considerable number of Greeks at Joannina, who display an active and intelligent character, and cultivate with ardour the different branches of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> and literature. The total number of inhabitants is estimated at upwards of thirty-five thousand.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> of Albania is chiefly carried on through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTA\">Arta</a>, a small city situated on a gulf of the same name, in the most southern district of the country. The principal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> however, are Greeks residing at Joannina, among whom a very active commercial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> appears to prevail. Ali, who anxiously endeavours to promote the trade of his dominions, without however knowing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>, imposes great restraints on the removal of the merchants. He generally insists, that at least one member of a family should continue to reside at Joannina. The mercantile houses of this city have often branches in other countries, particularly Germany and Russia, and several of them suffered considerably by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONFLAGRATION\">conflagration</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOSCOW\">Moscow</a>. Under the continental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of the late French ruler, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALTA\">Malta</a> became the great channel for the trade of Albania, and, notwithstanding the recent political changes, may probably retain it to a certain extent. The exports consist almost entirely of unmanufactured produce. Notwithstanding its mountainous character, the fertility of its plains affords a surplus of grain, of which, upwards of fifty cargoes are sent to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, the Ionian isles, Malta, and other places. The Pasha, however has checked this commerce by the impolitic system of assuming the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONOPOLY\">monopoly</a> of it into his own hands. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">Wool</a> is exported, chiefly unmanufactured; but partly also wrought into coarse cloth. Other important <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of export are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOBACCO\">tobacco</a> of good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, cotton and cotton <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-YARN\">yarn</a>, chiefly from Thessaly. Some cargoes of wood for building and fire, are annually sent to Malta. The chief imports consist of woollen cloths, used for winter coverings. For this purpose, the preference is given to a coarser and cheaper species than any that is usually manufactured in Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>. This is supplied from Germany. Albania imports also guns, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a>, hardware, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COFFEE\">coffee</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>. On the 8th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OCTOBER\">October</a>, an annual fair is opened in the neighbourhood of Joannina, and continues for fourteen days, when the imported articles are exchanged for native commodities, which then pour in from every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>.\n\nThe reader <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> find much interesting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> in regard to this country, and its present ruler, in the lately published Travels of Mr Hobhouse, and of Dr Holland. The latter resided for some time at Ali's court, where, in quality of physician, he enjoyed the privilege of a familiar intercourse with that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> personage; and the anecdotes which he relates, give no small share of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> to his otherwise valuable and instructive publication.","sp":460,"ep":463},{"h":"ALCARRAZAS","t":"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a>, of Arabic origin, applied to a kind of porous earthen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARE\">ware</a>, much used in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a> for cooling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>.

These islands are very shortly noticed in the body of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> Fox Islands. According to the practice of the most recent Russian geographers, we have comprehended the whole of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARCHIPELAGO\">archipelago</a> under one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> name, although it has been sometimes divided into three several groups: those nearest to the eastern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of Kamtschatka being properly called Aleutian; the central <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUP\">group</a> the Andreanofskie, or Andreonovian; and those nearest to the American promontory, the Fox Islands. The Russian geographers usually separate Behring's and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COPPER\">Copper</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">Island</a>, which are at the western extremity of this chain, from the other parts of it, included by them under the general name of\nAleutian Islands; but as there seems <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> for this exception, it certainly would be better to comprehend the whole under one general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DENOMINATION\">denomination</a>.\n\nThe first voyage of discovery in this remote and dangerous archipelago was projected by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">Great</a>, whose enterprising mind appears to have been strongly excited by the question, then much agitated, relative to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> between the Asiatic and American Continents; the solution of which seemed to be facilitated by the recent conquest of Kamtschatka. A short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> previous to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of that monarch, which took <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in 1725, he drew up instructions, with his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, for the conduct of an expedition, which was to be entrusted to the command of an officer named Behring, who had already made several voyages in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> of Kamtschatka, by order of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CROWN\">Crown</a>. In 1728, Behring set sail from the mouth of the Kamtschatka river, and coasted the eastern shores of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIBERIA\">Siberia</a>, as far to the northward as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LATITUDE\">latitude</a> 67\u00b0 18', but made no discovery of the opposite Continent. In 1729, he again set sail, for the purpose of prosecuting the same enterprise, but with no better success. A third voyage was undertaken, by order of the Empress <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANNA\">Anna</a>, in 1741; and Behring was again selected as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> of the expedition; another vessel being entrusted to the command of Tschirikoff. This enterprise proved more fortunate, and led the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> to all the subsequent important discoveries of the Russians in those seas; although the immediate results of the voyage, upon the whole, were not deemed commensurate with the time and expense employed in fitting out the expedition. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of the undertaking, however, appears to have been accomplished. Tschirikoff discovered the coast of America in the 56th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of latitude; and Behring, who was separated from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a> in a storm, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> it in latitude 58\u00b0 28'. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">On</a> his voyage back to Kamtschatka, Behring's ship was driven on the island which now bears his name, where he soon afterwards died.\n\nThe two uninhabited islands, Behring's and Copper Island, now became known to the natives of Kamtschatka, who frequently resorted thither, for the purpose of hunting sea-otters, and other animals, affording valuable furs, with which they carried on a lucrative traffic. Some of the vessels which sailed upon these expeditions were driven, by stormy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, to the south-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EAST\">east</a>, by which means the group of Aleutian Islands came to be discovered. These islands seem to have been first visited in the year 1745, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to be resorted to, for some time, by private individuals, without attracting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of the Russian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">Government</a>. In the above-mentioned year a vessel, called the Eudokia, was fitted out at the expence of some private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ADVENTURERS\">adventurers</a>, and the command given to Michael Nevodtsikof, a native of Tobolsk. Having discovered three unknown islands, they ventured upon one of them, in order to kill sea-otters, of which they found a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a>. These islands were undoubtedly the nearest Aleutian Islands, and were found <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> inhabited. The Russians continued upon this island until the 14th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEPTEMBER\">September</a> 1746, when, having incurred the enmity of the natives by their arbitrary and hostile proceedings, they put to sea, with the view of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> out for some uninhabited islands. Being overtaken, however, by a violent storm, they were driven about until the 30th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OCTOBER\">October</a>, when their vessel was wrecked upon the rocky shore of the island of Karaga, the inhabitants of which were of the Koriae <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBUTARY\">tributary</a> to the Russian empire.\n\nFrom this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, the zeal or avarice of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a> adventurers prompted them to undertake repeated voyages to the new-discovered islands, in some of which they penetrated as far eastward as the Fox Islands, where they collected a quantity of valuable skins; but, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of their own rapacity and misconduct, they were frequently embroiled in fatal quarrels with the natives. One of the most remarkable of these voyages was that of the St Andrean and the St Natalia, fitted out by the merchant Andrean Tolstyk, which sailed from the mouth of the Kamtschatka river on the 27th September 1760, and on the 29th reached <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol4.html#article-BEHRING_S_ISLAND\">Behring's Island</a>. Having been driven on shore by a violent autumnal storm, they were here obliged to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> the winter; and, after refitting, they put to sea again on the 24th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 1761. They passed by Copper Island, which lies about 150 versts from the former, and steered S.E. towards the Aleutian isles, which they did not reach before the 6th August. From thence they proceeded, on the Discovery 19th, in quest of some more distant islands, for the purpose of exacting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBUTE\">tribute</a>, steering their course N.E. and N.E. by E., and were driven, by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GALE\">gale</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>, towards an island, where, on the 30th August, they anchored in a safe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a>. This island, they called Ayagh or Kayaka, and another, which lay at the distance of about 20 versts, Kanagra. The Russians persuaded the inhabitants of these islands to become tributary to the empress, to which they made no great objection. Four other islands were discovered in the neighbourhood; and the crew remained here, in great tranquillity, until the year 1764, but met with no great success in their hunting excursions. This group of islands, which lies somewhat to the north-west of the Fox Islands, was denominated, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of the vessel which made the discovery, the Andreanofskie, or Andrenovian Isles.\n\nFrom the year 1758 to 1760, several vessels visited the Fox Islands, and obtained considerable cargoes of sea-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OTTER\">otter</a> and fox skins. But the crews appear to have behaved with the most shameful inhumanity towards the natives; and little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> was derived from these voyages, except a few particulars which\n\n---\n\n* Mr Pinkerton appears to be mistaken when he says, that, \"the nearest Aleutian Isles of the Russians, are those which we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> Behring's and Copper.\" (Geog. 3d. Edit. Vol. II. p. 428.) We do not find that the term Aleutian, has ever been applied to the two islands above mentioned. That name was first given, by the early Russian discoverers, to the small group of islands, situated to the S.E. of Behring's island; and the islands composing this group, were sometimes called the nearest Aleutian isles, to distinguish them from the more easterly and remote parts of the chain. See Coxe's Russian Discoveries, chap. ii.\ntranspired during the course of a judicial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> into their conduct. In 1762, four vessels sailed for the Fox Islands, of which only one returned safe to Kamtschatka. The first was the Zacharias and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a>, fitted out by Kulkof and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">Company</a> of Vologda, under the command of Drusinin, with a crew of thirty-four Russians and three Kamtschadals. This vessel touched at the Aleutian Islands, and, in the beginning of September 1763, arrived at Unmak, one of the most considerable of the Fox Islands. On the 22d September they proceeded to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNALASHKA\">Unalashka</a>, where the vessel was brought into a safe harbour. Here the crew formed themselves into hunting parties, but were soon afterwards attacked separately by the natives, and cut off, with the exception of four individuals, who, after defending themselves with astonishing courage and intrepidity, and suffering incredible hardships, succeeded in making their escape from the island in a baidar, their own vessel having been destroyed by the savages. One of these four died during the home voyage; but the other three returned safe to Kamtschatka, and gave an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of their adventures.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> vessel which sailed from Kamtschatka in 1762 was the Trinity, fitted out by the trading company of Nikiphor Trapesnikof, a merchant of Irkutsk, under the command of Ivan Korovin, and manned with thirty-eight Russians and six Kamtschadals. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of October they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANCHOR\">anchor</a> before the south side of Behring's Island, where they resolved to winter, on account of the late season of the year. On the 1st of August 1763, Korovin sailed from Behring's Island, in company with Dennis Medvedef, who commanded a vessel fitted out by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JACOB\">Jacob</a> Protassof, merchant of Tiumen. On the 15th the former vessel made Unalashka, and Medvedef reached Unmak. After having reconnoitred the coast, and received hostages from the Toigons, or Chiefs, Korovin sent out several hunting parties; but the natives soon began to exhibit hostile intentions, and three Kamtschadals, belonging to Kulkof's ship, arrived with accounts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a> of that vessel, and the massacre of the crew. On the 10th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a>, the savages assembled in large bodies, and invested the hut which the Russians had constructed, and continually annoyed them with their darts. Korovin, finding himself thus harassed by the natives, ordered the hut to be destroyed, and retired to his vessel, which was removed to the distance of an hundred yards from the beach, where they lay at anchor from the 5th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> to the 26th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a> 1764. Here the natives attempted to surprise the vessel; but Korovin, having been warned of their approach, compelled them to retreat. On the 26th April, Korovin sailed from Unalashka, and, after being driven about by contrary winds, the vessel was at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> stranded, on the 28th, in a bay of the Island of Unmak. Having got on shore, the crew attempted to secure themselves between their baidar and some empty barrels, with the sails spread over them in the form of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TENT\">tent</a>. Next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, they were surprised by a large body of the natives, who attacked them with their darts, and wounded every one of the crew. Korovin, however, sailed out, in company with four Russians, and put the savages to flight; although he and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PARTY\">party</a> were so severely wounded, that they had scarcely sufficient strength to return to the tent. During the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>, the vessel was dashed to pieces by the storm. On the 30th of April, they were again attacked by the natives, who, however, were soon put to flight by the fire of the Russians. On the 21st of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a>, Korovin, with the remainder of his crew, which was now reduced to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of twelve persons, including six Kamtschadals, put to sea in a baidar; and, having landed upon another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the same island, they discovered the remains of a vessel which had been burnt, and, at a small distance, a deserted Russian dwelling, containing twenty dead bodies in their clothes; among which they recognized several of those individuals who had sailed in Protassof's vessel, and distinguished, among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a>, the commander Medvedef. Korovin afterwards joined Glottof's vessel, (of whose proceedings we shall immediately give some account), which he quitted in the month of April 1765, and went over, with five other Russians, to Soloviof, with whom he returned, the following year, to Kamtschatka.\n\nThe third voyage from Kamtschatka in 1762, and Voyage of the most fortunate and most remarkable of the whole, Stephen Glottof, in was that of the Andrean and Natalia, which was fitted out by Terenty Tsebneffskoi and Company, under the command of Stephen Glottof, an experienced and skillful seaman of Yarensk. This vessel sailed on the 1st October, with a crew of thirty-eight Russians and eight Kamtschadals. Having wintered at Copper Island, they set sail from thence on the 26th July 1763, and steered for the Fox Islands. In consequence of storms and contrary winds, they were thirty days on the voyage to Unmak, where they arrived on the 24th August, and, without dropping anchor, sailed farther in quest of new islands, of which they passed eight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTIGUOUS\">contiguous</a> to each other, and separated by straits from 20 to 100 versts <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>. Glottof, however, did not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> until he reached the most eastward of these islands, called by the inhabitants Kadyak. Here, and in the neighbouring islands, they passed the winter, and collected a considerable quantity of furs; but as the conduct of the natives, at first decidedly hostile, was always suspicious, Glottof did not think it prudent to prolong his stay; and accordingly, having taken on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOARD\">board</a> all the peltry and stores, he left Kadyak on the 24th May 1764, and sailed for Unmak, where he arrived on the 3d July. He remained here two years, sending out hunting parties through the islands of Unmak and Unalashka, and commenced his voyage homewards in the month of July 1766. In the month of August he arrived safe in Kamtschatka river with a rich <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARGO\">cargo</a>.\n\nSoloviof, to whose voyage we have already alluded, sailed from Kamtschatka on the 25th of Au-\n\n* This was the fourth vessel which sailed in 1762; but, as the whole crew were massacred by the natives, we have no distinct account of the voyage.\ngust 1764, in a ship called the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul, fitted out by Jacob Ulednikof and Company, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> of Irkutsk. This vessel reached Unalashka on the 17th September, where Soloviof passed two winters; and having succeeded, notwithstanding the continual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSTILITY\">hostility</a> of the natives, in collecting a considerable cargo of peltry, he returned to Kamtschatka in the month of July 1766.\n\nHaving thus traced an outline of the gradual progress of early discovery in this archipelago, it seems unnecessary to proceed with an enumeration of the subsequent voyages performed by private individuals. These were undertaken merely for commercial purposes; the accounts brought home by the adventurers were generally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> and incorrect; and rather tended to excite than to gratify the curiosity of those who might be desirous of obtaining more accurate and more ample information. We shall, therefore, now turn to the conduct of those expeditions, which were fitted out by the State for the express purpose of discovery.\n\nIn the year 1768, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> Krenitzin and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">Lieutenant</a> Levashof sailed from the mouth of the Kamtschatka river, by order of the Empress Catharine, to examine the chain of Aleutian Islands. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> they accordingly executed very carefully, having surveyed the whole of this archipelago, from Behring's Island to the promontory of Alaska; and, after spending the winter among the Fox Islands, they returned to Kamtschatka in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUTUMN\">autumn</a> of 1769.\n\nBut our great navigator, Captain Cook, communicated more accurate scientific information respecting these islands, as well as the coasts of the two continents, than all the previous voyages of the Russian discoverers had afforded. During his third and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> voyage, in the year 1778, he surveyed the eastern portion of this archipelago, accurately determined the positions of some of the most remarkable islands, and corrected many errors of former navigators.\n\nIn the year 1785, a fresh expedition was set on foot by the Russian government, the command of which was entrusted to Captain Billings, an English naval officer in the Russian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>, who had accompanied Captain Cook in his last celebrated voyage to the Pacific Ocean. This expedition appears to have been suggested by Mr Coxe, who was at that time at St Petersburg, and whose Account of the Russian Discoveries between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a> and America, had already attracted the attention of the Russian government. During this voyage, which was not completed until the year 1796, Captains Billings and Sarytschef explored the whole chain of the Aleutian islands, particularly that part of it which had been visited by Captain Cook, and some parts of the adjacent western coast of America. Ample details of the conduct of this expedition have been published in the narratives of Martin Sauer, who officiated as secretary to Captain Billings, and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ADMIRAL\">Admiral</a> Sarytschef.\n\nSome years after the termination of the expedition under Captain Billings, the attention of the Russian American Company was turned towards the best means of supplying their settlements on the north-west coast of America with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> and stores of all kinds; and it was resolved to try whether the Aleutian conveyance by sea would not answer the purpose better, than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> and tedious journey by land to Ochotsk. With the view of ascertaining the practicability of the project, Captain Krusenstern, an experienced Russian naval officer, who had served for a long period in the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">Navy</a>, suggested the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of an expedition from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CRONSTADT\">Cronstadt</a>, round <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORN\">Horn</a>, to the Aleutian Islands and the north-west coast of America. This plan was approved of by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> Romanzof, the Minister of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">Commerce</a>, and Admiral Mordwinof, Minister of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">Marine</a>, and obtained the sanction of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERIAL\">Imperial</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJESTY\">Majesty</a>. Two vessels, called by the Russians the Nadeshda and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEVA\">Neva</a>, were accordingly purchased in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> for the voyage. The command of the expedition was intrusted to Captain Krusenstern, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> author of the plan; and Captain Lisiansky was appointed to the Neva. These two vessels accordingly sailed in company from Cronstadt, in the month of August 1803, and, after a short stay at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALMOUTH\">Falmouth</a>, proceeded to the Brazils; from whence they sailed round Cape Horn to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDWICH\">Sandwich</a> Islands. Here they separated; the Nadeshda being ordered on a distinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MISSION\">mission</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JAPAN\">Japan</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHINA\">China</a>; while Captain Lisiansky, in the Neva, proceeded to Kadyak and the American settlements. Of this voyage, very full and interesting accounts have been lately published by Captains Krusenstern and Lisiansky, and by Dr Langsdorff, who accompanied the expedition in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of physician.\n\nFrom the ample sources of information, to which we have alluded in the foregoing narrative, we shall now proceed to exhibit an enumeration and general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of the islands composing this singular chain, which appears to be a prolongation of either continent. We shall begin with the more westerly part of the chain, consisting of those islands which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> nearest to Kamtschatka, and proceed eastwards to the American promontory. The first is Commodore's or Behring's Island, situate (according to Cook's reckoning), in 55\u00b0 of latitude, and 6\u00b0 of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a> from the harbour of Petropaulowska in the bay of Awatska. It is from 70 to 80 versts long, and stretches from north-west to south-east. Ten leagues from the south-east point of this island, in the direction of east by south, or east-south-east, lies Mednoi Ostroff, or Copper Island, so called from large masses of native copper being found upon the beach. To the south-east of Copper Island lie three small islands, Attak, or Attoo, Semitshi, and Agattoo, called by the Russians Plishnic Ostrova, or the nearest Aleutian Islands. Of these Attak is the largest; it is nearly of the same shape as Behring's Island, but rather more extensive, stretching from west to east to the length of 18 leagues. These islands are situate between 54\u00b0 and 55\u00b0 of north latitude. Attak has two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HARBOURS\">harbours</a>, one of which lies on the southern coast. From the eastern extremity of the Aleutian Islands, properly so called, another group runs, south-eastward, continuing the chain as far as the western extremity of the Fox Islands. These are called the Andreanofskie Islands; but we have less accurate information respecting this central part of\nthe chain, than regarding the eastern and western groups. They are said to lie within the 52d and 54th degree of north latitude, to be of inconsiderable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> or importance, and, therefore, seldom visited by recent navigators. The most remarkable are, Takavangha, which has in its centre, near the northern coast, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> mountain; Kanaghi, or Kanaga, likewise with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> smoking mountain; Ayag, which has a number of good bays and anchoring-places; and Tshetchina, on which a high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> mountain overtops the rest, which apparently is an extinct volcano, as there are still hot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a> on this island. Atshak, or Atchka, and Amlac, are also usually reckoned among the number of the Andreonovian isles. The former greatly resembles Copper Island, and is provided with a commodious harbour.\n\nBy far the most important and best explored portion of this archipelago is the most easterly group, called by the Russians Lysic Ostrovo, or the Fox Islands. Of these islands the most considerable are, Umnak, Unalashka, or Oonalashka; and Unimak; the last of which is separated by a narrow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRAIT\">strait</a> from the promontory of Alaska. Beyond these, to the north-east, lies the large island of Kadyak, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-KODIAK\">Kodiak</a>, which is generally included among the group called Schumagin's Islands.\n\nThe whole of the islands composing this chain are bare and mountainous; their coasts are rocky and surrounded by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAKERS\">breakers</a>, which renders the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a> of those seas exceedingly dangerous. The land rises immediately from the coasts to steep bald <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>, gradually ascending higher behind each other, and assuming the appearance of chains of mountains, with a direction lengthwise of the island. Springs take their rise at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> of the mountains, and either flow in broad and rapid streams into the neighbouring sea, or, collecting in the rocky vales and glens, form ample <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>, which send off their superfluous waters, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CANALS\">canals</a>, into the adjacent bays. These islands bear evident marks of volcanic formation; and several of them have still <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> volcanoes, which continually emit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a>, and sometimes flames. No traces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a> have been discovered on these islands; but carnoles and sardonyxes are brought from thence. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> is said to be similar to that of Kamtschatka; and affords the same kinds of edible wild berries and roots; excepting some few vegetables which seem to be of foreign origin. No wood of any considerable growth has been perceived upon any of these islands, except a very small quantity, on Unalashka. The land animals are bears, wolves, river-otters, river-beavers, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERMINES\">ermines</a>. The sea-otter, so valuable on account of its skin, is frequently caught; but the number of these animals, it is believed, is much diminished of late. On the Fox Islands they have a great variety of foxes, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>, grey, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a>. The sea abounds with all sorts of seals, dolphins, and whales; sea-lions and porpoises are rare, and sea-cows not at all to be seen. Salmon are caught in great abundance and variety; and halibut of an immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> are frequently taken. The winter upon these islands is tolerably mild, but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> is equally short and unpleasant. The inhabitants are pretty numerous, and tributary to Russia, from whence vessels are sent out, and establishments formed upon these islands, on account of the very profitable chace of sea-otters and foxes.\n\nUnalashka, one of the largest of the Fox Islands, Island of was visited by Captain Cook during his last voyage, and seems to merit particular notice. This island stretches from north-east to south-west, and is from 70 to 80 versts in length, but of very unequal breadth. On the north and north-east side there are many bays and creeks, in some of which are very secure harbours for vessels. A part of the southwest shore consists of very high, steep, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INACCESSIBLE\">inaccessible</a> cliffs; and another part has remained hitherto wholly unexplored. The whole island consists of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of rocks, covered only with a very thin coat of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>; the hills are of very unequal height, and are intersected by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> valleys, the soil of which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> argillaceous, or an earth which appears washed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> from the hills. In the lower valleys there is great abundance of grass, which would furnish very good food for cattle; indeed Captain Cook was of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> that cattle might subsist at Unalashka all the year round, without being housed; and the soil, in many places, appeared capable of producing grain, roots, and vegetables. But the Russian traders, and the natives, seem satisfied with what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> brings forth. No wood grows on this and the neighbouring islands; only low bushes and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHRUBS\">shrubs</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DWARF\">dwarf</a>-birch, willow, and alder. For all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a> used for the purposes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>, &c., they are indebted to the sea, which wafts it to their shores from the adjacent continent of America. The inhabitants are rather low of stature, but plump and well shaped; with the Natives, short necks, swarthy chubby faces, black eyes, small beards, and long, straight, black <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>, which the men wear loose behind, and cut before, but the women tie up in a bunch. With regard to their character, Captain Cook describes them as, to all appearance, the most inoffensive people he ever met with, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> patterns of honesty. But, according to the accounts of the first discoverers, this does not seem to have been their original disposition; and recent travellers have observed, that although generally kind-hearted and peaceable, yet, when roused to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a>, they become exceedingly malevolent, and indifferent to all danger, even to death itself. The clothing of the men and women Dress, is nearly the same, and consists of a sort of frock or shirt, called parka, fastened round the neck with a broad stiff <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLAR\">collar</a>, and descending below the knee. These garments are made of the skins of seals, prepared in a manner peculiar to themselves, and sewed together very ingeniously. Though simple in their form, they are ornamented in a variety of ways; with glass beads; beaks of sea parrots; long white goat's hair, brought from Siberia, or small red feathers. Over the frock, the men sometimes bear a kamleika, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a>-garment. This is made of gut, which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a>; and has a hood to it, which draws over the head, and is tied under the chin. When on shore, the men wear boots, made of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEAL\">seal</a>'s skin; and they all have a kind of oval snouted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>, made of wood, with a rim to admit the head. These caps are dyed with green and other\nAleutian Islands.\n\ncolours, and are very fancifully ornamented with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IVORY\">ivory</a> figures, carved from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a> of the sea-cow, with glass or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMBER\">amber</a> beads, and with the bristles from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEARD\">beard</a> of the sea-lion. They make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of no paint; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TATTOOING\">tattooing</a> was formerly very much in use among them, particularly among the women; but their intercourse with the Russians has rather brought this practice into disrepute. Both men and women, particularly the latter, bore the under lip, and insert pieces of bone or other ornaments; but this practice has also decreased of late. The women, for the most part, go barefooted; they wear bracelets of glass beads <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> above the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WRIST\">wrist</a> and ankle-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a>, and are very fond of rings upon their fingers. The principal food of these islanders consists of fish, sea-animals, birds, roots and berries. They dry large quantities of fish in summer, which they lay up in small huts for winter use; and roots and berries are also preserved for the same time of scarcity. Among the fish, the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> and most abundant are several sorts of salmon, cod, herrings, and halibut. The last is the most esteemed, and is sometimes caught of an enormous size. The fat of the whale is also a favourite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of food; when it grows old and rancid, it serves to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> and warm their houses. They eat almost everything raw; but of late, they have learnt some simple modes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COOKERY\">cookery</a> from the Russians. Vegetable food does not appear to be held in much esteem by the Unalashkans. That sweet plant, the Siberian parsnip, (*Heracleum Sibiricum*), is but little eaten, any more than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BULB\">bulb</a> of the *Saranna*, or Kamtschadale lily. Berries of an eatable quality abound; such as brambleberries, cranberries, huckleberries, heath-berries, and several others. Of late, the Russians have begun to plant potatoes, which succeed extremely well, and are much liked by the people. The habitations of the Unalashkans are holes dug in the earth, covered with a wooden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a>, over which they throw grass and earth; so that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VILLAGE\">village</a> has the appearance of an European <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-YARD\">yard</a> full of graves. The entrance into these huts is from the roof; some of the largest, however, which are inhabited by the Russians, have a low door in the side. The light is also admitted by the roof, through an opening or window covered over with seal's entrails, or dried fish-skin. Several divisions are made within, by means of seal-skins or straw-mats, which separate the apartments of the different families that occupy the habitation. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSEHOLD\">household</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FURNITURE\">furniture</a> consists of bowls, spoons, buckets, piggins or cans, matted baskets, and perhaps a Russian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KETTLE\">kettle</a> or pot. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HATCHET\">hatchet</a>, or rather a small flat piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, made like an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADZE\">adze</a>, by fitting it into a crooked wooden handle, are the only iron tools found amongst them. Yet all their instruments and utensils are made with the greatest neatness, and the most exact symmetry. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NEEDLES\">needles</a>, with which they sew their clothes and embroider, are made of the wing-bone of the gull, with a very nice cut round the thicker end, instead of an eye, to which they tie the thread so skilfully, that it follows the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NEEDLE\">needle</a> without any obstruction. Their thread is made of the sinews of the seal, the fibres of which they split to the thickness which each sort of work requires. All sewing is performed by the women; they are the tailors, shoemakers, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a>-builders, or boat-coverers. At their leisure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a>, particularly in long winter evenings, they make fine mats, little baskets, and pocket-books of straw, that are both beautiful and strong. Indeed, Captain Cook observes, there is a neatness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a> in most of their work, that shows they neither want ingenuity nor perseverance. Their houses have no fire-place, but are heated, as Use of Fire well as lighted, by lamps. These are made of a flat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, hollowed on one side like a plate; in the hollow part they put the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>, mixed with a little dry grass, which serves the purpose of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WICK\">wick</a>. They produce fire both by collision and by attrition; the former by striking two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> one against another, of producing one of them being previously rubbed with brimstone. The latter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> is with two pieces of wood; one of which is a pointed stick, and the other a flat piece. The pointed end of the stick they press upon the other, whirling it nimbly round as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRILL\">drill</a>; thus producing fire in a few minutes.\n\nThe principal occupations of the Aleutians, are Occupations <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISHING\">fishing</a> and hunting, and preparing the implements necessary for both. Their *baidars*, *baidarkas*, or boats, resemble the canoes of other savages. They consist of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SKELETON\">skeleton</a> of wood, over which is stretched a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a> covering made of seals' skins. The boats of the Unalashkans are much superior in point of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> to those of any of the other islands; some of them appear so transparent that one might trace the formation of the inside, and the manner in which the rower sits. In their form, they are long and narrow, and commonly hold only one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a>; sometimes they are made to hold two, and very rarely three; each person sitting in a round hole just fitted to the size of the body. The whole canoe is so extremely light, even when sodden with water, that it may be carried with ease in one hand. They are impelled by means of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> paddles, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> or eight feet long, which are managed with great dexterity. Experienced navigators <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> sometimes venture out a considerable way to sea in these boats, even in very stormy weather. The Darts used darts, or javelins, with which they kill their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAME\">game</a>, in Hunting, are formed with the same neatness as their other instruments, and adapted with the greatest judgment to the different objects of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHASE\">chase</a>. For land animals, a single barbed point; for birds, three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of light bone, spread, and barbed; for seals, &c., they use a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSE\">false</a> point, inserted in a socket at the end of the dart, which parts on the least effort of the animal to dive, remaining in its body. A string of considerable length is fastened to this barbed point, and twisted round the wooden part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JAVELIN\">javelin</a>. This serves as a float to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> them to the seal, which, having the stick to drag after it, soon tires, and becomes an easy prey. These darts are not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a> from Curies no bow, but slung from a small plank, about 18 inches long and two inches broad. In order that the weapon may be held the faster, they have a sort of handle at the lower end, and an opening through which the fore-finger is thrust. At the other end is a small channel, into which the javelin fits with a little knob, which serves to retain it. When the javelin is to be thrown, the plank is held horizontally, and the aim being taken, the weapon is directed by the middle finger and thumb. This is done\nwith so much dexterity, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> given to it is so powerful and so rapid, that the object aimed at is rarely missed; even whales are killed without any other weapon.\n\nTheir favourite amusement appears to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DANCING\">dancing</a>; in which, however, they do not seem to exhibit any particular exertion of strength, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEGANCE\">elegance</a>; the only motion being a sort of hop, the performer scarcely moving from the place he first takes up. Their music is exceedingly rude, consisting of a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRUM\">drum</a> or tambour, and a rattle made of the bladder of a sea-dog, filled with peas or small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEBBLES\">pebbles</a>. In their leisure hours, they amuse themselves with making these little drums and rattles, which are frequently ornamented with a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of ingenuity and elegance; and with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> out from the teeth of the sea-cow, small figures of men, fish, sea-otters, and other objects, in a manner that appears very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a>, considering that the sea-cow's teeth are much harder than ivory, and that they have no proper tools to work with.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> of these Islanders, like that of most uncivilized nations, consists in superstitious observances, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> in charms. Many of them have been baptized, and are nominally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PROFESSORS\">professors</a> of the Greek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>; of which, however, they understand nothing more than making the sign of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a>. They have no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a>; every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> may have as many wives as he can conveniently maintain; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> his means decrease, he sends first one, then another back to their parents; and these women become perfectly at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> to look out for other husbands. Sometimes the same woman lives with two husbands; and it is not uncommon for men to sell or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a> wives. Boys, if they happen to be very handsome, are often brought up entirely in the manner of girls; instructed in the arts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> blandishment; and used as concubines. This shocking, unnatural, and immoral practice, has prevailed here even from the remotest times. Such men are known under the name of schopans.\n\nThe bodies of the dead, especially of the men, were formerly interred in places set apart for the purpose, and with particular ceremonies. Their best javelins and clothes, with a portion of train-oil and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of food, were laid with them in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a>; and sometimes even slaves of both sexes were slaughtered upon the occasion. These customs are now, however, entirely laid aside.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> of Unalashka, and the neighbouring islands, appears to have been formerly considerable, amounting to several thousands. In 1790, Sarytcheff reckoned it at 1300. According to the most recent accounts, it does not appear to amount to more than 300. This rapid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEPOPULATION\">depopulation</a> is ascribed partly to the practice of sending the best hunters from hence to a distance, to chase the large sea-otters, few of whom ever return again to their families; and partly to the state of oppression under which the natives live, and the change which has taken place in their modes of living. Captain Cook seems to consider the natives of these Islands as originally of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTRACTION\">extraction</a> with the Greenlanders and Esquimaux. When first discovered by the Russians, they were under the government of Toigons, or chiefs, who, however, possessed little superior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>, and had no revenue. At present they are all subject to the government of the Russian settlers.\n\nThroughout the whole of the Aleutian Islands, on the Russian settlement of Kadyak, and the western coast of America, the Russians have formed settlements for the purpose of hunting, and collecting furs; with which they carry on a lucrative commerce, particularly with the Chinese. The most valuable fur is that of the sea-otter; an animal which has now become rare on these islands, in consequence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> eagerness with which they have been hunted and killed. Besides the sea-otter, there are numbers of foxes, especially on the Fox Islands. The black foxes found on these islands are not so valuable as those of Siberia. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCTIC\">Arctic</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ICE\">ice</a> fox, called also the rock fox, and the blue fox, from the natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> of the fur, which is of a bluish grey, is very common. From the discovery of these islands by Behring and Tschelikoff, in 1741, the fur-trade was carried on for a long period entirely by private adventurers; and appears to have been productive of great abuses. The natives were frequently treated in the most cruel and barbarous manner; and the keenness <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> by these rapacious hunters, threatened to extirpate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of animals upon which the trade depended. Convinced of the extreme <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of putting a stop to this destructive plan of proceeding, Schelikoff, an intelligent Russian merchant, took considerable pains to unite the different partakers of this trade into a company, in order that it might be conducted with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a> and precaution, upon some plan that might prove advantageous to all parties. In 1785, he succeeded in joining company with the Golikoffs. They increased their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a>, and fitted out several ships, which the enterprising Schelikoff commanded in person. Factories, protected by forts, were established in almost all the Aleutian islands, as far eastward as Kadyak; and, during several years, they continued this lucrative trade in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONJUNCTION\">conjunction</a>, by which they acquired considerable wealth. The success of this connection induced several merchants to unite like Schelikoff and the Golikoffs; and, in this manner, was laid the foundation of the present Russian American Company. The irregular manner, however, in which the trade was still carried on, and the cruelty which was frequently exercised by the Russian merchants towards the natives of the islands, drew upon them great and well-founded censure; insomuch, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">Emperor</a> Paul determined to put an end to the company and the trade at the same time. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a> would have infallibly been carried into effect, but for the interference of M. Von Resanoff, who had married Schelikoff's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a>, and was personally interested in the successful continuance of the American Company. In consequence of his active interposition, the new established company was formally confirmed, in 1799, with considerable privileges. On the accession of the present Emperor, his Majesty interested himself very much in behalf of the company, of which he became a member, and thus induced many of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a> to follow his example; and by means of the active superintendence of the minister, Count Romanzoff, and the Commer-\n\nVOL. I. PART I.\ncial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNSELLOR\">Counsellor</a> Benedict Cramer; this branch of the Russian commerce has undergone several advantageous changes. But, according to the accounts of recent observers, many abuses still exist which loudly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CALL\">call</a> for correction. The miserable situation of the Provi\u0161\u010deniks, or fur-collectors, themselves the slaves of the company's agents, and exercising, in their turn, the most oppressive tyranny over the wretched Aleutians, has been represented by several eye-witnesses in the most deplorable colours. It is to be hoped, that these representations may attract the serious attention of the Russian Government; and that the information which the late voyages have brought to light, with regard to the evils connected with the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of management, may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADOPTION\">adoption</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a>, tending at once to the better regulation of the trade, and to the amelioration of the condition of those remote settlements.\n\nThey who are desirous of obtaining more ample information on the subject of this article, may consult the following works: M\u00fcller's Sammlung Russischer Geschichte; particularly the third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a>.

The Commanders of the Faithful had become the patrons and cultivators, instead of the scourgings and contemners, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> and literature. Knowledge found her only sanctuary under the successors of those rulers who had sought to extinguish every ray of intellectual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, by means of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol13.html#article-LIBRARIES\">libraries</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALEXANDRIA\">Alexandria</a>. Instead of proscribing every book as useless but the Koran, some of these rulers carried their zeal in the cause of learning so far, as to make the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACQUISITION\">acquisition</a> of Greek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUSCRIPTS\">manuscripts</a> an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of negotiation, in their treaties with the Emperors of Constantinople. Under the Caliphs of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABBAS\">Abbas</a>, men of learning were raised to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of favour and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, which has never been enjoyed by that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a>, under the sovereigns of any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of the world. The munificence which shone forth with so much lustre in the supreme depositaries of power, was widely emulated among the inferior rulers and governors; and \"this emulation,\" to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> the words of Gibbon, \"diffused the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> and the rewards of science, from Samarcan and Bochara, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEZ\">Fez</a> and Cordova.\" Every little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">court</a> had its circle of men of letters, who were always admitted to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">Prince</a>, and for the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> liberally supported by his bounty. Thus, when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-ALFARABIUS\">Alfarabius</a>, after he had finished his travels, came to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> at Damas, he was received with Alfarabian open arms by its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOVEREIGN\">sovereign</a>, who bestowed upon him a pension, which he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to enjoy till his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, in the year 950.\n\nBut to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> the notice of princes, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> to acquire wealth, formed none of the aims of this philosopher. He is said to have led a very retired and ascetic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, rather contemning than seeking after the good things of the world. \"He constantly slept, even during winter, upon straw; his countenance was always sorrowful, and he found <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> consolation in anything but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>.\" (Enfield's Hist. of Philosophy, B.v.c.l.) His works were numerous, and very various in their subjects; his speculations seem, indeed, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of his writings, to have embraced the whole circle of the sciences. He is particularly deserving of notice, as having been perhaps the first compiler of an Encyclopedia. Such is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of one of his works, of which there is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> in manuscript, in the library of the Escorial. It contains, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIEF\">brief</a> notice of it given in Casiri's valuable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of the Arabic Manuscripts in that collection, a clear and comprehensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPENDIUM\">compendium</a> of all the Arts and Sciences; and it appears to have been regarded in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EAST\">East</a> as the most valuable of Alfarabius's compositions. It would have been agreeable to the lovers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LITERARY\">literary</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> to have possessed some more detailed view of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>, and contents of an Encyclopedia, written by an Arabian, so many centuries before any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> was thought of in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>.\n\nNext to this in estimation appears to have been his treatise <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> Music; in which he is said to have applied the principles of physics to correct the errors of musical theorists, and to regulate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of musical instruments.

He lost his father in early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANCY\">infancy</a>; but he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to reside with his mother, who married a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, till his tenth year, when he was placed at the academy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURIN\">Turin</a>. After he had passed a twelvemonth at the academy, he went on a short visit to a relation who dwelt at Comi, and during his stay there, he made his first poetical attempt in a sonnet chiefly borrowed from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> in Ariosto and Metastasio, the only poets he had at that time read. When thirteen years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> he was induced to commence the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of civil and canonical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a>; but the attempt only served to disgust him with every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a>, and to increase his relish for the perusal of French romances.\n\nBy the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of his uncle, who had hitherto taken some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> and conduct, he was left, at the age of fourteen, to enjoy without control his vast paternal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INHERITANCE\">inheritance</a>, augmented by the recent accession of his uncle's fortune. He now began to attend the riding-school, where he acquired that rage for horses, and equestrian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a>, which continued to be one of his strongest passions till the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a>.\n\nAfter some time spent in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> fits of extravagant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISSIPATION\">dissipation</a>, and ill-directed study, he was seized with a desire of travelling; and having obtained permission from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a>, he departed, in 1766, under the care of an English preceptor. Restless and unquiet, he posted with the utmost rapidity through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>; and his improvement was such as was to be expected from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of travelling and his previous habits. Dissatisfied with himself, he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> as little relish for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECTACLES\">spectacles</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> entertainments as for literature; and was as little amused by the gaiety of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARNIVAL\">carnival</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPLES\">Naples</a>, as he was impressed by the remains of antiquity at Rome, or the exhibitions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> art at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLORENCE\">Florence</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOLOGNA\">Bologna</a>. This indifference and insensibility did not, however, arise from defect of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a> or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> powers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, but from the want of some serious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>, or some enabling or praiseworthy pursuit. Hoping to find in foreign countries some relief from the tedium and ennui with which he was oppressed, and being anxious to become acquainted with the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEATRE\">Theatre</a>, he proceeded to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>; but his feelings were only those of disgust or indifference for the dramas which he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> represented in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a>. He seems, indeed, to have been completely dissatisfied with everything he witnessed in France, and contracted a dislike to its people, which his intercourse in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> years rather contributed to augment than diminish. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a> he became deeply enamoured of a married <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a>, who returned his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a>, but who was soon obliged to accompany her husband to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWITZERLAND\">Switzerland</a>. Alfieri, whose feelings were of the most impetuous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>, was in despair at this separation, and returned to his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> in the utmost anguish and despondency of mind. While under this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPRESSION\">depression</a> of spirits, he was induced to seek alleviation from works of literature; and the perusal of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLUTARCH\">Plutarch</a>'s Lives, which he read with profound <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMOTION\">emotion</a>, inspired him with an enthusiastic passion for freedom and independence. Under the influence of this rage for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> he recommenced his travels; and his only gratification, in the absence of freedom among the Continental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">States</a>, appears to have been derived from contemplating the wild and sterile regions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a>; where gloomy forests, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>, and precipices, conspired to excite those sublime and melancholy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> which were congenial to his disposition. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">Human</a> manners and human institutions he seems invariably to have surveyed with an eye of passion or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a>, instead of viewing them with the calmness of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>, who meditates how they may be rectified, or what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LESSONS\">lessons</a> may be drawn from them. In every country his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> felt as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> confined by the bonds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>; he everywhere panted for something more free in governments, more elevated in sentiment, more devoted in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOVE\">love</a>, and more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> in friendship. In search of this ideal world, he posted through various countries, more with the rapidity of a courier, than of one who travels for amusement or instruction. During a journey to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, he engaged in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTRIGUE\">intrigue</a> with a married lady of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>; and having been detected, the publicity of a rencontre with the injured husband, and of a divorce, which followed, united to the knowledge he now acquired of the infamous character of the woman, to whom he was ardently attached, rendered it expedient and desirable for him to quit England. He then visited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PORTUGAL\">Portugal</a>, where he became acquainted with the Abb\u00e9 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CALUSO\">Caluso</a>, who remained through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> the most attached and estimable friend he ever possessed. In 1772, Alfieri returned to Turin, where he again became enamoured of a lady, whom he loved with his usual ardour; and who seems to have been as undeserving of a sincere attachment as those he had hitherto adored. In the course of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> attendance on his mistress, during a malady with which she was afflicted, he one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> wrote a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIALOGUE\">dialogue</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of a drama, which he left at this lady's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>. About a year after, on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> taking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> between them, this piece was returned to him. Having then retouched and extended it to five acts, it was performed at Turin in 1775, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLEOPATRA\">Cleopatra</a>, whose amours had always been a favourite subject with Italian dramatists.\n\nFrom this moment, Alfieri was seized with an immeasurable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THIRST\">thirst</a> of theatrical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>, and the remainder of his life was devoted to its attainment. His two first tragedies, Filippo and Polinice, were originally written in French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROSE\">prose</a>; and when he came to versify them in Italian, he found that, from his Lombard origin, and long intercourse with foreigners, he expressed himself with febleness and inaccuracy. Accordingly, with the view of improving his Italian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a>, he went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TUSCANY\">Tuscany</a>, and, during an alternate residence at Florence and Siena, he completed his Filippo and Polinice, and conceived the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of various other dramas. While thus employed, he became acquainted with the Countess <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALBANY\">Albany</a>, who then resided with her husband at Florence. For her he formed an attachment, which, if less violent\nAlfieri than his former loves, appears to have been more permanent. With this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a> to remain at Florence, he could not endure the chains by which his vast possessions bound him to Piedmont. He therefore resigned his whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> to his sister, the Countess Cumiana, reserving an annuity, which scarcely amounted to a half of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> revenues. At this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, the Countess Albany, urged by the ill-treatment she received from her husband, sought refuge in Rome, where she at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> received permission from the Pope to live apart from her tormentor. Alfieri followed the Countess to that capital, where he completed fourteen tragedies, four of which were now for the first time printed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIENNA\">Sienna</a>.\n\nAt length, however, it was thought proper, that, by leaving Rome, he should remove the aspersions which had been thrown on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of his affections. During the year 1783, he therefore travelled through different states of Italy, and published six additional tragedies. The interests of his love and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LITERARY\">literary</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> had not diminished his rage for horses, which seems to have been at least the third passion of his soul. He went to England solely for the purpose of purchasing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of these animals, which he brought with him to Italy. On his return, he learned that the Countess Albany had gone to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLMAR\">Colmar</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALSACE\">Alsace</a>, where he joined her, and resided with her under the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a> during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> of his life. They chiefly passed their time between Alsace and Paris; but at length took up their abode entirely in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a>. While here, Alfieri made arrangements with Didot for an edition of his tragedies; but was soon after forced to quit Paris by the storms of the Revolution. He recrossed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALPS\">Alps</a> with the Countess, and finally settled at Florence. The ten <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> years of his life, which he spent in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, seem to have been the happiest of his existence. During that long period, his tranquillity was only interrupted by the entrance of the Revolutionary armies into Florence in 1799. Though an enemy of kings, the aristocratic feelings of Alfieri rendered him also a decided foe to the principles and leaders of the French Revolution; and he rejected, with the utmost contempt, those advances which were made with a view to bring him over to their cause. The concluding years of his life were laudably employed in the study of Greek literature, and in perfecting a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of comedies. His assiduous labour on this object, which he pursued with his characteristic impetuosity, exhausted his strength, and brought on a malady, for which he would not adopt the prescriptions of his physicians, but obstinately persisted in employing remedies of his own. Under this regimen his disorder rapidly increased, and at length terminated his life on the 8th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OCTOBER\">October</a> 1803, in the fifty-fifth year of his age.\n\nThe character of Alfieri may be best appreciated from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PORTRAIT\">portrait</a> which he has drawn of himself in his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> of his Life. He was evidently of an irritable, impetuous, and almost ungovernable temper. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIDE\">Pride</a>, which seems to have been a ruling sentiment, may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> for many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> inconsistencies of his character. While it made him abhor kings, because superior to himself, it led him to detest those republicans who, by too near an approach, contaminated aristocratic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>; and it induced him, while yet undistinguished himself, and panting for literary fame, to decline a proffered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-INTRODUCTION\">introduction</a> to Metastasio and Rousseau. But as all his bad qualities were greatly softened by the cultivation of literature, it may be presumed, that a better education, and an earlier employment of his faculties, would have rendered him a much more perfect character. His application to study gradually tranquillized his temper, and softened his manners; leaving him, at the same time, in perfect possession of those good qualities which he had inherited from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>\u2014a warm and disinterested attachment to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> and friends, united to a generosity, vigour, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELEVATION\">elevation</a> of character, which rendered him not unworthy to embody in his dramas the actions and sentiments of Grecian heroes.\n\nTo these dramas Alfieri is chiefly indebted for the high reputation to which he has attained. Before his time, the Italian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, so harmonious in the Sonnets of Petrarch, and so energetic in the Commedia of Dante, had been invariably languid and prosaic in dramatic dialogue. The pedantic and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INANIMATE\">inanimate</a> tragedies of the sixteenth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a> were followed, during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> age of Italian literature, by dramas, of which extravagance in the sentiments, and improbability in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, were the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> characteristics. The prodigious success of the Merope of Maffei, which appeared in the commencement of the last century, may be attributed more to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> with such productions, than to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTRINSIC\">intrinsic</a> merit. In this degradation of tragic taste, the appearance of the tragedies of Alfieri was, perhaps, the most important literary event that had occurred in Italy during the eighteenth century. On these tragedies it is difficult to pronounce a judgment, as the taste and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of the author underwent considerable change and modification during the intervals which elapsed between the three periods of their publication. An excessive harshness of style, an asperity of sentiment, and total want of poetical ornament, are the characteristics of his four first tragedies, Filippo, Polinice, Antigone, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGINIA\">Virginia</a>. These faults were, in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, corrected in the six tragedies which he gave to the world some years after; and in those which he published along with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAUL\">Saul</a>, the drama which enjoyed the greatest success of all his productions\u2014a popularity, which may be partly attributed to the severe and unadorned manner of Alfieri being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> adapted to the patriarchal simplicity of the age in which the scene of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRAGEDY\">tragedy</a> is placed. But though there be a considerable difference in his dramas, there are certain observations applicable to them all. None of the plots are of his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>. They are founded either on mythological <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FABLE\">fable</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>; most of them had been previously treated by the Greek dramatists, or by Seneca. Rosmunda, the only one which could be supposed of his own contrivance, and which is certainly the least happy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EFFUSION\">effusion</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a>, is partly founded on the eighteenth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVEL\">novel</a> of the third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BANDELLO\">Bandello</a>, and partly on Prevost's M\u00e9moires d'un Homme de Qualit\u00e9. But whatever subjects he chooses, his dramas are always formed on the Grecian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODEL\">model</a>, and breathe a freedom and independence worthy an Athenian poet. Indeed, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGIS\">Agis</a> and Bruto may rather be considered oratorical declamations and dialogues on liberty than tragedies. The unities of time and place are not so scrupu-\npulously observed in his, as in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> dramas; but he has rigidly adhered to a unity of action and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>. He occupies his scene with one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> action, and one ruling passion, and removes from it every necessary event or feeling. In this excessive zeal for the observance of unity, he seems to have forgotten, that its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARM\">charm</a> consists in producing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> relation between multiplied feelings; and not in the bare <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXHIBITION\">exhibition</a> of one, divested of those various accompaniments which give <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a> to the whole.\n\nConsistently with that austere and simple manner which he considered the chief excellence of dramatic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>, he excluded from his scene all coups de th\u00e9\u00e2tre, all philosophical reflections, and that highly ornamented versification, which had been so assiduously cultivated by his predecessors. In his anxiety, however, to avoid all superfluous ornament, he has stripped his dramas of the embellishments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>; and for the harmony and flow of poetical language, he has substituted, even in his best performances, a style, which, though correct and pure, is generally harsh, elaborate, and abrupt\u2014often strained into unnatural energy, or condensed into factitious conciseness. The chief excellence of Alferi consists in powerful delineation of dramatic character. In his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a> II. he has represented, almost with the masterly touches of Tacitus, the sombre character, the dark mysterious counsels, the suspensa semper et obscura verba of the modern Tiberius. In Polinice the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> of the rival brothers are beautifully contrasted; in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARIA\">Maria</a> Stuarda, that unfortunate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> is represented unsuspicious, impatient of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a>, and violent in her attachments. In Mirraha, the character of Cynaras is perfect as a father and king, and Cenchris is a model of the virtues of a wife and mother. In the representation of that species of mental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALIENATION\">alienation</a> where the judgment has perished, but traces of character still remain, he is peculiarly happy. The insanity of Saul is skilfully managed; and the horrid joy of Orestes in killing Egishus rises finely and naturally to madness, in finding that, at the same time, he had inadvertently slain his mother.\n\nWhatever may be the merits or defects of Alferi, he may be considered as the founder of a new school in the Italian drama. His country hailed him as her sole tragic poet, and his successors in the same path of literature have regarded his bold, austere, and rapid manner, as the genuine model of tragic composition.\n\nBesides his tragedies, Alferi published during his life many sonnets, five odes on American independence, and the poem of Etruria, founded on the assassination of Alexander I. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">Duke</a> of Florence. Of his prose works, the most distinguished for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANIMATION\">animation</a> and eloquence is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PANEGYRIC\">Panegyric</a> on Trajan, composed in a transport of indignation at the supposed feebleness of Pliny's eulogium. The two books, entitled La Tirannide and the Essays on Literature and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">Government</a>, are remarkable for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEGANCE\">elegance</a> and vigour of style, but are too evidently imitations of the manner of Machiavel. His Antigallicus, which was written at the same time with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">Defence</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> XVI., comprehends a historical and satirical view of the French revolution. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POSTHUMOUS\">posthumous</a> works of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-AL\">Al</a>-\n\nfieri consist of satires, six <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> comedies, and the Memoirs of his Life\u2014a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> always be read with interest, in spite of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> and languid gravity with which he delineates the most interesting adventures and the strongest passions of his agitated life.

In some accounts of Alhazen, we find it said, that he lived in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>; but it appears from Casiri, (Bibl.

It also appears, that he was invited to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> by one of the Fatemite Caliphs; and that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> was, some boasts which he had made of being able to obviate the evils attendant upon the overflowing, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as the decrease of the waters of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NILE\">Nile</a>. He surveyed the country with a view to this project, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-AID\">aid</a> which, every thing that he asked was liberally furnished by the Caliph; but finding that his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> had seduced him into a wild and impracticable scheme, he feigned madness, thereby to avoid the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> which he dreaded; and he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to play this humiliating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> till the Caliph's death relieved him from his apprehensions.\n\nBut whatever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> he may have made as a projector, there can be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> doubt that he was a skilful geometrician; and that his name deserves a conspicuous place among the improvers of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPTICS\">optics</a>.

He refuted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> philosophers, that vision was produced by rays emitted from the eye.

At a very early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> he showed such marks of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> as attracted the notice of some gentlemen living in the neighbourhood. In a remote <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, and deprived of the ordinary means of indulging his propensity to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a>, he took himself, when a boy, to such implements and materials as he could readily procure; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> skill and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> which, in particular, he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> in using his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a>, have been mentioned as remarkable for his years. Mr Stewart, then Collector of the Customs at Alloa, having mentioned these proofs of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a> to Mr Fowlis the Painter, who sometime before had instituted an Academy in Glasgow, for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a> and engraving, invited young Allan to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> under his care. Here he remained about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> years, studying the elementary principles of his art; and by the proficiency which he attained, justified the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of his talents, which had procured him admission to that ill-fated seminary. But, although, the public taste for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-FINE_ARTS\">fine arts</a>, which then existed in Scotland, was so feeble as to leave his preceptor without that support which his liberal and spirited efforts justly claimed, Allan, on leaving the academy, had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOOD_FORTUNE\">good fortune</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRONAGE\">patronage</a> of individuals, whose generosity enabled him to prosecute his views, and to improve his taste, by studying the works of art abroad. At the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> expense of several persons of fortune, particularly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Cathcart and Mr Abercrombie of Tullibody, he was enabled to go to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>; and at Rome he devoted himself with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> zeal to his profession. Here he remained for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> less a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> than sixteen years, during which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, his subsistence chiefly depended on the copies which he made from the most celebrated pictures of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> masters; but one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> which he then painted, does the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> to his talents, namely, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> representing the Origin of Painting. On this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a>, indeed, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> of Mr Allan, as a historical painter, chiefly rests; and its merit was rewarded, by his receiving the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> medal given by the Academy of St Luke, in the year 1773, for the best specimen of historical composition. There is an excellent engraving of this piece by Cunego.\n\nOn his return to his native country, he took up his residence in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, where he was appointed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of the Academy established by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-TRUSTEES\">Trustees</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">Manufactures</a> in Scotland. There he executed a great variety of works, of various degrees of merit; but perhaps none such as might have been expected from the author of the Origin of Painting. Those, indeed, by which he is most known, are of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> altogether different, being remarkable for the comic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a> which they display. The Scotch wedding; the Highland dance; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REPENTANCE\">Repentance</a>-stool, with his Illustrations of the Gentle Shepherd, are all of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a>, and so generally known, as to need no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>. Four pictures representing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARNIVAL\">Carnival</a>, are said to have been very successful. Of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAVER\">graver</a> compositions, the Prodigal Son, in possession of Lord Cathcart, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERCULES\">Hercules</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OMPHALE\">Omphale</a>, in the possession of Mr Erskine of Mar, are regarded as works of great merit.\n\nAs an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a>, Mr Allan possessed much facility of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>; with a keen discernment of those evanescent circumstances in the outward form, which mark the different shades of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> and affection in the mind. With the talent of artfully arranging the various parts of a crowded and bustling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a>,\u2014such as appears in some of his comic productions, he possessed that feeling for simplicity, which gives to his graver compositions, a classical and antique <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEGANCE\">elegance</a>. In his drawing he often was hasty and incorrect. He executed a great variety of etchings and drawings in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, which are valuable, on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of their excellent humour; and the great knowledge of national character which they express. Many of the original plates and drawings are now in the possession of Mr George Thomson, to whose kindness and friendship their author was much indebted. We do not know that Allan left any pupil who has followed his particular line in painting. Mr H. W. Williams received from him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> of art, but his genius has directed him to a different course, which has conducted him to merited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMINENCE\">eminence</a> as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANDSCAPE\">landscape</a> painter.\n\nMr Allan is remembered and spoken of as an excellent private character. He died at Edinburgh on the 6th of August 1796, in the 53rd year of his age. (n.)","sp":474,"ep":474},{"h":"ALUM","t":"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> very much employed by Dyers and other artists, in their different processes.

Its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-SPECIFIC_GRAVITY\"><a class=\"xref\" </a>href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIFIC\">specific</a> gravity is 1.731, according to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> of the experiments of Fahrenheit, Wallerius, Watson, and Hassenfratz. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">Water</a> at the temperature of 60\u00b0 dissolves about one fifteenth of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of alum; while <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> water dissolves about three-fourths of its weight. When alum is exposed to a dry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>, it effloresces slightly. When heated, it speedily becomes liquid. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>, its water is driven off, and it loses about 44 per cent. of its weight. What remains, is a vitreous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> substance, known by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of burnt alum. When alum is exposed to a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> heat, it gives off a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OXYGEN\">oxygen</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAS\">gas</a>, as Dr Milner first ascertained. The same fact was afterwards pointed out by Gay-Lussac.\n\nAlum is one of those substances which chemists have distinguished by the name of triple salts. It is composed of sulphuric acid, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POTASH\">potash</a>, alumina and water. That it contained sulphuric acid as a constituent, was known even to the Alchemists. Pott and Margraaf demonstrated, that alumina was another constituent. Mr Pott, in his Lithogeognosia, showed\nthat the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> of alum, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> the precipitate obtained when an alkali is poured into a solution of alum, is quite different from lime and chalk, with which it had been confounded by Stahl. Margraaf went much farther. He not only showed that alumina is one of the constituents of alum; but that this earth possesses peculiar properties, is different from every other substance, and is one of the ingredients in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> clay. (Experiences faites sur la terre d'alun. Margraaf's Opusc. II. 111.) Margraaf showed likewise, by many experiments, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CRYSTALS\">crystals</a> of alum cannot be obtained by dissolving alumina in sulphuric acid, and evaporating the solutions. The crystals formed are always soft, and quite different in their appearance from alum crystals. But, when a solution of potash or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMMONIA\">ammonia</a> is dropped into this liquid, it immediately deposits <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> crystals of alum. (Sur la <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGENERATION\">regeneration</a> de l'alun. Margraaf's Opusc. II. 86.) He mentions likewise, that manufacturers of alum, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a>, were unable to procure the salt without a similar addition; and that at first, it had been customary to add a quantity of putrid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-URINE\">urine</a>, and that afterwards a solution of carbonate of potash was substituted in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>. But subsequent chemists do not seem to have paid much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to these important observations of Margraaf; they still continued, without any rigid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>, to consider alum as a sulphate of alumina.\n\nBergman indeed had observed, that the addition of potash or ammonia made the alum crystallize; but that the same effect was not produced by the addition of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SODA\">soda</a> or of lime, (De confectione aluminis. Bergman's Opusc. I. 225.) He had observed likewise, that sulphate of potash is frequently found in alum. He decomposed the solution of alum by means of ammonia, evaporated the filtered liquid to dryness, and exposed the residue to a red heat. A quantity of sulphate of potash often remained behind in the crucible, (Ibid. p. 326.) He drew, as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONCLUSION\">conclusion</a> from these facts, that sulphate of potash readily combines with sulphate of alumina. Yet, it is obvious from the whole of his dissertation, that he had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> that alum is a triple salt. He ascribed the difficulty of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CRYSTALLIZATION\">crystallization</a>, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a> of sulphuric acid present. He thought that the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of the potash was to saturate this excess; and advises manufacturers to substitute clay instead of potash, as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> which would not only saturate the excess of acid, but increase the quantity of alum. This very bad advice was not, we presume, followed by any alum makers. If they tried it, they would soon be convinced of its injurious consequences. Instead of alum, they would have obtained an insoluble tasteless powder, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> known by the name of alum saturated with its earth.\n\nAfter Klaproth had discovered the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> of potash as an ingredient in leucite and lepidolite, it occurred to Vauquelin, that it was probably an ingredient likewise in many other minerals. He collected that alum crystals often make their appearance during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a> of stony bodies; and, considering that alum cannot be obtained in crystals without the addition of potash, he began to suspect that this alkali constituted an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> ingredient in the salt. A set of experiments undertaken <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> purpose to elucidate this important point, soon satisfied him that his conjecture was well founded. Accordingly, in the year 1797, he published a dissertation, demonstrating that alum is a triple salt, composed of sulphuric acid, alumina and potash. (Annales de Chimie, XXII. 258.) Soon after, Chaptal published the analysis of four different kinds of alum, namely, Roman alum, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEVANT\">Levant</a> alum, British alum, and alum manufactured by himself. This analysis led to the same result as that of Vauquelin. (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANN\">Ann</a>. de Chim. XXII. 280.)\n\nSince that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, alum has been admitted by chemists to be a triple salt; and various analyses of it have been made to determine its constituents. Vauquelin, (Ann. de Chim. I. 167), Thenard and Roard, (Ibid. Tom. LIX. 72), Curandou, (Journal de Physique, LXVII. 1.) and Berzelius, (Ann. de Chim. LXXXII. 258.) successively published the results of their experiments. They differ but little from each other. We shall therefore satisfy ourselves with giving the analysis of Berzelius, which is the latest, and in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> the most accurate. His result was as follows:\n\n| Substance          | Weight |\n|--------------------|--------|\n| Sulphuric acid     | 34.23  |\n| Alumina            | 10.86  |\n| Potash             | 9.81   |\n| Water              | 45.00  |\n| Loss               | 0.10   |\n| **Total**          | **100.00** |\n\nOr\n\n| Substance          | Weight |\n|--------------------|--------|\n| Sulphate of alumina| 36.85  |\n| Sulphate of potash | 18.15  |\n| Water              | 45.00  |\n| **Total**          | **100.00** |\n\nNow, as we shall show in a subsequent article, (See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-ATOMIC_PHILOSOPHY\">Atomic <a class=\"</a>xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>), an integrant particle of sulphuric acid weighs 5, an integrant particle of alumina 2.136, and an integrant particle of potash 6. We shall show likewise in the same article, that sulphate of potash is composed of one integrant particle of sulphuric acid, united with one integrant particle of potash; and sulphate of alumina of one integrant particle of sulphuric acid, united to one integrant particle of alumina; therefore, the relative weight of an integrant particle of each of these salts, is as follows:\n\n| Substance          | Weight |\n|--------------------|--------|\n| Sulphate of potash | 11.000 |\n| Sulphate of alumina| 7.136  |\n\nBut the quantities of each of these salts in alum, according to the preceding analysis, are as the numbers 18.15 : 36.85. Now, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a> 18.15 : 36.85, is very nearly the same as 11 : 7.136 \u00d7 5. Hence it follows, that alum contains 1 integrant particle of sulphate of potash, and 5 integrant particles of sulphate of alumina. An integrant particle of water, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be shown likewise in the article Atomic philosophy, weighs 1.132. Now, one integrant particle of sulphate of potash, \u00d7 5 integrant particles of sulphate of alumina, weigh 46.680. But alum con-\ntains 45 per cent. of water. To find how many integrant particles of water these amount to, we have this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a>; \\( \\frac{56}{45} : \\frac{46,680}{38,213} \\). Now, 38,213, is very nearly the weight of 34 integrant particles of water. For \\( 1.132 \\times 34 = 38,488 \\).\n\nHence, it follows, that alum is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> of\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEXT\">text</a>{Sulphate of potash} & - 1 \\text{ integrant particle.} \\\\\n\\text{Sulphate of alumina} & - 5 \\\\\n\\text{Water} & - 34 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTotal 40\n\nMaking altogether no fewer than 40 integrant particles united together. It is not easy to see how these 40 particles, by their symmetrical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNION\">union</a> with each other, can form a tetrahedron, which Haury conceives to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIMITIVE\">primitive</a> form of the integrant particle of alum. The octahedron is a much more probable primitive form. It might be conceived to be formed by the six integrant particles of sulphate of potash, and sulphate of alumina, and the thirty four particles of water, which are probably much smaller, may fill up the intervals between them. The objection to this supposition is, that in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> the atom of sulphate of potash cannot be surrounded by the atoms of sulphate of alumina, as one would naturally expect, from their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> for each other. The most probable supposition of the arrangement of the integrant particles of alum is, that the atom of sulphate of potash occupies the centre; that it is surrounded at equal distances by the five atoms of sulphate of alumina, each surrounded by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> atoms of water. But, we do not readily see how such an arrangement would either form a tetrahedron or octahedron. This symmetrical arrangement of the different integrant particles that compose a crystal deserves to be studied with care, because it is probable, that it will throw <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of affinity, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> in which atoms combine together.\n\nThe word alumen, which we translate alum, occurs in Pliny's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">Natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a>. In the 15th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> of his 35th book, he gives us a detailed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of it. By comparing this with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of \u1f00\u03bb\u03cd\u03c4\u03c1\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 given by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIOSCORIDES\">Dioscorides</a> in the 123d chapter of his 5th book, it becomes quite obvious, that he alludes to the same substance. Hence it follows, that \u1f00\u03bb\u03cd\u03c4\u03c1\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 is the Greek name for alumen. Pliny informs us, that alumen was found naturally in the earth. He calls it salugatoriae. Different substances he informs us, were distinguished by the name of alumen; but they were all characterized by a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of astrin gency, and were all employed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DYEING\">dyeing</a> and in medicine. The light-coloured alumen was useful in brilliant dyes; the dark-coloured only in dyeing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>, or very dark colours. One <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of alumen was a liquid, which was apt to be adulterated; but, when pure, it had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of striking a black with the juice of the pomegranate. This property seems to characterize a solution of sulphate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> in water. It is quite obvious, that a solution of our alum would possess no such property. Pliny says, that there is another kind of alum which the Greeks <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CALL\">call</a> schistos. It forms in white threads upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a> of certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>. From the name, schistos, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of formation, there can be little doubt, that this species was the salt which forms spontaneously on certain slaty minerals,\u2014as alum slate and bituminous shale, and which consists chiefly of sulphate of iron and sulphate of alumina. Possibly in certain places the sulphate of iron may have been nearly wanting; and then the salt would be white, and would answer, as Pliny says it did, for dyeing bright colours. Several other species of alumen are described by Pliny, but we are unable to make out to what minerals he alludes.\n\nThe alumen of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>, then, was not the same with the alum of the moderns. It was most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> a sulphate of iron, sometimes probably a sulphate of alumina, and usually a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> of the two. But the ancients were unacquainted with our alum. They were acquainted with sulphate of iron in a crystallized state, and distinguished it by the names of misty, sory, chalcanthum, (Plini, xxxiv. 12.) As alum or green <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VITRIOL\">vitriol</a> were applied to a variety of purposes in common, and as both are distinguished by a sweetish and astringent taste, writers, even after the discovery of alum, do not seem to have discriminated the two salts accurately from each other. In the writings of the Alchemists we find the words misty, sory, chalcanthum, applied to the alum as well as sulphate of iron, and the name atramentum sutorium, which ought to belong (one would suppose) exclusively to green vitriol, applied indifferently to both.\n\nWhen our alum was discovered is entirely unknown. Beckman devoted a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of time to trace the history of this salt, and published a curious dissertation on the subject. But his attempts to trace its origin were unsuccessful. The manufacture of it was discovered in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EAST\">East</a>; but at what time or place is totally unknown. It would appear, that about four or five hundred years ago, there was a manufactory of it at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol8.html#article-EDESSA\">Edessa</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYRIA\">Syria</a>, at that time called Rocca. Hence, it is supposed, the origin of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> Rock alum, commonly employed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>; though there are others that pretend that the term originated at Civita Vecchia, where alum is made from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> mineral in the state of a hard rock.\n\nDifferent alum works existed in the neighbourhood of Constantinople. About the time of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> of the Grecian empire, the art of making alum was transported into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, at that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> the richest and most manufacturing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> in Europe. Bartholomew Pernix, a Genoese merchant, discovered alum ore in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISCHIA\">Ischia</a>, about the year 1459. Nearly at the same time, John di Castro, who was well acquainted with the alum works in the neighbourhood of Constantinople, suspected that a mineral fit for yielding alum existed at Tolfa, because it was covered with the same trees that grew on the alum mineral near Constantinople. His conjecture was verified by trials, and the celebrated manufactory at Tolfa established. Another was begun in the neighbourhood of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENOA\">Genoa</a>, and the manufactory flourished in different parts of Italy. To this country, it was confined for the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>. Various manufactories of it were established in Germany, by the year 1544. In the time of Agricola, there was a manufactory of it at Commoton in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOHEMIA\">Bohemia</a>. About the same time,\nan alum <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> was established near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARTHAGENA\">Carthagena</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, at Alcmaron.\n\nEngland possessed no alum works till the reign of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> I. Thomas Chaloner, Esq., son of Dr Chaloner, who had been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TUTOR\">tutor</a> to Charles, while hunting on a common in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORKSHIRE\">Yorkshire</a>, took notice of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERBAGE\">herbage</a>, and tasted the water. He found them similar to what he had seen in Germany, where alum works were established. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of this, he got a patent from Charles for an alum work. This manufactory was worth two thousand a-year, or perhaps more. But some of the Courtiers thinking this too much for him; prevailed with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">King</a>, notwithstanding the patent, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> a moiety of it to another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a>. This was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> why Mr Chaloner was such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARTISAN\">partisan</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a>, and such an enemy of the King, that, at the end of the civil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, he was one of those who sat in judgment upon his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJESTY\">Majesty</a> and condemned him.* Since that time, various alum works have been established in different parts of England and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a>. But none at present exist, except the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITBY\">Whitby</a> works, originally established by Mr Chaloner, and two works at the Hurlet and Campsie, both in the neighbourhood of Glasgow.\n\nSeveral alum works likewise exist in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a>, particularly in West Gothland. There is one for example at Hanseter, near the borders of the Wene lake, on the west side of the mountain called Kinnekulle. But, for a description of the Swedish works, we refer to Bergman's Opuscula, Vol. I. p. 284, or the English translation, Vol. I. p. 342. We do not know if any alum works exist in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLAND\">Poland</a> or Russia; but, as the greatest part of these extensive countries consists of alluvial soil to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> depth, it is probable, that little alum ore will be found in them.\n\nVarious minerals are employed in the manufacture of alum; but by far the most important of them are the following three: alum <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, alum slate, bituminous shale.\n\nAlum stone is the mineral which occurs at Tolfa, near Rome, from which the celebrated Roman alum is made. Werner also possesses specimens of the same mineral from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUNGARY\">Hungary</a>. At Tolfa, it is said to constitute a hill. Its colour is greyish white, sometimes yellowish grey, and sometimes, as Gay Lussac informs us (Ann. de Chim. LV. 267.) reddish from the peroxide of iron. It is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASSIVE\">massive</a> and rather hard. It has no lustre. It is translucent on the edges. Fractures uneven, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a> to the fine earthy. Fragments blunt edged. Does not adhere to the tongue. It is rather heavy; but its specific gravity is not accurately known. This mineral, according to the analysis of Klaproth (Gehlen's Neue Allgemeine Journal der Chemie, VI. 35.) is composed of the following constituents:\n\n| Silica | 56.5 |\n|--------|------|\n| Alumina| 19.0 |\n| Sulphuric Acid | 16.5 |\n| Potash | 4.0 |\n\nVauquelin likewise analyzed this mineral, and found the same constituents, though in different proportions. We have no analysis of the varieties of alum stone which contain peroxide of iron. Thus it appears, that alum stone contains all the ingredients of alum ready formed.\n\nAlum slate is a much more abundant mineral than alum stone. It is said to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> with primitive clay slate. It occurs abundantly along with transition slate; and there can be little doubt that it occurs likewise in the flint formations. In West Gothland in Sweden, it constitutes a part of different hills; as Kinnekulle, Hunneberg, and Halleberg; in all of which it appears to alternate with flint trap rocks. It occurs likewise abundantly in Whitby in Yorkshire. We have never ourselves been upon the spot; but, from the general structure of Yorkshire, and the neighbouring counties, indeed of the whole east <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of England, there can be very little doubt that, in this position, it is also a flint rock.\n\nAlum slate, as the name implies, is a slaty rock, though sometimes it occurs in balls. The colour is blueish-black, with a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a> of grey. Fracture straight slaty. Fragments tabular. Its internal lustre is glimmering. It retains its colour in the streak; but acquires more lustre. Soft. Not particularly brittle. When exposed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> it effloresces, and acquires an aluminous taste.\n\nThis mineral has never been accurately analyzed. But there can be no doubt that it contains silica, alumina, iron, sulphur, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARCOAL\">charcoal</a>, and often likewise potash. Probably this was the mineral upon which the alum scissile of the ancients was found.\n\nBituminous shale, the brandschiefer of the Germans, is a slaty mineral, which almost constantly accompanies beds of coal; and, accordingly, is very common in Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>. Its colour is brownish-black. Its fracture is thin slaty. Fragments tabular. Internal lustre glimmering; but the colour is not altered. Very soft. Rather sectile. Feels rather greasy. Easily frangible. When heated, it burns with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> and sulphureous odour, and becomes white. It has never been accurately analyzed; but it is probably nothing more than slate clay, which occurs so abundantly in the independent coal formation, impregnated with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of coal. Its other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> constituents must be silica, alumina, and iron <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYRITES\">pyrites</a>.\n\nSlate clay itself, at least not sufficiently impregnated with coaly matter to deserve the name of bituminous shale, is frequently employed in the making of alum. This is the case in the neighbourhood of Glasgow.\n\nFour different processes are employed by the alum manufacturers, according to the nature of the mineral from which the alum is to be extracted.\n\n---\n\n* Letters written by Eminent Persons, in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries; and Lives of Eminent Men, by John Aubrey, Esq.; Vol. II. p. 281.\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> employed at Tofia is the simplest of all. If the Tofia stone be kept constantly moistened with water for about two months, it falls to powder of itself, and yields alum by elixivation. But this is not the process employed by the manufacturers. The alum stone is broken into small pieces, and piled on the top of a perforated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOME\">dome</a>, in which a wood fire is kindled. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a> and flame of the wood penetrate through the pieces of alum stone, and a sulphurous odour is disengaged, owing to the decomposition of a portion of the sulphuric acid in the stone. This roasting is twice repeated; the pieces of ore which, the first time, were at the edge of the dome, being the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> time put in the middle. The process of roasting this stone requires considerable attention. If the heat be too great, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of yielding alum is destroyed. If the heat be too small, the stone does not readily fall to powder. There can be little doubt that the unroasted stone would yield more alum than the roasted; but probably the additional labour requisite in the latter case would more than swallow up the increase of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRODUCT\">product</a>.\n\nThe roasted stone, which has now acquired a reddish colour, is placed in rows between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRENCHES\">trenches</a> filled with water. This liquid is so frequently sprinkled on it, that the stone is always moist. In two or three days it falls to powder, like slackened quicklime; but the daily watering is continued for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>. The success of this part of the operation is said to depend very much on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>. When the weather is rainy, the alum is all washed out, and little or nothing left for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANUFACTURER\">manufacturer</a> to extract. In such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, it is obvious that the alum stone should be covered by a shade from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a>.\n\nWhen the stone has by this process been reduced to a sufficiently fine powder, it is thrown into a leaden boiler, filled two-thirds with water. During the boiling, the powder is frequently stirred up, and the water that evaporates is replaced. When the boiling has been continued for a sufficient time, the fire is withdrawn, and time allowed for the earthy matter to subside to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a>. A cock is then opened, which allows the clear liquor to flow out into deep wooden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> vessels, so made that they can be easily taken to pieces. Here the alum gradually crystallizes, and attaches itself to the sides and bottom of the vessel. The mother liquor is now drawn off into shallower wooden troughs, where more alum crystals are deposited. The liquid has now a red colour, and is muddy; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> alum crystals are mixed with this red matter. They are washed clean in the mother liquor, which is finally pumped into a trough, and used in subsequent processes.\n\nThe alum obtained at Tofia is the purest of all. It is known by the name of Roman alum, and is in very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> estimation. It is always mixed with a little reddish powdery matter, which is easily separated from it. What this red matter is, has not been ascertained; but it is not peroxide of iron. To the eye it has very much the appearance of a vegetable matter. We have some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> that it is added artificially by the sellers of Roman alum. Probably Roman alum at first had a red tinge, in consequence of the red matter in the mother liquor remaining partially attached to it. The goodness of the alum may have given the purchasers a partiality to the red colour, and induced the sellers to add a red powder artificially. We have never had an opportunity ourselves of examining this matter; but have been informed by those that have, that it contains no iron.\n\nIt is not improbable that this process would be improved by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRINDING\">grinding</a> the Tofia stone to a fine powder in a mill, without any previous roasting, and then keeping the powder moistened with water for a considerable time. If the residual earth, after the alum is extracted, be boiled with sulphuric acid, the liquid yields alum crystals by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a>. This is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a> that neither the alumina nor the potash is exhausted, and that the sulphuric acid, driven off by the roasting, is so much alum lost to the manufacturer. Indeed, the quantity of sulphuric acid in the alum stone is not sufficient to occupy the whole of the potash in the formation of alum. It would be necessary to add about one-tenth of the weight of the alum stone of sulphuric acid, if it were wanted to employ the whole potash present in the stone. The consequence of this addition (supposing no loss) would be an additional quantity of alum, amounting to rather more than one-fifth of the weight of the alum stone employed.\n\nAlum slate being very different in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>, requires a different treatment to fit it for yielding alum. If the alum slate contain a notable quantity of lime or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNESIA\">magnesia</a>, it does not answer the purposes of the manufacturer so well. Indeed, the proportion of lime present may be conceived to be such, that no alum would be obtained whatever. As alum slate has never been subjected to accurate analysis, we do not know in what proportion these two earths exist in it, or whether they may not, in many cases, be absent altogether. The essential ingredients in alum slate for the alum-makers are alumina and iron pyrites.\n\nThe first process is to roast the ore. In Sweden, where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a> is wood, and consequently expensive, it is customary to use the alum slate itself as fuel for roasting the ore. For this purpose, a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LAYER\">layer</a> of brushwood is covered with pieces of alum slate, and set on fire; and, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMBUSTION\">combustion</a> proceeds, new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAYERS\">layers</a> of alum slate are added. It is usual to place alternate layers of roasted and unroasted alum slate. The combustion continues for a month or six weeks. At Whitby, coal is employed for roasting the alum slate. Indeed, the alum slate of Whitby is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a> coloured than that of Sweden, and probably would not burn of itself. So great is the quantity of combustible matter in the Swedish alum slate, that it is employed as fuel for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">limestone</a>. Great quantities of limestone are burnt in this manner at Humeberg, near the south side of the lake Wener. The roasted ore has usually a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> colour. When it is red, the quantity of alum which it yields is considerably diminished.\n\nBy this roasting the pyrites is decomposed. The sulphur is converted into sulphuric acid, while the iron is oxidized. In what manner this change is produced it is not easy to say. Indeed, it does not seem certain that pyrites is a constant ingredient in alum slate. We have never been able to detect any, by the eye, in any specimens of Whitby alum slate which we have examined. At Hansacter in Sweden, no sulphate of iron crystallizes when the liquid is\nevaporated; yet, if pyrites had been present, it is difficult to see any reason that should prevent this salt from being formed. Hence it is probable, that, in alum slate, the sulphur is sometimes at least combined with other substances than iron. It must always be in a state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a>; for, if it were in a loose state, it would be driven off by the roasting. This point deserves to be elucidated, by analyzing different varieties of alum slate.\n\nThe roasted ore has an astringent taste, owing to the sulphate of iron and sulphate of alumina which it contains. The next process is to lixiviate it with water, in order to dissolve out these salts. For this purpose, it is put into reservoirs made of wood or masonry; with a stop-cock at the bottom to draw off the water. The usual method is to keep the water for twelve <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a> in contact with ore that has been twice lixiviated; then to draw it off, and allow it to remain for an equal period on ore that has been once lixiviated. Lastly, it is run upon fresh ore, and allowed to remain on it for twelve hours longer. If the specific gravity of the liquid thus treated be 1.25, at the temperature of 55\u00b0, it may be considered as saturated with sulphate of alumina and sulphate of iron. But we presume that this specific gravity is not often obtained.\n\nThe liquid, thus impregnated with salt, is now boiled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> in leaden vessels to the proper consistency for crystallization. In Sweden, the fuel employed for this purpose is alum slate. By this means, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> effect is produced. The liquid is evaporated, and the alum slate is roasted. During the boiling, abundance of oxide of iron falls mixed with gelinite, if lime be one of the constituents of the alum slate. When the liquid is sufficiently concentrated, it is let into a square reservoir, in order to crystallize. Great quantities of sulphate of iron crystals are usually deposited in this vessel. These are collected by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> the liquid off into another reservoir. When all the sulphate of iron that can be obtained has been separated, a quantity of sulphate of potash, muriate of potash, or putrid urine, is mixed with the liquid. The sulphate of potash is procured from the sulphuric acid-makers, and the muriate of potash from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOAP\">soap</a>-makers. By this addition, alum is formed in the liquid, and it gradually deposits itself in crystals on the sides of the vessel. These crystals are collected, and dissolved in the smallest quantity of boiling water that will take them up. This solution is poured into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> wooden casks. In a fortnight or three weeks the alum crystallizes, and covers the sides and bottom of the cask. The hoops are now taken off, and the staves of the cask removed. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of alum crystals, having the shape of the cask, remains. This mass is pierced, the mother liquor allowed to run out, and preserved for a subsequent process. The alum, being now broken in pieces, is fit for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a>.\n\nThe manufacture of alum from bituminous shale, and slate clay, bears a considerable resemblance to the manufacture from alum slate; but differs in several particulars. There are two works of this kind in the neighbourhood of Glasgow, managed with great skill, and excellent in every respect. We shall give a sketch of the processes followed in these works.\n\nThe bituminous shale and slate clay employed, are obtained from old coal pits, which are very extensive in the neighbourhood of Glasgow. The air in these coal-pits is moist, and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> temperature about 62\u00b0. The shale, having been exposed for many years, has gradually opened in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of its slaty fracture, so as to resemble in some respects a half-shut <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAN\">fan</a>, and all the chunks in it are filled with a saline <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EFFLORESCENCE\">efflorescence</a> in threads. This salt is white, with a shade of green; has a sweetish astringent taste, and consists of a mixture of sulphate of iron and sulphate of alumina. Nothing more is requisite than to lixiviate this shale with water, in order to obtain these salts in a state of solution. The lixiviated ore being left exposed to the weather, forms more salt, which is gradually washed out of it by the rain water, and this water is collected and preserved for use.\n\nThe next step in the process, is to boil down the liquid to a sufficient state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCENTRATION\">concentration</a>. At Campsie, all these boilers are composed of stone, and the heat applied by means of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEAM\">steam</a>. This is a great saving, as leaden vessels are not only much more expensive, but require more frequent renewal. When the liquid is raised to a sufficiently high temperature in the stone reservoir, pounded sulphate of potash, or muriate of potash, as they can be procured, is mixed with it, and there is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGITATOR\">agitator</a> in the vessel by which it is continually stirred about. This addition converts the sulphate of alumina into alum. The liquid is now let into another trough, and allowed to remain till it crystallizes. There are two salts contained in solution in this liquid, namely, sulphate of iron and alum; and it is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of great consequence to separate them completely from each other. The principal secret consists in drawing off the mother liquor at the proper time; for the alum is much less soluble in water than the sulphate of iron, and therefore crystallizes first. The first crystals of alum formed, are very impure. They have a yellow colour, and seem to be partly impregnated with sulphate of iron. They are dissolved in hot water, and the solution poured into troughs, and allowed to crystallize a second time. These second crystals, though much purer, are not quite free from sulphate of iron; but the separation is accomplished by washing them repeatedly with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> water; for sulphate of iron is much more soluble in that liquid than alum. These second crystals are now dissolved in as small a quantity of hot water as possible, and the concentrated liquid poured while hot into large casks, the surface of which is covered with two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> beams. As the liquor cools, a vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of alum crystals form on the sides and surface. The casks are allowed to remain, till the liquid within is supposed to be nearly of the temperature of the atmosphere. This, in winter, requires eleven days; in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, fourteen or more. We have seen the liquid in a cask that had stood eleven days in summer, still more than blood-hot. The hoops are then removed, precisely as in the manufacture of alum from alum slate.\n\nThere always remains in the boilers a yellowish substance, consisting chiefly of peroxide of iron. This is exposed to a strong heat in a reverberatory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FURNACE\">furnace</a>, and it becomes red. In this state it is washed, and yields more alum. The red residue is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>\nto a fine powder and dried. It then answers all the purposes of Venetian red, as a pigment. By altering the temperature to which this matter is exposed, a yellow ochre is obtained instead of a red.\n\nIn France, where alum ores are by no means abundant, alum is manufactured from clay. This method of making the salt, was first put in practice by Chaptal, when Professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">chemistry</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONTPELLIER\">Montpellier</a>. His methods have been since gradually improved, and brought to a state of considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a>. The first process tried was this: the clay was reduced to a fine powder in a mill, and then mixed with sulphuric acid. After remaining some days, it was exposed for twenty-four hours to a temperature of about 130\u00b0. It was then lixiviated, and the liquid mixed with urine or potash. This method being found inconvenient, was abandoned for the following: the clay being well ground, was mixed with half its weight of the saline residue, from a mixture of sulphur and nitre. This residue is little else than sulphate of potash. The mixture was formed into balls about five inches in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a>, which were calcined in a potter's furnace. They were then placed on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a> of a chamber, in which sulphuric acid was made. The acid vapour caused them to swell, and to open on all sides. In about a month, they were sufficiently penetrated with the acid. They were then exposed to the air, under shades, that the saturation might become more complete. Finally, they were lixiviated, and the liquid being evaporated, yielded pure alum.\n\nThis process has been considerably improved by Berard, the present proprietor of the Montpellier alum work. Instead of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> the calcined balls to the fumes of sulphuric acid, he sprinkles them with a quantity of sulphuric acid of the specific gravity 1.367, equal to the weight of the clay employed. But it is obvious, that the proportion must vary with the nature of the clay. The solution takes place with the greatest facility, and crystals of alum are obtained by evaporating the liquid.\n\nAnother process was put in practice by Chaptal in the neighbourhood of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, and is still followed, or was at least followed some years ago by M. Bouvier. A mixture is made of 100 parts of clay, 50 parts of nitro, and 50 parts of sulphuric acid of the specific gravity 1.367; and this mixture is put into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RETORT\">retort</a>, and distilled. Aquafortis comes over, and the residue in the retort being lixiviated with water, yields abundance of excellent alum.\n\nWe may mention another process described by Caraudan, and certainly practicable, and even easy, though we do not believe that it would be attended with profit. He forms 100 parts of clay into a paste with water, holding 5 parts of common salt in solution. This paste is formed into cakes, and calcined in a reverberatory furnace. The calcined mass is reduced to powder, and well mixed with the fourth part of its weight of concentrated sulphuric acid. When the muriatic acid vapours are dissipated, as much water is added as there had been employed of acid, and the mass is kneaded with care. A strong heat is produced; the composition swells; more water is added; and at last a solution of potash, in which the alkali amounts to one fourth of the acid employed. The liquor is now drawn off, and, on cooling, it yields a copious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEPOSIT\">deposit</a> of alum crystals.\n\nIn the preceding sketch of the manufacture of alum, no notice has been taken of alum earth as an alum ore, because the writer of this article has never had an opportunity of seeing any manufactory of the salt from this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-MATERIAL\">material</a>. We conceive the process to be nearly the same as that followed, when bituminous shale or slate clay is the alum ore. Alum earth seems to be a vegetable substance, or rather to be derived from the vegetable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>. It is connected with coal, and may, without impropriety, be considered as a variety of brown coal. There is a manufacture of alum from this substance at Frienwalde, in Germany. Klaproth subjected this variety of alum earth to analysis, and from 1000 parts of it obtained the following constituents:\n\n| Substance          | Percentage |\n|--------------------|------------|\n| Sulphur            | 28.5       |\n| Charcoal           | 196.5      |\n| Alumina            | 160.0      |\n| Silica             | 400.0      |\n| Black oxide of iron| 64.0       |\n| Sulphate of iron   | 18.0       |\n| Gypsum             | 15.0       |\n| Magnesia           | 5.0        |\n| Sulphate of potash | 15.0       |\n| Muriate of potash  | 5.0        |\n| Water              | 107.5      |\n\nThe excess of one and a half per cent. obviously proceeded from the water adhering to the salts. (J.)\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBOYNA\">AMBOYNA</a>. The reader will find some interesting particulars regarding the history of this celebrated island in the body of the work. Its great importance, as the centre of the Clove-trade, renders it necessary that we should here enter into some further details. It is divided into two unequal parts, by two deep bays, which are separated only by a narrow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISTHMUS\">isthmus</a> of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> across. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a> on the west side extends to about two thirds of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> of the island, and forms a commodious and safe harbour. That on the east side is much smaller, and, as a harbour, very insecure, both on account of its bad anchorage, and of its rocky shores. The largest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> is called Hitoo, and the smallest division Leytimoor. Although the larger bay is more commodious for a settlement, it is in the Leytimoor division that the Europeans have chosen to fix their residence; and they have here erected their principal fortification of Victoria, which is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEXAGON\">hexagon</a>, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DITCH\">ditch</a> and covered way on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> side, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORN_WORK\"><a class=</a>\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORN\">horn</a>-work towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>. Being commanded however by two ranges of heights, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> of from 700 to 1200 yards, it could make no serious resistance against an invading force. \"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWN\">town</a> of Amboyna is extremely clean, and both neatly and regularly built. The streets run at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a>, and the houses, on account of the frequency of earthquakes, are seldom above one storey high. From the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COVERT\">covert</a> way of the fort to the town, there is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESPLANADE\">esplanade</a> of nearly 250 yards, terminated by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANGE\">range</a> of handsome dwelling-houses, with a double row of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NUTMEG\">nutmeg</a>-trees.\"\nin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> of them. In these houses, the principal inhabitants reside. There are two well built churches in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> established by the Dutch <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">Government</a>, one for the European, the other for the Malay <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>. All the other public buildings are in the fort, except the stadhouse, which fronts the esplanade, and is a neat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> of two stories.\" (Asiatic Annual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGISTER\">Register</a> for 1800.)\n\nAmboyna has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> been the seat of the supreme government of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPICE\">Spice</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">Islands</a>; and, under its jurisdiction are comprehended ten other islands; namely Ceram, which is equal in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> to all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a>, Ceram Laut, Bouro, Amblaw, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANIPA\">Manipa</a>, Kelang, Bonoa, Harackau, Saporouna, and Noossa Laut. The cultivation of the nutmeg has been, for some years past, prohibited in Amboyna; the industry of its inhabitants being chiefly directed to the rearing of the clove-tree. It is only in Amboyna, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-THREE_ISLANDS\">three islands</a> of Harackau, Saporouna, and Noossa Laut, that cloves are now cultivated.\n\n\"The clove-tree grows to the height of about forty or fifty feet, its branches spread, and its leaves are long and pointed. In a favourable soil, it begins to bear at fifteen years' growth, is in perfection at twenty, and continues to bear, without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> decay, till the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of forty or fifty. Some trees yield thirty pounds of cloves; but the average quantity produced, does not amount to more than six pounds a tree. They grow to the greatest perfection in deep valleys, well sheltered by hills and woods, and in a soil of rich black mould, quite dry; though they require frequent rain for the greatest part of the year, and very hot weather at the gathering season; which commences generally about the latter end of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OCTOBER\">October</a>, or the beginning of November, and continues until February. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a> and May, there is an after-crop, but of a very inferior quality.\" (Asiatic Annual Register for 1800.)\n\nThe Dutch East <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">Company</a> appear to have been actuated by the same sordid, narrow, and oppressive views, which have, in a greater or less degree, characterized all the European governments established in the east. Cloves, the great article of produce throughout the island, are rigorously engrossed for the benefit of the Company. And for the convenience of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONOPOLY\">monopoly</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a>, and its dependencies, is divided into several districts, over which residents or governors are appointed, for the purpose of preventing all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRABAND\">contraband</a> trade, and to take care also, that the whole produce of the country is strictly delivered up, at a fixed price. The Governor has under his immediate management seven great, and twenty-four small districts; and the subordinate residents have committed to them from six to ten districts, with the exception of the resident of Saporouna, who has under his superintendence twenty-four districts. These districts are likewise called regencies; and the officers who govern them are distinguished by the names of Regents, Rajahs, Patties, and Orankaios. Several of these regencies are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a>, and are enjoyed by the lineal descendents of the Portuguese families who first settled in the island. All the others are appointed by the Governor, although, in this respect, he is obliged to regulate his choice by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> customs and prejudices of the people, whose reverence for the ties of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSANGUINITY\">consanguinity</a> carries them so far, as to induce them to keep a regular pedigree of their families, which is registered in the secretary's office, and on which the candidate for a vacant regency rests his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIMARY\">primary</a> claim. The regents are the vassals of the Company, who not only claim the sovereignty of the island, but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> property of the soil; the whole of the lands being in their immediate possession, except a few pieces of ground belonging to burghers and private persons, who, under the prohibition of cultivating the clove-tree, are permitted to alienate them. A similar claim has been advanced by the English East India Company to all the lands of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENGAL\">Bengal</a>. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> of these claims is exceedingly doubtful; for it is certain that, before the English or Dutch visited India, the soil was possessed; and the question is, how the new claimants came to have a better <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> proprietors? In Amboyna, however, though the Dutch Company claim a paramount right in the soil, they still so far acknowledge the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> of individuals to certain districts, that they do not attempt to deprive them of their property without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPENSATION\">compensation</a>; especially if their lands produce clove-trees, which, being considered the peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INHERITANCE\">inheritance</a> of the planters, are held to be inviolable.\n\nIt is only in the districts marked out by the state, that the cultivation of cloves is permitted; and the grounds which are appropriated for this purpose, are portioned out to the inhabitants. These grounds are called Daty-lands; a regular register of the produce of them is kept; the clove-trees are numbered once a-year; and their qualities particularly noted. The entire produce of these trees the people are bound, under pain of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, to deliver annually into the Company's stores. Where clove-trees flourish spontaneously without the limits of the lands appointed for their cultivation, an account of them is immediately taken, and inserted in the register; and where young trees shoot up, they are immediately transplanted into Daty-lands, unless the number of trees in them is already sufficient.\n\nTo enforce the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> down all the clove trees, which, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPONTANEOUS\">spontaneous</a> bounty of nature, may shoot up in different parts of the island, an annual circuit is made by the governor, accompanied by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DETACHMENT\">detachment</a> of troops, and such of the gentlemen of the settlement as he may appoint to accompany him. As this expedition is performed by water, it is escorted by a number of the regents of the districts in their barges, which they are obliged to equip at their own expense. The governor generally sets out in the middle of October, attended by all the residents of those districts under the immediate management of the supreme government. As he proceeds, he calls on the attendance of all the principal people of the district through which he passes. He makes the tour in this manner of his whole dominions, continuing to increase his train of attendants, until, having made the complete circuit of the island, he returns to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a>. His annual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAVALCADE\">cavalcade</a> is much complained of, on account of the numerous exactions to which it gives rise.\n\nIn gathering the cloves, each labourer brings the quantity which he gathers to a weigh-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, where the\nname of the person, together with the quantity delivered, is regularly noted. But, unless the cloves are thoroughly dried, the full weight is not always admitted. There must be an allowance for wastage, which is entirely at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-DISCRETION\">discretion</a> of the receiving officer, and under this pretence the unprotected inhabitants are exposed to numerous frauds. The price at which cloves are received by the State is 4s. 8d. per <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a>. But this price is merely nominal, in consequence of large deductions being subsequently made on various accounts. Of these the principal is an allowance of 20 per cent. on the weight of the cloves, for the benefit of the governor, and the other servants of the Company; besides which, there are other deductions for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGENT\">regent</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> magistrates of the district, and the labourer's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WAGES\">wages</a> are also paid out of the price allowed by the State. The annual produce of cloves is estimated at 600,000 lb., from which a deduction of one-fifth, or twenty per cent., amounts to 120,000 lb.; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBUTE\">tribute</a> thus levied is portioned out among the residents and members of the executive government, according to their respective ranks. The produce of cloves is apt to vary, however, according as the season is favourable or otherwise.\n\nFor six years, ending 1791, the average quantity of cloves imported into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a> amounted to 597,617 lbs., and were sold for a sum equal to L. 155,129; besides which, considerable quantities are annually sent to various parts of India, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARABIA\">Arabia</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHINA\">China</a>; the exact amount of which it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to ascertain. When the island was taken possession of by the British in 1796, there were in store 515,940 lbs. of cloves. The quantity imported by the English East India Company after the conquest of the island by Britain, was, in the years 1803, 1804, 1805, respectively, 49,441; 127,866; 179,507 lbs, which were sold for L. 8,789; L. 19,994; L. 27,912.\n\nThe despotism under which this fine island is oppressed, is sufficiently implied in the monopoly of its produce for the state, and in the severe and sanguinary laws which are found necessary to prevent contraband trade. If the government were to deal fairly with its subjects, the temptation to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a> to other countries with this produce would be much diminished; and, in proportion to the severity of the laws established against such an intercourse, we may, therefore, fairly estimate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of the fraud practised upon the inhabitants by their mercantile despots. Monopoly, besides being in itself an odious abuse, is an impure source from which other abuses naturally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>; and in Amboyna, accordingly, we find that, as the produce of the inhabitants is engrossed by the State at an undervalue, they are upon the same principle forced to purchase at prices proportionally exorbitant, whatever necessaries they may require. A lucrative trade of this nature is carried on by the residents of the respective provinces, as well as by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> officers at the outposts with the peasantry under their authority. They procure from the supply of stores which the Dutch company used to send annually from Batavia, such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> as the natives require, particularly blue cloth, which they oblige them to purchase at a price far above its value; and, in order to furnish them with the means of satisfying their wants, the residents lend them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> at usurious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>; so that these people are reduced to the miserable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ALTERNATIVE\">alternative</a> either of submitting to the grossest oppression and fraud, or of remaining destitute of those things which nature and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> unite to render necessary. The accumulated debt in which the peasantry are thus involved, is a never-falling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONDAGE\">bondage</a> and oppression; as it places them entirely at the discretion of their task-masters, to whose bounty they are indebted for their miserable subsistence. An order in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> was published by the Dutch government, some time before the island was conquered by the British, prohibiting the residents from stopping from the peasantry for debts due to themselves, more than two-thirds of the amount of their spice money. But, while the residents retain the extensive powers with which they are necessarily vested, in order to enforce the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of monopoly, the peasantry must be at their mercy; and in that case, the government being tyrannical in its principle, pretexts will never be wanting for evading the force of particular laws.\n\nThe maxims on which this country is governed are well explained in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CODE\">Code</a> of written regulations drawn up by order of the Dutch Company some years before the island came into the possession of the British. This Code, in place of containing mild and liberal regulations for the general improvement of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a>, is filled with all the impolitic restrictions of avarice and despotism; the general tendency of which is, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENDING\">bending</a> down and oppressing the lower orders of the community, to strike at the root of national prosperity, and, finally, to impoverish and degrade the country. From a view of those regulations, it appears to have been the settled policy of the government of Amboyna for 150 years back, to discourage cultivation,\u2014to check all attempts to establish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a>,\u2014and, in short, to suppress every improvement which might enable the inhabitants to supply their own wants, and might thus render them independent of the monopolies established by their rulers. In this they have been but too successful; and hence the people are fettered down in a state of the most wretched poverty and dependence,\u2014destitute of the common necessaries of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, in consequence of their progressive advance in price; while, in the meantime, the wages of labour have been forcibly depressed, or rather indeed have been kept back from the labourer by fraud; he being bound to the state for a variety of severe duties and services, for which he receives no remuneration. In consequence of these oppressions, the inhabitants are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> and indolent. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">Agriculture</a> has made no progress. Not more than one-tenth of the island is under cultivation, and it is therefore dependent on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JAVA\">Java</a> for supplies of cattle, and grain. The same causes which have discouraged the cultivation of land and the rearing of cattle, have prevented the improvement of manufactures, or of the mechanic arts; of which the inhabitants are so ignorant, that they do not even manufacture the coarse cloth of which they make their own wearing apparel; but are furnished with it from Java or Ben-","sp":474,"ep":482},{"h":"AMBOYNA","t":"Amboyna gal, and receive it in retail from the residents and men in office, at such prices as they choose to fix <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> it.\n\nAll the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> productions of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> are in like manner neglected by the policy of its rulers.

But the growth of this valuable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMODITY\">commodity</a> was discouraged by the Dutch, chiefly with a view of protecting the indigo trade carried on between the mother <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> and her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a> in the West Indies; and from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JEALOUSY\">jealousy</a> also, that the natives, by acquiring wealth, might be enabled to assert their independence. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">Sugar</a> grows to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a>; but its cultivation is discouraged. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COFFEE\">Coffee</a> is produced in great plenty in different parts of the island; and, were the culture of it sufficiently attended to, it would be equal in quality to the first Mocha coffee.

The cocoa tree also grows here; but the cultivation of it is almost entirely neglected. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> the culture of vegetables were sufficiently attended to, this island would produce a great variety of the finest quality. All sorts of roots are produced in abundance, particularly yams and sweet potatoes; and the increased circulation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>, since the island has been in possession of the English, has induced the farmers to bring ample and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> supplies to the market. There is also great variety of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>, of the finest quality and flavour.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> is nearly uniform, consisting of loam of different degrees of tenacity and fertility, with scarcely any clay.

Near Aberffraw, where the Ffraw discharges itself into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, is the lake Llyngoron, about two miles in circumference, abounding in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TROUT\">trout</a>, gwynaid, and other fish. There is undoubted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> of the encroachment of the sea on the shore of this Island: the Lavan sands, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a> of Beaumaris, formed a habitable Hundred in the sixth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, when they were suddenly overwhelmed by the sea. There are five ferries across the Menai Straits, of which Port-hamel, or the Gloomy ferry (so called from the dense woods which in former times overshadowed its banks), is celebrated as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, where Suetonius landed, when he exterminated the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRUIDS\">Druids</a>. Off the eastern point is the steep, rocky islet of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIEST\">Priest</a>-holme, or Puffin's island: it is a noted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a>, during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, of various birds of passage; the Puffin, whence it derives one of its appellations, breeds there in immense numbers. At the northern point of Anglesey, is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLE\">isle</a> of Seals; its sides are frequented by vast shoals of fish, and Seals which prey upon them.\n\nAnglesey is rich in minerals, particularly in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>. Of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> of this metal in the Parys mountain, a particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> is given in the body of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, on the authority of Mr Pennant; since that account was written, the produce of these mines has declined considerably; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of men employed having been reduced, from 1500 to 600. Besides <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">limestone</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> marble, and blue-veined grey marble, sulphat of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARYTES\">barytes</a>, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> yielding $\\frac{1}{2}$ of pure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNESIA\">magnesia</a>, steatite, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERPENTINE\">serpentine</a>, fullers earth, and native sulphur, are found in this Island. Hitherto, coal has not been wrought with any profit, though the depth of coal, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to the whole depth sunk, appears favourable, being $3\\frac{1}{2}$ feet in 77 feet. An uncommon appearance in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of this fossil is met with in Anglesey, viz. podicles of loose coal of several tons <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>. This Island is celebrated for the variety of its shell-fish; Bingley, in his tour, gives a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of thirty-eight of the principal of these productions; the oysters in particular are highly Anglesey esteemed. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTANY\">botany</a> of Anglesey presents nothing very peculiar or remarkable.\n\nOf the 173,000 acres contained in Anglesey, it is computed that there are 12,600 acres of waste land; and that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> more than the eleventh part of the remainder is under tillage, in the following proportions: oats 7953 acres; barley 6107; wheat 520; rye 2. In the *Encyclopedia*, apparently on the authority of the anonymous author of the supplement to Rowland's *Mona Antiqua*, it is stated, that in 1770, upwards of 90,000 bushels of corn were exported, exclusive of wheat. This must be incorrect, as the whole produce of the Island, in the year 1795, taken by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> survey, did not exceed 59,770 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>: viz. oats 35,485; barley 22,700; wheat 1578; and rye 7 quarters. The Cattle of Anglesey are of a good breed; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> is paid to them; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> annual export is about 8000 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, from one to four years old. The Anglesey breed of sheep is the largest in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">North</a> Wales; averaging about 15 lbs. the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>, and yielding from $1\\frac{1}{2}$ to $2\\frac{1}{2}$ lbs. of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a>: the annual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPORTATION\">exportation</a> of sheep varies from 5000 to 7000; nearly the same number of hogs are exported.\n\nThe inhabitants of Anglesey manufacture deep-coloured blue cloth, flannels, blankets, &c. for home <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>, but none for exportation. In Newborough there is a manufacture of mats and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROPES\">ropes</a>, made of the sea <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REED\">reed</a>-grass, which binds together the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a> hills on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a>.\n\nThe antiquities of this Island are sufficiently illustrated in the body of the work. A rural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIPE\">pipe</a>, used by the Shepherd, called the Pibgorn, is said to be almost peculiar to it; it derives its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> from its extremities being tipped with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORN\">horn</a>; it has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> holes, besides the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APERTURE\">aperture</a> in which the reed is concealed; and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TONE\">tone</a> is between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLUTE\">flute</a> and the clarionet.\n\nFrom the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> returns of 1801, it appears that there were then in Anglesey 6679 houses, inhabited by 7058 families; and 127 uninhabited houses: 9776 persons chiefly employed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>: 2614 in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a> and trade; and 19,228 not comprised in these two classes: the number of males was 15,775; and of females 18,031. By the returns in 1811, there were 7183 houses, inhabited by 7706 families; 72 houses <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>; 108 uninhabited; 5376 families chiefly employed in agriculture; 1453 in manufactures; and 877 not comprised in these two classes: the number of males was 17,444; and of females 19,601. It <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be remarked, that, according to both returns, the number of females exceeds that of males; this disproportion is not, however, peculiar to Anglesey, but extends over all Wales.\n\nThe reader, who is desirous of farther <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a>, in regard to this Island, may consult Davie's *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">General</a> View of the Agriculture of North Wales*\u2014Bingley's *Tour in North Wales*\u2014Aiken's *Tour in Wales*.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANNEALING\">ANNEALING</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> and use of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> in Glass-making, has been already explained in\nAnnealing the body of the work; it remains to add some details in regard to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a>. In the manufactures, in which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALLEABLE\">malleable</a> metals are employed, annealing is used to soften a metal after it has been rendered hard by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAMMER\">hammer</a>, and also to soften <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, which is rendered very hard and brittle by rapid cooling.\n\nIn the manufacture of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a> goods, which are first formed by the hammer, and require to be filed or otherwise treated, and in which softness and flexibility are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> to the change, annealing is absolutely necessary. This is particularly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> in making files and scissors; that the metal may be left sufficiently soft for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>, and for filing off those parts which cannot be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>. Annealing is not less necessary in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> of wire, whether iron, copper, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a>, silver, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>. The operation of drawing soon gives the wire a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTICITY\">elasticity</a>, which, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> not removed from time to time by annealing, would prevent the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of the wire, and render it extremely brittle. The same operation is also necessary in rolling or flattening those metals which are in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> state, such as brass, silver, gold, &c. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRAZIER\">Brazier</a> who forms vessels of copper and brass by the hammer, can work upon it only for a little time, before he is obliged to anneal it.\n\nThe common methods employed for annealing iron and steel are very injudicious, and materially injure the latter, when it is used for making cutting instruments. After they have been formed by the hammer, they are generally piled up in an open fire, slowly raised to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, and then allowed to gradually cool. By this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a>, the surface of the steel will be found considerably scaled, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OXYGEN\">oxygen</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>. When it is remembered, that steel consists of iron joined to carbon, it will be evident, that the steel immediately under the scaly oxid will be deprived of its carbon, which has been carried off by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> of the oxygen; and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, will lose the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>, of acquiring that degree of hardness necessary to a cutting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a>.\n\nNothing, therefore, can be more obvious, than that steel particularly should be annealed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> vessels, to prevent that effect. For this purpose, the goods should be placed in a trough or recess made of fire-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, or fire-brick, and stratified with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASHES\">ashes</a>, or clean <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>, and finally covered with a thick stratum of the same; but if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> of the vessel be small, it may have a cover of its own materials. This oven or trough must now be heated by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FURNACE\">furnace</a> passing under and round it till the whole is of a red heat. It must then be suffered to cool, without letting in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>. The goods so treated, will be much softer than by the common method. The surface, instead of becoming scaled, will have acquired a metallic whiteness, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a> of a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of carbonaceous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> contained in the ashes in which they were imbedded. They will become so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEXIBLE\">flexible</a> also, as to allow them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEND\">bend</a> considerably without breaking, which is very far from being the case before the operation. The fracture, before annealing, will be smooth and short; but afterwards it will be rough, exhibiting bright parts of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-CRYSTALLINE\">crystalline</a> appearance. Wire, especially that of iron and steel, should be treated in a similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>, when it is annealed. The wire used for some purposes, requires to be soft, and is sold in that state. If the wire after finishing, when it is bright and clean, were to be annealed in contact with oxygen, it would not only lose all its lustre and smoothness, but much of its tenacity. The process above-mentioned will therefore be particularly necessary in annealing finished wire, as well as in softening it from time to time during the drawing.\n\nCopper and brass suffer much less than iron and steel from annealing in the open air, and do not require to be heated above a low red heat. If, however, the lustre is to be preserved, a close vessel would be desirable. The latter metals, after annealing, although much discoloured by the oxygen of the atmosphere, may be cleansed, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMMERSION\">immersion</a> in a hot liquor composed of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> and a small quantity of sulphuric or nitric acid. Very small brass or copper wire is frequently annealed, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> it to the flame of hay or straw. In casting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> pieces of pig-iron, which is generally done in wet sand, the metal possesses the property of steel to such a degree, as to assume, by the rapid cooling, a degree of hardness equal to hardened steel; at the same time, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> are so brittle as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> by falling on the ground. When, however, these goods are treated in the way above directed, they acquire a degree of softness which renders them penetrable by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FILE\">file</a>, and at the same time capable of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENDING\">bending</a>. In this state, they are much less tenacious than steel, but still so much so, as to have been sold in the form of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTLERY\">cutlery</a> for steel.\n\nThe change which metals undergo by annealing, is not yet thoroughly understood. Most of the malleable metals are susceptible of two distinct forms, one called the crystalline form, which they assume by slow cooling; and the other, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FIBROUS\">fibrous</a>, which is acquired by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAMMERING\">hammering</a> or rolling. When this, however, is carried beyond a certain point, the metal becomes so hard, that it is not capable of being bent far without breaking. All the malleable metals in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INGOT\">ingot</a> or in their cast state are brittle, and exhibit a crystalline fracture. By hammering or rolling, they become more tenacious, and break with difficulty, exhibiting what is called a fibrous fracture. At the same time, they become stiffer and more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a>. They lose the latter properties by annealing, but become more malleable. If the annealing, however, be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>, the malleability diminishes, and they again have a crystalline fracture. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZINC\">Zinc</a> by wire-drawing becomes very flexible, and possesses a degree of tenacity not inferior to that of copper. But, if it be kept in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> water for a length of time, it will resume its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> brittleness, and show a crystalline appearance when broken. This proves that the particles of metals can change their arrangement, without losing their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> form\u2014which is still more strongly confirmed by the fact, that brass wire loses its tenacity by exposure to the fumes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a>, and even by the presence of a damp atmosphere. This is not caused by the moisture, but by the action","sp":634,"ep":636},{"h":"ANIMAL ANATOMY","t":"I. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">HUMAN</a> ANATOMY.\n\n1.

Required the annual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREMIUM\">premium</a> for an assurance <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> \\( A \\) now 50 years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> 5 per cent.\n\nAccording to No. 185, the operation is thus,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n1 + A &= 12.660 \\lambda \\\\\n\\frac{1}{1 + A} &= 0.0789890 \\times 2.8975663 \\\\\n\\text{adding } v &= 0.9523809, \\text{ and subtracting unity,} \\\\\n\\text{we have } \\circ A &= 0.0313699, \\text{ agreeably to No. 85.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n195. Ex. 2. What should the annual premium be for an assurance on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> survivor of three lives \\( A, B, C \\), now aged 50, 55, and 60 years respectively, rate of interest 5 per cent?\n\nOperation by No. 188.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n(68) \\quad 1 + \\text{ABC} &= 15.001 \\lambda \\\\\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\text{ABC}} &= 0.0666622 \\times 2.8238798 \\\\\nv &= 0.9523809 \\\\\n\\circ \\text{ABC} &= 0.0190431, \\text{ agreeably to No. 88.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nNo. 88.\n\n196. Ex. 3. Required the annual premium for an assurance for 10 years only, on a life now 45 years of age, interest 5 per cent.\n\nOperation according to No. 186.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nv^{10} &= 6.18913 \\lambda \\times 1.7881068 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{v^{10}} &= 4073 \\lambda \\times 3.6099144 \\\\\na &= 4727 \\times 4.3254144 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{v^{10}a} &= 5.28976 \\lambda \\times 1.7234356 \\\\\n1 + \\frac{1}{v^{10}A} &= 11.347 \\lambda \\times 1.0548811 \\\\\n\\text{Subtract } 6.002 \\lambda \\times 0.7783167 \\\\\n\\text{from } 1 + A &= 13.648 \\\\\n\\text{remains } 7.646 \\times 1.1165657 \\\\\n1 - \\frac{1}{v^{10}A} &= 4.71024 \\times 1.6730430 \\\\\n\\cdot 061604 \\lambda \\times 2.7896087 \\\\\nv &= 0.952381 \\\\\n\\circ \\text{A} &= 0.019885, \\text{ agreeably to No. 96.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nWhat has been advanced from numbers 99 to 109, needs no algebraical illustration.

We shall have occasion fully to explain the principles upon which our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> is founded, in the article ZOOLOGY. At present, it is only necessary to mention, that all the different branches of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> department of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">Natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> will be treated of under these heads: viz.

From these heads, references will be made to the zoological articles in the body of the work, and also from the older names to the corresponding appellations in the arrangement adopted in these volumes.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> ANNULOSA (from Annulus, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> segment), is applied to animals whose bodies are more or less divided transversely into segments.\n\n**<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLASS\">Class</a> I.\u2014<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CRUSTACEA\">CRUSTACEA</a>.**\n\n**History.**\n\nAll the Crustacea, as their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> imports, are enveloped in a crust or shell (crusta). Many of the larger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> were known to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Naturalists. They were named Crustacea by the Latins, Malacostracoi (\u039c\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9) by the Greeks. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a> has dedicated a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> to the species known to him; Athen\u00e6us enumerates those used as food; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HIPPOCRATES\">Hippocrates</a> has made mention of such species as were considered useful in medicine.\n\nTo the observations of Aristotle, very little was added by Pliny; and from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> until that of Rondeletius, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELON\">Belon</a>, Gesner, Aldrovandus, and Johnson, who placed the Crustacea between the Fishes and Mollusca, little or nothing was done that tends in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> to elucidate the natural history or structure of these animals.\n\nBy the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> reformer Linn\u00e9, they were arranged under the genera Monoculus, Cancer, and Oniscus, along with apterous insects; but the most prejudiced of his followers now admit that they have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> sufficient to establish them as a distinct class.\n\nThis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYPE\">type</a> of animals was proposed in one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">General</a> Arrangements of the Annales de Mus\u00e9um, by M. G. Cuvier. It comprehends five classes, the classification of which will form the subject of the present article.\n\nAs the leading characters of the classes are very obvious, we shall, in the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, lay them before our readers through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDIUM\">medium</a> of a table, and shall then detail them more fully.\n\n- **Class 1. CRUSTACEA.** Branchiae or gills for respiration. Legs \u2020 for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>.\n- **Class 2. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MYRIAPODA\">MYRIAPODA</a>.** Trache\u00e6 or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>-tubes for respiration. Legs more than eight. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">Head</a> distinct from the thorax. Antenn\u00e6 two.\n- **Class 3. ARACHNIDES.** Trache\u00e6 for respiration. Legs eight or six. Head not distinct from the thorax. Antenn\u00e6 none.\n- **Class 4. INSECTA.** Trache\u00e6 for respiration. Legs six. Head distinct from the thorax. Antenn\u00e6 two.\n- **Class 5. VERMES.** Trache\u00e6 for respiration. Legs none. Antenn\u00e6 none.\n\nJ. C. Fabricius, a pupil of Linn\u00e9, divided the Crustacea from insects, and formed several distinct classes for their reception; but as he has altered his system in his different works, it seems necessary only to state the last, which is given in the Supplement to his Entomologia Systematica. In this work is the following arrangement:\n\n- **Class POLYGONATA.** Many maxill\u00e6 within the lip.\n  Gen. 1. Oniscus, 2. Ligia, 3. Idotea, 4. Cymothoa, 5. Monoculus.\n- **Class KLEISTAGNATHA.** Many maxill\u00e6, closing the mouth. Lip none.\n  Gen. 1. Cancer, 2. Calappa, 3. Ocypode, 4. Leucosia, 5. Parthenope, 6. Inachus, 7. Dromia, 8. Dorippe, 9. Orithya, 10. Portunus, 11. Matutin, 12. Hippa, 13. Symethis, 14. Limulus.\n- **Class EXOCHINATA.** Many maxill\u00e6 outside the lip, covered by the palpi.\n  Gen. 1. Albunea, 2. Scyllarus, 3. Pallinurus, 4. Palaeemon, 5. Alpheus, 6. Astacus, 7. Penaeus, 8. Cran-gon, 9. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol0.html#article-PAGURUS\">Pagurus</a>, 10. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-GALATHEA\">Galathea</a>, 11. Squilla, 12. Podsydon, 14.

In the present article, we propose to give the characters and economy of the Genera, and an example of one Species of each, with the exception of INSECTA, which will be treated of under that head in a separate article.\n\n\u2021 By this term, we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> those organs which actually perform the functions of legs. On this subject more will be said under the article Zoology.\n\n|| This class was instituted by Dr Leach.

Limulus.\n\n** Shell bivalve.\nGen. 11. Lynceus.\n\nA great portion of the species, composing the Entomostraca of M\u00fcller, were described by the microscopic observers, Joblot, Frish, R\u00e9aumur, De Geer, Baker, Lederm\u00fcller, and Geoffroy, and were by the latter author arranged into two genera, which he named Binoculus and Monoculus.\n\nBy that learned anatomist G. Cuvier, the Crustacea were considered as forming a class, which he placed between the Vermes and Insecta. This indefatigable observer discovered, that the Crustacea breathed by branchiae or gills, and he disposed them into three great sections, viz.\n\nI. Monoculus, including the genera, 1. Limulus, 2. Caligus, 3. Cyclops, 4. Apus, 5. Polyphemus of M\u00fcller.\n\nII. Cancer, comprehending the genera, 6. Cancer, 7. Inachus, 8.

Cymothoa of Fabricius.\n\nLamarck, in his Syst\u00e8me des Animaux sans Vertebres, has disposed the Crustacea into the two following orders, viz.\n\nOrd. I. Crustace's pediociques, including the genera, *1. Cancer, 2. Calappa, 3. Ocypode, 4. Grapsus, 5. Dorippe, 6. Portunus, 7. Podophthalmus, 8. Matuta, 9. Maja, 10. Porcellana, 11. Leucosia, 12.

Guenin\u2020 says, that more people were destroyed by it than by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAGUE\">plague</a>, which had prevailed a short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> before it came into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>; and Garelli, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> physician to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">Emperor</a>, wrote to Hoffmann that Tofania confessed she had used it to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POISON\">poison</a> more than six hundred persons. This he learnt from the Emperor himself, to whom the whole criminal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> instituted against her was transmitted.\n\nIt is to be regretted, that Garelli, who had such an authentic source of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a>, has not given us some details of the infamous Tofana or Tofania; as the little that we know of her rests upon the authority of travelers, and is evidently exaggerated, and sometimes irreconcilable with established facts. She was a Sicilian by birth, and resided first at Palermo, and then at Naples. When she began to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> her horrible profession, is nowhere stated; but it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> presently appear, that it must have been at a very early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, and before 1659. She was extremely liberal of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a>, chiefly it is said, to ladies tired of their husbands; and the better to conceal the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of her gift, it was put up in small flat phials, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSCRIBED\">inscribed</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANNA\">Manna</a> of St Nicholas of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARI\">Bari</a>, ornamented <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> one side with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGE\">image</a> of the Saint, that it might <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> for a liquid said to drop from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOMB\">tomb</a> at Bari, which was in great request on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of the medicinal virtues ascribed to it. Nor is it ascertained how <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> she carried on her murderous practices with impunity and undiscovered. Labat\u00a7 says, that when he was at Civita Vecchia in 1709, the Viceroy of Naples, then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> Daun, made the discovery. It was long before she was secured, as she was extremely cautious, and often changed her abode or retired into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONVENTS\">Convents</a>. At <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> she was betrayed, and, although in a Convent, was seized and carried to the Castel del Uovo, where she was examined. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARDINAL\">Cardinal</a> Pignatelli, then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">Archbishop</a> of Naples, indignant at the violation of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> sanctuary, threatened to excommunicate\n\n---\n\n* Lanzoni <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPERA\">Opera</a>, 4to.

But the sagacious Viceroy caused a report to be spread, that she and her accomplices had determined upon the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, to poison all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a> in the city, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> brought to market, and the public granaries. The manoeuvre succeeded. The credulous people were now clamorous for her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> with satisfaction the persons whom she accused of having purchased her Aquetta, taken from the Churches and Monasteries. Some of inferior birth were executed publicly; those of higher <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> secretly in prison; and the whole city resounded with the praises of the Viceroy, whose energy had saved it from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a>. A kind of compromise was entered into with the Cardinal; in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of which, after being strangled, her body was thrown at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a> into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of the Convent, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> of testifying some respect for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">Church</a>. But the reverend traveller must have either been misinformed as to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> execution of this Medea, or she must have been resuscitated; for Garelli expressly says that she was alive in prison at Naples, when he wrote to Hoffmann, not long before 1718; and Keysler, who visited Naples in 1730, likewise asserts, that she was then living in prison, and that few strangers left the city without going to see her. He describes her as a little and very old woman.\n\nThe Roman ladies very quickly availed themselves of Tofania's discovery; for it was remarked in 1659, that many husbands died when they became disagreeable to their wives; and several of the clergy also gave information, that, for some time past, various persons had confessed themselves guilty of poisoning. This led to the detection of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> of young married women (who had, for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">president</a>, an old woman of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of Hieronyma <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPARTA\">Sparta</a>, a pretended fortune-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TELLER\">teller</a>), as the perpetrators of these murders. On being put to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TORTURE\">torture</a> they all confessed except Sparta, who seemed to rely upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-PROTECTION\">protection</a> of powerful individuals whom she had formerly served. But she was left to her fate, and was hanged along with her assistant, one Gratiosa. Others were afterwards hanged, or whipt and banished. Sparta, who was a Sicilian, had acquired her knowledge from Tofania at Palermo.\n\nPope Alexander VII., immediately on the discovery and punishment of those who dealt in poison in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a>, published an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDICT\">edict</a> forbidding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTILLATION\">distillation</a> of aquafortis, or the purchase of any of its ingredients, without the permission of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">Government</a>; which Gmelin considers as an artifice to mislead the people as to the real <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of the poison, or as originating in the absurd <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOMENCLATURE\">nomenclature</a> of the Chemists of former times, who called arsenic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CONCRETE\">concrete</a> aquafortis. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a> of the Pope was rendered fruitless; for we are informed by Gayot di Pitaval (Causes C\u00e9l\u00e8bres, Vol. I. Amsterd. 1774, p. 317.), on what authority he does not state, that Tofania's fatal secret was disclosed by the indiscretion of the judges at Naples, to whom she had made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CONFESSION\">confession</a> of her crime. The whole city soon knew that she employed in its composition a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERB\">herb</a>, and that its preparation was otherwise easy; and in this way the art of poisoning became very common in Naples, where, Keysler says, it was still secretly practised when he visited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>; and Archenholz, who was there in 1780, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, that Aqua Tofana was then in use, although its composition was only known to a few; but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a> Frank, who was long Professor in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PAVIA\">Pavia</a>, and has written a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> on toxicology (Handbuch der Toxicologie, Wien, 1803, p. 168.), regards this as an unfounded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CALUMNY\">calumny</a>, and asserts that it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> longer exists or is heard of.\n\nAqua Tofana is described as being as limpid as rock <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, and without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, and hence it could be administered without exciting suspicion. The Abb\u00e9 Gagliani adds, that there was not a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a> in Naples, who had not some of it lying openly on her toilet among her perfumes, in a phial known only to herself.\n\nIt was generally believed, that the effect of this poison was certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>; and that it could be so tempered or managed, as to prove fatal in any determinate time, from a few days to a year or upwards. Four or six drops were reckoned a sufficient dose, and they were said to produce no violent symptoms, no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOMITING\">vomiting</a>, or but very seldom, no pains, convulsions, inflammation, or fever; but only a feeling of indisposition, without any very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEFINITE\">definite</a> symptoms, except sometimes inextinguishable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THIRST\">thirst</a>; the victim, however, sunk into a languid state, and his weakness increased daily. Disgust at all kinds of food, and weariness of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, succeeded; the nobler organs were then attacked, the lungs were wasted by suppuration, and death closed the miserable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a>. This termination was the more certain, that the true cause of these symptoms was not at first suspected, and the remedies <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> prescribed rather aggravated the evil. Indeed, even when known, no treatment was of any avail, although a Dr. Brancaletti, according to Keysler, wrote a book on its remedies, until it was discovered by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCIDENT\">accident</a> that lemon-juice, when very early administered in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> doses, sometimes proved effectual (Bertholimus), after which, Keysler tells us, that the poison fell into some disrepute.\n\nVarious accounts of the composition of this detestable liquor have been given.

The same account is given by Bertholinus, Lobell (Der freymuthige Heilkunstler, Berlin, 1786), Plenk (Toxicologia, p. 335), Haller, + Molitor (Commerc. Lit. Noric. 1737, p. 182), and M\u00f6hsen, \u2020 and is received by the most judicious systematic writers, as Gmelin and Hahnemann. (Ueber die Arsenikevergiftung, 8vo, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LEIPZIG\">Leipzig</a>, 1786, p. 35.) Wildberg, \u2021 however, considers its composition to be unknown.\n\nFrom Italy this poison seems to have found its way to Paris. In 1672 Godin de Sainte Croix, an adventurer, who lived in a scandalous intimacy with the Marchioness <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol5.html#article-BRINVILLIERS\">Brinvilliers</a>, was suddenly killed by suffocation, as it is said, in consequence of the falling off of a mask of glass, which he wore to protect him from the fumes of certain chemical operations about which he was employed. As he had no known relations, his effects were examined by a public officer, and among them was found a casket, containing many packets of poisonous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a>, sealed up in a mysterious manner, together with a kind of last will, directing the whole to be delivered to the Marchioness, and, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of her having predeceased him, to be burnt unopened. This led to the discovery of his having been instructed in the art of preparing poison, by an Italian, called Exili, with whom he had become acquainted, when confined in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BASTILLE\">Bastille</a>; and of his having furnished the Marchioness with the means of poisoning her father and her two brothers, besides others on whom she tried the effect of her preparations. One of these afterwards was called from her by the name Eau de Brinvilliers. She is also said to have employed a powder called Poudre de Succession. \u00a7 La Chauss\u00e9e, who had been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VALET\">valet</a> to Sainte Croix, was convicted of being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCESSORY\">accessory</a> to these murders, and was broken alive on the wheel. The Marchioness herself, who had escaped to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIEGE\">Liege</a>, was also seized, and her execution, which took <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> on the 17th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> 1676, is described with revolting levity by Mad. de Sevign\u00e9 in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a>.\n\nThe practice of poisoning, however, did not seem to terminate with the death of this infamous woman; and a particular court called Chambre des Poisons, or Chambre Ardente, was established in 1679, to endeavour to put an end to it. In consequence of the investigations which took place in it, many persons, some of the highest rank, especially the Duc de Luxembourg, were implicated. More than forty persons were at one time confined in the Bastille; but it was ascertained, that almost all of them had been guilty of no crime, but were merely the dupes of a few impostors, who pretended to raise spirits, foretell <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> events, and to possess many secrets of a similar nature. Two women, La Vigoureux and La Voisin, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> of the former, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a> called Le Sage, \u00b6 pretended fortune-tellers, were convicted of being dealers in poison, and burnt alive, on the 22d Feb. 1680; some others were hanged, and others acquitted. This closed the proceedings of this inquisitorial court, which has been accused of being a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> engine, contrived to serve the purposes of Louvois and the Marchioness de Montespan. Voltaire, however, admits that the crime of poisoning infected Paris from 1670 to 1680.\n\nConcerning the effects of the Eau de Brinvilliers, Pitaval tells us (p. 271,) that the Marchioness's father experienced violent effects from the poison,\u2014<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> vomiting, insupportable pain at stomach, and great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> in the bowels. He died soon after his return from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>-seat to Paris. The brothers, and five other persons, were all taken ill, and affected with vomiting, after partaking of a tart at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DINNER\">dinner</a>. On their return from the country to Paris, the brothers had the appearance of persons who had been long ill; and after suffering, the one for two, and the other for three months, from nausea and vomiting, they died extremely emaciated, and as it were dried up, without fever, though experiencing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a> in the stomach. On opening the bodies, the stomach and duodenum were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> and tender, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIVER\">liver</a> gangrenous and burnt. Mad. Sevign\u00e9 relates, that the Marchioness often poisoned her husband, that she might marry Sainte Croix, but that the gallant, having no desire for a wife of her disposition, as often gave the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> husband an antidote. She is also said to have attempted to poison her sister; but did not succeed; and that she was in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of trying the effects of her poisons on the\n\n---\n\n* Dissert. de Veneno salutem sistens, Lipsiae, 1701, \u00a7 21.\n\u2020 Vorlesungen \u00fcber die gerichtliche Arzneikunde, 2ter Band, p. 190.\n\u2021 Beschreibung einer Berlinischen Medallien-sammlung, 1.

But Voltaire positively denies this horrible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPUTATION\">imputation</a>, and says, that she never attempted the life of her husband, who overlooked a connection, of which he was the cause.\n\nThe information concerning the nature of the Eau de Brinvilliers, derived from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of Sainte Croix's famous casket, is not satisfactory. It contained poisons enough to have killed a whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a>; besides opium, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUNAR\">lunar</a> caustic, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTIMONY\">antimony</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VITRIOL\">vitriol</a>, more than 75 lbs. of corrosive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUBLIMATE\">sublimate</a>, and two bottles of a liquid, like water, with a sediment in one. The clear liquid was probably his real poison; as none of the other substances could have been given so as to produce death, without instantly being detected, by their abominable taste; but what this liquid was, we can now only conjecture, for its examination, as reported by Pitaval, shows that the physicians, at that time, had not the slightest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of detecting arsenic even in substance, much less in solution; and accordingly, although both the liquor and powder killed the animals to which they were given, it is candidly admitted, that the poison of Sainte Croix surpassed the art and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a> of the physicians, and that it baffled all their experiments to discover its composition. We have, however, no doubt, that arsenic was the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> ingredient of all these pretended secret poisons; as it is the only substance capable of explaining all the credible circumstances related of them. From the mode of administering them in small, but repeated and perhaps increased doses, there was some foundation for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> that they could be given so as to kill in any determinate time, while their failing in any instance to produce death, was easily accounted for by supposing antidotes to have been administered. But although the progress of knowledge has proved, that there is no such thing as such antidotes, it has on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, by rendering the detection of poison easy and certain, put a stop forever to the trade of poisoners; and what is perhaps of equal importance, to the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALARM\">alarm</a> and cruel punishment of individuals which have often resulted from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> deaths being ascribed to poison. It is not because we know less, but because we know a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> more than our forefathers, that the art of secret poisoning seems to be lost.\u2014See Forensic Medicine in this Supplement.\n\nARACHNIDES.

The name does not occur in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> authors; hydroscopium and baryllium being the ancient names of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a>. This instrument was known in the civilized <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the Roman empire, about the year 400, as appears from the fifteenth epistle of Synesius, addressed to Hypatia, daughter of Theon; and to Hypatia some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> writers have erroneously ascribed its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>. The instrument is also described in some verses annexed to Priscian; and the principles on which its operation is founded, are to be seen in the treatise of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHIMEDES\">Archimedes</a> on floating bodies (De Humido In-\n\nsidentibus). The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a>, as used by writers on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\">natural <a class=\"</a>xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, is chiefly applied to instruments which are made to float, so as to indicate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-SPECIFIC_GRAVITY\"><a class=\"xref\" </a>href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIFIC\">specific</a> gravity of the liquids in which they are placed: the p\u00e8se liqueur, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HYDROMETER\">hydrometer</a>, in common use for measuring the specific gravity of vinous spirits, are instruments of this kind.\n\nA floating body displaces a portion of the liquid, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of which is equal to its own weight, the liquid acting upwards with a force equal to this weight, and the weight of the body acting downwards with the same force, equilibrium takes place. If the body be afterwards placed in a liquid of less density, the part of the body immersed, will be greater than when the body was in the more dense liquid, because it requires a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of this less dense liquid to equal the weight of the floating body. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> weights of two bodies being the same, their specific gravities are in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERSE\">inverse</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a> of their volumes \\( \\frac{G}{g} = \\frac{v}{V} \\), when \\( G \\) is put for the specific gravity of the first body, \\( g \\) for that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>; \\( V \\) for the volume of the first, and \\( v \\) for the volume of the second. On this principle the common hydrometer is constructed; the instrument described by Synesius, is also of this kind. In order that a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> in the volume immersed may be sensible, the part which is intersected by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a> of the fluid is in the form of a very slender <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a>, the great bulk of the instrument being always immersed in the liquid. At the inferior part is a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a>, containing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a> or small lead <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a>, which serves as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALLAST\">ballast</a>, bringing the centre of gravity low, so that the instrument may float erect, and without much lateral oscillation. The common hydrometers are made of glass, and sometimes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a>, or tin or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PEWTER\">pewter</a>, and some have been made of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMBER\">amber</a> as objects of curiosity: when made of glass, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a>, inscribed upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, is inserted in the cylindrical stalk; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of the scale at which the surface of any liquid intersects the stalk, denotes the specific gravity of that liquid. The divisions of the scale should be formed by immersing the instrument in liquids of known specific gravity, and marking a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> corresponding to that specific gravity opposite to each division. The specific gravities of water and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALCOHOL\">alcohol</a> mixed in various proportions, have been accurately ascertained by Mr Gilpin (see his Tables, and Dr Blagden's paper in the Philosophical Transactions); on immersing the instrument in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> of known proportions of these two liquids, the point at which the surface intersects the stalk, is to be marked with the number expressing the specific gravity of the mixture taken from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>. Some hydrometers, such as that constructed by the French chemist Beaum\u00e9, and which is much used in France under the name of Ar\u00e9ometre de Beaum\u00e9, have the\nAr\u00e6meter scale divided into equal parts, so that the divisions do not correspond as they ought to do with the numbers which express specific gravities.\n\nIn the ar\u00e6meter of Fahrenheit, the uncertainty arising from the erroneous division of the scale is obviated, no division being required. The form of the instrument is the same as that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> described, only at the top there is a small cup, into which weights are put, so as to bring the surface of the denser liquid to a fixed mark on the stalk; when the instrument is placed in a liquid of less density, some of the weights are taken out till the mark again comes to the surface.\n\nSuppose the weight of the instrument and of the weights in the cup together equal to 1000, when sunk to the mark in distilled water at a certain temperature; the instrument is now taken out of the water and immersed in a liquid, where 10 must be taken out of the cup in order to bring the mark to the surface; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMMERSION\">immersion</a> in water indicates that a volume of water weighs 1000; the immersion in the second liquid, shows that an equal volume of this liquid weighs 990; when the volumes of bodies are equal, the specific gravities are directly as the absolute weights \\( \\frac{G}{g} = \\frac{W}{w} \\); consequently the specific gravity of the second liquid is 990, that of water being 1000. To <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> computation, it is convenient that the whole weight of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a>, when in distilled water, at a certain temperature, should be represented by 1000; for this purpose, the instrument-maker divides the weight of the apparatus into 1000 parts, and forms small weights consisting of one, two, three, &c. of these thousandth parts, the relation of which to the ounce or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a>, does not require to be known; the weights thus formed are to be used with the instrument.\n\nThe ar\u00e6meter of Nicholson is like that of Fahrenheit, with the addition of an immersed cup, whereby it is rendered proper for ascertaining the specific gravity of solids. Suppose that it requires 400 grains in the exterior cup to sink the instrument to the mark in distilled water, at 60 degrees of Fahrenheit's thermometer:\n\n1st, The body under examination is put into the exterior cup, and weights (say 300 grains) are taken out till the mark again stands at the surface; this gives the absolute weight of the body 300 grains.\n\n2dly, The body is then put into the immersed cup S, taking care to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRUSH\">brush</a> off any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>-bubbles with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a>, and in order to bring the mark to the surface, a Ar\u00e6meter weight (say 100 grains) must be put into the exterior cup, that is, the weight of a volume of water equal to the body, is 100 grains. The first part of the process gave the absolute weight of the body 300 grains, and the volumes being equal, the specific gravities are as the absolute weights, consequently the specific gravity of the body is 300, that of water being 100. This ar\u00e6meter may be used to find the specific gravity of liquids; the process, in that case, is the same as that described above in speaking of the ar\u00e6meter of Fahrenheit. The ar\u00e6meter of Nicholson is useful to the mineralogist for ascertaining the specific gravity of minerals; the specific gravity being a convenient character for distinguishing one kind of mineral from another. It is sometimes made of tinned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, but where more accuracy is required, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a> is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-MATERIAL\">material</a> employed. When put together, it does not exceed a foot in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>, and therefore is suited to form a part of the travelling mineralogist's apparatus.\n\nSome ar\u00e6meters have been constructed with the exterior cup C placed underneath, and supported by a stirrup, whose upper part is fixed to the stalk of the ar\u00e6meter, as represented on the margin; this is done in order to place the centre of gravity low, that the ar\u00e6meter may thereby float more steadily. The ar\u00e6meter floats in a cylindrical vessel fitted to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> of the stirrup, and this vessel is supported on a stand so formed as not to interfere with the free <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of the stirrup.\n\nThe ar\u00e6meter of Deparcieux is like the common hydrometer, only the ball is much more voluminous; this renders it capable of indicating the small difference which exists in the specific gravity of the water of different springs, for which purpose Deparcieux proposed it. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DILATATION\">dilatation</a> of the large glass <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BULB\">bulb</a> by heat, has a considerable effect on the operation of this instrument, and this dilatation being different in different instruments, renders the results inaccurate. The different ar\u00e6meters above-mentioned, have the advantages of being easily made and easily carried about; but where the specific gravity of a body is required with the greatest accuracy, recourse must be had to the hydrostatic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a>, which ought to be constructed with the utmost care by the most skilful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a>.\n\nThe following algebraic expressions may serve to elucidate some of the properties of the ar\u00e6meters hitherto spoken of:\n\n\\( g \\) is the specific gravity of water, which is 1000 ounces when the ounce and foot are taken as units, 1000 ounces avoirdupois being the weight of a cubic foot of water.\n\n\\( z \\) is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a> of the wire-stalk of the ar\u00e6meter.\n\n\\( \\pi \\) is 3.1415, &c., the number expressing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIPHERY\">periphery</a> of a circle whose diameter is 1.\nWhen the small weight, the density of the liquid, and the length of that part of the stalk which is submerged on adding the small weight, are known, then this equation will give the diameter of the stalk in known quantities \\( z = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\frac{w}{v + \\frac{1}{3}x^2}}} \\).\n\nWhen the weight of the whole araeometer is known in ounces, &c., and the specific gravity of one of two liquids (water for instance) is known, the difference of specific gravity between that liquid and another liquid may be had in known quantities.\n\n\\( g \\) is the specific gravity of water.\n\n\\( g' \\) is the specific gravity of the second liquid, which is here supposed more dense.\n\n\\( w \\) is the weight of the volume of water displaced by the araeometer.\n\n\\( s \\) is a small additional weight placed on the exterior cup to keep the araeometer, when placed in the denser liquid, at the same point of immersion as when it floated in water.\n\n\\( w + s \\) is the whole weight of the apparatus when floating in the denser liquid.\n\nThe equation \\( g' = \\frac{w + s}{v + \\frac{1}{3}x^2} \\) is obtained by substituting \\( g' \\) for \\( g \\), and \\( w + s \\) for \\( w \\) in the equation, \\( g = \\frac{w}{v + \\frac{1}{3}x^2} \\), which was given above. Divide by \\( g = \\frac{w}{v + \\frac{1}{3}x^2} \\) and there results \\( \\frac{g'}{g} = \\frac{w + s}{w} \\), which gives the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> of the density of the second liquid to the density of water. By <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUBTRACTION\">subtraction</a> there results \\( \\frac{g' - g}{g} = \\frac{s}{w} \\) and \\( g' - g = \\frac{s}{w} \\), that is, the difference between the density of the second liquid, and the density of water is found by multiplying the small weight by 1000 ounces, and dividing this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRODUCT\">product</a> by the number of ounces, &c., which denote the weight of the araeometer unchanged.\n\nSmall bodies, whose specific gravities are known, serve to indicate the specific gravity of a liquid in Ar\u00e6ometer, which they just remain suspended. In this way, beads of glass, three or four tenths of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a> in diameter, are employed, each of which remains suspended in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of a certain specific gravity. The density of each of these beads, or rather bubbles, is regulated by the proportion between the quantity of glass and the cavity which the glass incloses. A piece of bees-wax, whose specific gravity, by the addition of lead, is such, that the body is just suspended in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRINE\">brine</a> of a known density, is used as an araeometer in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> works. The fresh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGG\">egg</a> of a common fowl is just sustained by brine of a certain specific gravity, and is employed as an araeometer.\n\nThe araeometer of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOMBERG\">Homberg</a>, consists of a phial, Homberg's, with a slender neck and glass-stopper, so made, that it may be filled with the same volume of different liquids. It is employed in finding the specific gravity of liquids in the following way: 1st, The phial is filled with distilled water, and then weighed in a balance; 2dly, The phial is emptied, and again filled with the liquid, whose specific gravity is sought, and weighed in a balance, the proportion of the weight of the contents of the phial in the second process to the weight of its contents in the first, is the specific gra-\nThe pressure of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a> supports columns of different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a>, whose height is inversely as the densities of the fluids. An arrometer has been constructed on this principle. It is a curved tube, one leg of which has its extremity immersed in water, and the other in the spirit whose density is to be tried. On rarifying the air in the tube, by means of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PUMP\">pump</a> fixed at the upper part of the tube, the water ascends in one leg, and the spirit in the other; the height of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> of each liquid being measured by a scale of equal parts applied to each branch of the tube. This instrument has never come into use, probably on account of the difficulty of ascertaining, with precision, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> at which the surfaces of the columns are terminated.

In preparing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> for semination; 2. In depositing the seed; 3. During the growth of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a>; 4. In reaping and securing the crop; 5. In preparing it for market; and, 6. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> purposes of a farm. But as the same implement is sometimes used for more than one purpose, it would be of little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> to adhere strictly to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> any other arrangement. The implements required for rendering land fit for tillage do not belong to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the article, and several others that have not yet been brought into general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>, or are employed only for particular purposes, shall be noticed under the sections to which they respectively belong.\n\n1. Ploughs.\n\nOf ploughs there are a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> many different sorts; and, besides the variety of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> occasioned by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of soils, and the different purposes for which they are employed even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, there is a considerable diversity in the form, in districts where both the soil and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of culture are nearly alike. The most obvious general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> among ploughs is, their being constructed with or without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHEELS\">wheels</a>; and each of these kinds may be again distinguished by other circumstances\u2014such as the form of the mould-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOARD\">board</a> and share; their operation in making one or more furrows at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>; their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIZE\">size</a>; and the depth at which they are calculated to work, as in trench-ploughing. It would neither be of much utility, nor at all consistent with our limits, to describe all the numerous varieties of form. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the operation to be performed, and the rules for constructing ploughs that shall be adapted to the different purposes of the cultivator, have been already pointed out in the body of the work; and, therefore, all that is necessary here is to mention those ploughs that are in most general use, in the best cultivated districts.\n\nThe Swing-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLOUGH\">Plough</a>, with a feathered sock or share, and a curved mould-board, is almost the only one used in Scotland, and throughout a considerable part of England. The old Scotch plough mentioned in our former article has been laid aside, except in a few of the least improved counties, where it is still found useful, when the soil is encumbered by roots or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>. The swing-plough is drawn with less power than wheel ploughs, the friction not being so great; and it probably admits of greater variations in regard to the breadth and depth of the furrow slice. It is usually drawn by two horses <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABREAST\">abreast</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> tillage; but for ploughing between the rows of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRILL\">drill</a> culture, a smaller one, drawn by one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>, is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> employed. A plough of this kind, having a mould-board on each side, is also used both in forming narrow ridges for turnips and potatoes, and in laying up the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> to the roots of the plants, after the intervals have been cleaned and pulverized by the horse and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> hoe. This plough is sometimes made in such a manner, that the mould-board may be shifted from one side to the other when working on hilly grounds; by which means the furrows are all laid in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>\u2014a mode of construction as old as the days of Fitzherbert, who wrote before the middle of the sixteenth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>. This is called a turn-west plough.\n\nSwing-ploughs, similar to the present, have been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> known in England. In Blythe's Improver Improved, (Edit. 1652,) we have engravings of several ploughs; and what he calls the \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> plough\" does not seem to differ much in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> parts from the one now in use. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMOS\">Amos</a>, in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> on Agricultural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACHINES\">Machines</a>, says that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> named Lunnus (whom he is mistaken in calling a Scotchman, see Maxwell's Practical Husbandman, p. 191.) first attempted its construction upon mathematical principles which he learned in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>; but having obtained a patent for the making and vending of this plough, he withheld the knowledge of these principles from the public. However, one Pashley, plough-wright to Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> Turner of Kirkleatham, having a knowledge of those principles, constructed upon them a vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of ploughs. Afterwards his son established a manufactory for the making of them at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROTHERHAM\">Rotherham</a>. Hence they obtained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of the Rotherham plough; but in Scotland they were called the Dutch or patent plough.\"\u2014\"At <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> the Americans, having obtained a knowledge of those principles, either from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> or Holland, claimed the priority of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>; in consequence of which, Mr Jefferson, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">President</a> of the United <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">States</a>, presented the principles for the construction of a mould-board, first to the Institute of France, and next to the Board of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">Agriculture</a> in England, as a wonderful discovery in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a>.\" (Communications to the Board of Agriculture, Vol. VI. p. 487.)\n\nAccording to another writer, the Rotherham plough was first constructed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORKSHIRE\">Yorkshire</a> in 1720, about ten years before Lunnus's improvements. (Survey of the West Riding of Yorkshire.)\n\nBut the present improved swing-plough was little known in Scotland till about the year 1764, when Small's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of constructing it began to excite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>.* This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> mechanic formed the mould-board upon distinct and intelligible principles, and afterwards made it of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>. His appendage of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a> has been since laid aside. It has been disputed, whether he took the Rotherham or the old Scotch plough for the basis of his improvements. The swing plough has been since varied a little, in some parts of Scotland, from Small's form, for the purpose of adapting it more completely to particular situations and circumstances. Of late this plough has been made entirely of iron. See Plate I.\n\nWheel-Ploughs, used in many parts of England, Wheel-are also constructed in a great variety of forms. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> recommendation is, that they require less skill in the ploughman; but it is admitted, that the friction caused by the wheels adds to the resistance, and that they are more expensive, and more liable to\n\n* Small's Treatise on Ploughs and Wheel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARRIAGES\">Carriages</a>, 1784; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Kames's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">Gentleman</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">Farmer</a>.","sp":337,"ep":338},{"h":"ARAUCANIA","t":"a territory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the western <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of South <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>, extending 186 miles in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>, between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> Biobio and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol21.html#article-VALDIVIA\">Valdivia</a>, and penetrating 420 miles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INLAND\">inland</a> to the foot of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANDES\">Andes</a>.

Originally, Araucania was of smaller dimensions, not reaching above 300 miles from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>-shore; but it received a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> accession by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNION\">union</a> of another territory belonging to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> Puelches, in the course of the seventeenth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>.\n\nThis is a pleasant and fertile <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, partly consisting of wide and extensive plains, partly mountainous, with spacious valleys interposed. It contains two considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>, Laquen, called Villarica by the Spaniards, 72 miles in circuit, with a conical islet in the centre; and Nahuelguapi, 80 miles in circuit, which also has an islet towards one side covered with trees. The latter is the source of a river of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a>, which, after a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> course, falls into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCEAN\">ocean</a>, near the Straits of Magellan; and the Talton, which discharges itself farther north into the sea, rises from the latter. A great volcanic mountain, fourteen miles in circumference at the base, and visible at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> of 150, stands near the lake Villarica. Its eruptions are not violent, though it is always in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> state. The summit is covered with snow, but lower <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>, perpetual verdure is intermixed with woods, and besides mineral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a>, several streams flow from it. Sulphur and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">Salt</a> are plentiful on Araucania, the eastern confines; and quantities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMBER\">Amber</a>-grease are thrown up on the coast. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINES\">Mines</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">Gold</a>, formerly yielding immense revenues, are said to exist in the southern parts, but ever since the natives expelled their Spanish invaders, they have prohibited resorting to them under pain of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. Possibly all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-REMEMBRANCE\">remembrance</a> of their site is lost, and the Araucanians are sufficiently prudent to avoid awakening the cupidity of neighbouring nations by discovering it. This precious metal is not rare beyond their confines. We are acquainted with the vegetable productions of this territory, only in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> with those of the surrounding country; they are numerous, useful, and afford a copious supply for the sustenance of mankind. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> and utility of a tree called the Pehuen, probably a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>-fruit, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> of some analogous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>, is particularly celebrated, as uniting the properties of the Pine, Chestnut and Frankincense. It is of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPONTANEOUS\">spontaneous</a> growth, requiring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> culture, and rises 80 feet in height, by about 8 in circumference; the whole tree at full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> being of a pyramidal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a> are conical, and its fruit, which is as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, is divided into cells, containing kernels resembling chestnuts. These are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATE\">ate</a> in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>, or sometimes reduced to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLOUR\">flour</a>, and preserved by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a>. A yellowish odoriferous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUM\">gum</a> exudes through the bark. The sea abounds in fishes, and various ph\u0153ne frequent the shores. Of these the sea Elephant is the largest, often being 22 feet in length, and 15 around the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>; it produces more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a>; and is so fat, that undulations under the skin are perceptible during its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>. Furious combats ensue among the males for possession of the females, which latter always retire until their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a>; and that for the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> is in the death of one or other of them. Their skins are generally covered with scars; yet notwithstanding the great size of the animal, and its warfare among its own species, a smart blow near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOSE\">nose</a> is invariably fatal. A species of Hippopotamus is said to inhabit some of the lakes and rivers of Araucania, different from that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>, but its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> is not sufficiently authenticated. However, it is only of late years that Naturalists have become acquainted with the real Hippopotamus, whose figure and habits were long considered to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FABULOUS\">fabulous</a>. One of the most useful animals in this country is the Chililhueque, a species of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIMINUTIVE\">diminutive</a> camel, greatly resembling the sheep, about 4 feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>, of various colours, grey, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> very soft <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a>, which is employed solely in manufacturing the finest cloths. Formerly, it was used as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAST\">beast</a> of burden; now it is highly prized by the inhabitants, by whom it is never killed except at festivals, or on occasion of solemn sacrifices.\n\nThe natives of the country now described, are called Inhabitants Araucans or Araucanians from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of Arauco, which forms a small portion of it. They denominate themselves <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARA\">Ara</a>, which signifies free, or unsubdued, though some European authors have affirmed, that both Auca and Araucanian originated with the Spaniards, as a name of reproach, signifying rebel or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANDITTI\">banditti</a>; and others, such as Falkner, says, that they denominate themselves generally moluches or warriors. Whatever may be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, they are a\nThe Araucanians do not differ from the ordinary stature of mankind; their persons are handsome; they are of a strong muscular form and martial appearance; their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a> is of a reddish brown, clearer than that of the other Americans; they have round faces, small expressive eyes, and small flat feet. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEFORMITY\">Deformity</a> among them is very rare. The women are of a fine delicate figure, and many, especially of one of their tribes called Boromees, are beautiful. The Araucanians possess uncommon vigour of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>, which is probably augmented by their free and uncontrolled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. Inhabiting a delightful country, and unaccustomed to that variability of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> which generates lasting distempers, they rarely become grey before attaining sixty or seventy years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>; many are to be seen who have reached an hundred; and to the latest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> and mental faculties remain equally entire.\n\nThese people are said to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> high in moral character; they are intrepid and patient of labour, enthusiastic admirers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, which has gained them the name of invincible from their enemies; courteous, and hospitable. But these good qualities are sullied, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> not altogether obscured, by numerous vices. They are prone to all kinds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRUNKENNESS\">drunkenness</a> and debauchery: they are haughty and presumptuous, entertaining a profound contempt for other nations, and considering <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> the only genuine source of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>; sentiments which powerfully conspire to keep barbarians barbarous. Not content with exercising their prowess against their neighbours, they practise invasions of each others <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>, and carry off quantities of spoil. But notwithstanding their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> violence, these private dissensions are generally confined to pilage, without bloodshed, for deadly weapons are seldom resorted to. Their animosity towards the Spaniards being originally roused by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> provocation, has remained for centuries unabated; and, in their incursions into their settlements, they have sometimes put all the men to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>, while the women were spared, and carried into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTIVITY\">captivity</a>. They have been called faithless and treacherous by that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>; but most probably more from resisting oppression, than from truly meriting such reproaches.\n\nThe Araucanians being a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> people, have adopted a suitable costume, consisting in clothes fitted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> to the body, and a mantle or cloth, called poncho, with an opening in the middle, to admit the head. Some of these are of so fine and elegant a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEXTURE\">texture</a>, as to sell for an hundred, or an hundred and fifty dollars. The head is begirt by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WREATH\">wreath</a> of embroidered wool, and ornamented with beautiful plumes, during warfare. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODESTY\">Modesty</a> and simplicity equally distinguish the dress of the women, which is entirely of woollen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STUFF\">stuff</a>, and consists of a piece descending to the feet, a girdle, and a cloak, called ichella; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> floats gracefully in tresses over their shoulders, and their heads are decorated with a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSE\">false</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMERALD\">emerald</a>, that is held in great estimation. Necklaces and bracelets are also wore for ornament, and rings on every finger. The national <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> for all the apparel of both sexes, especially among the lower classes, is greenish blue.\n\nThe Araucanians never inhabit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>: their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of independence has deterred them from living in places surrounded by walls, which they consider a mark of servitude: hence they dwell in cottages or hamlets scattered on the banks of rivers, or on plains: and, as their local attachments are strong, each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> prefers occupying the same bounds which have served for the subsistence of its forefathers. The houses are simple, kept remarkably clean and neat, and proportioned to the size of the family. They are surrounded by trees, under which they partake of their meals, in the open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> during <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>; and the wealthy are then fond of displaying their plate. These people are much less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARNIVOROUS\">carnivorous</a> than most uncivilized tribes, neither do they esteem fish grateful food, and they live chiefly on what is prepared from different kinds of grain. At their feasts, however, or marriages, funerals, and such public occasions, remarkable profusion prevails: three hundred individuals are then sometimes present; the feast lasts two or three days, and as much provision is consumed as would maintain an ordinary family during two years. Fermented liquors form a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> ingredient of the entertainment, and the guests testify great dissatisfaction, should they be at all sparingly supplied with it, whatever may be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>. Every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of property being anxious to entertain his friends, Bacchanalian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REVELS\">revels</a> succeed each other, almost without interruption; and they are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCCUPATION\">occupation</a> of the Araucanians, when free of warfare.\n\nCelibacy is thought reproachful here. Both sexes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">Marriage</a>, in that state are exposed to contemptuous expressions, and polygamy is practised to an unbounded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>. A man marries as many wives as he can afford to purchase, for the father of each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> receives a price on her being transferred to a husband. Marriage is attended with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> violence. The husband, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONCERT\">concert</a> with the father of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIDE\">bride</a>, accompanied by some friends, lies in wait near a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, where she knows she is to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a>. Notwithstanding her shrieks, and affected resistance, she is placed behind him on horseback, and is conducted with much clamour to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, where her relations receive the covenanted presents, after having partaken of a feast. The expense on such occasions is so considerable, that none except the rich can afford to marry many wives; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> are generally content with one or two. The first, however, is alone respected as the real or legitimate spouse; all the others are held in a secondary view; and she has the whole arrangement and regulation of the internal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> concerns. But it is no easy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> for the husband to repress the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JEALOUSY\">jealousy</a> and rivalry excited by the jarring inclinations of his different wives. Each must daily present him with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISH\">dish</a> of some food prepared by herself, in her own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KITCHEN\">kitchen</a> or fireplace; for which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a>, the Araucanians have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of fires in their houses equal to that of the women inhabiting them, and the most polite way of inquiring of any one how many wives he has, is asking \"how many fires he keeps?\" Each wife must, besides, supply her husband with a poncho or cloak yearly. They entertain great respect for their husbands; and in addition to their domestic duties,\nAraucanians, they have to perform all the most laborious operations. Both sexes practise several daily ablutions, in the course of which they become expert swimmers and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVERS\">divers</a>, and they are able to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> the largest rivers with great facility.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">Reading</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> are no part of the accomplishments of the Araucanians, nor can they be induced to acquire either; but they hold oratory in high estimation. Children are accustomed from an early period to speak in public, and are carried by their parents to the national assemblies, where the best Orators of the country display their eloquence; therefore much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> is paid to speaking correctly, and preserving their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> pure. So great is their precaution to avoid the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-INTRODUCTION\">introduction</a> of any foreign expressions, that if a stranger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> in their territory, he is compelled to abandon his own name, and assume one in the Araucanian language. The Missionaries who preach in the national language with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of making converts, are frequently interrupted by the audience when an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> escapes them. The speeches of the Araucanian Orators are said to be highly figurative, allegorical, and elevated; they contain all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHETORIC\">rhetoric</a>, and are constructed by its rules. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a> is impressive, and seems capable of being directed to the passions. They are fond of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a>, which is expressed in blank <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSE\">verse</a>, not in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RHYME\">rhyme</a>, and, like that of all barbarous nations, is employed on warlike exploits. Its images are bold, lively, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANIMATED\">animated</a>; for it has been truly observed, that unrestrained enthusiasm is the chief characteristic of the poetry of the uncivilized. Their learning, however, is very limited, and certainly the cultivation of poetry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not readily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> to its improvement. In physic, the Araucanians <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> in simples, or the practice of ceremonies; and their leading <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> ascribes the origin of all diseases to insects or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WITCHCRAFT\">witchcraft</a>. Ordinary remedies are resorted to for destroying the former; but for the latter, a different course is followed. The physician having lighted up the patient's room, desires the women to sing a doleful tune, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ACCOMPANIMENT\">accompaniment</a> of drums, while he fumigates the patient; and a sheep, about to be sacrificed, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOBACCO\">tobacco</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a>. Having killed the animal, and sucked some blood from its heart, he approaches the patient, pretending to inspect his belly for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POISON\">poison</a> which has been administered by some sorcerer, and then falls into a pretended swoon, accompanied by frightful contortions. While the sick <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a>'s relations question him concerning the cause of the evil, he answers in a manner the most suitable to the occasion, or fixes an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCUSATION\">accusation</a> on some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a>, which frequently leads to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> of the innocent in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a> of the supposed injury. Their physicians, however, are capable of reducing dislocated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SETTING\">setting</a> fractured <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a>; they can even perform wonderful cures of wounds, and have a slight skill in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISSECTION\">dissection</a>.\n\nThe Araucanians divide the year into twelve months, the names of which are characterized by their properties, as Avuin-cuyen, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>; Cogi-cuyen, the month of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARVEST\">harvest</a>; Huin-cuyen, the unpleasant month; Hacul-cuyen, the first month of winds; thus somewhat resembling the Prairial, Floreal, Nivose, in the revolutionary language of the French. They divide the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> into twelve parts, each Araucanian equal to two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a> with us in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>. The stars are classed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSTELLATIONS\">constellations</a>; they are acquainted with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANETS\">planets</a>; and some among them even entertain speculations of their being other inhabited worlds. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMETS\">Comets</a> are supposed to originate in terrestrial exhalations united in the higher regions; and they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CALL\">call</a> eclipses the death of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>. Few generations can avail themselves of the knowledge of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>, or preserve their own to posterity, where writing is not practised.\n\nThey have little acquaintance with the arts, and are ignorant of the principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>; chiefly employed in warfare, they are accustomed to constant privations, and thence abstain from those luxuries which are the offspring of a state of peace and the arts. Their principal manufacture consists of ponchos or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> cloaks, which some years ago they were wont to dispose of to the extent of 4000 annually, either to the neighbouring tribes or to the Spaniards: their other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of traffic are cattle, horses, feathers, and baskets of curious workmanship. They have the character of strict integrity in commercial transactions, which are conducted entirely by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BARTER\">barter</a>. They have no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, and for their own commodities receive wine, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, and hardware.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of the Araucanians bears some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> to the feudal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a>, but it does not appear, that, as in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, their lands are held by military <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TENURE\">tenure</a>. The whole territory is divided into four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> districts called Uthal-mapus, being the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARITIME\">maritime</a> country, the plains, the country at the foot of the Andes, and that which is occupied by part of these mountains. Each district is subdivided into five provinces, and each province contains <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> counties; therefore their total possessions are partitioned into an hundred and eighty parts. Each Uthal-mapu is governed by a chief, styled Toqui or commander, subordinate to whom are the Apo-Ulmenes, and on these, in so far as respects military affairs, are dependent, the Ulmenes, under whose immediate jurisdiction the counties are placed. All these orders have badges of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a>; the Toqui a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HATCHET\">hatchet</a>, the Apo-Ulmen a silver-headed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATON\">baton</a>, encircled by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a> on the middle, the Ulmen a baton simply with a silver head, and their dignities are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a>. The whole combine in a great national <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> usually held in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, where the pleasures of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> usually divide their attention with state affairs. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> council is vested with the power of declaring war; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a> of a military commander in chief, immediately follows a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> to that effect. Should none of the Toguis be themselves qualified for so important a station, any other person whatever may be chosen, even one of low rank: and on his appointment he assumes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of Toqui, bears the stone hatchet, which is laid aside by the rest, who now take an oath of fealty to him. He regulates the number of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> to be furnished by each portion of the state, and nominates the higher officers, who have the choice of their own subalterns. Meantime ex-warfare presses are secretly dispatched to all the allies of the nation, announcing the approach of hostilities: which are intimated by investing the envoy with a bundle of\nAraucan\u00eda. Arrows tied together with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> string; but if they have actually commenced, the finger of a slain enemy is added to the arrows. The armies consist of five or six thousand men, cavalry and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANTRY\">infantry</a>, though some authors who have written on this subject, deny that the whole country can produce such a force: the infantry is divided into regiments, of 1000 each, containing ten companies of 100 men: the cavalry is divided in the same manner, but the numbers are not always alike: their arms are swords and lances; those of the infantry, pikes or clubs pointed with iron. The onset of these troops is terrible; they bear every thing before them, and always try to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COPE\">cope</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> to hand with their foes. Each soldier, as was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> of Europe in feudal times, carries his own provisions, which consist only of a small bag of parched <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAL\">meal</a>; and this diluted with a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, generally proves sufficient subsistence until reaching an enemy's country, where he can live at free <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>. Their conflicts are conducted with great desperation, though, at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, wonderful regularity and subordination are preserved; but as all pant after military glory, and as valour is the only path to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POST\">post</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> is eagerly courted, where rank after rank is successively destroyed before defeat or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VICTORY\">victory</a> can be declared. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> over, and the spoils of war divided by equal portions, according to numbers, not in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to rank, the next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a> is a horrible sacrifice of one of the unfortunate captives to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANES\">manes</a> of those who have fallen, called Prolancon, or the dance of the dead. Many barbarous nations, nay some emerging from the darkness of their savage state, have been accustomed to offer up human sacrifices; and all mankind have believed, at one period or other in their progress to civilization, that blood was grateful to their Deities, or that it was necessary for the repose of their deceased relatives. Some, less cruel and sanguinary, have been content with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a> of the lower animals; but others, more atrocious, have shed the blood of their own species. This deliberate murder has been of three distinct descriptions: first, to propitiate Divinities, or to avert their wrath; secondly, that the victims might be useful to deceased persons passing to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> state; and thirdly, that the manes of those who had fallen in war might be appeased. The Prolancon, nevertheless, is seldom resorted to; but, when determined on, it is conducted with great formality. The miserable prisoner is seated on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>, deprived of its ears and tail, with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a> turned towards his own country, and ignominiously conducted amidst a circle of the Araucanians and their chiefs. There he is obliged to dig a hole in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>, wherein a number of rods are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> in succession; and while he repeats the names of the warriors of his nation, the surrounding soldiers accompany his words with contempt and execrations. He is next ordered to cover the hole, as if to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURY\">bury</a> the reputation and value of his fellow warriors, whom he has just named. Then the Togui, or one of his bravest companions, ambitious of the honour, dashes out the brains of the unfortunate victim with a club. But the solemnity is not yet completed; for, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CANNIBAL\">cannibal</a>-like ferocity, his heart is instantly torn out, and presented to the Chief, who, sucking a little of the blood, transmits it to his officers, to follow his Araucan\u00eda example. Should the skull of the prisoner not have been fractured by the violence of the blow, a cup is made of it, which, as is told of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Scythians, is used at the succeeding banquets. Meanwhile the soldiers strip the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> from off the bones, in order to procure them for flutes; and, having cut off the head, carry it on a pike around their circle, stamping a measured <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">march</a>, and vociferating the war <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SONG\">song</a> of Savages. In the next place, the head of a sheep is applied to the mangled corpse, and the whole ceremony closes with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of riot and intoxication. Should a truce follow victory or defeat, and both, or either side be weary of the contest, the parties meet in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONGRESS\">congress</a>, and an Araucanian Orator makes a speech on the evils of war, the advantages of peace, and the most eligible means of mutually preserving it. A branch of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CINNAMON\">cinnamon</a>-tree is here a pacific <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMBLEM\">emblem</a>, as that of the olive is elsewhere. If the enemies are Spaniards, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">President</a> or leader makes an answer adapted to the circumstances of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>; and articles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a> having been agreed upon, several chiliqueques are sacrificed for its permanence. The Chiefs of each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PARTY\">party</a> then participate of a meal together, and presents are distributed to those of the Araucanians. It is affirmed, that, as the latter suffer least from warfare, and conduct it without much difficulty, they never sue for peace, and thence that the first overtures always proceed from the Spaniards, with whom they have incessantly been engaged in bloody and destructive contests. But it is rather to be inferred, from the best authorities, that they have not invariably <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> equal confidence; and that their numbers, at the end of a war, have been so greatly diminished, as to make them as desirous as their foes of pacification. A congress must frequently be repeated, as without it, the Araucanians, a haughty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>, would consider themselves neglected and despised, and go to war for no other reason.\n\nThe civil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CODE\">code</a> of these people is very limited, and, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as their criminal laws, rest entirely on consuetudinary principles, none being written. The latter chiefly respect the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> of murder, robbery, witchcraft, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADULTERY\">adultery</a>, and treachery, which are all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> offences. The murderer, however, can escape by a pecuniary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> with the relatives of the deceased; and husbands and fathers are not subject to any punishment for putting their wives or children to death, because they are judged to be the natural masters of their lives. Persons accused of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SORCERY\">sorcery</a> are first tortured by fire, on purpose to obtain a discovery of their accomplices, and then stabbed with daggers. Execution immediately follows the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> is sometimes administered in a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> and tumultuous manner. Impatient of delay, the Araucanians often <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of retaliation in lesser offences, which leads to the subversion of all public order, and is the source of many enormities in their turn becoming the objects of this kind of retributive justice.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> of the Araucanians is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> of absurdity invented by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGNING\">designing</a> or superstitious, and imposed on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a> and credulous whom they found ready to receive it; but, amidst that absurdity, containing some principles which have generally\nAraucania, been admitted by the more reflecting part of mankind. They are said to believe in a Supreme Being, who has subordinate Deities, like their own subaltern officers. One of these is the god of war, another a benevolent, and a third a malevolent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a>, who is called Guecubu. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> is the most active <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a> of all others, and the source of every misfortune. If a horse dies, it is because the Guecubu has rode him; if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> trembles, it is because the Guecubu has given it a shock; nor does a person ever die, who is not suffocated by the Guecubu. Such is the language of the Missionaries, from whom alone our principal knowledge of the Araucanians is derived. However, these Divinities receive no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADORATION\">adoration</a>; they have no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a>, and only on occasion of some severe calamity, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONCLUSION\">conclusion</a> of a peace, are sacrifices offered to them. Then the Araucanians immolate animals, and burn tobacco, which is esteemed the most grateful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCENSE\">incense</a>. The Supreme Being, and the benevolent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEITY\">Deity</a>, are invoked on urgent occasions,\u2014those which most naturally induce mankind to seek the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-PROTECTION\">protection</a> of superior powers. Christianity has never made any progress among this nation; and although the Missionaries are well treated, respected, and allowed ample liberty to preach their doctrines, they are utterly unsuccessful in making converts. The Araucanians are extremely superstitious; they have implicit confidence in omens and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVINATION\">divination</a>, particularly such as may be gathered from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DREAMS\">dreams</a>, or the flight of birds; and he who has confronted death with intrepidness in battle, will tremble at the sight of an owl. They entertain uncommon apprehensions of pretended sorcerers, who they imagine keep under control a kind of beings partaking of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of men and animals, concealed in caverns by day, but let loose to transform themselves into nocturnal birds, that shoot invisible arrows at their enemies as they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRAVERSE\">traverse</a> the air. On all occasions they consult Soothsayers, who boast of their own powers, and give firm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> to their predictions. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-IMMORTALITY\">immortality</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> is a principle admitted by the Araucanians; they maintain that the human frame is compounded of two substances essentially different, one destructible on death, the other incorruptible and incorporeal, which exists for ever. They have also wavering <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> about a place of future reward and punishment, situated to the west beyond the sea; but regarding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> state of the virtuous or the vicious, they are not agreed. Their funerals are ceremoniously conducted. The body of the deceased, clothed in his best attire, is laid on a high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BIER\">bier</a> or scaffold, where it remains during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> is passed by the relatives in weeping, or in eating with those who come to offer consolation. This meeting is called caricahuin, or the black entertainment. On <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a> the place of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERMENT\">interment</a>, a woman walks behind strewing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASHES\">ashes</a> on the way, to prevent the soul, it is supposed, from returning to its late abode; and the body being laid on the ground, is surrounded with arms and other instruments, and covered with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYRAMID\">pyramid</a> of earth or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>. Sometimes a horse is killed and inclosed among them. But no sooner do the relatives retire, than, according to their ideas, an old woman comes in the shape of a whale, to transport the deceased to the Elysian fields, though before his arrival, a toll is exacted by another Araucanian old woman guarding a very narrow passage, who malevolently deprives the passenger of an eye, in event of refusal. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELYSIUM\">Elysium</a> the same functions are exercised by the souls of the deceased as on earth; husbands have the same wives, but the latter have no children, because that region cannot be inhabited by any but the spirits of the departed. They may revisit their own country, still possessing the same properties as when united to the body; and the Araucanians conceive that the tempests of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a> which they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WITNESS\">witness</a>, originate from their furious combats in the air. A storm never happens among the Andes, or on the ocean, which they do not ascribe to a battle between the souls of their deceased countrymen, and those of the Spaniards; the roaring of the wind is the trampling of their horses; thunder the rolling of drums; and lightning the flashes of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTILLERY\">artillery</a>. If the course of the storm travels towards the Spanish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONTIER\">frontier</a>, they believe that the spirits of their countrymen are victorious; if it approaches their own territory, they are overwhelmed with consternation, and encourage them to be firm and resist their enemies.\n\nThough the Araucanians wander about their own country, they are rarely seen out of it, unless while waging war; sometimes they cross to the eastern parts of South America, and, meeting with another tribe called Pampas, repair to Buenos-Ayres, there passing for the people of that nation.\n\nOur knowledge of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> is limited nearly to the period when the American Continent was visited by Europeans in the fifteenth century; and as they are themselves destitute of written records, it must be sought among the Spanish Chronologers. About the year 1450, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCA\">Inca</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERU\">Peru</a> attempted the conquest of the extensive region of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHILI\">Chili</a>, and consequently, of Araucania along with it; but his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> retired on being defeated in a sanguinary engagement. A century later the Spaniards having gained a firm establishment in America, resolved to extend their conquests, but were obstinately opposed by the Araucanians with a body of 4000 men, led beyond their own confines; and their conduct on this occasion, though they did not prove victorious, impressed their enemies with apprehensions which have never abated. The Spaniards were at length enabled to form settlements within their boundaries; and sometime after, Pedro de Valdivia, a celebrated officer, was defeated in a pitched battle, taken prisoner, and dispatched with the blow of a club, about the close of the year 1553. A period of bloody warfare followed, which cost the Araucanians the life of their favourite commander Lautaro, whose talents were held in the highest esteem. Though sufficiently exasperated before, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESENTMENT\">resentment</a> was inflamed still farther against the Spaniards for their barbarous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTILATION\">mutilation</a> of those unfortunate prisoners who fell into their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>. One of their bravest commanders Caupolic\u00e1n, being treacherously betrayed after a gallant resistance, was condemned to be impaled alive, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a> with arrows; but when brought to the place of punishment, and beholding the ignominy that awaited him, he hurled the executioner from the scaffold, exclaiming, \"Is there no sword,\"\nAraucanians, and some less cowardly hand to be found to put to death a man like myself? This has nothing of justice in it,\u2014it is base revenge.\" But the merciless Spaniards were deaf to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a>. Various successes and discomfits ensued, when, about the termination of the sixteenth century, the Araucanians besieged the enemy in the fortress of Puren. Unable to reduce the place so speedily as he desired, their chief presented himself before it, mounted on a fine horse recently taken from the governor, and challenged the Commander, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DON\">Don</a> Garcia Ramon, to single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBAT\">combat</a> at the end of three days. The defiance being accepted, the Chieftains met, each accompanied by a small body of men who stood at a distance. Putting spurs to their horses, they advanced impetuously, but at the first encounter the Araucanian Toqui was pierced through the body by his adversary's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANCE\">lance</a>. Refusing to acknowledge himself vanquished, he endeavoured to remount his horse, but in doing so expired. These events were followed by the siege of Villarica, an rich and populous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> belonging to the Spaniards, which, after a resistance of two years and eleven months, fell into the hands of the Araucanians. A similar fate awaited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERIAL\">Imperial</a>' and Osorno, other cities of equal importance, and their inhabitants were led into captivity. Incessant wars, with very short intervals of repose, occupied almost the whole of the seventeenth century, and thousands after thousands fell in their prosecution. But the Araucanians received an important accession to their strength, in the union of a warlike tribe called Puelches, which was thenceforth incorporated under the same government. The eighteenth century did not open more auspiciously; for although a cessation of hostilities had prevailed some time, the Araucanians became sensible that it afforded opportunities for the Spaniards to form new and permanent establishments within their territories: the arrogance of those who resided among them, under pretence of protecting the missionaries, had also excited their indignation. Villumilla, a man of low origin but distinguished abilities, was appointed military Toqui, or commander in chief, and formed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> for expelling the Spaniards from the whole coast. But his attempt to raise his own and the neighbouring countries, in the year 1723, proved abortive, and the war was marked by nothing except some inconsiderable skirmishes. Peace having been restored, the Spanish governor conceived a scheme for the civilization of the Araucanians (regarded as chimerical by those best acquainted with their disposition), which was persuading them to live in cities. They agreed, however, to build a city, and were supplied with materials by the Spaniards, who also had assistants and superintendents on the spot, but suddenly seizing their arms, they killed their overseers, about the year 1753. Peace was once more interrupted by repeated encounters, and at length a bloody battle ensued in the year 1773. The Spaniards found themselves unable to retain any settlements within the Araucanians' territories, and the natives, in opposition to all the skill and force employed against them, have ever since been able to keep possession of their country.

He studied <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">Mathematics</a> with distinguished success under Clairaut the elder, and had for his fellow-student the celebrated Clairaut the son. He obtained a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> in the French army; and, in 1746, was embarked in the expedition which was intended to make a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> in Scotland. He was made prisoner, and was treated like other prisoners of war, no notice being taken of his having been born a British subject. He <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> attached to the House of Stuart during the whole of his life.\n\nIn 1760, he published his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTILLERY\">Artillery</a>. To estimate the force of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPLOSION\">explosion</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUN\">gun</a>-powder, he employed a cannon suspended, so that the arc of vibration described by it on its being fired, was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of the force of explosion. To measure the initial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a> of a projectile, he used Robins' machine. Robins showed, that when the velocity of a projectile is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a>, the resistance opposed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> is not in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> of the velocity, as is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> when the velocity is small. D'Arcymade experiments with a view of ascertaining this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, but without success. His work contains an account of experiments made by him to determine the most advantageous length of cannon. He published a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> on hydraulic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACHINES\">machines</a> in 1754, where he treats of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MAXIMUM\">maximum</a> of effect of water-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHEELS\">wheels</a>. He also published a paper concerning the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> of the impression of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> on the retina. He found that the revolution of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUMINOUS\">luminous</a> point must be rapid, so as to be performed in \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> at the least, in order to produce the appearance of a continued luminous circle.\n\nHe was of a handsome <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, and passed much of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> in the gay world.

A little wheat is raised near Campbeltown, and in other parts of Kintyre; and a few patches of turnips are occasionally seen, but chiefly on the farms of proprietors. Clovers also, though more frequent, have not yet come into extensive culture, notwithstanding these, and other green crops, are better adapted, both to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> and the leading branches of the husbandry of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, than grain. The principal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> in the culture of bigg is the supply of the distilleries. The great body of the inhabitants live almost exclusively on oatmeal and potatoes; of the former of which they have been in the practice of importing about 20,000 bolls (of 140 lbs.) annually. Considerable progress, indeed, has been made of late in the improvement of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>, but this is necessarily limited by the small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> of land fit for profitable cultivation; there being only 125,000 acres arable out of 1,408,000 which this part of Argyreshire contains; as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> in which, till very lately, farms were held\u2014without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LEASES\">leases</a>\u2014and for performance of many vexatious services.

These cattle are sent from the country in a store condition, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> when about three years old, and fattened on the pastures of the south, the greater number for the consumption of England. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAIRY\">dairy</a> begins to be an object of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENINSULA\">peninsula</a> of Kintyre, where there is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> proportion of arable land, but cannot be extended to the inland and more mountainous districts of the county.\n\nUntil the middle of last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, the only sheep in Argyleshire (and their number was inconsiderable), were of the small native race, the same that are still to be found in the Hebrides, and in most parts of the Highlands of Scotland and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a>. About that period coarse woollen heath sheep were introduced into the higher and more barren districts; and as it was soon discovered that the scanty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERBAGE\">herbage</a> of these gloomy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>, could be converted into a much greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of mutton than of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEEF\">beef</a>, besides yielding a valuable article of manufacture,\u2014these hardy animals soon spread over extensive regions, upon which cattle could barely subsist in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> months; and the income of the landed proprietors, and of the public, was accordingly augmented in proportion. Notwithstanding the outcry of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a>, and the more mischievous speculations of mistaken philanthropy, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-INTRODUCTION\">introduction</a> of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of live stock, now increased to about 300,000, has not, as we shall see immediately, had the effect of diminishing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> of Argyleshire.\n\nIn this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of the County, there is a considerable extent of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> coppice woods; probably near 40,000 acres, which are cut periodically, commonly every 19 or 20 years, and are understood to return about 20s. per <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACRE\">acre</a> annually. Very extensive plantations have been formed by the Duke of Argyle and other proprietors. About 20 years ago, those of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRACE\">Grace</a> were reckoned to contain 2,000,000 of trees, then worth 4s. each, amounting to the enormous sum of L. 400,000.\n\nNext in importance to its agriculture, are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FISHERIES\">fisheries</a>, which, from the great extent of sea coast, and the form of the district, penetrated in almost every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> by arms of the sea, and traversed by extensive lakes, ought to furnish food and employment to the inhabitants, to an extent, perhaps, still greater than their barren territory and ungenial climate can supply. Some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> of their great importance may be formed, when we are told that the herrings caught in Lochfyne alone, in the years 1794 and 1795, were computed to be worth more than L. 80,000 (Smith's Survey, 1798). But the regulations of the revenue laws in regard to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> are universally complained of, as an intolerable grievance; forming an insuperable obstruction to the industry of the lower classes, who have not the means, nor even the knowledge, which a strict compliance with these regulations requires. Whole cargoes of herrings have been thrown into the sea in a putrid state, and others used as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANURE\">manure</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the inability of the fishermen to find surety for the requisite supply of salt, according to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a>.\n\nThe mainland of Argyleshire is principally composed of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIMITIVE\">primitive</a> rocks, which, in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>, are skirted and intermixed with those of the transition <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a>; while fl\u00f6tz rocks occur very sparingly. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a> volcanic rocks have hitherto been met with in the mainland of Argyleshire, but those of an alluvial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> abound everywhere. The primitive and transition rocks are stratified, and the general direction of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRATA\">strata</a> is from NE. to SW. The primitive rocks are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANITE\">granite</a>, gneiss, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MICA\">mica</a> slate, clay slate, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">limestone</a>, porphyry, sienite, trap, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTZ\">quartz</a> rock. The transition rocks are greywacke, greywacke slate, clay slate, trap, and quartz; and the fl\u00f6tz rocks are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> sandstone, conglomerate, and rocks of the coal formation. The Islands off the coast of Argyleshire afford highly interesting examples of rocks of the different classes; Isla and Jura of the primitive and transition rocks; Mull of fl\u00f6tz and primitive rocks; Staffa, Rum, and Cannay, of fl\u00f6tz rocks; and Coll, Tyree, and Iona, of primitive rocks.\n\nCoal has been wrought for many years near Campbelltown in Kintyre, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> at Strontian in Sunart; and besides the slate quarries of Eisdale, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">Island</a> belonging to this County, others have been opened at Ballachelish in Appin.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">Manufactures</a> have made little progress in this district, and no attempts to establish them upon a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a> have yet been successful. Mr Dale endeavoured to extend to it some branches of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COTTON_MANUFACTURE\">cotton manufacture</a>, which failed, it is said, from want of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> carriage; but a number of weavers in Campbelltown and its neighbourhood, have been employed for some time in working cottons from Glasgow. The late Duke of Argyle, almost 40 years ago, set on foot a woollen manufactory near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERARY\">Inverary</a>, which, notwithstanding very uncommon encouragement given to it by his Grace and the other landed proprietors, has been long in rather a languishing state. There is a bleachfield in Kintyre; tanneries at Campbelltown and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBAN\">Oban</a>; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> works in Upper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORN\">Lorn</a> and at Loch-\nArgyleshire fine, below Inverary, belonging to English companies, who bring the ore thither, chiefly for the sake of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARCOAL\">charcoal</a> which the woods afford; and near Campbelltown, the formation of salt from sea water has been lately carried on to some extent. The manufacture of kelp from sea weed, to the extent of 600 tons annually, is none of the least profitable branches of industry; and that of their scanty crops of grain into ardent spirits, certainly the most pernicious.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">Commerce</a>. The commerce of Argyleshire is also very limited, its exports consisting chiefly of raw produce; sheep and cattle, and fish, form at least two thirds of the whole: The imports are almost confined to the supply of necessaries, including only such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a>, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> has rendered scarcely less indispensable.\n\nBut, though such is the present state of this extensive territory, there is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> to anticipate a great increase of its wealth, of its industry, and of its population, as soon as a revisal of the revenue laws shall have removed the present obstacles to the prosecution of the fisheries. It is upon this species of industry, that the prosperity of the County must be founded; and it is only after wealth has flowed in from this source, that the inhabitants can be expected to succeed in manufactures or in commerce. To its natural advantages, a very important addition has been made by the Crinan Canal, cut across the peninsula of Kintyre, at an expense of L. 140,000; which shortens the voyage from the West Highland and Hebridean <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAMPS\">Camps</a>, ports, to the river Clyde, about 200 miles. The Caledonian Canal, from the access it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> give the County to the German Ocean, and still more, from the frequent intercourse of which it will be the channel, must contribute, in an eminent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, to the prosperity of Argyleshire.\n\nThe population of the whole County, as taken under the Acts 1800 and 1811, will be seen from the following Tables:\n\n### 1800\n\n| DISTRICTS | HOUSES | OCCUPATIONS | PERSONS |\n|-----------|--------|-------------|---------|\n|           | Inhabited | By how many Families occupied | Uninhabited | Persons chiefly employed in Agriculture | Persons chiefly employed in Trade, Manufactures, or Handicraft | All other Persons not comprised in the two preceding classes | Males | Females | Total of Persons |\n| Argyle    | 2578    | 2827        | 4       | 3494 | 671 | 9087 | 6764 | 7984 | 14,148 |\n| Cowal     | 1259    | 1380        | 13      | 901  | 415 | 5268 | 3064 | 3470 | 6534  |\n| Islay     | 2370    | 2293        | 1       | 3309 | 754 | 6253 | 6045 | 6727 | 12,772 |\n| Kintyre   | 2884    | 3496        | 8       | 4252 | 1079| 11,105| 7706 | 9007 | 16,713 |\n| Lorn      | 2439    | 2581        | 4       | 5254 | 808 | 7020 | 6146 | 6936 | 13,082 |\n| Mull      | 1579    | 1601        | 2       | 1868 | 468 | 5151 | 4042 | 4568 | 8610  |\n\nTotal: 13,109 | 14,278 | 32 | 19,078 | 4195 | 43,884 | 33,767 | 38,099 | 71,859 |\n\n### 1811\n\n| DISTRICTS | HOUSES | OCCUPATIONS | PERSONS |\n|-----------|--------|-------------|---------|\n|           | Inhabited | By how many Families occupied | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">Building</a> and uninhabited | Families chiefly employed in Agriculture | Families chiefly employed in Trade, Manufactures, or Handicraft | All other Families not comprised in the two preceding classes | Males | Females | Total of Persons |\n| Argyle    | 2702    | 3720        | 76      | 1568 | 545 | 1607 | 7729 | 7908 | 15,637 |\n| Cowal     | 1212    | 1276        | 44      | 789  | 329 | 158  | 3318 | 3569 | 6887  |\n| Islay     | 2636    | 2687        | 1162    | 1284 | 615 | 788  | 6814 | 7348 | 14,162 |\n| Kintyre   | 2959    | 3733        | 62      | 1074 | 984 | 1735 | 8404 | 9882 | 18,286 |\n| Lorn      | 2721    | 2845        | 353     | 1064 | 752 | 1029 | 6462 | 7317 | 13,779 |\n| Mull      | 3010    | 3107        | 24      | 2642 | 254 | 211  | 7948 | 8886 | 16,884 |\n\nTotal: 15,240 | 17,368 | 1721 | 8421 | 3419 | 5528 | 40,675 | 44,910 | 85,585 |\n\n* No returns for Kilfinichen and Kilvicuen; population in 1791, Tyree, population in 1792, Rum, Cannay, and Muck, population in 1795.\n\nThe whole population in 1800 must therefore have amounted to 78,217.

The common fathers of Vegetable Anatomy, Grew and Malpighi, who, at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, but in different countries, prosecuted their inquiries, for many years, without any knowledge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> with each other, are nearly of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> all the more important <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> in relation to these vessels. Later writers have differed alike from them, and from each other, on almost every point. As the subject is of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> importance in the economy of vegetables, we shall endeavour, at the risk even of a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>, to set before the reader the leading facts and opinions concerning it; to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CANVASS\">canvass</a> their relative merits; and deduce from the whole such conclusions as seem most nearly to approach the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>.\n\n19. Malpighi describes spiral vessels as existing in Opinion of the ligneous parts of all plants. He called them Malpighi; spiral tubes, because, when extended, they were resolved, not into separate rings, but into a single zone, which might be drawn out to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a>, they form continuous tubes, but are sometimes contracted at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> distances, so as to resemble somewhat a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a> cells. One of these contracted spiral vessels is represented in fig. 14, Plate XV. at the extremity of which, the spiral filament is in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> drawn out, and similar appearances of the spiral structure are exhibited in figures 9 and 10. by Mirbel. In herbs, according to Malpighi, these spiral vessels constantly accompany the common sap-vessels, and are ensheathed by them; in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHRUBS\">shrubs</a>, they occur in every part of the wood, single or in clusters; and in trees, an intermixture of spiral vessels with the common sap-vessels, is observed in every part of the wood. In the Fir, they are found immediately beneath the bark, and are so numerous as to constitute the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> bulk of the wood. They exist with the sap-vessels in the petioles and ribs of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a>, and likewise in the petals of the flower. In\nElementary the roots, they are also met with, and in some roots Organs are so abundant, as to exceed in bulk all the other parts. They exist, he adds, in every part of the plant except the bark; and are annually formed with the albuminous vessels of trees. (Anatom. Plantar. passim.)\n\n20. From the writings of Grew we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLECT\">collect</a> also, that spiral vessels exist in every part of a plant, except the bark. In the root they are numerous, of very various size, and their bore is generally larger than that of the common sap-vessels. In the trunks, both of herbs and trees, they are equally visible; and in position, size, and number, subject to great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a>. Sometimes they are collected into fasciculi; at other times they are disposed in rays; and in other instances they are arranged in a circular form: They stand sometimes next to the pith, in other instances next to the bark; and in other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> again, they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> with the common sap-vessels in every part of the wood. They have a more ample bore than the common vessels, and vary in size to at least twenty different degrees. In the leaf, they always accompany the sap-vessels; and both in its petiole and ribs, are constantly surrounded or ensheathed by them. They have a similar position in the petals of the flower, and in the vascular parts of the fruit. (Anatomy of Plants, passim.) Hence, then, it appears, from the dissections of Malpighi and Grew, that, in every plant in which vessels are to be seen, and almost in every part of it, spiral vessels abound; they exist, however, only in the ligneous portion, or that part in which the sap ascends, and are never to be found in the bark.\n\n21. By Du Hamel, the spiral vessels, supposed to convey <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, are described as existing in the leaves and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a>, the petals of which are almost wholly composed of them. In the herbaceous portion of young branches, they are also <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> seen; which portion afterwards becomes ligneous; so that it cannot be doubted that they exist in the wood, though he could never discover them but in young branches. (Phys. des Arbres, Tom. I. p. 42.) <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a>, however, all the empty vessels, seen in a transverse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> of the wood, be deemed air-vessels, and all air-vessels have a spiral structure, then, says this author, they would, in many plants, form a great part of the ligneous body. From these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> vessels, however, he has seen, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUTUMN\">autumn</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a> to escape; so that they are not properly air-vessels, or, as Grew observed, they sometimes carry sap. They are not to be found in the bark.\n\n22. Under the common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of sap-vessels, Hill delineates all the varieties of vessels that constitute the wood; they are largest in the outer circles, smaller in the others; they contain, says he, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> and at midsummer, a limpid liquor; but at all other seasons they appear empty, and have therefore been erroneously deemed air-vessels. He says nothing of their spiral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a>; but describes the vessels, which form the chief <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of the wood, as possessing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> and firm coats, forming an arrangement of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> and simple tubes; as in fig. 6. Plate XV.; resembling those of the albumen, except that they have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> mouths in their sides. (On the Construction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">Timber</a>, p. 8 & 19.) But though, with Du Hamel, he was unable to trace their spiral structure in the wood, yet there can be no doubt of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> in that part; which, as we shall afterwards show, has been recently demonstrated by Kieser.\n\n23. M. Reichel maintains their existence in all parts of the plant. By causing plants to vegetate in coloured fluids, he traced them from the roots, through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a> and branches, to the extremity of the leaves, and into all parts of the flower,\u2014as the calyx, the petals, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a>, the stamens, and the anthers. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> and in seeds, and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RADICLE\">radicle</a> and plume of the latter, they were equally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a>. The coloured liquors, as they rose, communicated a tinge to the cellular tissue of the wood, as was previously observed by De la Baisse; but no trace of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> was ever observed either in the bark or pith, which therefore contains no spiral vessels. He considered the spiral vessels as the organs everywhere conveying nutrient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> to the plant, and as having no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> to the appellation of air-vessels. (Encyclop. M\u00e9thodique, Article Physiol. V\u00e9g\u00e9t. p. 288.) Similar experiments of Hedwig and others, confirm these facts as to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a> of the spiral vessels, and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> to every part the fluids absorbed by the roots. In his late <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, M. Kieser, as we shall afterwards see, in describing the vascular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of the ligneous parts of plants, regards it as composed entirely of spiral vessels, and asserts their existence in every part of the plant except the bark and pith.\n\n24. Against these combined authorities M. Mirbel opposes his fanciful views. We have already enumerated the five different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of vessels which he regards as constituting the woody part of plants. According to him, true spiral vessels (which he continues to denominate tracheae) are not to be found in the root, but only in the trunk and the parts which are produced from it. Even in the trunk, they are to be found only around the pith, and never in the exterior ligneous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAYERS\">layers</a>. He admits that they exist in all soft and succulent parts, and that coloured fluids rise in them as well as in the other varieties of vessels; but they never are to be found either in the bark or pith. (Exposition de la Th\u00e9orie de l'Organisation V\u00e9g\u00e9tale, p. 74, 78.) It appears, therefore, that the vessels which are thus erroneously called tracheae, are destined to carry fluids; and as to the parts in which they do or do not occur, the opinion of M. Mirbel weighs as nothing with us, in opposition to the facts observed by so many preceding and subsequent writers.\n\n25. From the combined observations, therefore, of all the preceding writers, with the exception of M. Mirbel, we collect that the vessels heretofore called air-vessels and tracheae, and which possess a spiral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CONFORMATION\">conformation</a>, exist together with those called common sap-vessels, in every part and organ of the plant, except the bark. It appears also, that, though they are often found empty, yet their true office is to carry sap. This may be concluded not only from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> occurrence of sap in them early in spring and again in autumn, and from the entrance of coloured fluids at all seasons; but from the circumstance that, in some parts, no other vessels appear to exist by\nElementary which the rising sap can be conveyed. Are we, therefore, with many, to consider them, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of their formation, as a species distinct from the common sap-vessels, or are both to be held merely as varieties of one common kind?\n\n26. It is allowed, on all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, that spiral vessels are most readily visible, and are most numerous in the tender and succulent parts of vegetables, in which they form almost the entire bulk of the vascular portion. In the albuminous part of trees, which is added annually to the pre-existing wood, they are not so readily seen. Even in trees, however, while still succulent, the first circle of vessels formed, contains spiral vessels; as Du Hamel observes, and even Mirbel admits; but, at a later period of vegetable growth, the whole of the vessels, formed annually in trees, are represented by Grew as common vessels, which, he adds, \"begin to be formed in spring; but the spiral vessels not till the latter end of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, or thereabouts, at least not till about that time do they appear.\" (Anatomy of Plants, p. 131.) Malpighi also describes these spiral vessels as gradually appearing in the albumen, and continually augmenting in size in every successive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a> of wood. A similar remark, as to increase of size, is made by Grew: \"the spiral vessels,\" says he, \"being amplified in each annual ring, at least for a certain number of years, so as to form a vessel of a wider bore:\" (Anatomy of Plants, p. 139.) and accordingly, in all the plates of both these writers, and in those of other authors, the spiral vessels are always represented of different sizes in every part of the wood.\n\n27. From the foregoing facts, it would seem, that, in the young and succulent parts of plants, the spiral construction of the vessels is almost, if not actually, coeval with their existence; but that, in more rigid textures, they are not so early formed, or at least are not discoverable in parts in which they are subsequently seen. Hence, therefore, we must suppose a sort of transformation to occur with respect to these vessels, or, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of Grew, that they \"are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POST\">post</a>-nate, and seem produced by some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, position, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEXTURE\">texture</a> of their fibres.\" If, indeed, spiral vessels exist in every part of the wood, but are not for some time visible in the albumen, and if the albumen be, as it most certainly is, the substance by which the ligneous layers are successively formed, then it follows, that the occurrence of spirals in the wood must be the result of some change induced on the vessels that at first constituted the albumen. Hedwig, indeed, considered all the albuminous vessels to possess from the first a spiral conformation, and that they gradually acquired the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> they possess in the wood. We shall presently see that the researches of Kieser support the same view, and thus go to establish the doctrine of transformation, first announced by Grew. Mirbel, however, protests against the transformation of one variety of vessel into another, and maintains that each of the five species, which he enumerates, retains, without change, its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> character and form. He nevertheless describes his fourth species, or what he calls mixed tubes, (fig. 10.) as composed of the three preceding species; and \"such,\" he adds, \"is the simplicity of vegetable organization, that frequently one and the same tube exhibits (as in fig. 12.) all the several species combined.\" (Expos. de la Th\u00e9orie, &c. p. 78, 80.) That the same vessel, from the operation of local causes, should sometimes exhibit, in different parts, a variety of appearance and form, is perfectly consistent with the principle of change and transformation which has been supposed to have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>; but that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> should from the first combine in one vessel, unsusceptible of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> change, five different species of forms, is not quite so credible; and to ordinary minds would certainly afford no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the \"simplicity\" of her operations.\n\n28. If then we adopt the opinion, that in young and succulent parts the vessels which carry sap have a variety of Sap-Vessels from the first a spiral construction; and if, as seems to be proved by the dissections of Grew, of Hedwig, and of Kieser, no other vessels, destined to such an office are, frequently, to be found, then we must conclude that, in such parts, only one species of sap-vessels exists, to which, from the first, the spiral construction belongs. If, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, it appear that, in the more rigid texture of the albumen of trees, no spiral vessels are at first to be found, but that they afterwards become visible in the wood, then it follows, from what has been already stated, that the spiral vessels of the wood are produced from the common sap-vessels of the albumen, and are consequently to be regarded, not as an original species, but only as a variety of one common kind. That such probably is the fact, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> farther appear from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> afterwards to be given of the structure of these vessels, and of the actual transformations which they seem to undergo. Even those who may still be of opinion, that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> form warrants a nominal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> of species, must, we think, admit that, in office, no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> for such distinction exists; but that all the vessels in the ligneous parts of plants are destined to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> one and the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a>. In relation to the economy of vegetables, this is a fact of far greater importance than any opinions that may be formed regarding the varieties of appearance or structure in the vessels themselves.\n\nArticle IV.\n\nOf the Structure of the Sap and Spiral Vessels.\n\n29. We have next to offer a few remarks on the structure of the vessels we have been engaged in describing. On this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, we shall not go much into detail. When we have seen such difficulties attending the correct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> of them in their entire forms, it may fairly be presumed that still greater perplexity must accompany the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> of their constituent parts. What, therefore, we have to advance, may be regarded rather as matter of opinion than of fact; and, in the present state of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>, this point must be deemed more a subject of curiosity than of use.\n\n30. According to Malpighi, the common sap-ves- sels of the wood, when viewed longitudinally, appear to be formed of a series of small vesicles or cells mutually opening into each other. These cells possess different forms, but in some vessels there seems to be no trace of such a cellular structure. In the\nElementary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OAK\">Oak</a>, the cells are represented to possess a roundish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, and in the Vine they possess an oblong form; as in Plate XV. fig. 13. (Anat. Plantar. Idea, p.2\u201424.) In these, and similar instances, Malpighi seems either to have mistaken a series of elongated cells for vessels, or to have conceived that the contractions, occasionally formed in the vessels of certain plants, afforded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> of their being constructed originally from cells. It is certain that, in the vessels of most parts of plants, no such cellular construction is apparent.\n\n31. Grew, on the other hand, considered the common sap-vessels to be composed of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRAIT\">strait</a> fibres, or rather smaller vessels, placed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to each other, and set round so as to form a cylindrical tube. (Anatomy of Plants, p.112.) In the opinion of Leuwenhoeck, the vessels are composed of two fine transparent coats, formed of other vessels exceedingly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a>, which are disposed partly in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONGITUDINAL\">longitudinal</a>, and partly in a circular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>. (Select Works, by Hoole, Vol. I. p. 11.) Du Hamel attempted to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> a knowledge of their structure, by submitting them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MACERATION\">maceration</a>. By this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a>, he separated the ligneous layers into leaflets thinner than the finest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, and the fasciculi of fibres or vessels that composed these layers, were farther separated into minuter filaments, placed parallel to one another, like the threads in a skein; and these filaments again seemed capable of almost indefinite subdivision. (Phys. des Arbres, Tom. I. p. 31.) Hill considered the vessels of the albumen to be formed of the same matter as the cells. He describes them as at first very delicate, and to collapse when emptied of their fluids. Sometimes the coat of which they were formed resembled a thin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARCHMENT\">parchment</a>, in which traces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> surrounding one another were visible, so that the coat seemed as if composed of several membranes that were vascular. In one instance, where a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> was made to penetrate the vessel, it appeared as if composed of numerous cells; but, on farther <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>, these seeming divisions altered their places, and were found to proceed from small portions of watery sap still retained in the vessel. This appearance, as he properly observes, may be a very necessary lesson against hasty judgments. (Construction of Timber, p. 33.)\n\n32. M. Mirbel's opinion concerning the formation of vessels may next be shortly noticed. He sets out with asserting, that \"the entire mass of the plant is nothing but cellular tissue, the cells of which differ only in form and dimensions.\" This he declares to be the basis of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a>; and he may perhaps be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> in thinking, that \"no one, before himself, had formed a similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> of vegetable organization.\" The cells and vessels of this tissue are farther considered to be produced out of one and the same membranous tissue. In forming cells, this membrane is supposed to dilate in every direction; in producing vessels, it increases only in length. (Expos\u00e9 de la Th\u00e9orie de l'Organisation V\u00e9g., p.9\u2014103.) Of the structure of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIMITIVE\">primitive</a> membrane itself, he professes to give no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a>; and his account of the manner in which the vessels are produced out of it, is so entirely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a>, so clumsily conceived, and so incapable of execution, that we deem it altogether unworthy of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of any one accustomed to contemplate the structure and formation of organized textures.\n\n33. Concerning the structure of the spiral vessels, opinions have varied still more than in relation to those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> considered. Malpighi describes them as composed of a thin zone, formed of a pellucid silvery plate, somewhat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, which, being placed spirally, and united at its edges, constructs a tube, interiorly and exteriorly, somewhat rough. When this tube is drawn out, it does not separate into distinct rings, but is resolved into a continuous spiral zone. At particular places, these vessels are sometimes contracted, so as to exhibit the appearance of oblong cells opening into each other, as in fig. 14 Pl. XV. In size they greatly surpass the ordinary sap-vessels; and their canal is then frequently occupied by membranous vesicles, which nearly fill their cavity. (Anat. Plantar. p. 3\u201426.) These vesicles were also observed by Leuwenhoeck, and their appearance, both in the transverse and longitudinal section of an enlarged vessel, are represented in fig. 15.\n\n34. According to Grew, the thin plate that forms the spiral vessel, is not always of the same breadth, and, instead of being flat, it has sometimes the form of a round thread. When minutely examined, the spiral zone, he adds, is never one single piece, but consists of two or more round filaments placed collaterally, but perfectly distinct. These component filaments he regards as united by other smaller transverse filaments, and the thin plates which they form by their connection, constitute the spiral vessel; \"as if we should imagine,\" he adds, \"a piece of fine narrow ribbon to be wound spirally, and edge to edge, round a stick, and the stick being drawn out, the ribbon to be left in the figure of a tube, answerable to a spiral vessel.\" As, however, the ribbon is composed of numerous threads, placed parallel to each other, so is the plate that forms the spiral vessel; and it is according to the greater or less delicacy of the vessel examined, and the manner of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISSECTION\">dissection</a>, that it appears to be constituted either of a flat plate, or a round filament. The spiration of the filaments he considered to be made in the root, from right to left, and in the trunk, from left to right. (Anat. of Plants, p. 73, and 117.)\n\n35. The opinion of Du Hamel, with respect to the construction of these vessels, was very similar to that of Grew, and he employed the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> of a ribbon twisted round a stick, to illustrate it. Hedwig gave a very different account of them. He of Hedwig considered the spiral vessel to be composed of two distinct parts; one a membranous canal conveying air, and the other a spiral tube rolled round it, by which the fluids were conveyed. The spires of the tube, in some instances, are represented as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a>; in others, they are separated, and the intervening portions of the membranous canal exhibit a dotted appearance. He considered all the sap-vessels, from their first formation, to possess this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> structure, and, by a series of changes, which he professes to describe, to be ultimately transformed into the solid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIBRE\">fibre</a> of the wood. (De Fibrae Vegetab. Ortu; p. 25.) Others, also, have believed the spiral vessel to be formed of a membranous tube, but have denied that it","sp":541,"ep":544},{"h":"ARTICLE VI","t":"Of the Proper Vessels.\n\n51. By <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> flow of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAP\">sap</a>, combined with the results of experiments made with coloured liquors, we have endeavoured to determine the situation and kinds of vessels by which it is conveyed. The same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> best assist us in ascertaining the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of those which have been called Proper Vessels. Of these also, many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> have been described by authors, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> of which we shall afterwards attempt to ascertain.\n\n52. It was before stated, that, early in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>, the sap of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> rises through the wood alone, and that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> fluid whatever is then to be found in the bark. At a later <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, however, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> is completely reversed; for the vessels of the wood no longer appear to carry sap, and those of the bark then become abundantly supplied with it. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> is very clearly and concisely stated by Grew. \"The sap,\" says he, \"in many plants, as the Vine, ascends visibly through the wood for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a>, and rises through every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a> of wood to the very centre, yet, at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, there arises no sap at all out of the bark, nor between it and the wood.\" \"But late in spring,\" he continues, \"and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, the sap is no longer visible in the wood, but is abundant in the bark, in the inner margin adjacent to the wood.\" Du Hamel too remarks, that when the lymph rises abundantly through the wood in spring, the bark is dry, and adheres to the wood, and no sap then issues from it, nor from between it and the wood; but, later in the season, he adds, the bark yields abundance of sap. These statements have been verified by the multiplied observations of various subsequent authors.\n\n53. But why is the sap thus present only in the wood at its first rising in spring? Why at a later period does it cease to be visible in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a>? And how and why does it afterwards find a passage into the bark? Some observations of Du Hamel, Hales, and Walker, point, we think, to the true cause. In spring, says Du Hamel, when the sap rises vigorously, the buds have not appeared; when they begin to open, the sap then flows less freely; and when the leaves are fully developed, then the flow of sap entirely ceases. Dr Hales also remarks, that, towards the end of April, when the young shoots come forth, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a> of the Vine is greatly increased by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPANSION\">expansion</a> of the leaves, the sap then ceases to flow in a visible manner till the return of the next spring. All bleeding trees, he adds, cease to bleed, as soon as the young leaves begin to expand enough to perspire plentifully, and draw off the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUNDANT\">redundant</a> sap. The bark of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OAK\">Oak</a>, too, separates easily when lubricated with sap; but before the leaves appear and perspire, the bark will no longer run (as they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> it), but adheres most firmly to the wood. (Vegetable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATICS\">Statics</a>, 3d edit., p. 126.) In like manner, in an experiment of Dr Walker, a Birch-tree bled from every perforation in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a>, and from every cut extremity of its branches, until vernation <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> budding began; then the bleeding was almost immediately checked, and when the young leaves had pushed beyond the hybernaculum, the bleeding entirely ceased. (Edin. Phil. Trans. Vol. I. p. 31.)\n\nIt is however certain, that though the sap was no longer visible in the wood after the leaves were developed, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> nevertheless to rise through it; for in no other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> could the leaves obtain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> portion of fluid which it is known that they constantly discharge by transpiration; and coloured <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a> manifest their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a> in the vessels of the wood, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> after as before the development of those organs. The leaves, therefore, must be regarded as the organs which, by their perspiration, draw off, as Dr Hales observes, the redundant sap; and hence in an experiment, where a notch was cut two or three feet above the lower end of a stem, though a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of sap passed by the notch, yet was it perfectly dry; because, says he, \"the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> of the perspiring leaves was greater than the force of suction from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>.\" (Veg. Statics, p. 111.)\n\n54. Not only, however, does the development of the leaves render the sap no longer visible in the wood; but they also appear to be the organs by or through the bark which it finds its way to the bark. In all the experiments <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> recited, the bark continued dry until the sap disappeared from the wood; in other words, until it was drawn off by the leaves; and then, and not till then, the bark became moist, and continued <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LADEN\">laden</a> with sap through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> of the summer. Now, as it has been before shewn that no sap enters the bark by the roots, nor gets into it directly from the wood, there is no other known channel by which it can be conveyed, except through the leaves; and these, therefore, necessarily appear to be the organs by which it is apparently carried off from the wood, and by or through which it, at the same time, finds its way to the bark.\n\nThis inference appears to follow, not only from the fact of the bark continuing dry until the leaves are developed, but from the circumstance that it is again rendered dry, after having become moist, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> these same leaves be removed. If, says Du Hamel, we remove the leaves of a young tree, when in full sap, and whose bark is easily detached, in a few days after the same bark will adhere as closely to the wood as it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> does during winter. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> connection between the leaves and bark, is also well illustrated in an experiment of Hales, employed by him for a very different purpose. From two thriving shoots of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PEAR\">Pear</a>-tree, he cut, in several places, half an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a> of the bark off all round. All the ringlets of bark between these incisions had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a>-bud upon them except one, and all but this\nElementary one ringlet grew and swelled at their bottoms till August; and the larger and more thriving the leaf-bud was, so much the more did the adjoining bark swell. (Veg. Statics, p. 149.) Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNIGHT\">Knight</a> also found the bark of the Vine to become shrivelled and dry when the leaves were stripped off; but in those parts in which it communicated directly with the leaves, it continued moist and flourishing. (Phil. Trans., 1801, p. 335.)\n\n55. By connecting, therefore, the circumstances attending the flow of sap with the development of the leaves, we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> satisfactory reasons for all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> anomalies observed to attend its course. In spring, before the appearance of the leaves, no natural outlet for the escape of the rising sap exists, and therefore, when the vessels are cut or perforated, they readily pour out their sap, or bleed; but late in spring, and in summer, when the leaves are developed, the more watery parts of the sap are thrown off by transpiration; and, while this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> proceeds, the fluids do not then accumulate in such quantity in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> vessels of the trunk, as to be effused, or bleed through their cut or perforated sides. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, however, or a moist and still <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>, by checking transpiration from the leaves, restores more or less the propensity to bleeding from the trunk; and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUTUMN\">autumn</a>, when fructification begins, and vegetation makes a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PAUSE\">pause</a>, the same disposition to bleeding recurs in the trunk, from the check imposed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> powers of growth.\n\n56. It is farther evident, that, when the vessels of the bark become supplied with fluid, they could not have derived it immediately from those of the wood, since, in these different parts, the fluids have frequently no sort of agreement in properties. Thus, Grew remarks, that almost all plants, late in spring and in summer, bleed from their bark; and the sap has either a sour, sweet, hot, bitter, or other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>. At this period, the bark of the Vine yields a sour sap; but, \"what is vulgarly called bleeding in the Vine, is,\" he adds, \"quite another thing, both as to the liquor which issueth, and the place whence it issues\u2014that is\u2014it is neither a sweet nor a sour, but a tasteless sap, issuing, not from any vessels in the bark, but from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>-vessels of the wood.\" (Anatomy of Plants, p. 125.) Malpighi also was well aware of the difference in the qualities of the sap, and thought every plant possessed its peculiar sap; but he has not so accurately defined the situation of the vessels that contain it. Du Hamel, however, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> out distinctly the difference of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> in the sap of the bark and wood. In the bark of some plants it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>; in others <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>; and in others <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a>: It is in some instances milky; in others resinous; and in others gummy. In many plants it has a sweet taste; in some it is caustic; and in others insipid. It has sometimes much odour as well as flavour, and frequently it is destitute of both. (Phys. des Arbres, Tom. I. p. 68.)\n\n57. But, if the qualities of the sap in the bark be acquired in thus different from those of the sap in the wood; if the leaves, these peculiar qualities are detected in it, only after the development of the leaves, and the leaves be the organs by which alone the sap can be conveyed from the one part to the other\u2014then it seems to follow, that the sap must acquire these new properties in the leaves, during its transmission through them. Malpighi remarked the existence of this altered sap in the leaves, and held them to be the organs which prepared nutrient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> for the plant; and Dr Darwin, by immersing plants of Spurge in coloured liquors, not only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a>, as others had previously done, the red fluid ascend through the leaf; but another fluid, of a white <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, returning, at the same time, from the extremities of the leaf, and descending into the petiole. (Botanic Garden, Vol. I. Notes, p. 450\u2014453.) This same returning fluid, Mr Knight observed, in similar experiments, on branches of the Apple and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">Horse</a>-Chesnut trees, and even traced it through the petiole into the inner bark, by the vessels of which, it seemed to be conveyed to the extremities of the roots. (Phil. Trans., 1801.) The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, therefore, of the sap in the bark, is not that of ascent, as Grew and Malpighi and many others have believed; but of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a>, as the observations and experiments of De la Baisse, Du Hamel, Knight, and others, abundantly prove. To these vessels of the bark, Grew assigned particular names, according to the apparent quality of the fluid they conveyed. Malpighi gave them the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> appellation of vasa peculiaria, from their containing a fluid different from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> sap. By others they have been called cortical vessels, a term, however, not applicable to many tribes of vegetables which are entirely destitute of bark. Lastly, Du Hamel and others denominated them proper vessels, which term differs but slightly from the appellation of Malpighi, and, though not very precise, is that we shall continue to employ.\n\n58. From regarding the newly formed vessels of\n\nThe view thus presented of the course of the sap, and the modifications which its movements and qualities <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> from the development of the leaves, may assist in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a> of the important and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a>-agitated question regarding the proper period of felling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a>, as it relates both to the bark and wood. The most proper period for the timber, is doubtless that in which it is most dry or destitute of sap; and the properest period for the bark, both as regards its chemical condition, and the facility of stripping it, is, when it is most succulent, and filled with its \"proper juices.\" But these respective periods and conditions do not happen to coincide, and therefore, the time at which the wood is in best condition, is that in which the bark is in its worst; and vice versa. If, therefore, the qualities of the bark dictate the period of felling, it will be late in spring or in autumn, when it is most abundantly filled with its proper juices, and of course, when the wood also is necessarily filled with fluid, and in an active state of vegetation; if, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, the condition of the wood regulate the period, then it will be late in winter, or before the sap rises in spring, when the wood is destitute of sap, and the bark, of course, is necessarily dry and adherent. To reconcile these opposing conditions, it seems desirable, as far as it may be practicable, to strip the\nElementary the wood as part of the bark, Grew uniformly represents the bark as possessing two distinct species of vessels, in which he has been since followed by several other writers; but the vessels which he calls lympheducts belong rather to the wood, so that we may regard him as describing only one species of proper vessels. In herbs, these vessels stand sometimes in distinct parcels or columns; sometimes they are disposed in a ring; sometimes they have a radiated position; and sometimes they are more intermixed with the sap-vessels, and seem to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> with them. In trees, the vessels of the bark are more distinct, and have a much more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> appearance. They are commonly postured near the inner margin of the bark, and, when viewed in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONGITUDINAL\">longitudinal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>, seem collected into fasciculi which are more or less numerous, and the component vessels of which continually diverge and join with others, so as to form a reticulated appearance; as in fig. 18. Plate XV. Of these reticulated fasciculi, many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAYERS\">layers</a> exist in an old tree; and to these layers the thickness of the bark is chiefly owing. As they proceed inward, the direction of the fasciculi is less oblique, so that near to the wood they are almost straight: Hence, the spaces formed by the reticulations are very unequal, often large in the exterior part of the bark, and diminishing in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> towards the wood; they are everywhere filled with cellular tissue. Such is a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of the proper vessels of the bark as given by Grew, Malpighi, and Du Hamel. The organs here described, we regard as truly vessels; but some writers have also described, as vessels, various collections of the proper juices which occur in different parts of the cellular tissue of the bark, and have thus lost sight altogether of the anatomical characters which distinguish vessels from cells.\n\n59. The vessels which thus form the vascular portion of the bark appear to differ but little in structure from the more simple vessels of the wood. Grew considered them to possess a similar structure, from believing them to be formed by the inner bark, at the same time with the vessels of the wood; and, therefore, he adds, \"they may be reasonably thought similar in the bark and wood.\" (Anat. of Plants, p. 112.) Malpighi regarded them as simple tubes, containing sometimes peculiar juices, but advances nothing particular respecting their structure. (Anat. Plantarum, p. 3.) M. Mirbel's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> deserves some notice, insomuch as he declares the structure of these vessels to differ entirely from all those of the wood. Their sides, says he, are perfectly entire; they have neither pores nor clefts, and may therefore be deemed simple tubes. (Exposit. de la Th\u00e9orie de l'Organisation V\u00e9g\u00e9tal, p. 109). A single vessel of this kind is represented in Plate XV. fig. 16; and in fig. 17, a fasciculus of the same vessels magnified, is given, as delineated by M. Mirbel. A remark also of Hill, if it be deemed to rest on correct observation, is entitled to great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>. \"The vessels of the bark that form the fasciculi are not,\" says he, united to each other, but are connected with the cellular tissue at numerous places, and, when separated from it, there appear on the sides of the vessels small oval depressions, dotted as it were with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PIN\">pin</a>-holes.\" (On the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">Construction</a> of Timber, p. 28.) These appearances he regards as of a glandular nature, but their description corresponds better with that of Leuwenboeck respecting the lateral ramifications from the vessels of the wood; and they may probably be the points at which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> is effected betwixt the vessels and cells.\n\n60. The cause of the reticulated appearance which the vessels of the bark exhibit in trees, is doubtless to be attributed, as we think Du Hamel somewhere remarks, to their peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of growth. A new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LAYER\">layer</a> of cortical vessels is every year added to the inner surface of the bark, as well as a new layer of ligneous vessels to the outer surface of the wood; so that, as Grew observes, the new matter of the tree is every year distributed two contrary ways; one part falling outward towards the bark, and the other part retaining its situation inward to constitute the wood. At first, the newly formed cortical vessels are straight, and stand <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a>, like those of the wood; but, by the continual growth of the new parts, formed between the bark and the wood, the older vessels of the bark are gradually forced outward, and being thus every year disposed around a larger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a>, are necessarily more and more separated from each other, and produce at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">net</a>-like form which we observe them to possess. The newly formed vessels of the wood, on the other hand, retain their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> position, and, therefore, preserve their parallelism, seldom or never exhibiting those flexures and reticulations so common to the vessels of the bark.\n\n61. In the bark, as well as in the wood, the vessels are found to possess different sizes. In the Pine, vessels containing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURPENTINE\">turpentine</a> are represented by Grew, which are very much larger than the common sap-vessels, and are surrounded by smaller ones, exactly as the large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRAL\">spiral</a> tubes of the wood are said to be ensheathed by the common sap-vessels. The milky juice of a species of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMACH\">Sumach</a> is contained in very large vessels, disposed so as to form a ring, and each large vessel is surrounded by many smaller ones. (Anat. of Plants, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-TAB\">Tab</a>. 20.) The appearance of these large vessels in one species of Pine, is well represented by Hill, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> he gives of their formation is probably correct. In this tree (Pinus orientalis), some of these vessels form oval openings, large enough to admit a straw; these openings occupy the centre of the bark, and are surrounded by a ring of smaller vessels; as their contents are soluble in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALCOHOL\">alcohol</a>, it is easy to obtain them empty. In fig. 19. Plate XV. the vessels of this tree, as they appear in the bark, are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a>; the woody portion of the tree has been scooped away, so that the longitudinal aspect, as well as the transverse sections of them, is exhibited. From a strict inquiry into\n\ntree of its bark while standing, in autumn, at or a little before the period of fructification, when the bark must possess its richest qualities, and be in the best condition to separate; and to fell the tree late in winter, when the wood is destitute of sap, and its vegetative powers are most completely suspended.\ntheir nature, Dr Hill concluded that these larger vessels were originally the same as those of the smaller fasciculi in the bark of the same tree; \"so that, if we conceive one of these smaller fasciculi opened in its centre, and the vessels driven every way outward, till they are stopped by the substance of the bark, we shall have an idea of the structure of this large vessel, which is nothing more than a great cylindrical hollow formed in the centre of such a fasciculus.\" (Hill on the Construction of Timber, p. 29.) It is in trees that have copious and viscid juices, that these enlarged vessels are formed; and where the juices do not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CONCRETE\">concrete</a>, it is probable, that, as the vessels annually recede from the centre, they suffer a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> in size, from the continued effects of desiccation and compression to which they are exposed.\n\n62. The foregoing varieties appear alone entitled to the appellation of the proper vessels of the bark. In many tribes of vegetables, however, as will afterwards be shown, no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> of bark and wood exists; but one uniform <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a> of vessels extends from the centre to the circumference of the plant. Such plants have also their proper vessels, but the place and disposition of these vessels are not so precisely ascertained. From the mode in which their growth is accomplished, as well as from observation of their structure, it may be inferred, that their proper vessels are distributed through the whole substance of the plant, accompanying, in every part, the sap-vessels. In some plants, possessing this arrangement of parts, such as different species of wheat, Malpighi describes and delineates a vas proprium as forming a part of each fasciculus of vessels; and a similar intermixture of the two kinds must, we conceive, exist in all similar structures.\n\n63. Even in many plants, possessing a distinct bark, vessels containing proper juices are found in the wood. In every circle of wood, from the inmost that surrounds the pith, to the outmost in contact with the bark, vessels containing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUM\">gum</a>, turpentine, or some other concrete or coloured juice, may frequently be found. Malpighi conceived them to exist in all plants, though, from the nature of their fluids, they could not always be distinguished; and he believed them to afford a highly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> juice for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NUTRITION\">nutrition</a> of the plant. According to Grew, \"the turpentine vessels that are scattered up and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the wood of the Pine and Fir are the self same which did once appertain to the bark; but being pinched up by the wood, they are become much smaller <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PIPES\">pipes</a>.\" (Anat. of Plants, p. 115.) Du Hamel also regarded them as similar to those of the bark, but rendered much smaller by compression. In the Pine and Fir, they are disposed circularly around the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AXIS\">axis</a>, much like the sap-vessels, and alternate with them. (Phys. des Arbres, Tom. I. p. 41.)\n\nIn Piscidia erythrina, the proper juices are of a scarlet colour, and the vessels that contain them are therefore readily discerned wherever they exist. This plant has been selected by Hill to demonstrate the position of these vessels. In the bark, they are collected into fasciculi, all the vessels of which contain coloured juices, and are disposed in a ring on the inner margin of the bark. Within this ring stands the albumen, through the substance of which many smaller red vessels are distributed, and similar red vessels are more sparingly seen in every layer of wood, particularly in that which envelopes the pith. (Constr. of Timber.)\n\n64. Now, the red vessels thus observed in the wood of the above mentioned plant, must either have been formed in the situations they occupy, or transported from some other place. The latter supposition is inadmissible, insomuch as the wood of trees is formed by layers of new vessels superimposed on one another; and no removal of the old vessels, nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-REPRODUCTION\">reproduction</a> of new vessels within the old layers, ever takes place; consequently, no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> transposition of vessels could occur; nor could new vessels be developed in the wood after it had been completely formed. If, however, an alternate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEPOSITION\">deposition</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSORPTION\">absorption</a> of matter go on into, and from the cells, it is possible that the vessels might, in this way, become filled with a matter different from that which they originally possessed; but in the case before us, a readier explanation presents itself. The new matter of the wood is formed at the same time, and in the same place, as that of the bark; and through this new woody matter the red vessels were dispersed as well as in the bark. Consequently, every addition made to the ligneous layers would furnish some vessels that contained these proper juices; and this being annually repeated, would exhibit that intermixture of proper vessels with sap-vessels, which is observed in all the ligneous layers of this and many other trees. Hence these proper vessels of the wood must be held to retain the position in which they were originally produced; and cannot be said to have approached nearer to the centre, but only, by the addition of new layers exterior to them, to be placed farther from the circumference of the tree. As Grew, therefore, held the albumen to be a part of the bark, he might correctly say that these vessels \"did once appertain to it.\"\n\nArticle VII.\n\nOf Collections of the Proper Juices in the Cellular Tissue.\n\n65. Beside this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCUMULATION\">accumulation</a> of the proper juices in certain vessels of the wood, it frequently happens that depositions of similar matter occur in all parts of the cellular tissue of plants. In the bark of the single Oak and Poplar, and of other trees, resinous concretions are often found in the cells; they are situated irregularly, and, according to Malpighi, are observed even in very young bark. Sometimes the cells containing milky and resinous juices are so postured in the bark, says Grew, as to form cylindrical channels, which are neither parallel nor anywhere inclosed, but run, with some little obliquities, distinct from one another. They appear to be formed out of the cells, and are not bounded by any walls or sides proper to themselves, but only by those of the cells. (Anat. of Plants, p. 112.) They are often short and tortuous, always isolated, and are sometimes placed irregularly; at others, disposed in a circular form. They occur sometimes in the pith, and possess very different sizes and figures. They have fre-\nElementary quently been deemed a species of proper vessels, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> circumstance of their containing similar juices, and from possessing sometimes an elongated form; but they are organs which, neither in form nor in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a>, bear any resemblance to vessels. Mirbel proposes to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> them secretory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CANALS\">canals</a>, and M. Link cellular reservoirs; the term certainly most generally applicable, and involving no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> respecting either their formation or functions.\n\n66. The manner in which these cellular reservoirs may be produced in the bark or pith, is readily explained, on the supposition that a communication everywhere subsists between vessels and the cells. One set of vessels has been shown to receive and carry out sap to the leaves, and another to bring it back from them to the bark; and these latter vessels are everywhere, in their course, surrounded by cellular tissue. Hence the cells, in every part, may receive a portion of the fluid which the vessels are employed to convey. Thus in herbs, the cells both of the bark and pith are filled with fluid, which led Grew to believe that the sap was actually transmitted through those organs; but at the same time he delivers facts which, even in his own opinion, prove that it is derived directly from the vessels. Not only in herbs, but \"in every annual growth, whether of a sprout from a seed, of a sucker from a root, or of a seyon from a branch, the pith is always found the first year full of sap; but in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> year, the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a> pith always becomes dry, and so it continues ever after. One cause whereof is, that the lympheducts of the bark being, the first year, adjacent to the pith, they do all that time transtuse part of their sap into it, and so keep it always succulent. But the same lympheducts, the following year, are turned into wood, and the vessels which are then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> and carry the sap, stand beyond them in the bark; so that the sap, being now more remote from the pith, and intercepted by the new wood, cannot be transmuted with that sufficient force and plenty as before, into the pith; which, therefore, from the first year, always continues dry.\" (Anat. of Plants, p. 124.)\n\nAll that is here said respecting the transusion of the common sap from the vessels to the cells, as it ascends through the wood, is equally applicable to the proper juices as they descend through the bark. During the first year of growth, both the sap and proper vessels are adjacent to the pith, as well as to the bark, and each order may therefore transtuse its fluids into the cells of either. The common sap, from retaining its fluidity, is frequently removed by absorption, and the cells that contained it appear empty and dry; but where the proper juices are transtused, and become viscid or concrete, they are retained, and appear in different quantities and forms both in the bark and pith, according to the nature and properties of the juices from which they are derived, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEXTURE\">texture</a> and situation of the tissue into which they are poured.\n\n67. To these collections of the proper juices in cellular Canals the cells of the cellular tissue may be referred the opinions of those who describe them as existing sometimes in vacuities betwixt the cells. M. Treviranus professes to have discovered certain interstices between the cells, formed in a mode hereafter to be explained, to which he has given the name of intercellular canals. According to him, these canals contain the proper juices, and convey them to all the cellular parts of plants; and are the true proper vessels of the bark. We before saw that M. Kieser, after making the wood to consist almost entirely of spiral vessels, and then converting these vessels into tubes destined only to convey air, supposed the sap to be carried by these same intercellular canals. (Kieser's M\u00e9m. sur l'Organisation des Plantes, p. 36.) With M. Treviranus he also considers them as the real proper vessels of the bark, by which alone the juices are conveyed to all parts of the cellular tissue. (Ibid. p. 216.) If such canals really exist betwixt the cells, it is probable, that, like the cells themselves, they may sometimes become reservoirs of the proper juices; but simply on that account, to pronounce them vessels, is, in an anatomical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, exceedingly incorrect; and to make them afterwards supersede the existence of the real vessels themselves, seems nothing less than downright extravagance and absurdity. Were there any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> in such statements, we might at once banish from the organization of plants all the varieties of vessels, whose situation, structure, and characters we have been labouring to describe and define. But the opinions of these writers have not at all shaken our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> in the facts observed by their predecessors; and as long as the vegetable functions shall continue to be exercised as they have hitherto been, so long, we believe, will a vascular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a>, such nearly as we have attempted to demonstrate, be employed as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> in their execution.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">Section</a> II.\n\nOf the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSORBENT\">Absorbent</a> and Exhalent Systems.\n\nArticle I.\n\nOf the Absorbent System.\n\n68. Connected with the vessels that distribute the fluids through organized bodies, is another system of vessels by which extraneous matter is taken up to support the growth of parts, and supply the waste occasioned by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of the various functions. To these vessels Anatomists have given the name of Absorbents. The function which they perform is carried on either from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> surface, or from some internal part of the body; and its exercise, in animal bodies, may be distinguished into three kinds or stages. The first is that in which new or extraneous matter is taken up and added to the system, as in the absorption of substances from the skin, or of chyle from the intestines; the second is that in which substances previously separated from the fluids by secretion, but without becoming organized, are again taken up by the absorbents, and reconveyed into the blood-vessels, as in the absorption of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>, bile, and fat; the third kind is that in which the secreting organs themselves, and successively all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> parts of the body, are removed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the absorbent vessels. By plants, this function is exercised to less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, and seems to comprise only the two first kinds or degrees of it, viz. the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIMARY\">primary</a> absorption of extraneous matter, and the reabsorption of certain\nany power of reabsorbing what has once formed an organized part of the system. Hence the formation of organized parts in plants is not accompanied, as in animals, by the unceasing removal of old particles; but the particles, which have once become organized, continue permanent, until removed by some cause or process foreign to the living powers of the plant. When once, therefore, the organs of plants have become mature, they are exposed to decay only from the operation of foreign causes, and cannot be mined from within by that gradual loss of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> between the secreting and absorbing functions, which the advances of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> bring on the animal system. Neither in the vegetable system can the removal of organized parts under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>, any more than in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, have place; and consequently, the several modes or stages of ulcerative absorption, so finely illustrated by the researches of Mr Hunter, belong not to the economy of plants.\n\n69. As the function of absorption is thus of more limited extent in plants than in animals, so may we expect to find the arrangement of organs destined to its exercise. In animals, the absorbent vessels are quite distinct from those which carry blood, are provided everywhere with glands, and, like the veins, are furnished with valves. From their beginnings, in all parts of the body, to their termination, they continually unite with one another into vessels successively increasing in size, until, after a long course, they form at length two trunks, which deliver their contents into the large veins near the heart. As no common reservoir exists in plants, there is no such single point to which their absorbed fluids require to be carried. Hence their absorbents seem everywhere to have a very short course, to form no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNION\">union</a> with one another, but to deliver their contents at once into the sap-vessels adjacent to them. They appear to be destitute alike of glands and valves, and indeed, in an anatomical view, they can scarcely be considered distinct from the sap-vessels, but may rather be deemed ramifications from them; so that although we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a>, with Grew, that the ordinary sap-vessels do not ramify one out of another, yet they certainly send off those fine ramifications which, from their office, we denominate the absorbents of plants.\n\n70. In the root, the absorbents are capable of being demonstrated: when a plant is immersed in coloured fluids, many of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CAPILLARY\">capillary</a> absorbents become tinged through their whole course to their termination in the sap-vessels, proving them to be simple ramifications from these vessels themselves. A farther <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IDENTITY\">identity</a> of these two systems is derived from the fact, that any part of a sap-vessel is not only capable of emitting capillary absorbents from its sides, but of exercising itself an absorbent function, whenever its cut extremity is brought into contact with a fluid. These absorbents are formed very speedily, and in great multitudes on the roots of annual plants; and even in perennial plants, they appear, like the leaves, to suffer an annual decay, and be reproduced with the return of vegetation.\n\n71. But plants absorb fluids by other parts of their surface as well as by the roots. This absorbing power extends, in some of the lower tribes, over the entire surface of the vegetable, which is destitute of any organ analogous to a root; in other instances, where the roots are small and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> arid, the plant derives almost all its moisture by the absorption of dews through the leaves. The experiments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BONNET\">Bonnet</a> show that all leaves, both those of herbs and of trees, when brought into contact with water, are capable of absorbing it, and that the moisture thus absorbed is communicated through the vascular system of the leaf. The leaves of herbs he found to absorb nearly alike from either surface; but those of trees absorbed best by the lower surface. The petiole and larger rilets appeared to absorb much less than the other parts of the leaf. So great and general is this absorbing power, that vegetables, says he, may be said to be planted in the air, nearly as they are in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, the leaves being to the branches what the capillary rootlets are to the roots. (Recherches sur l'Usage des Feuilles, p. 22, 47.)\n\n72. What then are the organs by which this function is carried on in the leaf? M. Bonnet imagined the vessels of the leaves to receive their fluids by Pores, through the pores adjacent to them; and that the leaves, which had only few pores, possessed but little absorbent power. (Ibid. p. 20, 22.) He thought, also, that the hairs frequently distributed over the leaf, attracted moisture, and might even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> as absorbents; though he admits that many leaves which have only slight inequalities on their surface, without hairs, exercise an absorbent function. (Ibid. p. 47.)\n\nThis subject has been since investigated by M. Decandolle, whose researches appear to confirm the account of Bonnet, as to the absorbing power of the pores. According to him, these pores are found on all parts of the leaf except the rilets, which have none, but are covered with hairs. At the mouth of the pore, a vascular net-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> is always to be found, which he regards as a production from the larger vessels of the leaf. He asserts that pores are found only in those parts where vessels go to terminate, and not in others; and that in trees, this structure occurs chiefly on the lower surface of the leaf, while in herbs it is equally seen on both surfaces. The stem, in general, has few or no pores, except where it is soft and herbaceous; and even then, the pores occur only in the deeper green furrows, not on the prominent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> which bound them, and are usually covered with hairs. No pores are to be found on roots or bulbs or fleshy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>, but most of the organs above <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> are more or less furnished with them. Exposure to the air seems necessary to their formation; for plants, or parts of plants, that live beneath water or earth, are destitute of pores, but acquire them if brought into the free air. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCLUSION\">Exclusion</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> prevents also the formation of pores; and hence etiolated plants are not furnished with them. (M\u00e9m. de l'Inst. Nat. Tom. I. p. 351.) In general, his anatomical researches, respecting the existence of pores in leaves, agreed with the results of Bonnet's experiments on the absorbing power of their surfaces; and when we consider that all plants, and parts of plants, secluded from the air, are at the same time destitute of pores, and of the power of absorbing by their surfaces, it may be inferred that the organs of absorption, on the external surfaces of\nElementary plants, are the minute vascular productions, which in tender and succulent parts exposed to the air and light, everywhere perforate the cuticle, and form in it those innumerable orifices which we denominate pores.\n\n73. But the function of absorption in plants, is not confined to the taking up of extraneous matters. Many facts prove that, in every part where active vegetation exists, internal absorption is continually going on. The organs by which it is immediately performed cannot, perhaps, from their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> delicacy and minuteness, be rendered capable of anatomical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a>; but certain facts which occur in plants, coupled with certain analogies derived from other organized textures, must, we think, carry complete <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVICTION\">conviction</a> of their existence. In almost every part, and on every surface of animal bodies, the vessels which exercise absorption may be traced; but the mouths or orifices by which they actually absorb, are scarcely ever to be seen. In one instance only, viz. in the intestines, have they been followed to their beginnings, and discovered in the act of exercising their appropriate function. (Gordon's System of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">Human</a> Anat. Vol. I. p. 70.) But though their orifices remain, in other parts, undiscovered, no anatomist hesitates to admit their existence when he sees the canals of the vessels themselves laden with blood, or milk, or bile; and seeing them thus to convey fluids, whose colour manifests their presence, he equally believes them capable of absorbing and conveying other substances, though they may not be visible to the eye. Believing farther, that no solid part of the body, nor even fluid part that has been deposited in closed cavities, can be removed in a natural manner from its place, but by the agency of these vessels, he comes to regard the simple fact of the disappearance of such part, as sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> of its absorption.\n\n74. Now the facts and analogies on which internal absorption rests in the vegetable system, are precisely of the same nature, and the evidence of its existence is scarcely less complete. In every part of the cellular tissue of plants, various substances have been found, which must have been primarily derived from the vessels, the only organs which furnish new materials to the plant. These substances, however, often disappear from the cells, and are again to be detected in the vascular system. Thus, in the seed, as will afterwards be shown, the cells of the cotyledon contain a solid unorganized matter, which could have been originally deposited in them only by means of the vessels. During germination, this solid matter is rendered fluid, disappears from the cells, and is again to be traced in the vessels on its way to afford nutriment to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RADICLE\">radicle</a> and plumule. We say then that this unorganized matter must have been taken up from the cells of the cotyledon, and conveyed into the vascular system, by the agency of absorbent vessels, which, it is probable, are distributed everywhere on the inner surface of these cells; just as, in the animal system, absorbent vessels are considered to take up the fat from the surface of the cells in which it is deposited, and convey it into the vessels of the animal.\n\n75. This alternate absorption and deposition of the nutrient matter of seeds, is sometimes strikingly displayed in the growth of potatoes. It frequently happens that potatoes, lying in a damp cellar, put forth shoots which grow to a considerable size without the access of any foreign agents, except <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, water, and air. On these shoots, young potatoes, as large as the eggs of pigeons, are sometimes to be found, and the substance of the old potatoe has in great part disappeared. In such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, the matter from the cells of the old potatoe, must be considered as removed by absorption, and conveyed into the vessels of the shoot, where it was in part employed in forming the new organs of the young potatoe, and in part deposited, to experience, perhaps, in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> growth, similar successions of removal and deposition. In the living parts of perennial plants also, nutrient matter appears to be alternately deposited and absorbed from the cells during the active periods of vegetation; and in the cellular tissue of herbaceous plants, a similar deposition and absorption of fluids seems to be frequently taking place; so that in all the vegetating parts of plants, these alternate functions of secretion and absorption are more or less constantly exercised.\n\n76. A good illustration of the manner in which these functions are alternately exercised, is afforded by an experiment of M. Decandolle. The parasitic plant called Mistletoe draws its nourishment, as is well known, from the tree on which it grows. M. Decandolle placed a branch of an Apple-tree, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> a stalk of mistletoe, in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFUSION\">infusion</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COCHINEAL\">cochineal</a> for five days. He then dissected it, and observed the coloured liquor to have risen through the wood and albumen of the apple-branch, and reached the place of junction between it and the mistletoe, which it strongly reddened; and from thence it penetrated into the woody part of the mistletoe. There did not, however, appear to be a true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANASTOMOSIS\">anastomosis</a> between the vessels of these different plants; but, at the base of the mistletoe, where the parts were so deeply reddened, a minute cellular structure was observed. Into these cells the vascular system of the apple appeared to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEPOSIT\">deposit</a> its sap, and from them the capillary absorbents of the mistletoe, distributed upon the cells, seemed, like the ordinary absorbents of roots, to take it up. (M\u00e9m. de l'Instit. Nat. Tom. I. p. 370.) From these and many similar facts it may be inferred, that absorbents, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> with the vessels of the plant, exist in every part, and that the removal of all secreted matters from the cells and other closed cavities of the vegetable, when effected by the living powers of the plant, is accomplished, as in animal bodies, by the exercise of an absorbent function.","sp":548,"ep":554},{"h":"ARTS","t":"FINE.\n\nIn the Encyclopaedia there is some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a>, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> Arts, of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-FINE_ARTS\">Fine Arts</a>, including <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POETRY\">Poetry</a>, Eloquence, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAINTING\">Painting</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATUARY\">Statuary</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">Architecture</a>.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHRASE\">phrase</a> has of late, we think, been restricted to a narrower and more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TECHNICAL\">technical</a> signification; namely, to Painting, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCULPTURE\">Sculpture</a>, Engraving, and Architecture, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> to the eye as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDIUM\">medium</a> of pleasure; and by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMINENCE\">eminence</a>, to the two first of these arts. In the present article, we shall adopt this limited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of the term; and shall endeavour to develop the principles upon which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> Masters have proceeded, and also to inquire, in a more particular manner, into the present state and probable advancement of these arts in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">Country</a>.\n\nThe great works of art, at present extant, and which may be regarded as models of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a> in their several kinds, are the Greek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATUES\">statues</a>\u2014the pictures of the celebrated Italian Masters\u2014those of the Dutch and Flemish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a>\u2014to which we may add the comic productions of our own countryman, Hogarth. These all stand unrivalled in the history of art; and they owe their pre-eminence and perfection to one and the same principle,\u2014the immediate imitation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>. This principle predominated equally in the classical forms of the antique, and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GROTESQUE\">grotesque</a> figures of Hogarth; the perfection of art in each arose from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IDENTITY\">identity</a> of the imitation with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a>; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> was in the subjects; there was none in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of imitation. Yet the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a> for the ideal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of art would persuade their disciples, that the difference between Hogarth and the antique does not consist in the different forms of nature which they imitated, but in this, that the one is like, and the other unlike nature. This is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>, the most detrimental, perhaps, of all others, both to the theory and practice of art. As, however, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> is very strong and general, and supported by the highest authority, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be necessary to go somewhat elaborately into the question, in order to produce an impression on the other side.\n\nWhat has given rise to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> of the ideal, as something quite distinct from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> nature, is probably the perfection of the Greek statues. Not seeing among ourselves, anything to correspond in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a>, either with the features or form of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a> in these exquisite remains of antiquity, it was an obvious, but a superficial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONCLUSION\">conclusion</a>, that they must have been created from the idea existing in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a>'s mind, and could not have been copied from anything existing in nature. The contrary, however, is the fact. The general form, both of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, which we observe in the old statues, is not an ideal abstraction, is not a fanciful invention of the sculptor, but is as completely local and national (though it happens to be more beautiful), as the figures on a Chinese screen, or a copperplate engraving of a negro chieftain in a book of travels. It will not be denied, that there is a difference of physiognomy as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a> in different races of men... The Greek form appears to have been naturally beautiful, and they had, besides, every advantage of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, of dress, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a>, and modes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> to improve it. The artist had also every facility afforded him in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> and knowledge of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> form, and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> and public institutions gave him every encouragement in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROSE\">prose</a>-\nAll these causes contributed to the perfection of these noble productions; but we should be inclined principally to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> the superior symmetry of form common to the Greek statues, in the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, to the superior symmetry of the models in nature, and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, to the more constant opportunities for studying them. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> we allow, also, for the superior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> of the people, we shall not be wrong; but this superiority consisted in their peculiar susceptibility to the impressions of what is beautiful and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> in nature. It may be thought an objection to what has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> been said, that the antique figures of animals, &c., are as fine, and proceed on the same principles as their statues of gods or men. But all that follows from this seems to be, that their art had been perfected in the study of the human form, the test and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of power and skill; and was then transferred easily to the general imitation of all other objects, according to their true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a>, proportions, and appearances. As a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> of these remarks, the antique portraits of individuals were often superior even to the personifications of their gods. We think that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> unprejudiced spectator of real <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> can hesitate for a moment in preferring the head of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANTINOUS\">Antinous</a>, for example, to that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOLLO\">Apollo</a>. And in general, it may be laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> as a rule, that the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> of the antiques are the most simple\u2014those which affect the least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, or violence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>\u2014which repose the most on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> beauty of form, and a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> of sweetness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>, that is, which remain most nearly in that state in which they could be copied from nature without straining the limbs or features of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a>, or racking the invention of the artist. This tendency of Greek art to repose has indeed been reproached with insipidity by those who had not a true feeling of beauty and sentiment. We, however, prefer these models of habitual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a> or internal grandeur to the violent distortions of suffering in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAOCOON\">Laocoon</a>, or even to the supercilious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> of the Apollo. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIOBE\">Niobe</a>, more than any other antique head, combines truth and beauty with deep passion. But here the passion is fixed, intense, habitual\u2014it is not a sudden or violent gesticulation, but a settled mould of features; the grief it expresses is such as might almost turn the human countenance itself into marble!\n\nIn general, then, we would be understood to maintain, that the beauty and grandeur so much admired in the Greek statues were not a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUNTARY\">voluntary</a> fiction of the brain of the artist, but existed substantially in the forms from which they were copied, and by which the artist was surrounded. A striking authority in support of these observations, which has in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> been lately discovered, is to be found in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELGIN\">Elgin</a> marbles, taken from the Acropolis at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a>, and supposed to be the works of the celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHIDIAS\">Phidias</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of fastidious refinement and indefinite abstraction is certainly not visible there. The figures have all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, the simplicity, and variety, of individual nature. Even the details of the subordinate parts, the loose hanging folds in the skin, the veins under the belly, or on the sides of the horses, more or less swelled as the animal is more or less in action, are given with scrupulous exactness.\n\nThis is true nature and true art. In a word, these invaluable remains of antiquity are precisely like casts taken from life. The ideal is not the preference of that which exists only in the mind, to that which exists in nature; but the preference of that which is fine in nature to that which is less so. There is nothing fine in art but what is taken almost immediately, and, as it were, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>, from what is finer in nature. Where there have been the finest models in nature, there have been the finest works of art.\n\nAs the Greek statues were copied from Greek forms, so Raphael's expressions were taken from Italian faces; and we have heard it remarked, that the women in the streets at Rome seem to have walked out of his pictures in the Vatican.\n\nSir Joshua Reynolds constantly refers to Raphael as the highest example in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> times (at least with one exception) of the grand or ideal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a>; and yet he makes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSENCE\">essence</a> of that style to consist in the embodying an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> or general idea, formed in the mind of the artist by rejecting the peculiarities of individuals, and retaining only what is common to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>. Nothing can be more inconsistent than the style of Raphael with this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a>. In his Cartoons and in his groupes in the Vatican, there is hardly a face or figure which is any thing more than fine individual nature finely disposed and copied. The late Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARRY\">Barry</a>, who could not be suspected of a prejudice on this side of the question, speaks thus of them: \"In Raphael's pictures (at the Vatican) of the Dispute of the Sacrament, and the School of Athens, one sees all the heads to be entirely copied from particular characters in nature, nearly proper for the persons and situations which he adopts them to; and he seems to me only to add and take away what may answer his purpose in little parts, features, &c.; conceiving, while he had the head before him, ideal characters and expressions, which he adopts these features and peculiarities of face to. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to the particulars which distinguish all the different faces, persons, and characters, the one from the other, gives his pictures quite the verity and unaffected dignity of nature, which stamp the distinguishing differences betwixt one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>'s face and body and another's.\"\n\nIf any thing is wanting to the conclusiveness of this testimony, it is only to look at the pictures themselves; particularly the Miracle of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVERSION\">Conversion</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">Assembly</a> of Saints, which are little else than a collection of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVINE\">divine</a> portraits, in natural and expressive attitudes, full of the loftiest thought and feeling, and as varied as they are fine. It is this reliance on the power of nature which has produced those masterpieces by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> of painters, in which expression is all in all;\u2014where one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a>\u2014that of truth,\u2014pervades every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a>, brings down <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAVEN\">Heaven</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">Earth</a>, mingles Cardinals and Popes with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGELS\">Angels</a> and Apostles,\u2014and yet blends and harmonizes the whole by the true touches and intense feeling of what is beautiful and grand in nature. It is no wonder that Sir Joshua, when he first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> Raphael's pictures in the Vatican, was at a loss to discover any great excellence in them, if he was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> out for\nhis theory of the ideal,\u2014of neutral character and middle forms.\n\nThere is more an appearance of abstract grandeur of form in Michael Angelo. He has followed up, has enforced, and expanded, as it were, a preconceived idea, till he sometimes seems to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-TREAD\">tread</a> on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERGE\">verge</a> of caricature. His forms, however, are not middle, but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> forms, massy, gigantic, supernatural. They convey the idea of the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> and strength in the figure, and in all the parts of the figure. Every muscle is swollen and turgid. This tendency to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXAGGERATION\">exaggeration</a> would have been avoided, if Michael Angelo had recurred more constantly to nature, and had proceeded less on a scientific knowledge of the structure of the human body; for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> gives only the positive form of the different parts, which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> may afterwards magnify, as it pleases, but it is nature alone which combines them with perfect truth and delicacy, in all the varieties of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> and expression. It is fortunate that we can refer, in illustration of our doctrine, to the admirable fragment of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THESEUS\">Theseus</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Elgin's, which shows the possibility of uniting the grand and natural style in the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>. The form of the limbs, as affected by pressure or action, and the general sway of the body, are preserved with the most consummate mastery. We should prefer this statue as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> for forming the style of the student to the Apollo, which strikes us as having something of a theatrical appearance, or to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERCULES\">Hercules</a>, in which there is an ostentatious and over-laboured display of anatomy. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> figure is so overloaded with sinews, that it has been suggested as a doubt, whether, if life could be put into it, it would be able to move. Grandeur of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a>, truth of nature, and purity of taste, seem to have been at their height when the masterpieces which adorned the temple of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINERVA\">Minerva</a> at Athens, of which we have only these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> fragments, were produced. Compared with these, the later Greek statues display a more elaborate workmanship, more of the artifices of style. The several parts are more uniformly balanced, made more to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TALLY\">tally</a> like modern periods: each muscle is more equally brought out, and more highly finished as a part, but not with the same subordination of each part to the whole. If some of these wonderful productions have a fault, it is the want of that entire and naked simplicity which pervades the whole of the Elgin marbles.\n\nHaving spoken here of the Greek statues, and of the works of Raphael and Michael Angelo, as far as relates to the imitation of nature, we shall attempt to point out, to the best of our ability, and as concisely as possible, what we conceive to be their general and characteristic excellences. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> excelled in beauty of form; Michael Angelo in grandeur of conception; Raphael in expression. In Raphael's faces, particularly his women, the expression is very superior to the form; in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> statues, the form is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> thing. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> which the latter excite, is in a manner <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a>; it depends on a certain grace and lightness of appearance, joined with exquisite symmetry and refined susceptibility to voluptuous emotions; but there is in general a want of pathos. In their looks, we do not read the workings of the heart; by their beauty they seem raised above the sufferings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>, by their beauty they are deified. The pathos which they exhibit is rather that of present and physical distress, than of deep internal sentiment. What has been remarked of Leonardo da Vinci, is also true of Raphael, that there is an angelic sweetness and tenderness in his faces, in which human frailty and passion are purified by the sanctity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>. The ancient statues are finer objects for the eye to contemplate; they represent a more perfect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of physical beings, but we have little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYMPATHY\">sympathy</a> with them. In Raphael, all our natural sensibilities are heightened and refined by the sentiments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">hope</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTING\">pointing</a> mysteriously to the interests of another world. The same intensity of passion appears also to distinguish Raphael from Michael Angelo. Michael Angelo's forms are grander, but they are not so informed with expression. Raphael's, however ordinary in themselves, are full of expression, \"even to overflowing;\" every nerve and muscle is impregnated with feeling,\u2014bursting with meaning. In Michael Angelo, on the contrary, the powers of body and mind appear superior to any events that can happen to them; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a> of thought and feeling is never full, never strained or tasked to the extremity of what it will bear. All is in a lofty repose and solitary grandeur, which no human interests can shake or disturb. It has been said, that Michael Angelo painted man, and Raphael men; that the one was an epic, the other a dramatic painter. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> we have stated is, perhaps, truer and more intelligible, viz. that the one gave greater dignity of form, and the other greater force and refinement of expression. Michael Angelo, in fact, borrowed his style from sculpture. He represented, in general, only single figures (with subordinate accompaniments), and had not to express the conflicting actions and passions of a multitude of persons. It is therefore a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> truism to say, that his compositions are not dramatic. He is much more picturesque than Raphael. The whole figure of his Jeremiah droops and hangs down like a majestic tree surcharged with showers. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> of the human form has the characteristic freedom and boldness of Titian's landscapes.\n\nAfter Michael Angelo and Raphael, there is no doubt that Leonardo da Vinci, and Correggio, are the two painters, in modern times, who have carried historical expression to the highest ideal perfection; and yet it is equally certain that their heads are carefully copied from faces and expressions in nature. Leonardo excelled principally in his women and children. We find, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> heads, a peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARM\">charm</a> of expression; a character of natural sweetness and tender playfulness, mixed up with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a> of conscious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTELLECT\">intellect</a>, and the graceful reserve of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> dignity. He blends purity with voluptuousness; and the expression of his women is equally characteristic of \"the mistress or the saint.\" His pictures are worked up to the height of the idea he had conceived, with an elaborate felicity; but this idea was evidently first suggested, and afterwards religiously compared with nature. This was his excellence. His fault is, that his style of execution is\ntoo mathematical; that is, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a> does not follow the graceful variety of the details of objects, but substitutes certain refined gradations, both of form and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, producing equal changes in equal distances, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> uniformity. Leonardo was a man of profound learning as well as genius, and perhaps transferred too much of the formality of science to his favourite art.\n\nThe masterpieces of Correggio have the same identity with nature, the same stamp of truth. He has indeed given to his pictures the utmost softness and refinement of outline and expression; but this idea, at which he constantly aimed, is filled up with all the details and varieties which such heads would have in nature. So far from any thing like a naked abstract idea, or middle form, the individuality of his faces has something peculiar in it, even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a> the grotesque. He has endeavoured to impress habitually on the countenance, those undulating outlines which rapture or tenderness leave there, and has chosen for this purpose those forms and proportions which most obviously assisted his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>.\n\nAs to the colouring of Correggio, it is nature itself. Not only the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TONE\">tone</a> is perfectly true, but every speck and particle is varied in colour, in relief, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEXTURE\">texture</a>, with a care, a felicity, and an effect, which is almost magical. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a> are equally admirable. No one else, perhaps, ever gave the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a> and roundness to his compositions. So true are his shadows,\u2014equally free from coldness, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPACITY\">opacity</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSE\">false</a> glare;\u2014so clear, so broken, so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIRY\">airy</a>, and yet so deep, that if you hold your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> so as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHADOW\">shadow</a> on any part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> which is in the light, this part, so shaded, will present exactly the same appearance which the painter has given to the shadowed part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a>. Correggio, indeed, possessed a greater variety of excellences in the different departments of his art, than any other painter; and yet it is remarkable, that the impression which his pictures leave upon the mind of the common spectator, is monotonous and comparatively feeble. His style is in some degree mannered and confined. For instance, he is without the force, passion, and grandeur of Raphael, who, however, possessed his softness of expression, but of expression only; and in colour, in light and shade, and other qualities, was quite inferior to Correggio. We may, perhaps, solve this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a> by saying, that he applied the power of his mind to a greater variety of objects than others; but that this power was still of the same character; consisting in a certain exquisite sense of the harmonious, the soft and graceful in form, colour, and sentiment, but with a deficiency of strength, and a tendency to effeminacy in all these.\n\nAfter the names of Raphael and Correggio, we shall mention that of Guido, whose female faces are exceedingly beautiful and ideal, but altogether commonplace and vapid, compared with those of Raphael or Correggio; and they are so, for no other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> but that the general idea they convey is not enriched and strengthened by an intense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a> of nature. For the same reason, we can conceive nothing more unlike the antique than the figures of Nicholas Poussin, except as to the preservation of the costume; and it is perhaps chiefly owing to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of studying his art at second-hand, or by means of scientific rules, that the great merits of that able painter, whose understanding and genius are unquestionable, are confined to his choice of subjects for his pictures, and his manner of telling the story. His landscapes, which he probably took from nature, are superior as paintings to his historical pieces. The faces of Poussin want natural expression, as his figures want grace; but the back-grounds of his historical compositions can scarcely be surpassed. In his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAGUE\">plague</a> of Athens, the very buildings seem stiff with horror. His giants, seated on the top of their fabled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>, and playing on their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAN\">Pan</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PIPES\">pipes</a>, are as familiar and natural as if they were the ordinary inhabitants of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a>. The finest of his landscapes is his picture of the Deluge. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> is just seen wan and drooping in his course. The sky is bowed down with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of waters, and Heaven and earth seem mingling together.\n\nTitian is at the head of the Venetian school. He is the first of all colourists. In delicacy and purity Correggio is equal to him, but his colouring has not the same warmth and gusto in it. Titian's flesh-colour partakes of the glowing nature of the climate, and of the luxuriousness of the manners of his country. He represents objects not through a merely lucid medium, but as if tinged with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> light. Yet it is wonderful in how low a tone of local colouring his pictures are painted,\u2014how rigidly his means are husbanded. His most gorgeous effects are produced, not less by keeping down, than by heightening his colours; the fineness of his gradations adds to their variety and force; and, with him, truth is the same thing as splendour. Every thing is done by the severity of his eye, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a> of his touch. He is enabled to keep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PACE\">pace</a> with nature, by never hurrying on before her; and as he forms the broadest masses out of innumerable varying parts and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> strokes of the pencil, so he unites and harmonises the strongest contrasts by the most imperceptible transitions. Every distinction is relieved and broken by some other intermediate distinction, like half notes in music; and yet all this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCUMULATION\">accumulation</a> of endless variety is so managed, as only to produce the majestic simplicity of nature; so that to a common eye there is nothing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> in his pictures, any more than in nature itself. It is, we believe, owing to what has been here stated, that Titian is, of all painters, at once the easiest and the most difficult to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COPY\">copy</a>. He is the most difficult to copy perfectly, for the artifice of his colouring and execution is hid in its apparent simplicity; and yet the knowledge of nature, and the arrangement of the forms and masses in his pictures, is so masterly, that any copy made from them, even the rudest outline or sketch, can hardly fail to have a look of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> art. Because he was the greatest colourist in the world, this, which was his most prominent, has, for shortness, been considered as his only excellence; and he has been said to have been ignorant of drawing. What he was, generally speaking, deficient in, was invention or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>, though even this appears to have been more from habit than want of power; but his drawing of actual forms, where they were not to be put into momentary action, or adapted to a particular expression, was as\nHis drawing of the forms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INANIMATE\">inanimate</a> objects is unrivalled. His trees have a marked character and physiognomy of their own, and exhibit an appearance of strength or flexibility, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOLIDITY\">solidity</a> or lightness, as if they were endowed with conscious power and purposes. Character was another excellence which Titian possessed in the highest degree. It is scarcely speaking too highly of his portraits to say, that they have as much expression, that is, convey as fine an idea of intellect and feeling, as the historical heads of Raphael. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> difference appears to be, that the expression in Raphael is more imaginary and contemplative, and in Titian more personal and constitutional. The heads of the one seem thinking more of some event or subject, those of the other to be thinking more of themselves. In the portraits of Titian, as might be expected, the Italian character always predominates; there is a look of piercing sagacity, of commanding intellect, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACUTE\">acute</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a>, which it would be in vain to seek for in any other portraits. The daring spirit and irritable passions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> and country, are distinctly stamped upon their countenances, and can be as little mistaken as the costume which they wear. The portraits of Raphael, though full of profound thought and feeling, have more of common humanity about them. Titian's portraits are the most historical that ever were painted; and they are so, for this reason, that they have most consistency of form and expression. His portraits of Hippolito de Medici, and of a young Neapolitan nobleman, lately in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GALLERY\">gallery</a> of the Louvre, are a striking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTRAST\">contrast</a> in this respect. All the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> of the face in the one, the eye-brows, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOSE\">nose</a>, the corners of the mouth, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONTOUR\">contour</a> of the face, present the same sharp <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a>, the same acute, edgy, contracted, violent expression. The other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PORTRAIT\">portrait</a> has the finest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPANSION\">expansion</a> of feature and outline, and conveys the most exquisite idea possible, of mild, thoughtful sentiment. The consistency of the expression constitutes as great a charm in Titian's portraits, as the harmony of the colouring. The similarity sometimes objected to his heads, is partly national, and partly arises from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a> of persons whom he painted. He painted only Italians; and in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> it rarely happened, that any but persons of the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>, Senators, or Cardinals, sat for their pictures. The similarity of costume of the dress, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEARD\">beard</a>, &c., also adds to the similarity of their appearance. It adds, at the same time, to their picturesque effect; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> in this respect, is one circumstance among others that has been injurious, not to say fatal, to modern art. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> is not confined to portrait; for the hired dresses with which our historical painters clothe their figures, sit no more easily on the imagination of the artist, than they do gracefully on the lay-figures over which they are thrown.\n\nGiorgioni, Paul Veronese, Tintoret, and the Bassans, are the remaining great names of the Venetian school. The excellence of all of them consisted in the bold, masterly, and striking imitation of nature. Their want of ideal form, and elevated character, is, indeed, a constant subject of reproach against them. Giorgioni takes the first place among them; for he was in some measure the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of Titian, whereas the others were only his disciples. The Carraccis, Domenichino, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> of the Bolognese school, formed themselves on a principle of combining the excellences of the Roman and Venetian painters, in which they for a while succeeded to a considerable degree; but they degenerated and dwindled away into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> insignificance, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> as they departed from nature, or the great masters who had copied her, to mould their works on academic rules, and the phantoms of abstract perfection.\n\nRubens is the Prince of the Flemish painters. Of Flemish and Dutch Painters, he is perhaps the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a>,\u2014the one who painted most from his own imagination,\u2014and, what was almost the inevitable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, the most of a mannerist. He had neither the Greek forms to study from, nor the Roman expression, nor the high character, picturesque costume, and sun-burnt hues which the Venetian painters had immediately before them. He took, however, what circumstances presented to him,\u2014a fresher and more blooming tone of complexion, arising from moister air, and a colder climate. To this he added the congenial splendour of reflected lights and shadows cast from rich drapery; and he made what amends he could for the want of expression, by the richness of his compositions, and the fantastic variety of his allegorical groups. Both his colouring and his drawing were, however, ideal exaggerations. But both had particular qualities of the highest value. He has given to his flesh greater transparency and freshness, than any other painter; and this excellence he had from nature. One of the finest instances will be found in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEASANT\">Peasant</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">Family</a> going to Market, in which the figures have all the bloom of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> upon their countenances; and the very air of the surrounding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANDSCAPE\">landscape</a> strikes sharp and wholesome on the sense. Rubens had another excellence; he has given all that relates to the expression of motion in his allegorical figures, in his children, his animals, even in his trees, to a degree which no one else has equalled, or indeed approached. His drawing is often deficient in proportion, in knowledge, and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEGANCE\">elegance</a>, but it is always picturesque. The drawing of N. Poussin, on the contrary, which has been much cried up, is merely learned and anatomical: he has a knowledge of the structure and measurements of the human body, but very little feeling of the grand, or beautiful, or striking, in form. All Rubens's forms have ease, freedom, and excessive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTICITY\">elasticity</a>. In the grotesque style of history,\u2014as in the groups of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SATYRS\">satyrs</a>, nymphs, bacchanals, and animals, where striking contrasts of form are combined with every kind of rapid and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> movement, he has not a rival. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WITNESS\">Witness</a> his Silenus at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLENHEIM\">Blenheim</a>, where the lines seem drunk and staggering; and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESSION\">procession</a> of Cupids riding on animals at Whitehall, with that adventurous leader of the infantine crew, who, with a spear, is urging a lion, on which he is mounted, over the edge of the world; for beyond we only see a precipice of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">clouds</a> and sky. Rubens's power of expressing motion perhaps arose from the facility of his pencil, and his habitually trusting a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> and imagination in his compositions; for this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> can be given in no other way. His portraits are the least\nvaluable productions of his pencil. His landscapes are often delightful, and appear like the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAIRY\">fairy</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>.\n\nIt remains to speak of Vandyke and Rembrandt, the one the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a> of Rubens, the other the entire founder of his own school. It is not possible for two painters to be more opposite. The characteristic merits of the former are very happily summed up in a single line of a poetical critic, where he speaks of\n\n\"The soft precision of the clear Vandyke.\"\n\nThe general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a> of the works of the great masters, has been to show, that their pre-eminence has constantly depended, not on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a> of a fantastic, abstract excellence, existing nowhere but in their own minds, but in their selecting and embodying some one view of nature, which came immediately under their habitual observation, and which their particular genius led them to study and imitate with success. This is certainly the case with Vandyke. His portraits, mostly of English women, in the collection in the Louvre, have a cool refreshing air about them, a look of simplicity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a> even in the very tone, which forms a fine contrast to the voluptuous glow and mellow golden lustre of Titian's Italian women. There is a quality of flesh-colour in Vandyke which is to be found in no other painter, and which exactly conveys the idea of the soft, smooth, sliding, continuous, delicately varied <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a> of the skin. The objects in his pictures have the least possible difference of light and shade, and are presented to the eye without passing through any indirect medium. It is this extreme purity and silvery clearness of tone, together with the facility and precision of his particular forms, and a certain air of fashionable elegance, characteristic of the age in which he flourished, that places Vandyke in the first rank of portrait painters.\n\nIf ever there was a man of genius in the art, it was Rembrandt. He might be said to have created a medium of his own, through which he saw all objects. He was the grossest and the least vulgar, that is to say, the least common-place in his grossness, of all men. He was the most downright, the least fastidious of the imitators of nature. He took any object, he cared not what, how <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> soever in form, colour, and expression, and from the light and shade which he threw upon it, it came out gorgeous from his hands. As Vandyke made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of the smallest contrasts of light and shade, and painted as if in the open air, Rembrandt used the most violent and abrupt contrasts in this respect, and painted his objects as if in a dungeon. His pictures may be said to be \"bright with excessive darkness.\" His vision had acquired a lynx-eyed sharpness from the artificial obscurity to which he had accustomed himself. \"Mystery and silence hung upon his pencil.\" Yet he could <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> rapidly from one extreme to another, and dip his colours with equal success in the gloom of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>, or in the blaze of the noon-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> sun. In surrounding different objects with a medium of imagination, solemn or dazzling, he was a true poet; in all the rest, he was a mere painter, but a painter of no common stamp. The powers of his hand were equal to those of his eye; and indeed he could not have attempted the subjects he did, without an execution as masterly as his knowledge was profound. His colours are sometimes dropped in lumps on the canvas; at other times they are laid on as smooth as glass; and he not unfrequently painted with the handle of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRUSH\">brush</a>. He had an eye for all objects as far as he had seen them. His history and landscapes are equally fine in their way. His landscapes we could look at for ever, though there is nothing in them. But \"they are of the earth, earthly.\" It seems as if he had dug them out of nature. Everything is so true, so real, so full of all the feelings and associations which the eye can suggest to the other senses, that we immediately take as strong an affection to them, as if they were our home\u2014the very place where we were brought up. No <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> of time could add to the intensity of the impression they convey. Rembrandt is the least classical and the most romantic of all painters. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JACOB\">Jacob</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LADDER\">Ladder</a> is more like a dream than any other picture that ever was painted. The figure of Jacob himself is thrown in one corner of the picture like a bundle of clothes, while the angels hover above the darkness, in the shape of airy wings.\n\nIt would be needless to prove that the generality of the Dutch painters copied from actual objects. They have become almost a bye-word for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> this principle into its abuse, by copying every thing they saw, and having no choice or preference of one thing to another, unless that they preferred that which was most obvious and common. We forgive them. They perhaps did better in faithfully and skilfully imitating what they had seen, than in imagining what they had not seen. Their pictures at least show, that there is nothing in nature, however mean or trivial, that has not its beauty\u2014and some interest belonging to it, if truly represented. We prefer Vangoyen's views on the borders of a canal, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a>-tufted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a>, and passing sail, or Ruysdael's woods and sparkling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> falls, to the most classical or epic compositions which they could have invented out of nothing; and we think that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TENIERS\">Teniers</a>'s boors, old women, and children, are very superior to the little carved <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IVORY\">ivory</a> Venuses in the pictures of Vandermeer; just as we think Hogarth's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">Marriage</a> \u00e0 la Mode is better than his Sigismunda, or as Mr Wilkie's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARD\">Card</a>-Players is better than his Alfred. We should not assuredly prefer a Dutch Fair by Teniers to a Cartoon by Raphael; but we suspect we should prefer a Dutch Fair by Teniers to a Cartoon by the same master; or we should prefer truth and nature in the simplest dress, to affectation and insanity in the most pompous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISGUISE\">disguise</a>. Whatever is genuine in art, must proceed from the impulse of nature and individual genius.\n\nIn the French school there are but two names of high and established reputation, N. Poussin and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLAUDE\">Claude</a> Lorraine. Of the former we have already spoken: of the latter we shall give our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> when we come to speak of our own Wilson. We ought not to pass over the names of Murillo and Velasquez, those admirable Spanish painters. It is difficult to characterize their peculiar excellences as distinct from those of the Italian and Dutch schools. They may be said to hold a middle rank between\nFine Arts, the painters of mind and body. They express not so much thought and sentiment, nor yet the mere exterior, as the life and spirit of the man. Murillo is probably at the head of that class of painters who have treated subjects of common life. After making the colours on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CANVASS\">canvass</a> feel and think, the next best thing is to make them breathe and live. But there is in Murillo's pictures of this kind a look of real life, a cordial flow of native animal spirits, which we find nowhere else. We might here refer particularly to his picture of the Two Spanish Beggars boys in the collection at Dulwich <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">College</a>, which cannot easily be forgotten by those who have ever seen it.\n\nWe come now to speak of the progress of art in our own Country,\u2014of its present state,\u2014and the means proposed for advancing it to still higher perfection.\n\nWe shall speak first of Hogarth, both as he is the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> in the order of time that we have to boast of, and as he is the greatest comic painter of any age or country. His pictures are not imitations of still life, or mere transcripts of incidental scenes or customs; but powerful moral satires, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> vice and folly in their most ludicrous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of view, and with a profound insight into the weak sides of character and manners, in all their tendencies, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a>, and contrasts. There is not a single picture of his, containing a representation of merely natural or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> scenery. His object is not so much \"to hold the mirror up to nature,\" as \"to show vice her own feature, scorn her own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGE\">image</a>.\" Folly is there seen at the height\u2014the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">moon</a> is at the full\u2014it is the very error of the time. There is a perpetual collision of eccentricities, a tilt and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOURNAMENT\">tournament</a> of absurdities, pampered into all sorts of affectation, airy, extravagant, and ostentatious! Yet he is as little a caricaturist as he is a painter of still life. Criticism has not done him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, though public opinion has. His works have received a sanction which it would be vain to dispute, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> delight and admiration with which they have been regarded, from their first appearance, to the present moment. If the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of amusement, or of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> for reflection which they have afforded, is that by which we are to judge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRECEDENCE\">precedence</a> among the intellectual benefactors of mankind, there are perhaps few persons who can put in a stronger claim to our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> than Hogarth. The wonderful knowledge which he possessed of human life and manners, is only to be surpassed (if it can be) by the powers of invention with which he has arranged his materials, and by the mastery of execution with which he has embodied and made tangible the very thoughts and passing movements of the mind. Some persons object to the style of Hogarth's pictures, or the class to which they belong. First, Hogarth belongs to no class, or, if he belongs to any, it is to the same class as Fielding, Smollett, Vanbrugh, and Moli\u00e8re. Besides, the merit of his pictures does not depend on the nature of his subjects, but on the knowledge <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> of them, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a>, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUND\">fund</a> of observation and amusement contained in them. Make what deductions you please for the vulgarity of the subjects\u2014yet in the research, the profundity, the absolute truth and precision of the delineation of character,\u2014in the invention of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INCIDENT\">incident</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WIT\">wit</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a>, in life and motion, in everlasting variety and originality,\u2014they never have, and probably never will be surpassed. They stimulate the faculties, as well as amuse them. \"Other pictures we see, Hogarth's we read!\"\n\nThere is one error which has been frequently entertained on this subject, and which we wish to correct, namely, that Hogarth's genius was confined to the imitation of the coarse humours and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARCE\">farce</a> of the lowest life. But he excelled quite as much in exhibiting the vices, the folly, and frivolity of the fashionable manners of his time. His fine ladies do not yield the palm of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIDICULE\">ridicule</a> to his waiting-maids, and his lords and his porters are on a very respectable footing of equality. He is quite at home, either in St Giles's or St James's. There is no want, for example, in his Marriage \u00e0 la Mode, or his Taste in High Life, of affectation verging into idiocy, or of languid sensibility that might\n\n\"Die of a rose in aromatic pain.\"\n\nMany of Hogarth's characters would form admirable illustrations of Pope's Satires, who was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">contemporary</a> with him. In short, Hogarth was a painter of real, not of low life. He was, as we have said, a satirist, and consequently his pencil did not dwell on the grand and beautiful, but it glanced with equal success at the absurdities and peculiarities of high or low life, \"of the great vulgar and the small.\"\n\nTo this it must be added, that he was as great a master of passion as of humour. He succeeded in low <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRAGEDY\">tragedy</a>, as much as in low or genteel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMEDY\">comedy</a>, and had an absolute power in moving the affections and rending the hearts of the spectators, by depicting the effects of the most dreadful calamities of human life, on common minds and common countenances. Of this, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RAKE\">Rake</a>'s Progress, particularly the Bedlam scene, and many others, are unanswerable proofs. Hogarth's merits, as a mere artist, are not confined to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINTS\">prints</a>. In general, indeed, this is the case. But when he chose to take pains, he could add the delicacies of execution and colouring in the highest degree to those of character and composition; as is evident in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of pictures, all equally well painted, of the Marriage \u00e0 la Mode, exhibited lately at the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">Institution</a>.\n\nWe shall next speak of Wilson, whose pictures may be divided into three classes:\u2014his Italian landscapes, or imitations of the manner of Claude,\u2014his copies of English scenery,\u2014and his historical compositions. The first of these are, in our opinion, by much the best; and we appeal, in support of this opinion, to the Apollo and the Seasons, and to the Phaeton. The figures are of course out of the question (these being as uncouth and slovenly as Claude's are insipid and finical); but the landscape,\n\nSee an admirable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> on the genius of Hogarth, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> Lamb, in a periodical work called The Reflector.\nFine Arts in both pictures, is delightful. In looking at them, we breathe the air which the scene inspires, and feel the genius of the place present to us. In the first, there is the cool freshness of a misty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>; the sky, the water, the dim <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZON\">horizon</a>, all convey the same feeling. The fine grey tone, and varying outline of the hills; the graceful form of the retiring lake, broken still more by the hazy shadows of the objects that repose on its bosom; the light trees that expand their branches in the air; and the dark <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> figure and mouldering temple, that contrast strongly with the broad clear light of the rising day,\u2014give a charm, a truth, a force and harmony to this composition, which produce the greater pleasure the longer it is dwelt on. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a> of light and shade resembles the effect of light on a globe. The Ph\u00e6ton has the dazzling fervid appearance of an autumnal evening; the golden radiance streams in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> masses from behind the flickering clouds; every object is baked in the sun,\u2014the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> fore-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>, the thick foliage of the trees, the streams, shrunk and stealing along behind the dark high banks,\u2014combine to produce that richness, and characteristic unity of effect, which is to be found only in nature, or in art derived from the study and imitation of nature. These two pictures, as they have the greatest general effect, are also more carefully finished than any other pictures we have seen of his.\n\nIn general, Wilson's views of English scenery want almost everything that ought to recommend them. The subjects he has chosen are not well fitted for the landscape-painter, and there is nothing in the execution to redeem them. Ill-shaped mountains, or great heaps of earth, trees that grow against them without character or elegance, motionless waterfalls, a want of relief, of transparency and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a>, without the imposing grandeur of real <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a> (which it is scarcely within the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of art to give),\u2014are the chief features and defects of this class of his pictures. In more confined scenes, the effect must depend almost entirely on the difference in the execution and the details; for the difference of colour alone is not sufficient to give relief to objects placed at a small distance from the eye. But, in Wilson, there are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> no details,\u2014all is loose and general; and this very circumstance, which might assist him in giving the massy contrasts of light and shade, deprived his pencil of all force and precision within a limited space. In general, air is necessary to the landscape-painter; and, for this reason, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUMBERLAND\">Cumberland</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WESTMORELAND\">Westmoreland</a> afford few subjects for landscape-painting. However stupendous the scenery of that country is, and however powerful and lasting the impression which it must always make on the imagination, yet the effect is not produced merely through the medium of the eye, but arises chiefly from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLATERAL\">collateral</a> and associated feelings. There is the knowledge of the physical magnitude of the objects in the midst of which we are placed,\u2014the slow, improgressive motion, which we make in traversing them;\u2014there is the abrupt precipice, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TORRENT\">torrent</a>'s roar, the boundless expanse of the prospect from the highest mountains,\u2014the difficulty of their ascent, their loneliness and silence; in short, there is a constant sense and superstitious awe of the collective power of matter, of the gigantic and eternal forms of nature, on which, from the beginning of time, the hand of man has made no impression, and which, by the lofty reflections they excite in us, give a sort of intellectual sublimity even to our sense of physical weakness. But there is little in all these circumstances that can be translated into the picturesque, which makes its appeal immediately to the eye.\n\nWilson's historical landscapes, his Niobe, Celadon and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMELIA\">Amelia</a>, &c. do not, in our estimation, display either true taste or fine imagination, but are affected and violent exaggerations of clumsy common nature. They are made up mechanically of the same stock of materials,\u2014an over-hanging rock, bare shattered trees, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> rolling clouds, and forked <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a>. The figures, in the most celebrated of these, are not like the children of Niobe, punished by the Gods, but like a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUP\">group</a> of rustics, crouching from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIL\">hail</a>-storm. We agree with Sir Joshua Reynolds, that Wilson's mind was not, like N. Poussin's, sufficiently imbued with the knowledge of antiquity to transport the imagination three thousand years back, to give natural objects a sympathy with preternatural events, and to inform rocks, and trees, and mountains, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a> of a God. To sum up his general character, we may observe, that, besides his excellence in aerial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSPECTIVE\">perspective</a>, Wilson had great truth, harmony, and depth of local colouring. He had a fine feeling of the proportions and conduct of light and shade, and also an eye for graceful form, as far as regards the bold and varying outlines of indefinite objects; as may be seen in his foregrounds, &c. where the artist is not tied down to an imitation of characteristic and articulate forms. In his figures, trees, cattle, and in everything having a determinate and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> form, his pencil was not only deficient in accuracy of outline, but even in perspective and actual relief. His trees, in particular, frequently seem pasted on the canvass, like botanical specimens. In fine, we cannot subscribe to the opinion of those who assert, that Wilson was superior to Claude as a man of genius; nor can we discern any other grounds for this opinion, than what would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> to the general conclusion,\u2014that the more slovenly the performance the finer the picture, and that that which is imperfect is superior to that which is perfect. It might be said, on the same principle, that the coarsest sign-painting is better than the reflection of a landscape in a mirror; and the objection that is sometimes made to the mere imitation of nature, cannot be made to the landscapes of Claude, for in them the Graces themselves have, with their own hands, assisted in selecting and disposing every object. Is the general effect in his pictures injured by the details? Is the truth inconsistent with the beauty of the imitation? Does the perpetual profusion of objects and scenery, all perfect in themselves, interfere with the simple grandeur and comprehensive magnificence of the whole? Does the precision with which a plant is marked in the foreground, take away from the air-drawn distinctions of the blue glimmering horizon? Is there any want of that endless airy space, where the eye wanders at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> under the open sky, explores distant objects, and returns back as from a de-\nThere is no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> between Claude and Wilson. Sir Joshua Reynolds used to say, that there would be another Raphael before there would be another Claude. His landscapes have all that is exquisite and refined in art and nature. Everything is moulded into grace and harmony; and, at the touch of his pencil, shepherds with their flocks, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a> and groves, and winding glades, and scattered hamlets, rise up in never-ending succession, under the azure sky and the resplendent sun, while \"universal Pan,\n\n\"Knit with the Graces, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a> in dance,\nLeads on the eternal spring.\"\n\nMichael Angelo has left, in one of his sonnets, a fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOSTROPHE\">apostrophe</a> to the earliest poet of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>:\n\n\"Fain would I, to be what our Dante was,\nForego the happiest fortunes of mankind.\"\n\nWhat landscape-painter does not feel this of Claude? We have heard an anecdote connected with the reputation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAINSBOROUGH\">Gainsborough</a>'s pictures, which rests on pretty good authority. Sir Joshua Reynolds, at one of the Academy dinners, speaking of Gainsborough, said to a friend,\u2014\u201cHe is undoubtedly the best English landscape-painter.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Wilson, who overheard the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVERSATION\">conversation</a>, \u201che is not the best landscape-painter, but he is the best portrait painter in England.\u201d They were both wrong; but the story is creditable to the versatility of Gainsborough's talents.\n\nThose of his portraits which we have seen are not in the first rank. They are in a good measure imitations of Van Dyke; and have more an air of gentility than of nature. His landscapes are of two classes or periods; his early and his later pictures. The former are minute imitations of nature, or of painters who imitated nature, such as Ruysdael, &c., some of which have great truth and clearness. His later pictures are flimsy caricatures of Rubens, who himself carried inattention to the details to the utmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIMIT\">limit</a> that it would bear. Many of Gainsborough's latter landscapes may be compared to bad water-colour drawings, washed in by mechanical movements of the hand, without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> with the eye. The truth seems to be, that Gainsborough found there was something wanting in his early manner, that is, something beyond the literal imitation of the details of natural objects; and he appears to have concluded rather hastily, that the way to arrive at that something more, was to discard truth and nature altogether. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> rests principally, at present, on his fancy-pieces, cottage-children, shepherd-boys, &c. These have often great truth, great sweetness, and the subjects are often chosen with great felicity. We too often find, however, Fine Arts, even in his happiest efforts, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSCIOUSNESS\">consciousness</a> in the turn of the limbs, and a pensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUOR\">languor</a> in the expression, which is not taken from nature. We think the gloss of art is never so ill bestowed as on such subjects, the essence of which is simplicity. It is perhaps the general fault of Gainsborough, that he presents us with an ideal common life, of which we have had a surfeit in poetry and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROMANCE\">romance</a>. His subjects are softened, and sentimentalised too much; it is not simple unaffected nature that we see, but nature sitting for her picture. Our artist, we suspect, led the way to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASQUERADE\">masquerade</a> style, which piques itself on giving the air of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADONIS\">Adonis</a> to the driver of a hay-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CART\">cart</a>, and models the features of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>-maid on the principles of the antique. His Woodman's Head is admirable. Nor can too much praise be given to his Shepherd Boy in a Storm; in which the unconscious simplicity of the boy's expression, looking up with his hands folded and with timid wonder,\u2014the noisy chattering of a magpie perched above,\u2014and the rustling of the coming storm in the branches of the trees, produce a most delightful and romantic impression on the mind.\n\nGainsborough was to be considered, perhaps, rather as a man of delicate taste, and of an elegant and feeling mind, than as a man of genius; as a lover of the art, rather than an artist. He devoted himself to it, with a view to amuse and soothe his mind, with the ease of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>, not with the severity of a professional student. He wished to make his pictures, like himself, amiable; but a too constant desire to please almost unavoidably leads to affectation and effeminacy. He wanted that vigour of intellect, which perceives the beauty of truth; and thought that painting was to be gained, like other mistresses, by flattery and smiles. It was an error which we are disposed to forgive in one, around whose memory, both as an artist and a man, many fond recollections, many vain regrets, must always linger.\n\nThe authority of Sir Joshua Reynolds, both from Sir Joshua's example and instructions, has had, and still continues to have, a considerable influence on the state of art in this country. That influence has been on the whole unquestionably beneficial in itself, as well as highly creditable to the rare talents and elegant mind of Sir Joshua; for it has raised the art of painting from the lowest state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEGRADATION\">degradation</a>,\u2014of dry, meagre, lifeless <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INANITY\">inanity</a>, to something at least respectable, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> to the rough strength and bold spirit of the national character. Whether the same implicit deference to his authority, which has helped to advance the art thus far, may not, among other causes, limit and retard its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> progress? Whether there are not certain ori-\n\n---\n\n* This painter's book of studies from nature, commonly called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIBER\">Liber</a> Veritatis, disproves the truth of the general opinion that his landscapes are mere artificial compositions, for the finished pictures are nearly facsimiles of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> sketches.\n\n\u2020 The idea of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of improving upon nature, and giving what was called a flattering likeness, was universal in this country fifty years ago; so that Gainsborough is not to be so much blamed for tampering with his subjects.\nginal errors, both in his principles and practice, which, the farther they are proceeded in, the farther they will lead us from the truth? Whether there is not a systematic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BIAS\">bias</a> from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> line by which alone we can arrive at the goal of the highest perfection?\u2014are questions well worth considering.\n\nWe shall begin with Sir Joshua's merits as an artist. There is one error which we wish to correct at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SETTING\">setting</a> out, because we think it important. There is not a greater or more unaccountable mistake than the supposition that Sir Joshua Reynolds owed his success or excellence in his profession, to his having been the first who introduced into this country more general principles of the art, and who raised portrait to the dignity of history from the low drudgery of copying the peculiarities, meannesses, and details of individual nature, which was all that had been attempted by his immediate predecessors. This is so far from being true, that the very reverse is the fact. If Sir Joshua did not give these details and peculiarities so much as might be wished, those who went before him did not give them at all. Those pretended general principles of the art, which, it is said, \"alone give value and dignity to it,\" had been pushed to their extremest absurdity before his time; and it was in getting rid of the mechanical systematic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONOTONY\">monotony</a> and middle forms, by the help of which Lely, Kneller, Hudson, the French painters, and others, carried on their manufactories of history and face-painting, and in returning (as far as he did return) to the truth and force of individual nature, that the secret both of his fame and fortune lay. The pedantic, servile race of artists, whom Reynolds superseded, had carried the abstract principle of improving on nature to such a degree of refinement, that they left it out altogether; and confounded all the varieties and irregularities of form, feature, character, expression or attitude, in the same artificial mould of fancied grace and fashionable insipidity. The portraits of Kneller, for example, seem all to have been turned in a machine; the eye-brows are arched as if by a compass; the mouth curled, and the chin dimpled, the head turned on one side, and the hands placed in the same affected position. The portraits of this mannerist, therefore, are as like one another as the dresses which were then in fashion; and have the same \"dignity and value\" as the full-bottomed wigs which graced their originals. The superiority of Reynolds consisted in his being varied and natural, instead of being artificial and uniform. The spirit, grace, or dignity which he added to his portraits, he borrowed from nature, and not from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMBIGUOUS\">ambiguous</a> quackery of rules. His feeling of truth and nature was too strong to permit him to adopt the unmeaning style of Kneller and Hudson; but his logical acuteness was not such as to enable him to detect the verbal fallacies and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a> absurdities which he had learned from Richardson and Copley; and, from some defects in his own practice, he was led to confound negligence with grandeur. But of this hereafter.\n\nSir Joshua Reynolds owed his vast superiority over his contemporaries to incessant practice, and habitual attention to nature, to quick organic sensibility, to considerable power of observation, and still greater taste in perceiving and availing himself of those excellences of others, which lay within his own walk of art. We can by no means look upon Sir Joshua as having a claim to the first rank of genius. He would hardly have been a great painter, if other greater painters had not lived before him. He would not have given a first impulse to the art, nor did he advance any part of it beyond the point where he found it. He did not present any new view of nature, nor is he to be placed in the same class with those who did. Even in colour, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PALLET\">pallet</a> was spread for him by the old Masters, and his eye imbibed its full perception of depth and harmony of tone, from the Dutch and Venetian schools, rather than from nature. His early pictures are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> and flimsy. He indeed learned to see the inner qualities of nature through the works of art, which he, perhaps, might never have discovered in nature itself. He became rich by the accumulation of borrowed wealth, and his genius was the offspring of taste. He combined and applied the materials of others to his own purpose, with admirable success; he was an industrious compiler, or skilful translator, not an original inventor in art. The art would remain, in all its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> elements, just where it is, if Sir Joshua had never lived. He has supplied the industry of future plagiarists with no new materials. But it has been well observed, that the value of every work of art, as well as the genius of the artist, depends, not more on the degree of excellence, than on the degree of originality displayed in it. Sir Joshua, however, was perhaps the most original imitator that ever appeared in the world: and the reason of this, in a great measure, was, that he was compelled to combine what he saw in art, with what he saw in nature, which was constantly before him. The portrait-painter is, in this respect, much less liable than the historical painter, to deviate into the extremes of manner and affectation; for he cannot discard nature altogether, under the excuse that she only puts him out. He must meet her, face to face; and if he is not incorrigible, he will see something there that cannot fail to be of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> to him. Another circumstance which must have been favourable to Sir Joshua was, that though not the originator in point of time, he was the first Englishman who transplanted the higher excellences of his profession into his own country, and had the merit, if not of an inventor, of a reformer of the art. His mode of painting had the graces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a> in the age and country in which he lived; and he had, therefore, all the stimulus to exertion, which arose from the enthusiastic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLAUSE\">applause</a> of his contemporaries, and from a desire to expand and refine the taste of the public.\n\nTo an eye for colour and for effects of light and shade, Sir Joshua united a strong perception of individual character,\u2014a lively feeling of the quaint and grotesque in expression, and great mastery of execution. He had comparatively little knowledge of drawing, either as it regarded proportion or form. The beauty of some of his female faces and figures arises almost entirely from their softness and fleshiness. His pencil wanted firmness and precision. The expression, even of his best portraits, seldom implies either lofty or impassioned intellect or deli-\ncate sensibility. He also wanted grace, if grace requires simplicity. The mere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGATION\">negation</a> of stiffness and formality is not grace; for looseness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTORTION\">distortion</a> are not grace. His favourite attitudes are not easy and natural, but the affectation of ease and nature. They are violent deviations from a right line. Many of the figures in his fancy-pieces are placed in postures in which they could not remain for an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INSTANT\">instant</a> without extreme difficulty and awkwardness. We might instance the Girl drawing with a pencil, and some others. His portraits are his best pictures, and of these his portraits of men are the best; his pictures of children are the next in value. He had fine subjects for the former, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASCULINE\">masculine</a> sense and originality of character of many of the persons whom he painted; and he had also a great advantage (as far as practice went) in painting a number of persons of every rank and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>. Some of the finest and most interesting are those of Dr Johnson, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOLDSMITH\">Goldsmith</a> (which is, however, too much a mere sketch), Baretti, Dr Burney, John Hunter, and the inimitable portrait of Bishop Newton. The elegant simplicity of character, expression, and drawing, preserved throughout the last picture, even to the attitude and mode of handling, discover the true genius of a painter. We also remember to have seen a print of Thomas Warton, than which nothing could be more characteristic or more natural. These were all Reynolds's intimate acquaintances, and it could not be said of them that they were men of \"no mark or likelihood.\" Their traits had probably sunk deep into the artist's mind; he painted them as pure studies from nature, copying the real image existing before him, with all its known characteristic peculiarities; and, with as much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> as good-nature, sacrificing the graces on the altar of friendship. They are downright portraits, and nothing more, and they are valuable in proportion. In his portraits of women, on the contrary (with very few exceptions), Sir Joshua appears to have consulted either the vanity of his employers or his own fanciful theory. They have not the look of individual nature, nor have they, to compensate the want of this, either peculiar elegance of form, refinement of expression, delicacy of complexion, or gracefulness of manner. Vandyke's attitudes have been complained of as stiff and confined. Reynolds, to avoid this defect, has fallen into the contrary extreme of negligence and contortion. His female figures which aim at gentility, are twisted into that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERPENTINE\">serpentine</a> line, the idea of which he ridiculed so much in Hogarth. Indeed Sir Joshua, in his Discourses (see his account of Correggio), speaks of grace as if it were nearly allied to affectation. Grace signifies that which is pleasing and natural in the posture and motions of the human form, as Beauty is more properly applied to the form itself. That which is stiff, inanimate, and without motion, cannot, therefore, be graceful; but, to suppose that a figure, to be graceful, need only be put into some languishing or extravagant posture, is to mistake flutter and affectation for ease and elegance.\n\nSir Joshua's children, as we have said above, are among his chef d'oeuvres. The faces of children have in general that want of precision of outline, that prominence of relief and strong contrast of colour, which were peculiarly adapted to his style of painting. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> simplicity of expression, and the grotesque character which he has given to the heads of his children, were, however, borrowed from Correggio. His Puck is the most masterly of all these; and the colouring, execution, and character, alike exquisite. The single figure of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANT\">Infant</a> Hercules is also admirable. Many of those to which his friends have suggested historical titles are mere common portraits or casual studies. Thus the Infant Samuel is an innocent little child, saying its prayers at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a>'s feet: it has nothing to do with the story of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEBREW\">Hebrew</a> prophet. The same objection will apply to many of his fancy-pieces and historical compositions. There is often no connection between the picture and the subject but the name. Even his celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IPHIGENIA\">Iphigenia</a> (beautiful as she is, and prodigal of her charms) does not answer to the idea of the story. In drawing the naked figure, Sir Joshua's want of truth and firmness of outline, became more apparent; and his mode of laying on his colours, which, in the face and extremities, was relieved and broken by the abrupt inequalities of surface and variety of tints in each part, produced a degree of heaviness and opacity in the larger masses of flesh-colour, which can indeed only be avoided by extreme delicacy, or extreme lightness of execution.\n\nShall we speak the truth at once? In our opinion, Sir Joshua did not possess either that high imagination, or those strong feelings, without which no painter can become a poet in his art. His larger historical compositions have been generally allowed to be most liable to objection, in a critical point of view. We shall not attempt to judge them by scientific or technical rules, but make one or two observations on the character and feeling displayed in them. The highest subject which Sir Joshua has attempted was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> Ugolino, and it was, as might be expected from the circumstances, a total failure. He had, it seems, painted a study of an old beggar-man's head; and some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a>, who must have known as little of painting as of poetry, persuaded the unsuspecting artist, that it was the exact expression of Dante's Count Ugolino, one of the most grand, terrific, and appalling characters in modern fiction. Reynolds, who knew nothing of the matter but what he was told, took his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOOD_FORTUNE\">good fortune</a> for granted, and only extended his canvass to admit the rest of the figures. The attitude and expression of Count Ugolino himself, are what the artist intended them to be, till they were pampered into something else by the officious vanity of friends\u2014those of a common mendicant at the corner of a street, waiting patiently for some charitable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DONATION\">donation</a>. The imagination of the painter took refuge in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> work-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, instead of ascending the steps of the Tower of Famine. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERO\">hero</a> of Dante is a lofty, high-minded, and unprincipled Italian nobleman, who had betrayed his country to the enemy, and who, as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> for his crime, is shut up with his four sons in the dungeon of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITADEL\">citadel</a>, where he shortly finds the doors barred against him, and food withheld. He in vain watches with eager feverish eye the opening of the door at the accustomed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>, and his looks turn to\nEven in the other world, he is represented with the same fierce, dauntless, unrelenting character, \"gnawing the skull of his adversary, his fell repast.\" The subject of the Laoco\u00f6n is scarcely equal to that described by Dante. The horror there is physical and momentary; in the other, the imagination fills up the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, obscure, dreary void of despair, and joins its unutterable pangs to the loud cries of nature. What is there in the picture to convey the ghastly horrors of the scene, or the mighty energy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> with which they are borne? His picture of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MACBETH\">Macbeth</a> is full of wild and grotesque images; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> of the witches contains a very elaborate and well arranged inventory of dreadful objects. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARDINAL\">Cardinal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEAUFORT\">Beaufort</a> is a fine display of rich mellow colouring; and there is something gentlemanly and Shakespearian in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">King</a> and the attendant Noblemen. At the same time, we think the expression of the Cardinal himself is too much one of physical horror, a canine gnashing of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>, like a man strangled. This is not the best style of history. Mrs Siddons as the Tragic Muse, is neither the tragic muse nor Mrs Siddons; and we have still stronger objections to Garrick between Tragedy and Comedy.\n\nThere is a striking similarity between Sir Joshua Reynolds's theory and his practice; and as each of these has been appealed to in support of the other, it is necessary that we should examine both. Sir Joshua's practice was generally confined to the illustration of that part of his theory, which relates to the more immediate imitation of nature, and it is to what he says on this subject, that we shall chiefly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> our observations at present.\n\nHe lays it down as a general and invariable rule, that \"the great style in art, and the most perfect imitation of nature, consists in avoiding the details and peculiarities of particular objects.\" This sweeping principle he applies almost indiscriminately to Portrait, History, and Landscape; and he appears to have been led to the conclusion itself, from supposing the imitation of particulars to be inconsistent with general truth and effect. It appears to us, that the highest perfection of the art depends, not on separating but on uniting general truth and effect with individual distinctness and accuracy.\n\nFirst, it is said, that the great style in painting, as it relates to the immediate imitation of external nature, consists in avoiding the details of particular objects. It consists neither in giving nor avoiding them, but in something quite different from both. Any one may avoid the details. So far, there is no difference between the Cartoons, and a common sign-\n\nGreatness consists in giving the larger Fine Arts masses and proportions with truth\u2014this does not prevent giving the smaller ones too. The utmost grandeur of outline, and the broadest masses of light and shade, are perfectly compatible with the utmost minuteness and delicacy of detail, as may be seen in nature. It is not, indeed, common to see both qualities combined in the imitations of nature, any more than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of other excellences; nor are we here saying to which the principal attention of the artist should be directed; but we deny, that, considered in themselves, the absence of the one quality is necessary or sufficient to the production of the other.\n\nIf, for example, the form of the eye-brow is correctly given, it will be perfectly indifferent to the truth or grandeur of the design, whether it consists of one broad mark, or is composed of a number of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>-lines, arranged in the same order. So, if the lights and shades are disposed in fine and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> masses, the breadth of the picture, as it is called, cannot possibly be affected by the filling up of those masses with the details, that is, with the subordinate distinctions which appear in nature. The anatomical details in Michael Angelo, the ever-varying outline of Raphael, the perfect execution of the Greek statues, do not destroy their symmetry or dignity of form; and, in the finest specimens of the composition of colour, we may observe the largest masses combined with the greatest variety in the parts of which those masses are composed.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> style consists in giving no details; the finical in giving nothing else. Nature contains both large and small parts, both masses and details; and the same may be said of the most perfect works of art. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNION\">union</a> of both kinds of excellence, of strength with delicacy, as far as the limits of human capacity, and the shortness of human life would permit, is that which has established the reputation of the most successful imitators of nature. Farther, their most finished works are their best. The predominance, indeed, of either excellence in the best Masters, has varied according to their opinion of the relative value of these qualities,\u2014the labour they had the time or the patience to bestow on their works,\u2014the skill of the artist,\u2014or the nature and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of his subject. But, if the rule here objected to (that the careful imitation of the parts injures the effect of the whole), be once admitted, slovenliness would become another name for genius, and the most unfinished performance be the best. That such has been the confused impression left on the mind by the perusal of Sir Joshua Reynolds's Discourses, is evident from the practice, as well as conversation, of many (even eminent) artists. The late Mr Opie proceeded entirely on this principle. He left many admirable studies of portraits, particularly in what relates to the disposition and effect of light and shade; but he never finished any of the parts, thinking them beneath the attention\n\n---\n\n* Why does not the British Institution, instead of patronising pictures of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-WATERLOO\">Waterloo</a>, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> coats, foolish faces, and labels of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VICTORY\">victory</a>, offer a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIZE\">prize</a> for a picture of the subject of Ugolino that shall be equal to the group of the Laoco\u00f6n? That would be the way to do something, if there is any thing to be done by such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRONAGE\">patronage</a>.\nHe went over the whole head the second day as he had done the first, and therefore made no progress. The picture at last, having neither the lightness of a sketch, nor the accuracy of a finished work, looked coarse, laboured, and heavy. Titian is the most perfect example of high finishing. In him the details are engrained on the most profound knowledge of effect, and attention to the character of what he represented. His pictures have the exact look of nature, the very tone and texture of flesh. The variety of his tints is blended into the greatest simplicity. There is a proper degree both of solidity and transparency. All the parts hang together; every stroke tells, and adds to the effect of the rest. Sir Joshua seems to deny that Titian finished much; and says that he produced, by two or three strokes of his pencil, effects which the most laborious copyist would in vain attempt to equal. It is true, he availed himself in some degree of what is called execution, to facilitate his imitation of the details and peculiarities of nature; but it was to facilitate, not to supersede it. There can be nothing more distinct than execution and daubing. Titian, however, made a very moderate, though a very admirable use of this power; and those who copy his pictures will find that the simplicity is in the results, not in the details. To conclude our observations on this head, we will only add, that, while the artist thinks there is anything to be done, either to the whole or to the parts of his picture, which can give it still more the look of nature, if he is willing to proceed, we would not advise him to desist. This rule is the more necessary to the young student, for he will relax in his attention as he grows older. And again, with respect to the subordinate parts of a picture, there is no danger that he will bestow a disproportionate degree of labour upon them, because he will not feel the same interest in copying them, and because a much less degree of accuracy will serve every purpose of deception.\n\nSecondly, with regard to the imitation of expression, we can hardly agree with Sir Joshua, that \"the perfection of portrait-painting consists in giving the general idea or character without the individual peculiarities.\" No doubt, if we were to choose between the general character, and the peculiarities of feature, we ought to prefer the former. But, they are so far from being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a> with, that they are not without some difficulty distinguishable from, each other. There is a general look of the face, a predominant expression arising from the correspondence and connection of the different parts, which it is of the first and last importance to give; and without which, no elaboration of detached parts, or marking of the peculiarities of single features, is worth anything; but which, at the same time, is not destroyed, but assisted by the careful finishing, and still more by giving the exact outline of each part.\n\nIt is on this point that the modern French and English schools differ, and (in our opinion) are both wrong. The English seem generally to suppose, that if they only leave out the subordinate parts, they are sure of the general result. The French, on the contrary, as erroneously imagine, that, by attending successively to each separate part, they must infallibly arrive at a correct whole; not considering that, besides the parts, there is their relation to each other, and the general expression stamped upon them by the character of the individual, which to be seen must be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-FELT\">felt</a>; for it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEMONSTRABLE\">demonstrable</a>, that all character and expression, to be adequately represented, must be perceived by the mind, and not by the eye only. The French painters give only lines and precise differences; the English only general masses, and strong effects. Hence the two nations reproach one another with the difference of their styles of art,\u2014the one as dry, hard, and minute,\u2014the other as gross, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOTHIC\">gothic</a>, and unfinished; and they will probably remain for ever satisfied with each other's defects, as they afford a very tolerable fund of consolation on either side.\n\nMuch has been said of historical portrait; and we have no objection to this phrase, if properly understood. The giving historical truth to a portrait, means, then, the representing the individual under one consistent, probable, and striking view; or showing the different features, muscles, &c. in one action, and modified by one principle. A portrait thus painted may be said to be historical; that is, it carries internal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> of truth and propriety with it; and the number of individual peculiarities, as long as they are true to nature, cannot lessen, but must add to the strength of the general impression.\n\nIt might be shown (if there were room in this place) that Sir Joshua has constructed his theory of the ideal in art, upon the same mistaken principle of the negation or abstraction of particular nature. The ideal is not a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a> but a positive thing. The leaving out the details or peculiarities of an individual face, does not make it one jot more ideal. To paint history, is to paint nature as answering to a general, predominant, or preconceived idea in the mind, of strength, beauty, action, passion, thought, &c.; but the way to do this is not to leave out the details, but to incorporate the general idea with the details\u2014that is, to show the same expression actuating and modifying every movement of the muscles, and the same character preserved consistently through every part of the body. Grandeur does not consist in omitting the parts, but in connecting all the parts into a whole, and in giving their combined and varied action: abstract truth or ideal perfection does not consist in rejecting the peculiarities of form, but in rejecting all those which are not consistent with the character intended to be given; and in following up the same general idea of softness, voluptuousness, strength, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a>, or any combination of these through every ramification of the frame. But these modifications of form or expression can only be learnt from nature, and therefore the perfection of art must always be sought in nature. The ideal properly applies as much to the idea of ugliness, weakness, folly, meanness, vice, as of beauty, strength, wisdom, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNANIMITY\">magnanimity</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>. The antique heads of fauns and satyrs, of Pan or Silenus, are quite as ideal as those of the Apollo or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACCHUS\">Bacchus</a>; and Hogarth adhered to an idea of humour in his faces, as Raphael did to an idea of sentiment. But Raphael found the character of sentiment in nature as much as Hogarth did that of humour; otherwise\nneither of them would have given one or the other with such perfect truth, purity, force, and keeping. Sir Joshua Reynolds's ideal, as consisting in a mere negation of individuality, bears just the same relation to real beauty or grandeur as caricature does to true comic character.\n\nIt is owing either to a mistaken theory of elevated art, or to the want of models in nature, that the English are hitherto without any painter of serious historical subjects, who can be placed in the first rank of genius. Many of the pictures of modern artists have shown a capacity for correct and happy delineation of actual objects and domestic incidents, only inferior to the masterpieces of the Dutch School. We might here mention the names of Wilkie, Collins, Heath, and many others. We have portrait-painters, who have attained to a very high degree of excellence in all the branches of their art. In landscape, Turner has shown a knowledge of the effects of air, and of powerful relief in objects, which was never surpassed. But in the highest walk of art\u2014in giving the movements of the finer or loftier passions of the mind, this country has not produced a single painter, who has made even a faint approach to the excellence of the great Italian painters. We have, indeed, a good number of specimens of the clay-figure, the anatomical mechanism, the regular proportions measured by a two-foot rule\u2014large canvasses, covered with stiff figures, arranged in deliberate order, with the characters and story correctly expressed by uplifted eyes or hands, according to old receipt-books for the passions\u2014and with all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a> and inflexibility of figures carved in wood, and painted over in good strong body colours, that look \"as if some of nature's journeymen had made them, and not made them well.\" But we still want a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMETHEUS\">Prometheus</a> to give life to the cumbrous mass, to throw an intellectual light over the opaque image,\u2014to embody the inmost refinements of thought to the outward eye,\u2014to lay bare the very soul of passion. That picture is of little comparative value, which can be completely translated into another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>,\u2014of which the description in a common catalogue conveys all that is expressed by the picture itself; for it is the excellence of every art to give what can be given by no other, in the same degree. Much less is that picture to be esteemed, which only injures and defaces the idea already existing in the mind's eye,\u2014which does not come up to the conception which the imagination forms of the subject, and substitutes a dull reality for high sentiment; for the art is in this case an encumbrance, not an assistance, and interferes with, instead of adding to, the stock of our pleasurable sensations. But we should be at a loss to point out (we will not say any English picture, but certainly) any English painter, who, in heroic and classical composition, has risen to the height of his subject, and answered the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a> of the well-informed spectator, or excited the same impression by visible means, as had been already excited by words, or by reflection.\u2020\n\nThat this inferiority in English art is not owing to a fine arts deficiency of genius, imagination, or passion, is proved sufficiently by the works of our poets and dramatic writers, which, in loftiness and force, are not surpassed by those of any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>. But whatever may be the depth of internal thought and feeling in the English character, it seems to be more internal; and (whether this is owing to habit, or physical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>) to have, comparatively, a less immediate and powerful communication with the organic expression of passion,\u2014which exhibits the thoughts and feelings in the countenance, and furnishes matter for the historic muse of painting. The English artist is instantly sensible that the flutter, grimace, and extravagance of the French physiognomy, are incompatible with high history; and we are at no loss to explain in this way, that is, from the defect of living models, how it is that the productions of the French school are marked with all the affectation of national caricature, or sink into tame and lifeless imitations of the antique. May we not account satisfactorily for the general defects of our own historic productions, in a similar way,\u2014from a certain inertness and constitutional phlegm, which does not habitually impress the workings of the mind in correspondent traces on the countenance, and which may also render us less sensible of these outward and visible signs of passion, even when they are so impressed there? The irregularity of proportion, and want of symmetry, in the structure of the national features, though it certainly enhances the difficulty of infusing natural grace and grandeur into the works of art, rather accounts for our not having been able to attain the exquisite refinements of Grecian sculpture, than for our not having rivalled the Italian painters in expression.\n\nMr West does not form an exception to, but a confirmation of, these general observations. His pictures have all that can be required in what relates to the composition of the subject; to the regular arrangement of the groups; the anatomical proportions of the human body; and the technical knowledge of expression,\u2014as far as expression is reducible to abstract rules, and is merely a vehicle for the telling of a story; so that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a>, wonder, sorrow, pity, &c. have each their appropriate and well-known designations. These, however, are but the instrumental parts of the art, the means, not the end; but beyond these, Mr West's pictures do not go. They never \"snatch a grace beyond the reach of art.\" They exhibit the mask, not the soul of expression. We doubt, whether, in the entire <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANGE\">range</a> of Mr West's productions, meritorious and admirable as the design and composition often are, there is to be found one truly fine head. They display a total want of gusto. In Raphael, the same divine spirit breathes through every part; it either agitates the inmost frame, or plays in gentle undulations on the trembling surface. Whether we see his figures <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENDING\">bending</a> with all the blandishments of maternal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOVE\">love</a>, or standing in the motionless silence of thought, or hurried into the tumult of action, the\n\n* This subject of the Ideal will be resumed, and more particularly enlarged upon, under that head.\n\u2020 If we were to make any qualification of this censure, it would be in favour of some of Mr Northcote's compositions from early English history.\nFine Arts, whole is under the impulse of deep passion. But Mr West sees hardly anything in the human face but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a> and cartilages; or, if he avails himself of the more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEXIBLE\">flexible</a> machinery of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NERVES\">nerves</a> and muscles, it is only by rule and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a>. The effect is not that which the soul of passion impresses on the countenance; and which the soul of genius alone can <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a>; but such as might, in a good measure, be given to wooden puppets or pasteboard figures, pulled by wires, and taught to open the mouth, or knit the forehead, or raise the eyes in a very scientific manner. In fact, there is no want of art or learning in his pictures, but of nature and feeling.\n\nIt is not long ago that an opinion was very general, that all that was wanting to the highest splendour and perfection of the arts in this country might be supplied by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ACADEMIES\">Academies</a> and public institutions. We believe the most sanguine promoters of this scheme have at present relaxed in their zeal. There are three ways in which Academies and public institutions may be supposed to promote the fine arts; either by furnishing the best models to the student; or by holding out immediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol6.html#article-EMOLUMENT\">emolument</a> and patronage; or by improving the public taste. We shall bestow a short consideration on the influence of each.\n\nFirst, a constant reference to the best models of art necessarily tends to enervate the mind, to intercept our view of nature, and to distract the attention by a variety of unattainable excellence. An intimate acquaintance with the works of the celebrated masters may indeed add to the indolent refinements of taste, but will never produce one work of original genius, one great artist. In proof of the general truth of this observation, we might cite the history of the progress and decay of art in all countries where it has flourished. It is a little extraordinary, that if the real sources of perfection are to be sought in Schools, in Models, and Public Institutions, that wherever schools, models, and public institutions have existed, there the arts should regularly disappear,\u2014that the effect should never follow from the cause.\n\nThe Greek statues remain to this day unrivalled,\u2014the undisputed standard of the most perfect symmetry of form. In Italy the art of painting has had the same fate. After its long and painful struggles in the time of the earlier artists, Cimabue, Ghirlandaio, Massacio, and others, it burst out with a light almost too dazzling to behold, in the works of Titian, Michael Angelo, Raphael, and Correggio; which was reflected, with diminished lustre, in the productions of their immediate disciples; lingered for a while with the school of the Carraccis, and expired with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUIDO_RENI\">Guido Reni</a>. From that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, painting sunk to so low a state in Italy as to excite only pity or contempt. There is not a single name to redeem its faded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> from utter oblivion. Yet this has not been owing to any want of Dilettanti and Della Cruscan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a>,\u2014of academies of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLORENCE\">Florence</a>, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOLOGNA\">Bologna</a>, of Parma, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PISA\">Pisa</a>,\u2014of honorary members and Foreign Correspondents,\u2014of pupils and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEACHERS\">teachers</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PROFESSORS\">professors</a> and patrons, and the whole busy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> of critics and connoisseurs.\n\nWhat is become of the successors of Rubens, Rembrandt, and Vandyke? What have the French Academicians done for the arts; or what will they ever do, but add intolerable affectation and grimace to centos of heads from the antique, and caricature Greek forms by putting them into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPERA\">opera</a> attitudes? Nicholas Poussin is the only example on record, in favour of the contrary theory, and we have already sufficiently noticed his defects. What extraordinary advances have we made in our own country in consequence of the establishment of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> Academy? What greater names has the English school to boast than those of Hogarth, Reynolds, and Wilson, who created it? Even the venerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">President</a> of the Royal Academy was one of its founders.\n\nAgain, we might cite, in support of our assertion, the works of Carlo Maratti, of Raphael Mengs, or of any of the effeminiate school of critics and copyists, who have attempted to blend the borrowed beauties of others in a perfect whole. What do they contain, but a negation of every excellence which they pretend to combine? The assiduous imitator, in his attempts to grasp all, loses his hold of that which was placed within his reach, and, from aspiring at universal excellence, sinks into uniform mediocrity. The student who has models of every kind of excellence constantly before him, is not only diverted from that particular walk of art, in which, by patient exertion, he might have obtained ultimate success, but, from having his imagination habitually raised to an overstrained standard of refinement, by the sight of the most exquisite examples in art, he becomes impatient and dissatisfied with his own attempts, determines to reach the same perfection all at once, or throws down his pencil in despair. Thus the young enthusiast, whose genius and energy were to rival the great Masters of antiquity, or create a new era in the art itself, baffled in his first sanguine expectations, reposes in indolence on what others have done; wonders how such perfection could have been achieved,\u2014grows familiar with the minutest peculiarities of the different schools,\u2014utters between the splendour of Rubens, and the grace of Raphael, and ends in nothing. Such was not Correggio. He saw and felt for himself; he was of no school, but had his own world of art to create. That image of truth and beauty, which existed in his mind, he was forced to construct for himself, without rules or models. As it had arisen in his mind from the contemplation of nature, so he could only hope to embody it to others, by the imitation of nature. We can conceive the work growing under his hands by slow and patient touches, approaching nearer to perfection, softened into finer grace, gaining strength from delicacy, and at last reflecting the pure image of nature on the canvass. Such is always the true progress of art; such are the necessary means by which the greatest works of every kind have been produced. They have been the effect of power gathering strength from exercise, and warmth from its own impulse\u2014stimulated to fresh efforts by conscious success, and by the surprise and strangeness of a new world of beauty, opening to the delighted imagination. The triumphs of art were victories over the difficulties of art; the prodigies of genius, the result of that strength which had grappled with nature. Titian copied even a plant or a piece of common drapery from the objects\nthemselves; and Raphael is known to have made elaborate studies of the principal heads in his pictures. All the great painters of this period were thoroughly grounded in the first principles of their art; had learned to copy a face, a hand, or an eye, and had acquired patience to finish a single figure, before they undertook to paint extensive compositions. They knew that though Fame is represented with her head above the clouds, her feet rest upon the earth. Genius can only have its full scope, where, though much may have been done, more remains to do; where models exist chiefly to show the deficiencies of art, and where the perfect idea is left to be filled up in the painter's imagination. When once the stimulus of novelty and of original exertion is wanting, generations repose on what has been done for them by their predecessors, as individuals, after a certain period, rest satisfied with the knowledge they have already acquired.\n\nWith regard to the pecuniary advantages arising from the public patronage of the arts\u2014the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> unfortunately defeats itself; for it multiplies its objects faster than it can satisfy their claims; and raises up a swarm of competitors for the prize of genius from the dregs of idleness and dulness. The real <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a> is anxious to reward merit, not to encourage gratuitous pretensions to it; to see that the man of genius takes no detriment, that another Wilson is not left to perish for want\u2014not to propagate the breed of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMBRYO\">embryo</a> candidates for fame. Offers of public and promiscuous patronage can in general be little better than a species of intellectual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEDUCTION\">seduction</a>, administering provocatives to vanity and avarice, and leading astray the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YOUTH\">youth</a> of the nation by fallacious hopes, which can scarcely ever be realized. At the same time, the good that might be done by private taste and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a>, is in a great measure defeated. The moment that a few individuals of discernment and liberal spirit become members of a public body, they are no longer any thing more than parts of a machine, which is usually wielded at will by some officious, overweening pretender; their good-sense and good-nature are lost in a mass of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> and presumption; their names only serve to reflect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> on proceedings in which they have no share, and which are determined on by a majority of persons who have no interest in the arts but what arises from the importance attached to them by regular organization, and no opinions but what are dictated to them by some self-constituted judge. As far as we have had an opportunity of observing the conduct of such bodies of men, instead of taking the lead of public opinion, of giving a firm, manly, and independent tone to that opinion, they make it their business to watch all its caprices, and follow it in every casual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a>. They dare not give their sanction to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">sterling</a> merit, struggling with difficulties, but take advantage of its success, to reflect credit on their own reputation for sagacity. Their taste is a servile dependant on their vanity, and their patronage has an air of pauperism about it. Perhaps the only public patronage which was ever really useful to the arts, or worthy of them, was that which they received first in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>, and afterwards in Italy, from the religious institutions of the country; when the artist felt himself, as it were, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a> at the altar; when his hand gave a visible form to Gods or Heroes, Angels or Apostles; and when the enthusiasm of genius was exalted by mingling with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> of national <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a>. The artist was not here degraded, by being made the dependant on the caprice of wealth or fashion, but felt himself at once the servant and the benefactor of the public. He had to embody, by the highest efforts of his art, subjects which were sacred to the imagination and feelings of the spectators; there was a common link, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> sympathy between them in their common faith! Every other mode of patronage, but that which arises, either from the general institutions and manners of a people, or from the real unaffected taste of individuals, must, we conceive, be illegitimate, corrupted in its source, and either ineffectual or injurious to its professed object.\n\nLastly, Academies and Institutions may be supposed to assist the progress of the fine arts, by promoting a wider taste for them.\n\nIn general, it must happen in the first stages of the arts, that as none but those who had a natural genius for them, would attempt to practise them,\u2014so none but those who had a natural taste for them, would pretend to judge of or criticise them. This must be an incalculable advantage to the man of true genius; for it is no other than the privilege of being tried by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PEERS\">peers</a>. In an age when connoisseurship had not become a fashion; when religion, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTRIGUE\">intrigue</a>, occupied the time and thoughts of the great, only those minds of superior refinement would be led to notice the works of art, who had a real sense of their excellence; and, in giving way to the powerful bent of his own genius, the painter was most likely to consult the taste of his judges. He had not to deal with pretenders to taste, through vanity, affectation, and idleness. He had to appeal to the higher faculties of the soul,\u2014to that deep and innate sensibility to truth and beauty, which required only fit objects to have its enthusiasm excited,\u2014and to that independent strength of mind, which, in the midst of ignorance and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARBARISM\">barbarism</a>, hailed and fostered genius, wherever it met with it. Titian was patronised by Charles V. Count Castiglione was the friend of Raphael. These were true patrons and true critics; and, as there were no others (for the world, in general, merely looked on and wondered), there can be little doubt that such a period of dearth of factitious patronage would be most favourable to the full development of the greatest talents, and to the attainment of the highest excellence.\n\nBy means of public institutions, the number of candidates for fame, and pretenders to criticism, is increased beyond all calculation, while the quantity of genius and feeling remain much the same as before; with these disadvantages, that the man of original genius is often lost among the crowd of competitors who would never have become such, but from encouragement and example, and that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> of the few whom nature intended for judges, is apt to be drowned in the noisy and forward suffrages of shallow smatterers in Taste.\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">ASIA</a>. Under this head in the *Encyclopedia*, there is a general survey of Asia and its Divisions, and of the prevailing manners, religions, and institutions of its chief Communities. We have, in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a>, already treated in a general way of those grand Divisions of our Globe, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>; and notwithstanding the extent of the space devoted to Asia in the body of the work, the recent acquisitions to our knowledge of that Continent might also, without impropriety, have been made the subject of a supplemental article in this place; but as these additions are more susceptible, than in the case either of Africa or America, of being separately introduced under the names of particular Countries and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">Islands</a>, we shall, in order to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> room for other matters, adopt that course in regard to the recent improvements in Asiatic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">geography</a>.\n\nIt is proper to mention, that the best of the later Geographers have separated a vast number of Islands formerly described as Asiatic Islands, from that Continent, and arranged them with a multitude of other Countries and Islands to the south of Asia, and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PACIFIC_OCEAN\">Pacific <a cl</a>ass=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCEAN\">Ocean</a>, under the two new divisions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUSTRALASIA\">Australasia</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-POLYNESIA\">Polynesia</a>. The grounds of this arrangement, which was first suggested by the learned President des Brosses, are stated with sufficient clearness by Mr Pinkerton, in his introductory observations on the Asiatic Islands; and the reader of this work will also find them explained under our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> on Australasia and Polynesia.\n\nWe may here observe generally, that a great deal yet remains to be done in order to complete the geography of Asia. Its central mountains, perhaps the most stupendous masses on the Globe, present a wholly unexplored <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a> of inquiry; the origin, the course, and progressive increase of some of its greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>, remain still to be ascertained; and scarce any of its internal seas, except the Caspian, has been the subject of actual survey. The interior regions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIBERIA\">Siberia</a> require much illustration. The same may be said, and perhaps in a still stronger degree, of the central parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TARTARY\">Tartary</a>, of the northern parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHINA\">China</a>, and of those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>. As to the probable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> of this Continent, it is enough to say, that differences of a hundred millions exist in regard to that of China alone. From all this it appears how very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFECTIVE\">defective</a> our knowledge is of this important <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">Division</a> of the Globe, and what a vast and varied field it still presents to incite the inquiries, and reward the enterprise of future Explorers.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASPHALTITES\">Asphaltites</a>, a Lake of Judea, near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a>, so called from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BITUMEN\">Bitumen</a> which floats upon its surface; and equally well known under the name of the Dead <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">Sea</a>\u2014a name associated with many fables, and derived from a long standing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a>, that no creature could live in its waters, or within the reach of its pestiferous exhalations.\n\nThe reader will find the substance of the ancient accounts, and those of the earlier Travellers in regard to this famous Lake, in the article under its name in the *Encyclopedia*; we shall therefore confine ourselves in this place, to such authentic particulars, as have been furnished by the observations and inquiries of those who have recently visited the Holy Asphaltites <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">Land</a>.\n\nThis Lake is supposed to be from sixty to seventy miles in length, and from ten to twenty in breadth. It is curved like a bow, and placed between two ranges of mountains, of lofty and majestic appearance. But the grandeur of its features is blended with an air of sadness and desolation, which seems to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCORD\">accord</a> well with the marvellous stories associated with its name.\n\nSome of these fables have an obvious foundation in its physical properties. Its taste is remarkably bitter, saline, and pungent; and hence has arisen the notion of its pestiferous vapours and deadly influence. We are told even by Volney, that its waters are destructive both of animal and vegetable life; but he denies that its vapours have any deadly quality, for swallows, he says, are often seen to skim its surface without injury. M. De Chateaubriand, who visited its shores in 1807, with an imagination abundantly disposed to the marvellous, has given the first decided testimony that it abounds with fish. He reached the Lake when it was already dark, and passed the night among some Arab tents. \"About midnight,\" says he, \"I heard a noise upon the Lake, and was told by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BETHLEHEMITES\">Bethlehemites</a> who accompanied me, that it proceeded from legions of small fish which come out and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LEAP\">leap</a> about on the shore.\" This interesting Traveller speaks in the following terms of its saline properties: \"The first thing I did on alighting was to walk into the Lake up to my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-KNEES\">knees</a>, and to taste the water. I found it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to keep it in my mouth. It far exceeds that of the sea in saltiness, and produces upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIPS\">lips</a> the effect of a strong solution of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALUM\">alum</a>. Before my boots were completely dry, they were covered with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>: our clothes, our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-HATS\">hats</a>, our hands, were in less than three hours impregnated with this mineral.\"\n\nThe common story, that nothing will sink in it, is to be ascribed to the extraordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol7.html#article-DENSITY\">density</a> of its waters. Bodies follow the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, and sink or swim, according to the proportion of their gravity to the gravity of the water of the Lake; but its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-SPECIFIC_GRAVITY\"><a class=\"xref\" </a>href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIFIC\">specific</a> gravity is such, that a man may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> upon its surface motionless, without danger of sinking. This effect was experienced by Pococke, and by a Scottish traveller, Mr Gordon of Clunie, who also bathed in it. This gentleman brought home a phial of its water, and Dr Marcet found its specific gravity to be 1.211; a degree of density, says he, \"not to be met with in any other natural water.\" Dr Marcet was employed to analyse Mr Gordon's specimen, which that gentleman had presented to Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a> Banks in 1807; and the whole process, with its results, is detailed in the Philosophical Transactions for that year. It was found that 100 grains of the water contains the following substances, in the under-mentioned proportions:\n\n| Substance          | Grains |\n|--------------------|--------|\n| Muriat of lime     | 3,920  |\n| Muriat of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNESIA\">magnesia</a> | 10,246 |\n| Muriat of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SODA\">soda</a>     | 10,360 |\n| Sulphat of lime    | 0,054  |\n\nTotal: 24,580\nThe water of the Dead Sea had been previously analysed by Messrs Macquer, Lavoisier, and Sage, of whose experiments an account was published in the M\u00e9moires de l'Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences for the year 1778. Their analysis afforded results greatly different from those obtained by Dr Marcat, which that gentleman ascribes to some inaccuracy in their mode of operating. We find, however, that the processes employed by Dr Marcat have been called in question, and the accuracy of his proportions denied by a very skilful Chemist, who subsequently instituted an analysis of the Dead Sea water. We allude to Klaproth, who procured a specimen brought from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EAST\">East</a> by the Abb\u00e9 Mariot, and whose analysis offered the following proportions:\n\n| Substance          | Proportion |\n|--------------------|------------|\n| Muriat of magnesia | 24.20      |\n| Muriat of lime     | 10.60      |\n| Muriat of soda     | 7.80       |\n| Water              | 57.40      |\n\nKlaproth also found the specific gravity to be 1.245 instead of 1.211; agreeing in this respect more nearly with Macquer and Lavoisier, who stated it at 1.240. The specific gravity of Dr Marcat's specimen may, however, have been less, from its having been taken from the Lake, not far from the influx of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JORDAN\">Jordan</a>, on which account it might be somewhat diluted.\n\nDr Clarke mentions, that the inhabitants of the country still regard the Dead Sea with feelings of terror. This may be owing to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a> that its waters cover the engulfed cities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SODOM\">Sodom</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOMORRAH\">Gomorrah</a>, or to the ideas entertained of the peculiar insalubrity of its exhalations. It is much to be regretted, that this Traveller was prevented by the Arabs, who infested the neighbourhood, from exploring the Lake, which he only saw at some distance; as with his attainments, he could not have failed to gather some interesting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> regarding its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\">natural history</a>. Though M. de Chateaubriand, a few years after, succeeded in reaching its banks, he could only, owing to the same cause, remain a few hours; and besides, however capable of interesting his readers, he was not so well qualified for accurate or scientific observation. While some of his facts run <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTER\">counter</a> to the ancient fables, others seem calculated to add to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIST\">list</a>; as, when he discovers a resemblance between the noise of its waves, and the stifled clamours of the people whom they engulfed! The following passage, however, is of the antifabulous kind, and contains some information which cannot but be acceptable to our readers. \"There is scarcely any one who has not heard of the famous tree of Sodom; a tree, said to produce an apple pleasing to the eye, but bitter to the taste, and full of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASHES\">ashes</a>. Tacitus, in the fifth book of his History, and Josephus, in his Jewish war, are, I believe, the two first authors that made mention of the singular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> of the Dead Sea. Foulcher de Chartres, who travelled in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PALESTINE\">Palestine</a> about the year 1100, saw the deceitful apple, and compared it to the pleasures of the world. Since that period, some writers, as Ceverius de Vera, Baumgarten, de la Vall\u00e9e, Troilo, and certain Missionaries, confirm Foulcher's statement; others, as Reland, Father Neret, and Maundrell, are inclined to believe that this fruit is but a poetical image of our false joys; while others again, as Pococke and Shaw, absolutely question its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a>.\n\n\"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMMAN\">Amman</a> seemed to remove the difficulty. He gave a description of the tree, which, according to him, resembles the hawthorn. 'The fruit,' says he, 'is a small apple, of a beautiful colour.'\n\n\"Hasselquist, the Botanist, followed, and he tells a totally different story. The apple of Sodom, as we are informed by him, is not the fruit either of a tree or of a shrub, but the production of the Solanum melongena of Linnaeus. 'It is found in great abundance,' says he, 'round <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERICHO\">Jericho</a>, in the valleys near the Jordan, and in the neighbourhood of the Dead Sea. It is true that these apples are sometimes full of dust; but this appears only when the fruit is attacked by an insect (teuthredo), which converts the whole of the inside into dust, leaving nothing but the rind entire, without causing it to lose any of its colour.'\n\n\"Who would not imagine, after this, that the question had been set completely at rest, by the authority of Hasselquist, and the still greater authority of Linnaeus, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLORA\">Flora</a> Palestina? No such thing. M. Scetzen, also a man of science, and the most modern of all Travellers, since he is still in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARABIA\">Arabia</a>, does not agree with Hasselquist in regard to the Solanum Sodomaeum. 'I saw,' says he, 'during my stay at Karrak, in the house of the Greek clergyman of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWN\">town</a>, a species of cotton resembling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a>. This cotton, as he told me, grows in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> of El Gor, near the southern extremity of the Dead Sea, on a tree like a fig-tree, called Abescha-ex; it is found in a fruit resembling the pomegranate. It struck me, that this fruit, which has no pulp or flesh in the inside, and is unknown in the rest of Palestine, might be the celebrated apple of Sodom.'\n\n\"Here I am thrown into an awkward <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DILEMMA\">dilemma</a>; for I too have the vanity to imagine that I have discovered the long-sought fruit. The shrub which bears it grows two or three leagues from the mouth of the Jordan: it is thorny, and has small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TAPER\">taper</a> leaves. It bears a considerable resemblance to the shrub described by Amman; and its fruit is exactly like the little Egyptian lemon, both in size and colour. Before it is ripe, it is filled with a corrosive and saline juice; when dried it yields a blackish seed, which may be compared to ashes, and which in taste resembles bitter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEPPER\">pepper</a>.\" See Chateaubriand's Travels in Greece, Palestine, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>, and Barbary.\u2014Dr Clarke's Travels in Greece, Egypt, and the Holy Land.\u2014Philosophical Transactions of the Royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> for 1807.\u2014Klaproth, Beitr\u00e4ge zur Chemischen Kenntniss der Mineral K\u00f6rper, B. 5. p. 185. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BERLIN\">Berlin</a>, 1810.","sp":833,"ep":852},{"h":"ASSAM","t":"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>, situated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>-west of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENGAL\">Bengal</a>, between the 25th and 26th degrees\nAssam of north <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LATITUDE\">latitude</a>, and extending from 94 to 99 degrees of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EAST\">east</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a>.

Assam is an immense valley, about 700 miles in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>, by between 60 and 80 in breadth, surrounded by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> hills on all sides, and interspersed with numerous eminences in the interior, universally susceptible of cultivation.

It is bounded on the north by the successive ranges of the mountains of Bootan, Anka, Duffala, and Miree; and, on the south, by the Garrow Mountains, which rise higher as they recede northward, and change their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> to Naga at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> called Collabark. Probably the rivers intersecting Assam are more numerous than those of any other country of equal extent in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSE\">universe</a>, from its being completely environed by hills. The rains are collected together, and, pouring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> in irresistible torrents, swell the waters below, until the plains are covered by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INUNDATION\">inundation</a>. The valley is divided throughout, by the Burhampooter, into two parts nearly equal; and many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">Islands</a>, some of them very large, are formed by it, and by the confluence and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERSECTION\">intersection</a> of other rivers. They contribute alike to fertilize the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>, and to facilitate the intercourse of the inhabitants, as they are navigable by flat-bottomed boats, capable of transporting them and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>. Of these rivers, not less than sixty-one are known and distinguished by particular names, of which thirty-four flow from the northern, and twenty-four from the southern mountains; but the source of the Burhampooter is scarcely yet ascertained, nor were Europeans acquainted with its course until traced by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJOR\">Major</a> Rennell. However, it seems to rise beyond the confines of Assam.\n\nAs the rivers change their names at different places, it is sometimes difficult to discover those that are meant in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>; and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> may be estimated differently, according as they are examined in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of inundation, or otherwise. The length of the course, and the sinuosities of many, are remarkable. The Dhekow or Degoo, by the size of which Geographers are accustomed to compare the other rivers, rises very far to the eastward of the Naga mountains, which it traverses for a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a>, and then winds 200 miles through the valley from its entrance, until joining the Dehingli, a great branch of the Burhampooter. Another river, the Dekrungh, rises in the Duffala mountains; and, exhibiting a large stream, occupies 100 miles in its windings, before falling into the Burhampooter, though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> line does not exceed 25. Notwithstanding its depth and rapidity, it is navigable by small boats. The river Pisola, which likewise rises in the Duffala mountains, pursues a winding course of 60 miles, and, during the rainy season, may be ascended to the base of the mountains; but it is not navigable after the inundations subside. The rivers to the south are never so rapid, as the inundations commence from the northern rivers. Both these and the Burhampooter are filled, so that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> considerable current until May or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a>, when the current is rather stronger from the south in the season of the rains, though the increase is not very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-MATERIAL\">material</a>, as the large river at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> is always pretty full, and checks the rapidity of all the southern rivers.\n\nAmong the numerous Islands of different dimensions, formed by the intersection and confluence of the rivers, is Majuli, or the Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">Island</a>, as it is called by pre-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMINENCE\">eminence</a>, which appears to constitute one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> divisions of the kingdom. This Island extends 100 miles in length, by about 60 in breadth; and is formed by the river Dehingh on the west, and the Looicheh on the north; but independent of these great aquatic boundaries, it is intersected by numerous streams, so that it, in fact, consists of a cluster of lesser Islands, and some Islets, besides, near the banks, which in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> rivers are dry only while no inundations prevail. The other Islands throughout Assam are of all different dimensions, from the most inconsiderable size to six, ten, or twenty miles and more in length. A correct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> of the country may thus be figured as being an extensive valley, environed by mountains, full of rivers and level plains. While the rivers constitute its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>, and promote the convenience of its inhabitants, as also contribute to fertilize the soil overflowed by their inundations, they interrupt occasional intercourse from their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a> and rapidity; and it is to be observed, that there is only one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a> in the kingdom, which was erected at Rungepon by workmen brought from Bengal. Besides the Great Island or Majuli, Assam contains other two political divisions. Ootrecole, Uttarcul, or Otreparah; Deccancole, Dacshincul, or Deccaparrah; the former of which, Ootrecole, denotes the country lying north of the Burhampooter; the latter, Deccancole, that to the south. And it is further to be remarked, that Majuli is formed by great arms of the same river, though passing by different names.\n\nThe political subdivisions of Assam are apparently almost as numerous as the more important <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> ones; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of Camroop in Ootrecole, is one of the largest and the best known by description, at least, to Europeans. It formerly gave name to an extensive kingdom, of which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> seems to have been Rangmattee, beyond the present western confines of Assam. It now stretches about 100 miles in length, and its breadth, from the banks of the Burhampooter to the foot of the mountains, is 40 miles. There are no strong places within its limits, and its chief <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWN\">town</a> is Cotta. The district Summooria, occupies the southern banks of the Burhampooter; and the district of Nodooaria, which extends to the eastward, is divided into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> shares or districts, held by so many rajahs, though under the rule of only two.\nValuable minerals are found in Assam; the whole country produces <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> in abundance, insomuch that from 12,000 to 20,000 of the inhabitants are said to have been constantly employed in collecting it. This precious metal is found in all the rivers flowing from the northern mountains, but it is of different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> in purity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, and also in malleability. That which is obtained in the Dekrung is particularly celebrated; and it is distinguished by a higher colour than what is found in the Burhampooter and other rivers. Gold is more abundant in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a> of the Burrowgown than in the channel of most rivers, but is thought of inferior colour and quality. What is procured from the bed of the Burrogown is esteemed as much superior even to the gold of the Dekrung; the colour is deeper and more vivid, and is compared by the natives to fire; it is likewise deemed of more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTRINSIC\">intrinsic</a> value, and always bears a greater price in Assam. The greatest quantities of gold are found nearest the mountains, which probably indicates that it is carried down from them by the torrents, but it is never sought in the beds of the southern rivers. In the others, as those flowing from the north, it is of paler colour, less pure, and in smaller <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a>, according as it is recovered from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> farther to the east. The persons employed in collecting it, pay a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBUTE\">tribute</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOVEREIGN\">Sovereign</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to their success. Besides this precious metal, there are mines of silver, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, which all belong to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">King</a>, and are wrought for his advantage alone. Rock-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> is dug out of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, but it is bitter, and of indifferent quality. The vegetable products of Assam are abundant, and of excellent quality; thick and extensive forests cover a large portion of the country; cultivated fields, especially of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICE\">rice</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAPLE\">staple</a> grain for subsistence, and the finest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>, are generally to be seen. A Persian writer, Mahammed Cazim, in describing this country, makes some observations on its general appearance, which, as he was hostile to the inhabitants, may probably merit the greater confidence. He speaks of Mojuli as \"an Island well inhabited, and in an excellent state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>; it contains a spacious, clear, and pleasant country, extending to the distance of about 100 miles. The cultivated part is bounded by a thick forest, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HARBOURS\">harbours</a> elephants, and where these animals may be caught; as well as in four or five other forests of Assam. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> there be occasion for them, five or six hundred elephants may be procured in a year. Across the Dhonee, which is the side of Ghergong, is a wide agreeable level country, that delights the heart of the beholder. The whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of it is marked with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> and tillage, and it presents, on every side, charming prospects of ploughed fields, harvests, gardens, and groves. From the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VILLAGE\">village</a> of Salagerah to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Ghergong, a space of about 100 miles, is filled with such an uninterrupted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANGE\">range</a> of gardens, plentifully stocked with fruit-trees, that it appears as one garden. Within them are the houses of peasants, and a beautiful assemblage of coloured and fragrant herbs, and of garden and wild <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a> blowing together. As the country is overflowed in the rainy season, a high and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> causeway has been raised for the convenience of travellers, from Salagerah to Ghergong, which is the only uncultivated ground that is to be seen. Each side of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> is planted with shady bamboos, the tops of which meet and are entwined. Among the fruits which this country produces, are mangoes, plantains, jacks, oranges, citrons, limes, and puniales, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of amileh, which has such an excellent flavour, that every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> who tastes it, prefers it to the plum. There are also cocoa-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NUT\">nut</a> trees, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEPPER\">pepper</a>, vines, areca trees, and the sadij (an aromatic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a>), in great plenty. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">Sugar</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANE\">cane</a> excels in softness and sweetness, and is of three colours, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>; there is ginger free from fibres and betal vines. The strength of vegetation and fertility of the soil is such, that wherever seed is sown, or slips planted, they always thrive. The environs of Ghergong furnish small apricots, yams, and pomegranates, but as these are wild, and not assisted by cultivation and engraffing, they are very indifferent. The principal crop of this country consists in rice and mash. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADES\">Ades</a> (a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-PEA\">pea</a>) is very scarce, and wheat and barley are never sown.\" This is a favourable picture of the Kingdom, and although the revolutions and convulsions which it has since undergone, may have affected the industry of the inhabitants, the means of renewing it remain.\n\nElephants, wild buffaloes, hogs, and tigers, haunt the banks of the rivers, which are covered with grass and reeds so as to be impenetrable by men. It has been affirmed that there are neither horses, asses, nor camels here, though two species of the first are natives of a neighbouring territory. The other animals are unknown, but the rivers abound so plentifully with fish as to afford a copious supply to the inhabitants. A particular kind of animal, different from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a>-worm, according to Turpin, produces silk of another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEXTURE\">texture</a>, with which beautiful dresses, but of bad quality, are fabricated.\n\nIt is not unlikely that some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> physical distinctions prevail among the natives, according as they inhabit the high or the low countries, and that their moral qualities are influenced by the same cause. Mahammed Cazim remarks, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a> of the mountaineers, like that of the inhabitants of all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> climates, is red and white. They are an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a>, hardy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>, well formed, but the noses of the women are flattish. Both sexes go almost naked; formerly the mountaineers were absolutely so; and, unlike the easterns in general, none of the females, even those of the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>, are veiled. They wear a blue <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BONNET\">bonnet</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>, from which hogs' <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a> are suspended, which is perhaps of more recent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>, as the Persian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> referred to says they had neither turbans, robes, drawers, nor shoes. Their most valuable ornaments, at present, are bracelets of coral or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMBER\">amber</a>, and sometimes tortoise shell or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> shells. They dwell in habitations constructed of wood, bamboos, and straw, and there is only an inconsiderable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between those of the more wealthy and the poorer classes. With regard to their state of civilization, or their manners and customs, we have very little certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> applicable to the present times. Most probably the mountaineers are more barbarous than the inhabitants of the low country and the plains; and as the kingdom is di\nvided into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of petty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">States</a>, those may be subordinate to some paramount authority; but the frequent broils of the Rajahs retard the civilization of their subjects. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAHOMMED\">Mahommed</a> Cazim, who entertained a decided <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERSION\">aversion</a> to the Assamese, reproaches them with indiscriminately feeding \"on all kinds of food, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> excepted; they even eat animals that have died a natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>.\" He divides them into two tribes, Assamians and Culitanians; the latter excelling the former in every thing but warlike operations.\n\nIt appears that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of this Kingdom is monarchical, and that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SULTAN\">Sultan</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RAJAH\">Rajah</a> rules the whole; yet, owing to the incessant contest for power, the course of succession, if it be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a>, is disturbed, and the most potent Chief, gaining an ascendency, restores the country to peace. The government was wont to be mildly administered: in the words of Turpin, the \"king was attentive to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> of his subjects, and employed none excepting slaves to labour in the mines. It was the only country where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a> was not crushed under the pressure of despotism.\" Formerly the Rajah kept a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> of six or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> thousand warlike troops, whose courage was equal to any enterprise.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> of these people is supposed by Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAMILTON\">Hamilton</a> to be Brahminical. It is certain that they have many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a> erected to their Divinities throughout their territories, although the character and description of these Divinities have never been explained. In the time of Aurengzebe, they are said to have had no settled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>; \"they do not adopt any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol0.html#article-WORSHIP\">worship</a>, practised either by Heathens or Mahometans. Nor do they concur with any of the known sects which prevail amongst mankind.\" But it is by no means credible, that all their temples have been erected since that era. Rafts, covered with human heads, are sometimes seen floating down the Burhampooter through Bengal, which has excited conjectures that they belonged to victims offered to their sanguinary Deities. It is not evident, however, that human sacrifices, unless the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> at funeral obsequies be called such, are publicly offered up in the neighbouring Asiatic territories. This species of barbarity has been widely extended over the world; captives were slaughtered at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PILE\">pile</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>; slaves were buried alive to serve their masters in the world to come; and even the chosen wife of her husband's affections has been doomed to destruction at the same moment that his earthly remains were consigned to oblivion. Such customs have been familiar to mankind from the earliest records of time; and, among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a>, were practised by the natives of Assam. On the decease of a Rajah, or any distinguished person, a capacious pit was prepared, where not only his own body, but many of his women and attendants, were also buried. Of the latter was a torch-bearer, together with a quantity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> and lamps, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> to his comfort in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> state; some of his most elegant and useful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FURNITURE\">furniture</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CARPETS\">carpets</a> and clothes, were, in like manner, included; and even elephants, together with gold and silver, formed part of the promiscuous assemblage. A strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a>, resting on thick timbers, was then constructed over the pit, and the miserable victims, not already slain, were left to perish by a lingering death.\n\nIn regard to the present state of the arts, it is to be inferred, that the Assamese are behind many nations in their vicinity: formerly they manufactured excellent silks, chiefly for home consumption; likewise they fabricated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELVET\">velvet</a>, and embroidered it beautifully with flowers. Perhaps the same is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>, as also the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTRACTION\">extraction</a> of salt from vegetable substances; and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a> was reputed of the best quality. Nay, the Easterns hence ascribed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of this destructive substance to their ingenuity, and affirm that it passed from them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEGU\">Pegu</a>, and thence to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHINA\">China</a>. Their chief exports to Bengal are gold, elephants' teeth, two kinds of lac, which was esteemed the finest in those regions,\u2014coarse raw silk, and coarse cotton cloths. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRANDY\">Brandy</a> is made from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAPES\">grapes</a>, afforded by the numerous vines in Assam. Agriculture is certainly well understood; the populousness of several districts, which have attracted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of the Traveller, proves that there is no scarcity of subsistence; and well frequented <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-FAIRS\">fairs</a> are spoken of as being held in different places. Assam contains some celebrated Temples, probably of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a>; and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> causeways, constructed at an early period of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, are of admirable extent and magnitude. One of these, now in a state of decay, runs from Cooch <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAHAR\">Bahar</a> in Bengal, through Rangamatty, to the utmost extremity of the eastern limits of the kingdom, serving as a boundary of the Bootan dominions. Another, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of immense labour, passes the capital; and the banks of the Dheckow is connected with the southern mountains by a lofty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAMPART\">rampart</a>, traversing the space of ten or fifteen miles. It is undoubted, that although most authors who have treated of this subject, describe these structures as military causeways only, they have served both as the means of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> among the inhabitants during the season of inundations, and as barriers to the overflowing rivers spreading still farther on the plains. Thus the great causeway, which approaches the capital, was raised, to preserve the interior from the inundations of the Dehingh, while in the dry season, the river retires two miles from its base.\n\nA great many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> and villages are scattered over the banks of the rivers of Assam, these having been peculiarly selected by the natives for their habitations; and a certain number seems to be included in a circle, under the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMINISTRATION\">administration</a>. The capital, which is called Ghergong, Kirgana, or perhaps more properly Gurgown, is situated in $25^\\circ 35'$ north latitude, $93^\\circ 10'$ east longitude, at a considerable distance above Rungpoor, which is sometimes called the capital, but is only the military station of Ghergong. It stands on the high banks of the river Dheckow, or Degoo, and until recent disasters had overwhelmed it, was a place of great extent. This city, Dr Wade, who resided ten years in Assam, describes to have been ten miles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> by five in breadth; and we learn from other authors, that it was fortified and encircled by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FENCE\">fence</a> of bamboos, enclosing villages and fields in its circuit. Like other cities of the East, each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> stood separate, amidst a cultivated spot or\ngarden; each side of the river was lined with dwellings, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> was situated on its banks. It had four gates, constructed of earth and stone, from each of which the palace was distant four miles and a half, by which means its position was nearly in the centre, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> to the Dhekow. This palace was a spacious edifice, apparently between two and three miles in circuit, surrounded by a causeway, planted on each side by a close bamboo hedge, serving instead of a wall, and beyond them a wet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DITCH\">ditch</a>, always full of water. The interior contained many apartments, both for state and convenience, elegantly ornamented. Mahammed affirms it as an undoubted fact, that 3000 carpenters and 12,000 labourers were constantly occupied, during two years, in constructing the palace; but an insurrection, which took place about the year 1790, has proved almost totally destructive of it and the rest of the city. Rungpoor, situated in 25\u00b0 47' north latitude, and 89\u00b0 5' east longitude, stands on the opposite side of the Dhekow, with the river Numdaugh flowing on the south; a rampart, or causeway, to resist the inundations, protects it on the east; and on the west it is secured by a bridge, the only access whereby it can be approached. The circle including it contains several towns, and is about twelve miles in length, by ten in breadth. Goahantee is the capital of Lower Assam, and the residence of a Viceroy; the surrounding territory occupies a hilly country, on both sides of the Burhampooter, the hills on each side forming a spacious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMPHITHEATRE\">amphitheatre</a>, which has been fortified equally by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> and art. The district Goahantee is divided into north and south, including several strong passes among the fortified hills. A great number of other towns might be mentioned by name; but, excepting their position, we are unacquainted with anything regarding them. Many were greatly injured, and some totally ruined, by the distractions of the country; the cessation of which, for a few years, is now allowing them to recover from their disasters.\n\nThe history of this kingdom is involved in great obscurity, arising both from its remote situation, and from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JEALOUSY\">jealousy</a> of strangers, which has almost entirely precluded the access of Europeans; and by a singular fatality, after this difficulty had been conquered, by the admission and residence of an intelligent physician, Dr Wade, some of the most important materials collected by him were lost on being transmitted to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. The present race of inhabitants is said to have occupied the country during a thousand years, but not by any means in tranquillity; at least, we know that, since 1638, they have been involved in frequent contests with their neighbours. In these, however, they have, in general, been successful, for unconquerable obstacles are opposed to their enemies. \"Whenever an invading <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> has entered their territories, the Assamese have sheltered themselves in strong posts, and have distressed the enemy by stratagems, surprises, and alarms, and by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> off their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>. If these means failed, they have declined a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a>, but have carried the peasants into the mountains, burnt the grain, and left the country deserted. But when the rainy season has set in upon the advancing enemy, they have watched their opportunity to make excursions, and vent their rage; the famished invaders have either become their prisoners, or been put to death. In this manner, powerful and numerous armies have been sunk in that whirlpool of destruction, and not a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> has escaped.\" Such dangers were sufficient to intimidate the boldest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ADVENTURERS\">adventurers</a>, and we have the testimony of eye-witnesses that they are not exaggerated. About the close of the fifteenth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, Husein Shah, King of Bengal, invaded Assam, with a formidable force of cavalry, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANTRY\">infantry</a>, and also of boats; and, in the outset, was successful. The Rajah, unable to meet him in the plains, retired to the mountains, whither Husein could not follow him; but returning to Bengal, he left his son with a large army to keep possession of the country; the rainy season commenced, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a> were shut up by inundations; then the Rajah descended from the mountains, intercepted the supplies of the invaders, harassed them with skirmishes, and cut off the whole in detail. Another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">Prince</a> of Hindostan attempted the conquest of Assam, with an immense force of cavalry, but, says the author, who records the enterprise, they were all devoted to oblivion in that country of enchantment; and no intelligence or vestige of them remained. The Assamese, however, met with a reverse of fortune in leaving their own confines to sail down the Burhampooter, and assail the inhabitants of Bengal; for in the year 1638, they were repulsed by the troops of Shah Jehan.\n\nThe Rajah of Assam had assumed or preserved the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of Sarjee or Swerg, which signifies celestial, and lived in great pomp and splendour in the reign of Aurengzebe, the Mogul <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">Emperor</a>, who died in 1707. That great Prince, desirous of extending his conquests, sent an army, under an able general, to attempt the subjugation of this Kingdom; partly, it would appear, to humble the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a> of the Rajah, who was so vain-glorious as to believe that his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a> were of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVINE\">divine</a> origin, and that one of them, inclining to visit the earth, descended by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LADDER\">ladder</a>; partly to disseminate the principles of the Mahometan faith. The army advanced victoriously, conquering all opposition, and gained possession of the capital. There the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERIAL\">imperial</a> general, considering himself firmly established, made many regulations for internal administration, and also proclaimed the Mahometan religion. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">Measures</a> were taken for keeping the roads open, and for supplying the army with provisions; and as the season was now changing, he resolved, when the inundations subsided, to put his troops in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> to extirpate the Rajah, and those adherents who had escaped. The conquest of Assam extended to a large portion of the country, for all the villages of Decancole submitted to the invaders; and those of Ootrecle followed: Yet it is not to be inferred that this was accomplished without loss, for the panegyrist of the general describes the country as spacious, populous, and hard to be penetrated; that it abounded in dangers; that the paths and roads were beset with difficulties; and that the obstacles to conquest were more than could be expressed. The inhabitants, he says, were enterprising, well armed, and always prepared for\nAssam battle: they had lofty forts; numerously garri-\nsioned, and plentifully provided with warlike\nstores; and the approach to them was opposed\nby thick and dangerous jungles, and broad and boisterous rivers. Under these circumstances, it was to be considered wonderful that the army had prevailed; \"but the Musselman hordes experienced the comfort of fighting for their religion, and the blessings of it reverted to the sovereignty of his just and pious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJESTY\">Majesty</a>.\" But the Assamese were unsubdued: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> proved destructive to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOGULS\">Moguls</a>, and the general was obliged, first to evacuate the city, and as his troops were harassed by the natives, they were at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> compelled to retreat from the country with diminished numbers.\n\nTowards the earlier part of the eighteenth century, it is said that some of the Brahmins of Bengal reached Assam, desirous of introducing their religion there, where the inhabitants still had no settled faith. Amidst their exertions for this great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>, they persuaded them that it would be gratifying to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEITY\">Deity</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRAMA\">Brama</a>, if they would use salt imported from Bengal in preference to their own, which it greatly excelled. To this the Sovereign consented, on condition that it should be monopolized by himself, and that the vessels conveying it should not penetrate beyond the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONTIER\">frontier</a>; and, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, forty vessels, each of from 500 to 600 tons burden, have annually been sent thither.\n\nAbout the year 1790, the Kingdom was in the most distracted state from a widely extended insurrection, followed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> destruction of many important places; and, in the year 1793, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DETACHMENT\">detachment</a> of British troops was sent to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-AID\">aid</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESTORATION\">restoration</a> of the Rajah, who seems to have been dethroned by the insurgents. This detachment gained the capital, and completely effected their object, and the Rajah was so sensible of the assistance he had derived, that he immediately concluded a commercial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a> very favourable to the British interests. It was probably on this occasion that Dr Wade visited Assam, and that Mr Wood, of the Engineers, constructed a map of a considerable portion of the country. Either this, or another, was transmitted to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, we have understood, to be deposited in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ADVOCATES\">Advocates</a>' Library at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>; but, after its arrival, it unfortunately never reached the place of its destination, which is much to be regretted, since the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">geography</a> and history of the country are both so little known. The troops having remained some time in Assam, suffered severely from the pestilential climate, and returned to Bengal with considerable loss.","sp":852,"ep":857},{"h":"ASSAYING","t":"taken generally, implies an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a> of any substance, whose constituent parts are to be chemically determined.

Every one must be aware of the importance of a metallic currency agreeing in its standard fineness with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECREE\">decree</a> which establishes its circulation; and that it is an object of the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, to have the means of ascertaining, with accuracy, the value of the coins issued by the authority of the Monarch. Since the reign of Henry the Eighth, we have had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> capricious and unjustifiable changes in the standard fineness of our coins. That monarch, as Dr Henry remarks, \"after he had squandered all his father's treasures, the grants he had received from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a>, and the great sums he had derived from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> houses, began to diminish his coins both in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> and fineness. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIMINUTION\">diminution</a> at first was small, in hopes, perhaps, that it would not be perceived; but after he had got into this fatal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAREER\">career</a>, he proceeded by rapid steps to the most pernicious lengths. In the thirty-sixth year of his reign, silver <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> of all the different kinds was coined, which had only one-half silver and the other half <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALLOY\">alloy</a>. He did not even stop here; in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> year of his reign, he coined money that had only 4 oz. of silver and 8 oz. of alloy in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> weight; and the nominal pound of this base money was worth only 9s. 3\u00bdd. of our present money. He began to debase his gold coins at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, and proceeded by the same degrees. But it would be tedious to follow him in every step. In this degraded and debased condition Henry the Eighth left the money of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> to his son and successor Edward the Sixth. This shameful debasement of the money of his kingdom, was one of the most imprudent, dishonourable, and pernicious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> of his reign; it was productive of innumerable inconveniences and great perplexity in business of all kinds, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESTORATION\">restoration</a> of it to its standard purity, was found to be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of great difficulty.\"\n\nHenry's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> of Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, Vol. XII. p. 336 and 337.\n\nTo possess the art, therefore, by which such dishonourable proceedings as are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> detailed, may be speedily detected, is evidently an object of the greatest utility; in as much as the debasement of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COIN\">coin</a> would require an adjustment of the relative value of commodities to the degraded standard; and the more facility that can be given to this adjustment, the less perplexity and injury <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be sustained by the public.\n\nThe importance of the art of assaying will farther appear, when we consider the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of the manufacture of plate, and ornamental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of gold and silver; the standard value of which is determined by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASSAY\">assay</a> of a few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TROY\">Troy</a> grains only. The nicety and delicacy of the operation must be great, and much practical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> requisite to obtain uniformly a satisfactory result.\n\nThe principle of assaying gold and silver is very simple; it consists of two operations\u2014the separation of the alloy from the precious metals, and the parting of these latter from each other.\n\nBefore proceeding to the detailed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of these processes, we shall describe the furnaces and implements used in the art of assaying.\n\nPlate XXVIII.

It consists of a very thin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> of porous earthen-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARE\">ware</a>, from one to three inches in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a>, having a small neck firmly cemented to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> and rather wide tube of glass, to which is adapted a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>, with a narrow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLAR\">collar</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a> to fit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a>. Being filled with distilled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> pure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, the waste and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> serves to indicate the quantity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a> from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> surface of the ball. The tube is marked downwards through its whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> by the point of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIAMOND\">diamond</a>, with divisions across it, amounting from 200 to 500, each of which corresponds to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a> of fluid, that, spread over the whole exhaling surface, would form a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-FILM\">film</a> only one thousand <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a> in thickness. This graduation is performed by previously sealing one of the ends of the tube with wax, and introducing successive portions of quicksilver, to mark every 20, 50, or 100 of those divisions; being calculated of equal bulk to discs of water, that have the surface of the ball (exclusive of the neck) for their base, and so many thousand parts of an inch for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ALTITUDE\">altitude</a>.\n\nThe instrument, being thus constructed, has its cavity filled with pure water, and its cap screwed tight, and is then suspended freely out of doors, sheltered indeed from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a>, but exposed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>. The water transudes through the porous substance of the ball, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> as fast as it evaporates from the external surface; and this waste is measured by the corresponding descent of the liquid in the stem. At the same time, the column is suspended in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the tightness of the cap, and prevented from oozing so freely as to drop from the ball. As the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of evaporation goes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> globules of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, separated by the removal of atmospheric pressure from the body of the water, or partly introduced by external <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSORPTION\">absorption</a>, continue to rise in fine streamlets to the top, where they partially occupy the space left by the subsidence of the fluid column. We need scarcely observe, that, after the water has sunk to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> of the stem, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be requisite again to fill the cavity.\n\nIt is a fact of main importance for the accuracy of the Atmometer, that the rate of evaporation is nowise affected by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of the porous ball, and continues precisely the same, whether the exhaling surface appears almost dry or glistens with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a> of moisture. This rate must evidently depend on the effect of the dryness of the air combined with its quickness of circulation. In a close room, the instrument might therefore serve the purpose of an hygrometer; and, placed out of doors, first screened, perhaps, for an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>, and then exposed during an equal space of time, it would furnish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATA\">data</a> for calculating the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a> of the wind.\n\nThis elegant instrument is of extensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> practical utility. To ascertain readily and accurately the rate of evaporation from any surface, is an important <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACQUISITION\">acquisition</a>, not only in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METEOROLOGY\">Meteorology</a>, but in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">Agriculture</a>, and in the various <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> arts. The quantity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXHALATION\">exhalation</a> from the surface of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> is not of less consequence than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> of rain, and a knowledge of it might often <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">farmer</a> advantageously in his operations. On the rapid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISPERSION\">dispersion</a> of moisture, depends the efficiency of drying-houses, which are generally constructed on most erroneous principles.\n\nWe shall select a few observations made with the Atmometer, from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGISTER\">register</a> kept <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> season at Abbotshall, near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-KIRKCALDY\">Kirkcaldy</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIFESHIRE\">Fifeshire</a>, by the very intelligent gardener of Robert Ferguson, Esq. of Raith.

This doctrine was adopted by Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Newton, and, indeed, has been almost universally embraced by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> philosophers. But it was in chemistry alone that it could be applied with any advantage. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of chemists was to determine the component parts of bodies, and to ascertain the different elements out of which all substances are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a>. Considerable progress was gradually made in this difficult <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>. Thus it was soon ascertained that the salts, which constitute a very numerous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a> of bodies, contain always at least two constituents, namely, an acid and a base. Thus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALTPETRE\">saltpetre</a> is a compound of the acid called nitric acid, and the base called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POTASH\">potash</a>.

The same thing holds with respect to all the other salts, and, indeed, with respect to all compound bodies whatever. Now, this could not be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, unless these compounds were formed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNION\">union</a> of the minutest possible particles of the constituents with each other; that is to say, unless it were the ultimate atoms of the elements which united together and constituted the compound. Accordingly, it has been admitted as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-AXIOM\">axiom</a> in chemistry, that chemical union consists in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of the atoms of bodies with each other.\n\nChemistry originated from the absurd pursuits of the alchemists; and many years elapsed before it was able to shake off its connection with the chimerical notions respecting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER_S_STONE\"><a class=\"xref\" hre</a>f=\"vol16.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> medicine. Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CULLEN\">Cullen</a> was perhaps the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> that viewed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> as constituting a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> and important branch of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\"><a class=\"xref\" hr</a>ef=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> philosophy. His views were followed out by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">Black</a>, Cavendish, Priestley, and a cloud of other eminent men, who have added so much lustre to the scientific pre-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMINENCE\">eminence</a> of Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>. Margraaf, Bergman, and Scheele, were the first scientific chemists who appeared <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the Continent. Bergman, in particular, was of the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> to the science. Educated in those branches of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> philosophy which had already made such progress, and accustomed to the rigid accuracy of mathematical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a>, he introduced the same correct views, the same precise reasoning, the same generalization to which he had been already\nhabituated. Lavoisier, who had the advantage of a similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>, adopted a similar conduct. His industry was indefatigable, and he contributed much more than any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> to introduce that precision in experimenting, and that accuracy of reasoning, which characterize the chemists of the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>.\n\nThe exertions of these eminent men led to the discovery of the art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a>, such, though in a rude state, as it is practised at present. Bergman, Kirwan, and Wenzel, particularly distinguished themselves by the analysis of the salts. Of these three, Wenzel is by far the most accurate. The result of their experiments was, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a> that salts, and, indeed, all compound bodies, are universally composed of the same constituents united in the same proportions. Thus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> is always a compound of 1 part by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of hydrogen, and $7\\frac{1}{2}$ parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OXYGEN\">oxygen</a>; sulphate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a> always contains equal weights of sulphuric acid and black oxide of copper; and sulphate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARYTES\">barytes</a> is always a compound of 100 parts by weight of sulphuric acid, and 194 of barytes.\n\nJ. B. Richter, who was for sometime Mining Secretary at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRESLAU\">Breslau</a>, and afterwards Arcanist in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PORCELAIN\">Porcelain</a> manufactory at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BERLIN\">Berlin</a>, where he died on the 4th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a> 1807, employed himself, during the whole of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, in endeavouring to introduce the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a> into chemistry. His inaugural dissertation, printed in 1789, was entitled *De usu mathematicos in chymia*. In the year 1792, he published the first part of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> entitled *Anfangsgr\u00fcnde der Stochiometrie, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ODER\">oder</a> Messkunst chymischer Elemente; Foundation of Stochiometry, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">geometry</a> of the chemical elements*. This work he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to publish in successive parts, in 1793, 1794, 1795, 1802. Richter observed, that when two neutral salts, which mutually decompose each other, are mixed together, the two new salts which are formed still retain the same neutral state as the two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> ones from which they were formed. Thus, sulphate of potash, and nitrate of barytes, are two neutral salts, which decompose each other when mutually mixed; sulphate of barytes, and nitrate of potash, being formed both in a neutral state. This circumstance enabled him to examine the accuracy of the results obtained by preceding experimenters, and he showed that the numbers assigned both by Bergman, Kirwan, and Wenzel, for the constituents of the salts, were inaccurate, as they were unable to stand the test of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> decomposition. He was induced, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, to make a new set of experiments, in order to determine the constituents of the salts with more precision, and these experiments occupied him about ten years. He first analyzed the alkaline and earthy muriates and sulphates, then the nitrates, then the fluutes, then the carbonates, oxalates, succinates, tartrates, citrates, acetates, and some others; and lastly the phosphates. He placed in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of each of the bases required to saturate 100 parts of muriatic acid, beginning with that base of which the smallest quantity was necessary for the purpose, and terminating with the base of which the greatest quantity was requisite. Similar tables were drawn up, representing the weight of the different bases requisite to saturate 100 parts of sulphuric acid, nitric acid, carbonic acid, and all the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a> contained in the different genera of salts which he had subjected to analysis. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of these tables with each other enabled him to draw the two following remarkable consequences: First, The different bases follow exactly the same order in all the tables, and that order is as follows:\n\n- Alumina.\n- <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNESIA\">Magnesia</a>.\n- <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMMONIA\">Ammonia</a>.\n- Lime.\n- <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SODA\">Soda</a>.\n- Strontian.\n- Potash.\n- Barytes.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">Second</a>, The numbers in each table constitute a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a>, which have the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a> to each other in all the tables. Suppose, for example, that in the table representing the muriates, the quantity of potash requisite to saturate 100 parts of muriatic acid were three times as great as the quantity of alumina requisite to produce the same effect, the same thing would hold in the sulphates, nitrates, and all the other genera of salts. Three times as much potash would be requisite to saturate 100 sulphuric, nitric, or any other acid, as would be required of alumina. In the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> three times as much barytes be requisite to saturate a given weight of one acid as is required of lime, the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> will hold when we saturate any other acid; with these earths we must always employ three times as much barytes as of lime. When the quantity of each of the acids requisite to saturate a given weight of each successive base, was placed in tables in a similar way, it was found, as might have been anticipated, that the acids followed precisely the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a>.\n\nThese facts explain why, when two neutral salts decompose each other, the new formed salts are also neutral, and why there is never any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a> of acid or base upon the one side or the other. The same proportions of bases that saturate a given weight of one acid, saturate all the other acids, and the same proportion of acids that saturate one base, saturate all the other bases. Hence numbers may be attached to each acid and base, indicating the weight of it which will saturate the weights attached to all the other bases or acids. This accordingly was done by Fischer from Richter's experiments and tables. We shall here insert his numbers, not because they are accurate, which is very far from being the case, but because they constitute the first specimen of the kind ever offered to the chemical world. (Berthollet's *Essai de Statique Chimique*, I. 136.)\n\n| Alumina | Fluoric acid |\n|---------|-------------|\n| Magnesia | Carbonic acid |\n| Ammonia | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEBACIC_ACID\">Sebacic acid</a> |\n| Lime    | Muriatic acid |\n| Soda    | Oxalic acid |\n| Strontian | Phosphoric acid |\n| Potash  | Formic acid |\n\n5\nAccording to this table, 525 of alumina is saturated by 427 of fluoric acid, 377 of carbonic acid, 755 of oxalic acid, 1000 sulphuric acid, &c.; and 427 of fluoric acid, is saturated by 525 of alumina, 615 of magnesia, 672 of ammonia, &c. It is obvious, therefore, that this table, supposing it accurate, would give us the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of all the salts into which the bases and acids contained in it enter.\n\nM. Proust, a French chemist of great sagacity, who was settled as Professor of Chemistry at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MADRID\">Madrid</a>, was the first person who attempted an accurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of metallic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OXIDES\">oxides</a>. He studied the oxides of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZINC\">zinc</a>, arsenic, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTIMONY\">antimony</a>, &c. The result of his examination was, that every metal is capable of forming a certain determinate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of oxides and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> more. Zinc forms only one oxide; iron, arsenic, and antimony, form two each; tin forms three, &c. Each of these oxides he found composed of a determinate proportion of metal, and oxygen, which remained always the same in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>. Thus, the oxide of zinc, according to him, is always a compound of 100 parts zinc, and 25 oxygen. The two oxides of iron are the black and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>. If iron be combined with oxygen at all, it is either connected with the quantity of oxygen which constitutes the black oxide, or with the quantity which constitutes the red oxide, but it is incapable of uniting with any other proportion of oxygen. Wherever iron, already in the state of black oxide, combines with more oxygen, it becomes red oxide, being incapable of existing in any intermediate state between the black and the red oxide. The same law holds with respect to tin, antimony, arsenic, and all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a>; thus, M. Proust proved that metals unite only with determinate proportions of oxygen, which may be assigned in numbers. He showed that the same law held with respect to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a> of the metals with sulphur. When Berthollet published his Chemical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATICS\">Statics</a>, one of his objects was to show that there are two proportions of oxygen which unite with metals, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINIMUM\">minimum</a> and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MAXIMUM\">maximum</a>, and that between these two extremes, usually placed at a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> from each other, there are an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-INFINITY\">infinity</a> of proportions of oxygen capable of uniting with every metal. Hence he inferred that there is no such thing as permanent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEFINITE\">definite</a> metallic oxides; but an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFINITE\">infinite</a> number of shades of oxidization graduating into each other, and each capable of uniting with acids, and thus of forming an infinite variety of salts, differing from each other by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> shades of character. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, which, if correct, would have put an effectual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> to all chemical investigation, as it would have been useless and absurd to attempt to examine compounds, which had no permanence and no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> to each other, occasioned a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a> between Proust and Berthollet. Proust showed, by decisive experiments, that the indefinite numbers of metallic oxide, supposed by Berthollet, does not exist, and that metals are only capable of combining with 1, 2, or 3 doses of oxygen; that there is no indefinite number of oxides between the black and the red oxides of iron; but that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INSTANT\">instant</a> that iron combined with more oxygen than existed in the black oxide, it is converted into the red oxide.\n\nSuch was the state of the subject when Mr. Dalton turned his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to the combination of bodies with each other about the year 1804. At that period, it was known that hydrogen combines only in one proportion with oxygen; that carbon, sulphur, and phosphorus, unite each in two proportions; that carbon unites in two proportions with hydrogen, sulphur in two proportions with the same substance, and phosphorus in one proportion; that azote unites in one proportion with hydrogen, and in four proportions with oxygen. It was known, too, that several of the metals combine with only one dose of oxygen, while some unite with two doses, and others with three. It had been ascertained, that, in certain cases, when metals combine with two doses of oxygen, the second dose is exactly double the first dose, while in other cases it is to the first dose as 3 to 2. Thus, in platinum, the second oxide contains <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> double the quantity of oxygen that the first oxide contains, while in iron, the quantity of oxygen in the red oxide, is, to the quantity in the black oxide, as 3 to 2. None of the combinations of oxygen or hydrogen, with the simple combustibles, had been accurately analyzed; though approximations to a correct analysis of most of them existed, and what was chiefly wanting, was a criterion for distinguishing the comparative merits of the different analysis of these bodies which had been presented to the chemical world.\n\nMr. Dalton was struck with the small number of compounds which the elementary bodies are capable of forming with each other, and with the very simple relations which existed between the numbers that denote the weight of the different constituents in these compounds; and he set himself <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to endeavour to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> for these circumstances not hitherto inquired into. Water, he found, was always a compound of 1 part by weight of hydrogen, and 8 parts by weight of oxygen.\n\n| Compound                  | Weight |\n|---------------------------|--------|\n| Carbonic oxide            | 750    |\n| Carbonic acid             | 750    |\n| Sulphurous acid           | 2      |\n| Sulphuric acid            | 2      |\n| Nitrous oxide             | 175    |\n| Nitrous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAS\">gas</a>               | 175    |\n| Nitrous acid              | 175    |\n| Nitric acid               | 175    |\n\n* In the following examples, instead of using the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> analysis with which Mr. Dalton was obliged to be satisfied, and which misled him in some cases, we have thought it better to employ the most precise experiments hitherto made.\nNow, in all these compounds, it will be perceived, that the numbers denoting the oxygen, united to a given weight of the same base, bear a very simple and obvious ratio to each other. The oxygen in carbonic acid is twice as great as in carbonic oxide; the oxygen in sulphuric acid is to that in sulphurous as the numbers 3 to 2; while the oxygen, in the respective compounds of azote and oxygen, bears the ratio of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 5.\n\nThese and many other similar examples which Mr Dalton registered and examined, but which it is unnecessary to state here, led him to the lucky idea that the atoms of bodies unite together; that the atom of each body has a determinate weight, and that this weight regulates the proportion in which bodies combine with each other. Let us suppose, for example, that water is formed by the union of one atom of oxygen, with one atom of hydrogen, it follows, as the oxygen in water is 8 times that of the hydrogen, that the weight of an atom of oxygen is to that of an atom of hydrogen as 8 to 1. So that, if we represent the weight of an atom of hydrogen by 1, that of an atom of oxygen will be 8; or if, as is more convenient in practice, we pitch upon 1 for the weight of an atom of oxygen, an atom of hydrogen will weigh 0.125. As carbon unites with two proportions of oxygen, we may suppose that an atom of carbon unites with 1 atom, and with 2 atoms of oxygen. Hence, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> why the quantity of oxygen in carbonic acid is twice as great as in carbonic oxide. If an atom of oxygen weigh 1, it is obvious that an atom of carbon will weigh 0.751, supposing the numbers which we have given in the preceding table to be accurate. It is equally obvious, that sulphurous acid must contain 2 atoms of oxygen, and sulphuric acid 3 atoms; and that an atom of sulphur will weigh 2, on the supposition that an atom of oxygen weighs 1. Finally, nitrous oxide is a compound of 1 atom azote, and 1 atom oxygen; nitrous gas of 1 atom azote, and 2 atoms oxygen; nitrous acid of 1 atom azote, and 3 atoms oxygen; and nitric acid of 1 atom azote, and 5 atoms oxygen. And, supposing the numbers in our table correct, if an atom of oxygen weigh 1, an atom of azote will weigh 1.75.\n\nMr Dalton did not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> satisfied with this simple and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUMINOUS\">luminous</a> explanation, which threw a new and strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> around chemical combinations\u2014which afforded the means of correcting and checking chemical experiments, hitherto conducted without any guide, and promised, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, to introduce mathematical precision, and mathematical reasoning, into a science which hitherto has been able only to boast of analogical and probable conclusions. He contrived a set of symbols to represent the different elements, and make the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the combinations which they form obvious to the eye of the most careless reader. A few examples will be sufficient to make the nature and use of these symbols perfectly well understood.\n\nLet \\( O \\) be an atom of oxygen\n\n- \\( O \\) - - - - hydrogen\n- \\( O \\) - - - - azote\n- \\( O \\) - - - - carbon\n\nLet \\( \\oplus \\) be an atom of sulphur\n\n- \\( \\oplus \\) - - - - phosphorus,\n\nThen \\( \\bigcirc \\) represents an integrant particle\n\n- \\( \\bigcirc \\) - - - - of water\n- \\( \\bigcirc \\) - - - - of carbonic oxide\n- \\( \\bigcirc \\) - - - - of carbonic acid\n- \\( \\bigcirc \\) - - - - of sulphurous acid\n- \\( \\bigcirc \\) - - - - of nitrous oxide\n- \\( \\bigcirc \\) - - - - of nitrous gas\n- \\( \\bigcirc \\) - - - - of nitrous acid\n- \\( \\bigcirc \\) - - - - of nitric acid\n- \\( \\bigcirc \\) - - - - of carbureted hydrogen\n- \\( \\bigcirc \\) - - - - of olefiant gas.\n\nIt would be easy to multiply these symbols much farther; but the preceding specimen is sufficient, we conceive, to make the use of them understood, and even to make Mr Dalton's doctrine more simple to those who are still strangers to it. Mr Dalton has already published two volumes of what he entitles a New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYSTEM\">System</a> of Chemical Philosophy, in order to explain and show the accuracy and importance of this doctrine. Our object, in the present article, will be to lay the whole of it in its present state before our readers. But we must, in the first place, trace the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of the improvements which it has received to its termination.\n\nIn the year 1809, M. Gay-Lussac, who had already distinguished himself by many important chemical discoveries, and who was well acquainted with Mr Dalton's theory, published a curious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> on the combinations of gaseous substances with each other. (Memoires d'Arcueil, II. 205.) He showed that they follow a very simple law in their combinations; that one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of one gas always combines either with one volume of another gas, or with two volumes, or with three volumes. Thus,\n\n1 volume ammonia saturates 1 vol. of muriatic acid\n1 vol. of carbonic acid\n1 vol. of fluoboric acid.\n\nThe resulting compounds are neutral muriate, carbonate, and fluoborate of ammonia.\n\nNitrous gas is composed of one volume of azote, and one volume of oxygen.\n\nSubcarbonate of ammonia is composed of one volume carbonic acid, and two volumes ammoniacal gas.\n\nSubfluoborate of ammonia of one volume fluoboric acid, and two volumes ammoniacal gas.\nWater of one volume of oxygen, and two volumes of hydrogen gas. Nitrous oxide of one volume oxygen, and two volumes azote. Nitric acid of one volume oxygen, and two volumes nitrous gas. Sulphuric acid of one volume oxygen, and two volumes sulphurous acid. Carbonic acid gas of one volume oxygen, and two volumes carbonic oxide.\n\nFinally, ammonia is composed of one volume azote, and three volumes hydrogen; and nitrous acid gas of one volume oxygen, and three volumes of nitrous gas.\n\nGay-Lussac showed likewise, that the diminution of volume which takes place on the combination of these gases, follows as simple a law as the volumes in which they combine. In nitrous gas, the oxygen and azote undergo no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONDENSATION\">condensation</a>. Accordingly, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-SPECIFIC_GRAVITY\"><a class=\"xref\" </a>href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIFIC\">specific</a> gravity of nitrous gas is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> between that of oxygen and azote. Frequently one of the two gases retains its bulk unaltered, while the other totally disappears. Thus, when 100 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> of carbonic oxide, and 50 measures of oxygen gas, are united together by combination, the resulting compound constitutes 100 measures of carbonic acid. Sometimes the bulk is reduced to one half. Thus, when 100 measures of azote, and 300 measures of hydrogen, are united, they form 200 measures of ammoniacal gas.\n\nThis curious law, discovered by Gay-Lussac, when coupled with the doctrine of Mr Dalton, shows us, that there exists a very simple relation between the weight of the atoms and the bulk of the gaseous bodies. Accordingly, the weight of the atoms of these bodies may be deduced, with sufficient accuracy, from their specific gravity. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> was employed both by Sir Humphry Davy and Dr Wollaston.\n\nProfessor Berzelius of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STOCKHOLM\">Stockholm</a>, one of the most accurate and indefatigable chemists of the present time, was led, some years ago, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> the composition of the salts, in consequence of the perusal of Richter's Stoichiometry. He soon satisfied himself that neither the analyses of Richter, nor of preceding chemists, could be depended on for accuracy. He resolved, therefore, to institute a new analysis of a considerable number of saline bodies, and to be at particular pains to ensure the greatest possible precision which the present state of the science enabled him to attain. The result of this laborious undertaking has been published in the Annales de Chimie, the Annalen der Physik, Nicholson's Journal, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANNALS\">Annals</a> of Philosophy. It constitutes by far the most complete and valuable set of chemical analyses of which the science is possessed. Berzelius not only satisfied himself of the accuracy of Richter's law, but was so fortunate as to discover another of a very unexpected nature, and of the greatest importance in chemical analysis, because it enables us to subject the results of all our analyses to calculation, and thus to determine with certainty how far their accuracy may be depended on. All the acids, with a very few exceptions, contain oxygen. This is the case likewise with all the salifiable bases, so that the salts may be considered as combinations of two sets of oxides with each other. Now, Berzelius compared the oxygen in the base of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> with the oxygen in its acid, and he found that they always bore a very simple relation to each other. They were either equal, or the oxygen in the acid was twice as much as that in the base, or thrice as much, or four times as much, &c. If the acid contained twice as much oxygen as the base, this was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> that the acid contained two atoms of oxygen; if it contained thrice as much, it contained three atoms of oxygen, and so on. Thus, in the sulphates, the sulphuric acid contains three times as much oxygen as the quantity of base which it saturates. Hence we infer, that sulphuric acid is a compound of 1 atom sulphur, and 3 atoms oxygen. In the sulphites, the acid contains twice as much oxygen as the base which it saturates. Hence, we infer that sulphurous acid is composed of 1 atom sulphur, and 2 atoms oxygen. In the carbonates, the oxygen in the acid is twice as much as in the base which it saturates. Hence we infer that carbonic acid is composed of 1 atom of carbon, and 2 atoms of oxygen.\n\nBerzelius, during his experimental investigation of the atomic theory, met with some objections which he was not able immediately to surmount. In consequence of these difficulties, he substituted for the atomic theory what he calls the theory of volumes, derived from Gay-Lussac's discovery respecting the proportions in point of volume in which gaseous substances combine. This is merely substituting another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> for the atomic theory. For it is easy to show, that the theory of volumes, as Berzelius considers it, is precisely the same thing as Dalton's atomic theory. The difficulties of Berzelius will come under our consideration hereafter.\n\nAfter the preceding historical sketch, which we thought necessary in order to do <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> to all parties concerned in this important branch of chemistry, we shall proceed to lay the atomic theory, with the proofs in support of it, before our readers.\n\nI. Outline of the Atomic Theory.\n\nWith respect to the nature of the ultimate elements of bodies, we have no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> means of obtaining accurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a>. But it is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> opinion, that they consist of atoms or minute particles, incapable of farther division. It is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to demonstrate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of this opinion; but, for our part, we can conceive no other. It has been almost universally admitted, by mechanical philosophers, since the time of Newton. We shall, therefore, adopt it here as the foundation of our reasoning.\n\nWhen two bodies unite chemically, so as to form a third body, the two substances combined are dispersed everywhere through the new compound. Water, for example, is composed of oxygen and hydrogen. Now, how minute a portion soever of water we examine, we shall find it to contain both oxygen and hydrogen. Saltpetre is a compound of nitric acid and potash. If we examine the salt, whether we take an ounce or the hundredth part of a grain, we shall always find it to be a compound of nitric acid and potash. If any portion of it were to want one of these constituents, it would no longer be saltpetre; it would be potash, or nitric acid, according to the constituent which is not present. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">Limestone</a> is a compound of carbonic acid and lime. Now, we\nmay reduce it to an impalpable powder; but if we take one of the grains of this powder, however small, and throw it into nitric acid, we shall perceive an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EFFERVESCENCE\">effervescence</a>, indicating the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a> of carbonic acid, and it will dissolve, indicating that lime was also one of its constituents. Mechanical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRITURATION\">trituration</a>, however carefully made, is quite incapable of separating from each other substances which are chemically combined. Now, this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a> of the constituents could never be so complete through every part of the compound, unless it were the atoms of the combined bodies that united with each other. This, accordingly, is the opinion respecting chemical combinations, which appears always to have been entertained by chemical philosophers. Nor do we believe that any person will be disposed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CALL\">call</a> its truth in question.\n\nAll chemical compounds contain the same constant proportion of constituents with the most rigid accuracy, no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> whatever ever taking place. Water is universally a compound of 1 part by weight of hydrogen, and 8 of oxygen; sulphuric acid, of 1 part sulphur, and 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) oxygen; carbonic acid, of 1 part carbon, and 2.666 of oxygen. This permanency in the constituents of chemical compounds, indeed, is generally admitted. It constitutes, in fact, the basis of the whole science. For, if the proportions of the constituents of bodies were variable, chemical analysis would be nugatory, and the whole science of little importance. Even Berthollet, who contends for indefinite proportions in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a>, admits the incontrovertible fact that the proportions of chemical combinations in general are permanent.\n\nSince, then, bodies unite chemically atom to atom; and since they always unite in the same proportions, without the smallest deviation, this regularity can be ascribed to nothing else than the constant union of one atom of one body with one atom of another; or of a determinate number of atoms of one body with a determinate number of atoms of another. At first sight, it may appear impossible to determine how many atoms of each constituent combine with an indefinite number of atoms of the other. But there are some circumstances which afford us considerable assistance in this apparently intricate investigation.\n\nThus, oxygen has the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of uniting in different proportions with the same base; sometimes in two, sometimes in three, sometimes in four, &c., proportions. Thus, with carbon it unites in two proportions, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a> in two, with copper in two. With tin it unites in three proportions, while with manganese it unites in four proportions. Now, if we represent the weight of base with which the oxygen unites by \\(a\\), and suppose all the different proportions of oxygen to unite with this proportion of base; and if we denote the first portion of oxygen by \\(b\\), then, in general, the constituents of the different compounds formed by the union of the different doses of oxygen with the base will be as follows:\n\n1st compound \\(a + b\\).\n2d compound \\(a + 2b\\).\n3d compound \\(a + 3b\\).\n4th compound \\(a + 4b\\).\n\nSuppose 10 parts of oxygen enter into the first compound, then 20 parts enter into the second, 30 parts into the third, and 40 parts into the fourth compound. Hence, whatever number of atoms enter into the first compound, twice that number enters into the second compound, thrice the number into the third compound, and four times the number into the fourth compound. Hence it is clear, that there is a determinate number of atoms of oxygen, which always enter into these combinations. If we represent this number by \\(x\\), then \\(a + x\\) is the first compound, \\(a + 2x\\) the second, \\(a + 3x\\) the third, and \\(a + 4x\\) the fourth. Now, it would be singular, if 2, 3, 4, &c., atoms of oxygen, were to be always inseparably linked together, so as never to be able to enter into combinations separate. It is much more simple to conceive, that \\(x\\) represents only 1 atom. Indeed, there can be little doubt that this is actually the case. For oxygen gas, being a permanently <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> fluid, must consist of atoms that repel each other. Hence a compound atom of oxygen, or a number of atoms united together, seems to be impossible. But even though the opinion that \\(x\\) represents one atom should not be mathematically true, still it would be proper to adopt it. For, as far as our calculations are concerned, a number of atoms of oxygen, constantly and invariably united together, would constitute a compound atom, about which we may reason as accurately and justly as we could do about the simple atoms themselves. But if \\(x\\) in these combinations be considered as representing an atom of oxygen, there can be no doubt that \\(a\\) represents an atom of the body, which unites with oxygen. So that, by knowing the proportions in which they unite, we have the relative weight of an atom of oxygen, and of the body with which it unites.\n\nThis reasoning may be applied to hydrogen as well as oxygen. Hydrogen has the property of uniting in different proportions with various bodies, as with carbon, phosphorus, sulphur, &c. In these different proportions, we find the hydrogen always denoted by \\(y\\), \\(2y\\), &c., just as is the case with oxygen. Hence we have the same reason for concluding that \\(y\\), which represents the minimum of hydrogen which unites with the other constituent, is an atom.\n\nThe numbers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are easily discovered by making an accurate analysis of the different compounds into which various proportions of oxygen and hydrogen enter; and, when reduced to their lowest terms, they are very nearly \\(x = 8\\), and \\(y = 1\\). Hence these numbers represent the ratios of the weight of an atom of oxygen and an atom of hydrogen to each other. Now, it deserves attention, that these numbers represent the composition of water. For it has been ascertained, by very careful experiments, that water is composed of 100 measures of oxygen gas, and 200 measures of hydrogen gas. Now, the specific gravity of these gases is as follows:\n\n| Substance | Specific Gravity |\n|-----------|-----------------|\n| Oxygen    | 1.111           |\n| Hydrogen  | 0.069           |\n\nHence water is composed by weight of\n\n| Substance | Weight Ratio |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| Oxygen    | 8.00        |\n| Hydrogen  | 1.00        |\nFrom this coincidence we are entitled to conclude, that water is formed by the union of an atom of oxygen with an atom of hydrogen. And consequently, that an atom of hydrogen is to an atom of oxygen in weight, as 1 to 8. This very important <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONCLUSION\">conclusion</a> is supported by other considerations. Oxygen and hydrogen have never been made to combine in any other proportion than that in which they exist in water. Hence this proportion must be that which unites most readily and with the greatest force. Now, as the atoms of hydrogen repel each other, as is the case also with the atoms of oxygen, it is obvious, that when they are mixed equably, as is the case when 200 measures of hydrogen gas, and 100 measures of oxygen gas, are put into a tube and fired by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTRICITY\">electricity</a>, they will most readily unite atom to atom. This, though not in itself decisive, is a corroborating circumstance. It follows from it, that a given bulk of hydrogen gas contains only one half the number of atoms which exist in the same bulk of oxygen gas.\n\nBut we must not conceal that there is another view of this subject, which has been taken by Davy and Berzelius, and certainly possesses much plausibility. It is founded on this curious fact, first noticed, we believe, by Dr Wollaston, and confirmed by the theory of Gay-Lussac, detailed in the historical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-INTRODUCTION\">introduction</a> to this article, that if we determine the weight of an atom of the gaseous bodies from their specific gravity (or at least a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MULTIPLE\">multiple</a> of it), the numbers obtained will correspond with the atomic theory, as well as the numbers found by the method above described, which is the method of Dalton. In fact, they will always be the same numbers, or their halves or their doubles. This shows us, that a very simple relation exists between the bulk of a gas and the number of atoms which it contains. If the weight of an atom of a gas were always the same as its specific gravity, it would follow, that the same bulk of every gas contains always the same number of atoms. But cases occur in which this simple rule does not answer. Thus, it is admitted even by Davy and Berzelius, that the weight of an atom of azote is twice that of its specific gravity. So that, in a given <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of azotic gas, there is only one half of the number of atoms that exist in an equal measure of oxygen gas.\n\nThose who found their weights of the atoms of bodies on the specific gravity of the gases, consider water as composed of 2 atoms of hydrogen, and 1 atom of oxygen. If this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> be correct, the weight of an atom of hydrogen, is to that of an atom of oxygen, as 1 to 16. This is nearly the proportion given by Davy and Berzelius. Davy, who rejects decimals, makes an atom of hydrogen weigh 1, and an atom of oxygen 15. Berzelius makes an atom of oxygen weigh 15.069, supposing that of hydrogen to weigh 1. As oxygen and hydrogen cannot be united in any other than 1 proportion, we have no means of putting it to the test of experiment. But the example of azote (admitted at least by Davy, though Berzelius, by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>, that azote is a compound of nitricum and oxygen, gets over the difficulty) is sufficient to show us that it is not necessary that the weights of the atoms of gases should be directly as the specific gravity of these bodies. On this account, the reasons before urged in favour of the opinion, that water is a compound of 1 atom of oxygen, and 1 atom of hydrogen, seems to us sufficient to give a preponderancy to this opinion, and to induce us to embrace it.\n\nKnowing the weight of an atom of oxygen, and an atom of hydrogen, we have it in our power to determine the weight of an atom of the other substances, which unite with oxygen or with hydrogen, or with both. For example, 100 parts of sulphur unite with two proportions of oxygen, namely, with 100 parts constituting sulphurous acid, and with 150 parts constituting sulphuric acid, both by weight. Here, the proportions of oxygen being to each other as the numbers 1:1\u00bd or 2:3; it is reasonable to suppose, that the first proportion represents 2 atoms of oxygen, and the second 3 atoms. There may, perhaps, exist another compound, consisting of 1 atom sulphur, and 1 atom oxygen, or by weight of 100 sulphur and 50 oxygen. But such a compound is at present unknown. It is evident, if sulphurous acid be composed of 1 atom sulphur, and 2 atoms oxygen, that an atom of sulphur is twice as heavy as an atom of oxygen. So that if we were to represent the weight of an atom of oxygen by 8, that of an atom of sulphur would be 16. Davy makes an atom of oxygen 15. Accordingly, his atom of sulphur is represented by 30.\n\nWe have it in our power to verify this reasoning by means of the combinations which sulphur makes with hydrogen. This verification may be made two ways, and we shall employ both to show how they serve to corroborate one another. 1. It has been ascertained, that 100 measures of hydrogen gas may be united to sulphur, and converted into sulphureted hydrogen gas, without undergoing any change of bulk. Hence, to know with precision the composition of sulphureted hydrogen, we have only to determine with care the specific gravity of hydrogen gas, and sulphureted hydrogen gas. Now,\n\n100 cubic inches of hydrogen gas weigh 2.117 grains.\n100 cubic inches of sulphur. hyd. gas 35.89.\n\nHence it follows, that sulphureted hydrogen gas is composed of\n\n| Hydrogen | - - - | 2.117 or 1.00 |\n| Sulphur  | - - - | 33.773 16.00 |\n\nThis shows us, that if sulphureted hydrogen gas is composed of 1 atom sulphur, and 1 atom hydrogen, and if we suppose an atom of hydrogen to weigh 1, an atom of sulphur will weigh 16. The combination of oxygen and sulphur gave us 16. Thus the two processes of reasoning <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> to the same conclusion, since the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> really existing is greatly within the limits of the unavoidable errors in such kinds of experiment. 2. Sulphureted hydrogen gas requires for its complete <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMBUSTION\">combustion</a> 1\u00bd times its bulk of oxygen gas. The products of the combustions are sulphurous acid and water. The sulphurous acid gas amounts exactly to the bulk of the sulphureted hydrogen gas consumed. Suppose 100 measures of sulphureted hydrogen gas to\nbe burned. We must employ for the purpose 130 measures of oxygen gas. The gaseous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRODUCT\">product</a> consists of 100 measures of sulphurous acid gas; 100 measures of the oxygen gas go to the formation of the sulphurous acid gas, and 50 measures go to the formation of water. Now, 100 cubic inches of sulphurous acid gas weigh 66.89 grains, and contain 33.445 grains of sulphur; 50 cubic inches of oxygen combine with 100 cubic inches of hydrogen, or with 2.117 grains. So that, according to this analysis, sulphureted hydrogen is composed of\n\n| Hydrogen | 2.117 or 1.000 |\n|----------|----------------|\n| Sulphur  | 33.445         |\n\nSo that, according to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a>, the weight of an atom of sulphur is 15.8. This differs only .2 from the preceding, and is also within the limits of the unavoidable errors of chemical experiment. We may, therefore, consider these two methods of determining the weight of an atom of sulphur as all coinciding, and giving absolutely the same result.\n\nBy a similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of reasoning, we may determine, with considerable accuracy, the weight of an atom of azote, phosphorus, carbon, the metals, and almost all those bodies which at present are considered as simple. It would be tedious to give any more illustrations here. Enough, we conceive, has been said to explain the nature of the theory, and to render the manner of proceeding in determining the weights of the atoms of bodies intelligible to the reader. In a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> part of this article, we shall give a table of the weights of the atoms of bodies, and state, at the same time, the documents on which these weights are founded.\n\nIt is hardly necessary to observe, how very powerfully a particular conclusion is confirmed, when we arrive at it by different processes. This advantage we have in full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a>, when we set about determining the weight of the atoms of the simple substances. In most cases, we come to the same conclusions by two, three, or four different methods. These coincidences could not exist, unless the conclusions were well founded.\n\nWith respect to the number of atoms capable of uniting together, no general rule can be given. In organic bodies, this number is often very great. Hence, probably, the reason why we cannot succeed in our attempts to form animal and vegetable bodies. In unorganic bodies, the number of atoms united is much smaller. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIMARY\">primary</a> compounds, we do not recollect an example of any substance containing more than 7 atoms. These atoms are always confined to two different kinds of matter, as hydrogen and oxygen, carbon and oxygen, sulphur and oxygen, carbon and hydrogen, sulphur and phosphorus, &c. We never find three different kinds of matter united together in any primary compound, provided it does not belong to the vegetable or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANIMAL_KINGDOM\">animal <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>. For primary compounds of organized matter contain usually three, and sometimes four, or even five or six, different kinds of substances; as hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen; hydrogen, carbon, azote, oxygen; hydrogen, carbon, azote, iron, oxygen; hydrogen, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-CAR\">car</a>-\n\nbon, azote, phosphorus, sulphur, oxygen. According to Berzelius, one of the constituents of unorganized bodies always amounts only to 1 atom. This law certainly holds in the primary compounds. Whether it holds in those compounds called salts, is not so clear. We shall be better able to judge, when we have examined the composition of the salts in a subsequent part of this article.\n\nIn organic bodies, on the contrary, none of the constituents exists of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> to the amount of 1 atom; though this may sometimes happen from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCIDENT\">accident</a>. Hence the reasons of the very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPLEX\">complex</a> nature of organic bodies, and the numerous modifications of most of them that exist.\n\nThe secondary compounds, or those bodies formed by the union of primary compounds with each other, are of a much more complex nature. They frequently contain three or four different ingredients united together; as, for example, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALUM\">alum</a>, tartar emetic, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROCHELLE\">Rochelle</a> salt. Now, as each of these constituents is composed of several atoms, it is obvious, that the composition of the secondary compounds is much more complicated than that of the primary compounds. It will be convenient, on that account, to consider each separately.\n\nII. Weight of the Atoms of the Simple Substances.\n\nBefore we can draw up a table of the relative weights of the simple substances, we must fix upon some one whose atom shall be represented by unity. Mr Dalton has made choice of hydrogen for this purpose, because it is the lightest of all known bodies. Sir Humphry Davy has followed his example; but he has doubled the weight of an atom of oxygen, and of most other bodies, by the arbitrary supposition, that water is composed of 2 atoms of hydrogen, and 1 atom of oxygen. Dr Wollaston, Professor Berzelius, and Dr Thomson, have adopted oxygen as the most convenient unit; nor can there be any hesitation in embracing their plans. Oxygen is, in fact, the substance by means of which the weights of the atoms of almost all other bodies are determined. It enters into a much greater number of combinations than any other known body. Hence, if we denote the weight of its atom by 1, a considerable convenience will result to the practical chemist. We shall exhibit the weights of the atoms of the simple bodies, under the form of tables, and we shall state at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> of each, the documents by means of which these weights were obtained.\n\n1. Simple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUPPORTERS\">Supporters</a>.\n\n| Substances | Weight of Atom |\n|------------|---------------|\n| Oxygen     | 1.000         |\n| Chlorine   | 4.500         |\n| Iodine     | 15.621        |\n\nOxygen having been chosen for the unit, we have already stated our reasons for the weight assigned. The weight is arbitrary, and adopted merely for the sake of convenience.\n\nChlorous oxide (the euchlorine of Davy) is composed of 2 volumes of chlorine gas, and 1 volume of\nThe specific gravity of chlorine gas is 2.483; that of oxygen gas 1.104. If we suppose chlorous acid to be composed of 1 atom chlorine, and 1 atom oxygen, a supposition which gives the simplest view of the composition of the chlorides, we have for the weight of an atom of chlorine this proportion, \\( \\frac{1.104}{2.483} = \\frac{1}{2} \\) or 0.498 = the weight of an atom of chlorine.\n\nThe weight of an atom of iodine is the result of the experiments of Gay-Lussac, and may be considered as nearly correct. But we could not explain, in this place, the manner of conducting the experiments by which it was ascertained, without entering into details respecting the properties of this newly discovered substance that would be quite foreign to the present article.\n\n### 2. Simple Combustibles\n\n| Substances | Weight of an Atom |\n|------------|------------------|\n| Hydrogen   | 0.125            |\n| Boron      | 0.733            |\n| Carbon     | 0.750            |\n| Phosphorus | 1.625            |\n| Azote      | 1.750            |\n| Sulphur    | 2.000            |\n| Silicon    | 2.000            |\n\nThe method of determining the weight of an atom of hydrogen has been explained in a preceding part of this article. It was there shown from the composition of water, that the weight of an atom of hydrogen is to that of an atom of oxygen as 1 to 7.56. Now, \\( \\frac{7.56}{1} : 1 : 0.125 = \\<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEXT\">text</a>{weight of an atom of hydrogen} \\). We have given 0.125 in the table, as the weight of an atom of hydrogen, because we consider it as established by a paper in the *Annals of Philosophy*, Vol. VI. p. 322, that the specific gravity of oxygen is 16 times that of hydrogen.\n\nThe experiments of Davy on the combustion of boron in oxygen gas, and those of Berzelius on the borates (*Annals of Philosophy*, Vol. III. p. 66), have shown that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BORACIC_ACID\">boracic acid</a> is composed of 100 oxygen + 36.649 boron. The resemblance between boron and carbon is so great, that it is very probable they will be analogous to each other in the proportion of oxygen with which they combine. Now, we shall see afterwards that carbonic acid is a compound of 1 atom carbon, and 2 atoms oxygen. Supposing boracic acid to be a compound of 1 atom boron, and 2 atoms oxygen, to determine the weight of an atom of boron, we have this proportion \\( \\frac{100}{2} : 36.649 : : 1 : 0.733 = \\text{weight of an atom of boron} \\).\n\nWhen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARCOAL\">charcoal</a> is burnt in oxygen gas, the bulk of the gas is not altered; it is merely converted into carbonic acid gas. Therefore, if we subtract the specific gravity of oxygen gas from that of carbonic acid gas, the remainder denotes the quantity of carbon in carbonic united with the weight of oxygen indicated by the specific gravity. Now,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Grains.} \\\\\n100 \\text{ cubic inches of carbonic acid weigh } & 46.313 \\\\\n100 \\text{ oxygen gas } & 33.672 \\\\\n\\text{Remainder, } & 12.641\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTherefore carbonic acid is composed of\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Carbon} & - 12.641 \\text{ or } 27.29 \\\\\n\\text{Oxygen} & - 33.672 \\text{ or } 72.71 \\\\\n& 100.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nWe shall see afterwards that carbonic acid is composed of 1 atom carbon + 2 atoms oxygen. Therefore, to find the weight of an atom of carbon, we have this proportion, \\( \\frac{72.71}{2} : 27.29 : : 1 : 0.751 = \\text{weight of an atom of carbon} \\).\n\nThe writer of this article has ascertained, by experiments which it would be too tedious to adduce here, that phosphoric acid is composed of 100 phosphorus + 123 oxygen, and that it consists of 1 atom phosphorus + 2 atoms oxygen. Hence the weight of an atom of phosphorus is 1.625.\n\nThe determination of the weight of an atom of azote is attended with considerable difficulty. We have no doubt, that it is in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a> a compound. But whether it consists of hydrogen united to oxygen, as is the opinion of Mr Miers, or of nitricum and oxygen, as Berzelius believes, has not yet been decided by satisfactory experiments. We must, therefore, in the present state of our knowledge, allow it a place among the undecomposed bodies. It scarcely belongs to the combustibles, as it does not in any case exhibit the phenomena of combustions. But we give it a place among them for want of any better situation under which it could be arranged. Azote combines with four proportions of oxygen, and constitutes four compounds, all of which have been analyzed with care. If we denominate the quantity of oxygen that unites with 100 parts of azote by \\( x \\), the following table will exhibit the constituents of these compounds.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Nitrous oxide} & . 100 \\text{ azote } + 1 x \\\\\n\\text{Nitrous gas} & . 100 \\text{ azote } + 2 x \\\\\n\\text{Nitrous acid} & . 100 \\text{ azote } + 3 x \\\\\n\\text{Nitric acid} & . 100 \\text{ azote } + 5 x\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nFrom this table there can be no doubt, that \\( x \\) represents an atom of oxygen. Hence we have only to ascertain the value of \\( x \\); to be able to determine the weight of an atom of azote. Now nitrous oxide, nitrous gas, and nitric acid, have been analyzed with care, and the number in the table is the mean resulting from these analyses.\n\nIt has been ascertained by many and careful experiments, that sulphurous and sulphuric acids are composed as follows:\nHence we see, that the first contains two atoms of oxygen, and the second three atoms of oxygen, combined each with one atom of sulphur. Therefore for the weight of an atom of sulphur, we have this proportion \\( \\frac{100}{2} : 100 : : 1 : 2 = \\text{weight of an atom of sulphur.} \\)\n\nThe atom of silicon, which is a combustible substance analogous to charcoal, the base of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> called silica, is derived from the experiments of Berzelius, for which we refer to his mineralogical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSAY\">essay</a>, lately translated into English, as it would not be possible to make these experiments intelligible here, without entering into details, quite inconsistent with the nature of this article. These details will probably find a place under the article Chemistry, to which therefore we refer the reader.\n\n### 3.

The weights of the atoms of the metals inserted, have been taken from the best documents at present in possession of chemists. But we are far from supposing that they are all correct. Some have little better than analogical reasoning in their favour, while the weight of others is founded upon a law discovered by Berzelius relative to the salts; namely, that the oxygen in the acid of a neutral salt, is always a multiple of the oxygen in the base, by 2, 3, 4, 5, &c. and this number is always constant for every particular acid.\n\nThe weight of an atom of aluminum is calculated from the composition of alum. This salt is a combination of sulphate of potash and sulphate of alumina. Sulphuric acid is saturated by a quantity of base containing one third of the oxygen in the acid. Knowing the analysis of the salt, we obtain from this law the quantity of oxygen in a given weight of alumina. If we suppose alumina a compound of 1 atom aluminum, and 1 atom oxygen, the weight of an atom of aluminum will be as in the table. This hypothesis, however, is quite arbitrary. But it seems better to be satisfied with it at present, because we are not in possession of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATA\">data</a> to enable us to reason on the subject. The weight of the atoms of the bases of the alkaline earths, and earths proper, were ascertained by a similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of reasoning. They are smaller than the weights of those atoms assigned by Berzelius, because he conceives them to be united with more than one atom of oxygen. We have given, however, in the table, the weight of an atom of glucinium, as determined by Berzelius in a set of new experiments, which he has published as an appendix to his treatise on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINERALOGY\">mineralogy</a>, above referred to. The weights of the atom of potassium and sodium, are obtained from the experiments of Davy, and Gay-Lussac, and Thenard. It appears that potash is a compound of 100 potassium, and 20 oxygen, and peroxide of potassium of 100 potassium, and 60 oxygen. Hence the weight of an atom of potassium is obvious. Soda is composed of 100 sodium and 34.1 oxygen; peroxide of sodium of 100 sodium, and 51.1. Now 34.1 is to 51.1 as 2:3. Hence soda must contain 2 atoms of oxygen. For its weight therefore we have this proportion \\( \\frac{34.1}{2} : 100 : : 1 : 5.882 = \\text{weight of an atom of sodium.} \\)\n\nAmmonium is a problematic substance which never yet has been obtained in a separate state. But when a globule of mercury is moistened with ammonia, and acted on by a galvanic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATTERY\">battery</a>, the mercury is converted into an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMALGAM\">amalgam</a> of the consistence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a>, and not the fourth part of its original specific gravity. This fact cannot be explained any other way than by supposing ammonia to be a compound of oxygen, and an unknown metallic base which amalgamates with the mercury in the galvanic experiment. Analogy comes strongly in favour of this opinion. We are acquainted with nearly fifty bases which have the property of neutralizing acids, of which ammonia is one. Now it is known, that all the rest contain oxygen as a constituent. Hence, it would be singular if ammonia alone, of all\nthe bases, should constitute an exception to a general rule. There seems to be little doubt, that sal-ammoniac is a compound of chlorine and ammonium. This salt is formed by the union of equal volumes of muriatic acid gas, and ammoniacal gas. Hence, it consists of\n\nMuriatic acid - - 100\nAmmonia - - 46.178\n\nBy weight - - 146.178\n\nNow, muriatic acid is a compound of 75.731 chlorine, and 2.23 hydrogen. Therefore, 100 muriatic acid contain 2.86 hydrogen. We must suppose this hydrogen to find in the ammonia a quantity of oxygen capable of converting it into water. Now, 2.86 hydrogen require 21% oxygen to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> them into water. Therefore ammonia must be a compound of\n\nAmmonium 24.511 or 100.\nOxygen . . 21.666 88.39.\n\nNow, if ammonia be composed of 1 atom oxygen, and 1 atom ammonium, we have, for finding the weight of an atom of ammonium, this proportion:\n\n\\[ \\frac{21.666}{24.511} : 1 : 1.149 = \\text{weight of an atom of ammonium.} \\]\n\nThe weight of an atom of zinc is founded on Dr Thomson's analysis of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLENDE\">Blende</a> (Annals of Philosophy, IV. 89). It agrees almost exactly with the analysis of oxide of zinc by Berzelius. But Berzelius doubles the weight of an atom of zinc, by supposing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> of another oxide, containing less oxygen than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> oxide. But as this oxide has never been obtained nor examined by any one, we have no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to suppose its existence. The weight of an atom of tellurium is derived from the experiments of Berzelius. Its oxide, according to him, is composed of 100 tellurium + 24.83 oxygen.\n\nBerzelius (Annals of Philosophy, III. 101.) has shown that there are three oxides of chromium, the green, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a>, and chromic acid. The first contains 100 metal + 42.37 oxygen, while the acid is composed of 100 metal + 84.74 oxygen. These numbers are to each other as 1 to 2. As the brown oxide is intermediate, we must suppose the green oxide a compound of 1 atom metal + 2 atoms oxygen; the brown of 1 atom metal + 3 oxygen; and the acid of 1 atom metal + 4 atoms oxygen. This gives us the weight of an atom of chromium, stated in the table. But it would not be surprising if the brown oxide were merely a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> or combination of the green oxide and chromic acid. On that supposition the weight of an atom of chromium would be only 2.375.\n\nBerzelius has published an elaborate set of experiments on arsenic (Annals of Philosophy, III. 93.), in which he endeavours to prove that there are four oxides of arsenic, namely, 1. The black oxide, composed of 1 atom metal + 1 atom oxygen. 2. Salpable oxide of arsenic, composed of 1 atom metal + 3 atoms oxygen. 3. Arsenious acid, composed of 1 atom metal + 4 atoms oxygen; and, 4. Arsenic acid, composed of 1 atom metal + 6 atoms oxygen. But his experiments are too complicated, and his reasoning too hypothetical, to produce <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVICTION\">conviction</a>; especially as they appear inconsistent with the much simpler experiments of Proust, Thenard, Rose, Bucholz, and Thomson, from which it appears that 100 arsenic, when converted into arsenic acid, becomes 152.4. It was from this experiment of Dr Thomson that the weight of an atom of arsenic in the table was derived.\n\nThe weight of an atom of molybdenum is deduced from the experiments of Bucholz. He found two oxides of molybdenum, the blue and the white, composed of 100 metal united with 34 and 50 oxygen. Now 34 is to 50 as 2 to 3. Hence the first is a deuterioxide, and we have for the weight of molybdenum this proportion \\( \\frac{34}{2} : 100 :: 1 : 6.013 = \\text{weight of an atom of molybdenum.} \\)\n\nThere are four oxides of manganese, the green, the olive, the brown, and the black. The composition of these oxides is as follows:\n\n| Oxide | Metal | Oxygen |\n|-------|-------|--------|\n| 1st   | 100   | 14.0533|\n| 2d    | 100   | 28.107 |\n| 3d    | 100   | 42.16  |\n| 4th   | 100   | 56.213 |\n\nNow, the quantities of oxygen in these oxides are to each other as the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4. Hence the first is a protoxide; and for the weight of an atom of manganese we have this proportion \\( 14.0533 : 100 :: 1 : 6.833 = \\text{weight of an atom of manganese.} \\)\n\nIron forms two oxides, the black and the red. The first of these, according to the experiments of Dr Thomson, is composed of 100 metal + 28 oxygen, the second of 100 metal + 42 oxygen. Now 28 is to 42 as 2 to 3. Hence \\( \\frac{28}{2} : 100 :: 1 : 7.143 = \\text{weight of an atom of iron.} \\)\n\nNickel and cobalt agree with iron in being magnetic. They agree, likewise, in the number of oxides which they form, and almost in the proportion of oxygen with which they unite. Probably future experiments will show these proportions to be absolutely identical. At present it is believed, that the two oxides of nickel are composed as follows:\n\n| Oxide | Nickel | Oxygen |\n|-------|--------|--------|\n| 1st   | 100    | 27.6   |\n| 2d    | 100    | 41     |\n\nwhile those of cobalt consist of\n\n| Oxide | Cobalt | Oxygen |\n|-------|--------|--------|\n| 1st   | 100    | 27.3   |\n| 2d    | 100    | 40.95  |\n\nThese slight differences in the proportion of oxygen occasion the difference between the weights of the atoms of these metals and that of iron.\n\nThere are two oxides of copper, the red and the black, composed of\nHence \\(12.5 : 100 :: 1 : 8\\) = weight of an atom of copper.\n\nBismuth forms only one oxide. A mean of the experiments of Thomson, Lagerhjelm, and John Davy, gives its composition 100 metal + 11.229. Hence the number in the table.\n\nThere is no metal so difficult to experiment on as antimony. Hence, notwithstanding the laborious efforts of many distinguished chemists, considerable uncertainty still exists, both respecting the number and the composition of its various oxides. Proust makes only two oxides of antimony: Thenard makes six, and Berzelius makes four. We think it safer, in the present state of our knowledge, to deduce the weight of an atom of antimony from the sulphuret, which can be analyzed with accuracy, than from the oxides, respecting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of which considerable doubts still remain. From the experiments of Dr Thomson (Annals of Philosophy, IV. 99.), it appears that sulphuret of antimony is composed of 100 metal + 35.556 sulphur. Now, supposing it a compound of 1 atom metal + 2 atoms sulphur, an atom of antimony will weigh 11.249.\n\nThe weight of an atom of cerium is founded on the experiments of Hisinger, which may be seen in the Annals of Philosophy, IV. 355.\n\nBueholz has shown that there are two oxides of uranium, the black and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a>; the first composed of 100 metal + 8.333 oxygen, the second of 100 metal + 25 oxygen. These numbers are to each other as 1 to 3. Hence 8.333 : 100 :: 1 : 12 = weight of an atom of uranium.\n\nBerzelius has shown (Annals of Philosophy, III. 244), that there are two oxides of tungsten, brown oxide, and tungstic acid. The first is composed of 100 metal + 16.5 oxygen, the second of 100 metal + 24.75 oxygen. Now 16.5 is to 24.75 as 2 to 3.\n\nTherefore \\(\\frac{16.5}{2} : 100 :: 1 : 12 : 121 =\\) weight of an atom of tungsten.\n\nBerzelius obtained two oxides of platinum. The first composed of 100 metal + 8.287 oxygen, the second of 100 metal + 16.36. Now 8.287 is to 16.36 as 1 to 2. Therefore 8.287 : 100 :: 1 : 12.161 = weight of an atom of platinum.\n\nSilver forms only one oxide, and it parts with its oxygen so easily, that it is very difficult to determine the proportion of oxygen with which it unites. The number in the table is derived from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORN\">horn</a>-silver, which is known to be a compound of 100 chlorine and 304.89 silver. This gives us the weight of an atom of silver 13.714, and the oxide of silver, a compound of 100 silver + 7.291 oxygen.\n\nBerzelius could form only one oxide of palladium. It was brown, and composed of 100 metal + 14.209 oxygen. If we suppose this a deutoxide, which is probable, then we have \\(\\frac{14.209}{2} : 100 :: 1 : 14.075 =\\) weight of an atom of palladium.\n\nProust first proved that tin forms three oxides. According to Berzelius, the first oxide is composed of 100 metal + 13.6 oxygen, and the peroxide of 100 metal + 27.2. As there is an intermediate oxide, we cannot avoid concluding that the first oxide is a compound of 1 atom metal + 2 atoms oxygen. For the oxygen in the peroxide is just double that in the first oxide. Therefore for an atom of tin we have this proportion, \\(\\frac{13.6}{2} : 100 :: 1 : 14.705 =\\) weight of an atom of tin.\n\nBerzelius has shown that there are three oxides of rhodium. The first, constituting the base of the muriate, is composed of 100 metal + 6.71 oxygen. The second of a fleck brown <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, obtained by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, is composed of 100 metal + 13.42 oxygen. The third is red, and is obtained by precipitation from the soda-muriate. It contains more oxygen than either of the other two (Annals of Philosophy, III. 252.). We have therefore 6.71 : 100 :: 1 : 14.903 = weight of an atom of rhodium.\n\nThe weight of an atom of titanium, given in the table, is not much to be depended on. It is the number given by Berzelius from an experiment of Richter (Annals of Philosophy, III. 251.), and is merely inserted for want of better data.\n\nTo the indefatigable industry and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> of Berzelius, we are indebted for our knowledge of the composition of the oxides of gold. His mode of proceeding was not quite beyond the reach of objection, though perhaps, upon the whole, the best that he could have had recourse to, with the prospect of an answer to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a> which he was investigating. A determinate quantity of gold was dissolved in nitromuriatic acid, and thus converted into yellow oxide or peroxide of gold. He ascertained how much mercury was necessary to precipitate this gold in the metallic state. This portion of mercury united with all the oxygen of the gold. Now, as the composition of oxide of mercury is known, it was easy to determine how much oxygen had been united with the gold. By <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> the muriate of gold to heat, its nature was altered, and another oxide of gold formed, containing less oxygen. When water is poured upon this substance, two-thirds of the gold are reduced, and the other third converted into yellow oxide. Hence this new oxide contained only the third part of the oxygen in the yellow oxide. The yellow oxide was composed of 100 gold + 12.077 oxygen. Hence, the protioxide consisted of 100 gold + 4.026 oxygen. Now 4.026 : 100 :: 1 : 24.338 = weight of an atom of gold.\n\nThe weight of an atom of mercury, is taken from the experiments of Thenard, and Fourcroy, and Sefstrom. The mean of these give us black oxide of mercury, composed of 100 mercury + 4 oxygen, and red oxide of 100 mercury + 8 oxygen.\n\nThere are three oxides of lead, the yellow, the red, and the brown; the first composed of 100 metal + 7.7 oxygen, the second of 100 metal + 11.55 oxygen, and the third of 100 metal + 15.4 oxygen. Now 7.7, 11.55, and 15.4, are to each other as the numbers 2, 3, 4. Therefore, the yellow oxide con-\ntains two atoms of oxygen, and we have \\( \\frac{7.7}{2} : 100 :: 1 : 1 \\).\n\n\\( 25.974 = \\) weight of an atom of lead.\n\nSuch are the weights of the atoms of the simple substances, and such the documents upon which these weights are founded. The importance of these weights will best appear by giving a view of the compounds which these bodies form with each other.\n\n### III. Weight of the Integrant Particles of Primary Compounds.\n\nThe primary compounds being very numerous, we shall, for the sake of distinctness, subdivide them under different heads.\n\n#### 1. Compounds of the Simple Combustibles with Oxygen.\n\n| Substances          | Number of Atoms | Weight of an Integrant Particle |\n|---------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------|\n| Water               | 1a + 1o         | 1'125                           |\n| Boracic acid        | 1b + 2a         | 2'733                           |\n| Carbonic oxide      | 1c + 1o         | 1'750                           |\n| Carbonic acid       | 1c + 2o         | 2'750                           |\n| Phosphorous acid    | 1p + 1o         | 2'625                           |\n| Phosphoric acid     | 1p + 2o         | 3'625                           |\n| Nitrous oxide       | 1a + 1o         | 2'750                           |\n| Nitrous gas         | 1a + 2o         | 3'750                           |\n| Nitrous acid        | 1a + 3o         | 4'750                           |\n| Nitric acid         | 1a + 3o         | 6'750                           |\n| Sulphurous acid     | 1s + 2o         | 4'000                           |\n| Sulphuric acid      | 1s + 3o         | 5'000                           |\n| Silica              | 1s + 2o         | 6'000                           |\n\nWater is composed of two measures of hydrogen gas, united to one measure of oxygen. The reasons for considering it as a compound of 1 atom hydrogen, and 1 atom oxygen, have been already stated.\n\nBoracic acid is conceived to contain two atoms of oxygen, because this is the case with carbonic acid, and the analogy between carbon and boron is very striking.\n\nIf 100 measures of carbonic oxide be mixed with 50 measures of oxygen gas, and the mixture be fired by electricity, the result will be 100 measures of carbonic acid. If charcoal be burnt on 100 measures of oxygen gas, the bulk is not altered, but the oxygen is changed into carbonic acid. From these facts, it is obvious that the oxygen in carbonic oxide, combined with a given quantity of carbon, is just half of that in carbonic acid combined with the same quantity of carbon. Hence the first must be a compound of 1 atom carbon + 1 atom oxygen; the second of 1 atom carbon + 2 atoms oxygen. The weights in the table correspond exactly with the analysis of these two substances.\n\nSeveral of the compounds of azote and oxygen have been analyzed with great care; namely, nitrous oxide, nitrous gas, and nitric acid; and the results coincide with the numbers given in the table. Nitrous acid is merely given from theory. It has not hitherto been possible to analyze it.\n\nSulphurous acid was first analyzed by Dr Thom-\n\nson, who showed that it contained two-thirds of the oxygen in sulphuric acid. It seems demonstrated by the experiments of Klaproth, Berzelius, &c. that sulphuric acid is a compound of 100 sulphur + 150 oxygen. Therefore sulphurous acid must be composed of 100 sulphur + 100 oxygen, and the composition of both must be as in the table.\n\nThe composition of silica is taken from the experiments and calculations of Berzelius, and depends chiefly upon analogical reasoning.\n\n#### 2. Compounds of the Simple Combustibles with each other.\n\n| Number of Atoms | Weight of an Integrant Particle |\n|-----------------|--------------------------------|\n| Olefiant gas    | 1c + 1h                        | 0.875 |\n| Carbureted hydrogen | 1c + 2h                      | 1.000 |\n| Hydrophosphoric gas | 1p + 2h                     | 1.875 |\n| Phosphureted hydrogen | 1p + 4h                    | 2.125 |\n| Ammonia         | 1a + 3h                        | 2.125 |\n| Sulphureted hydrogen | 1s + 1h                   | 2.125 |\n| Sulphuret of carbon | 1c + 2s                  | 4.750 |\n\nOlefiant gas requires for complete combustion three times its bulk of oxygen gas, and forms twice its bulk of carbonic oxide; carbureted hydrogen requires twice its bulk of oxygen, and forms its own bulk of carbonic acid. Hence, it is obvious, that supposing the quantity of hydrogen the same in both, the carbon in olefiant gas, is just double that in carbureted hydrogen. We might have conceived carbureted hydrogen to be a compound of 1 atom hydrogen, and 1 atom carbon, and olefiant gas of 1 atom hydrogen, and 2 atoms carbon. But the reasons assigned by Mr Dalton, have induced us to adopt the composition in the table, which comes in fact to the very same thing.\n\nThe two gases which are composed of phosphorus and hydrogen, have not been hitherto analyzed. But it appears from Davy that the specific gravity of the first is double that of the second. Davy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> his hydrophosphoric gas to be composed of 100 hydrogen by weight, and 489.56 phosphorus. The numbers in the table are founded on these data; though they do not quite correspond.\n\nAmmonia, by electricity, may be resolved into 3 measures of hydrogen, and 1 measure of azote. 300 cubic inches of hydrogen gas weigh 6.69 grains, and 100 cubic inches of azotic gas weigh 29.56 grams. Now \\( \\frac{6.69}{29.56} : 0.132 \\times 3 : 1.704 = \\) weight of an atom of azote very nearly.\n\nWe have given the data upon which the composition of sulphureted hydrogen is founded in a preceding part of this article. It is therefore unnecessary to repeat them here.\n\nSulphuret of carbon was analyzed by Berzelius and Marcat, who found it a compound of 84.85 sulphur, and 15.17 carbon. The composition of this substance, as given in the table, supposes it a compound of 84.2 sulphur + 15.8 carbon; numbers which may be considered as identical with the preceding, since the difference is within the limits of the unavoidable errors of experiment.\nThis table contains all the metallic oxides at present known, which are 62 in number. We have omitted a few which Thenard has admitted into his *System of Chemistry*, just published; but which do not seem to be supported by sufficiently strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a>, to induce us to admit their existence. The same remark applies to some of the oxides of Gay-Lussac and Thenard; and, perhaps, also to some of the oxides of Berzelius. In short, we have admitted no primary compound into our tables, the existence of which is not demonstrated by the clearest evidence. For the loose admission of hypothetical bodies seems to us injurious, rather than beneficial to the progress of the science.\n\nAlumina, Magnesia, Lime, Zirconia, Strontian, Yttria, Barytes, are supposed compounds of 1 atom base, and 1 atom oxygen; because we do not know any other compounds which these bases form with oxygen; and, therefore, have no data to reason on the subject. Their composition has been calculated from the composition of the sulphates of alumina, magnesia, lime, zirconia, strontian, yttria, barytes, the constitution of which will be shown in a subsequent part of this article. The calculation was made, on the supposition, that the quantity of each base which saturates a given weight of sulphuric acid, contains just one-third of the oxygen in the acid: a law which holds, in every case, in which we have it in our power to verify it.\n\nAmmonia, in the present state of the sciences, is an enigmatical substance. We have given before a view of its composition, on the supposition, that it is a compound of hydrogen and azote. Here, its composition is seen on the supposition that it is a compound of ammonium and oxygen. Both analyses seem demonstrated. The seeming inconsistency will vanish, whenever it can be shown that azote is a compound of hydrogen and oxygen.\n\nPotash, peroxide of potash, soda, peroxide of soda, are given according to the experiments of Davy, and Gay-Lussac, and Thenard. The French chemists admit an oxide of potassium and sodium, containing each less oxygen than exists in potash and soda. But the existence of these supposed oxides is not made out in a satisfactory manner. For anything that appears to the contrary, their oxides may be mixtures of potash and potassium, soda and sodium.\n\nIn stating the weights of the atoms of the metals, we have noticed the most accurate experiments hitherto made, to determine the number and composition of the different metallic oxides; and it does not seem necessary to resume the subject here. If the reader be at the trouble to make the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>, he will find, that the numbers in the table agree very correctly with the best results of the analysis of the metallic oxides hitherto obtained. Hence there can be no doubt, that at least a considerable part of the table is accurate.\nAccording to the experiments of Dr Thomson (Annals of Philosophy, IV. 94.), sulphuret of zinc is composed of 100 metal + 48.84 sulphur. Hence the numbers in the table which have been derived from that analysis.\n\nThe composition of sulphuret of tellurium is derived from an experiment of Davy. He found, that tellurium united by fusion with nearly its own weight of sulphur. Hence it ought to combine with two atoms. Analogy, however, is against this conclusion. In all other cases, when a metal forms only one oxide, its sulphuret contains only one atom of sulphur. Hence the composition of sulphuret of tellurium, as stated in the table, is very doubtful.\n\nThe composition of sulphuret of potassium is derived from the experiments of Davy. Sulphuret of sodium is stated from the following analogy, having never been analyzed. Berzelius has shown, that all the sulphurets, when treated with nitric acid, are converted into neutral sulphates, without any redundancy of acid or base. Therefore, sulphuret of sodium, by this treatment, would be converted into sulphate of soda. But sulphate of soda is composed of 2 integrant particles of sulphuric acid, and 1 integrant particle of soda. Therefore, sulphuret of sodium must be composed of 2 atoms sulphur, and 1 atom sodium.\n\nFrom the experiments of Laugier it appears, that sulphuret of arsenic is composed of 42 sulphur + 58 arsenic. According to him, it is often mixed with an excess of arsenic, which occasions the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> variability in its composition. The experiments of Proust and Thenard do not agree well with those of Laugier. Hence the subject cannot be considered as completely cleared up.\n\nSulphuret of manganese is derived from an experiment of Vauquelin, who found that 74.8 manganese united with 25.5 of sulphur by heat.\n\nBucholz found sulphuret of molybdenum composed of 60 molybdenum + 40 sulphur. Hence its constitution as stated in the table.\n\nThe two sulphurets of iron were first analyzed by Hatchett, and the table is conformable to the results of that analysis. We consider the late speculations of Stromeyer on magnetic pysites as erroneous.\n\nNickel and cobalt have so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> an analogy to iron in their combinations, that it is reasonable to expect that the sulphurets will also correspond. Hence the reason for considering these sulphurets as compounds of one atom metal and two atoms sulphur. This statement likewise approaches nearest to the results obtained by Proust.\n\nIt has been ascertained that 100 copper combine with 25 sulphur. This coincides exactly with the statement in the table.\n\nJohn Davy has shown that 67.5 bismuth unite with 15.08 sulphur. Lagerhjelm found that 100 bismuth unite with 22.52 sulphur. Both of these statements coincide sufficiently with the table.\n\nFrom the analysis of sulphuret of antimony by Dr Thomson (Annals of Philosophy, IV. 99.), we learn, that it is a compound of 100 metal + 35.556 sulphur. With this analysis the statement in the table exactly coincides.\nBerzelius informs us, that 100 platinum combine with 32.8 sulphur. Now \\( \\frac{108}{32.8} : \\frac{12.161}{3.098} = 2 \\) atoms of sulphur very nearly.\n\nAccording to Berzelius, 100 sulphur combine with 14.9 sulphur. Now \\( \\frac{100}{14.9} : \\frac{13.714}{2.043} = 1 \\) atom of sulphur very nearly.\n\nSulphuret of palladium has not been analyzed; but, as palladium forms only one oxide, we may, without much risk of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>, consider the sulphuret as a compound of 1 atom metal and 1 atom sulphur.\n\nFrom the experiments of Dr Davy it appears, that mosaic gold contains just double the quantity of sulphuret in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> sulphuret of tin. According to the experiments of the same chemist, protosulphuret of tin is a compound of 55 tin + 15 sulphur. Now \\( \\frac{55}{15} : \\frac{14.705}{4.015} = 2 \\) atoms of sulphur very nearly.\n\nOberkampf has shown, that the sulphuret of gold is composed of 100 gold + 24.39 sulphur. Now \\( \\frac{100}{24.39} : \\frac{24.838}{6.057} = 3 \\) atoms of sulphur very nearly.\n\nAccording to the experiments of Sefstrom, black sulphuret of mercury is composed of 100 metal + 8.005 sulphur; and red sulphuret of 100 metal + 16.01 sulphur. Now \\( \\frac{100}{8.005} : \\frac{25}{2.001} \\) and \\( \\frac{100}{16.001} : \\frac{25}{4.002} \\). But 2.001 and 4.002 are obviously equal respectively to 1 atom and 2 atoms of sulphur.\n\nGalena is a compound of 100 lead + 15.42 sulphur. Now \\( \\frac{100}{15.42} : \\frac{25.974}{4.005} = 2 \\) atoms of sulphur. Sir John Sinclair found a variety of galena in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CAITHNESS\">Caithness</a>, which burned with a blue <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> when held to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a>. It was analyzed by Dr Thomson, and found to contain double the quantity of sulphur in common galena. Hence it was a compound of 1 atom lead and 3 atoms sulphur. This variety must be scarce, for it has never been noticed by mineralogists.\n\nSuch are the sulphurets with the composition of which we are at present acquainted. A good number are of necessity omitted, because they have never been analyzed by chemists. It would be easy to state the composition of most of these from theory. But we do not see any advantage that would result to the science from such theoretical statements, unsupported by experiment.\n\nNeither the phosphurets nor carburets have been examined with such precision as to enable us to exhibit their composition in a table. It is probable that the phosphurets are analogous to sulphurets. But certainly no such analogy holds with the carburets and silicarrets; both of which exist, though they have been hitherto too slightly examined to give us any exact notions of their constitution. Carbon seems to combine with a great number of atoms of iron, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> iron, and with a still greater number in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a>.\n\n5. Organic Bodies.\n\nHitherto the only correct analysis of organic bodies are those made by Berzelius, and published in the fifth volume of the Annals of Philosophy. As these experiments are so recent as not to be generally known, we shall state in the table the results of each analysis, and likewise the number of atoms of which the body is composed.\n\n| Constituents | Atoms | Weight | Atomic Theory |\n|--------------|-------|--------|---------------|\n| Citric acid  | oxygen | 55.096 | 2             |\n|              | carbon | 41.270 | 2             |\n|              | hydrogen | 3.634 | 1             |\n| Tartaric acid| oxygen | 60.213 | 10            |\n|              | carbon | 35.980 | 8             |\n|              | hydrogen | 3.807 | 5             |\n| Oxalic acid  | oxygen | 66.534 | 12            |\n|              | carbon | 33.292 | 8             |\n|              | hydrogen | 0.244 | 1             |\n| Succinic acid| oxygen | 47.888 | 3             |\n|              | carbon | 47.600 | 4             |\n|              | hydrogen | 4.512 | 2             |\n| Acetic acid  | oxygen | 46.832 | 3             |\n|              | carbon | 46.833 | 4             |\n|              | hydrogen | 6.35  | 3             |\n| Gallic acid  | oxygen | 38.02  | 3             |\n|              | carbon | 56.96  | 6             |\n|              | hydrogen | 5.02  | 5             |\n| Saccharic acid| oxygen | 61.465 | 8             |\n|              | carbon | 33.430 | 6             |\n|              | hydrogen | 5.105 | 5             |\n| Benzoic acid | oxygen | 20.43  | 3             |\n|              | carbon | 74.41  | 15            |\n|              | hydrogen | 5.16  | 6             |\n| Tannin from Nutgalls | oxygen | 44.654 | 4             |\n|              | carbon | 51.160 | 6             |\n|              | hydrogen | 4.186 | 3             |\n| Common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a> | oxygen | 49.015 | 20            |\n|              | carbon | 44.200 | 24            |\n|              | hydrogen | 6.785 | 21            |\n| Sugar of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>| oxygen | 53.359 | 8             |\n|              | carbon | 39.474 | 10            |\n|              | hydrogen | 7.167 | 8             |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUM\">Gum</a> Arabic   | oxygen | 51.306 | 12            |\n|              | carbon | 41.906 | 13            |\n|              | hydrogen | 6.788 | 12            |\n\n100,000 37\nFor the way in which these experiments were made, we refer to the original paper of Berzelius, quoted above. We have no doubt that the results are very near approximations to the truth, though some slight corrections may perhaps be necessary. The great number of atoms that enter into the composition of some of these bodies is very remarkable. We would find it difficult to explain the nature of such combinations, without having recourse to some hypothesis respecting the nature of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTICITY\">elasticity</a>. Twelve atoms of oxygen, and 13 of hydrogen, in a compound possessed of so little elasticity as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-POTATO\">potato</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STARCH\">starch</a>, is very extraordinary. The old opinion of Dr Black and his contemporaries was, that bodies owe their elasticity to a quantity of heat combined with them. Of course, when the heat is separated, the elasticity disappears. Were we to suppose, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONFORMITY\">conformity</a> with this hypothesis, that the oxygen and hydrogen which exists in organized bodies, are deprived of the heat requisite to give them the elastic form, there would be no difficulty in understanding how so many atoms unite together, and have no tendency to separate, and how the compound is so speedily decomposed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> of heat, or by combustion.\n\nThus, we have gone over all the primary compounds which have been subjected to examination by chemists, without finding a single exception to the atomic theory. On the contrary, the great and unexpected elucidation which this theory throws upon the nature of chemical combinations, is highly pleasing. The simplicity of the proportions in which the atoms of unorganic matter unite, is equally delightful and astonishing, and throws a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a> around the science, hitherto conversant in minute and apparently unconnected combinations, fully equal to what distinguishes the sublimest branch of mechanical philosophy. The operations of nature are everywhere equally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a>, and regulated by general principles equally simple and luminous, whether we examine the laws which regulate the motions of the solar system, or the minutest compound to be found in the terrestrial globe. Let us now examine the secondary compounds, that we may be able to judge how far they come under the dominion of the Atomic Theory.\n\nIV. Composition of Secondary Compounds.\n\nHere, our task is much more difficult, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a> in a great measure unexplored, or only partially so. The secondary compounds are very numerous, amounting to several thousands. Accurate chemical analysis cannot be dated farther back than a few years. A correct knowledge of the whole of these compounds, therefore, is not to be expected. But, from the indefatigable zeal, uncommon accuracy, and gigantic industry of Berzelius, we have it in our power to examine the composition of many genera of salts with considerable precision; supposing always that the laws which he has pointed out respecting the combination of acids and bases be precise. We shall continue the method which we adopted when treating of the primary compounds; namely, exhibit tables of the composition of the different genera of secondary compounds, and then give the documents on which these tables were founded.\n\n1. Hydrates.\n\n| Number of Atoms | Weight of an Integrant Particle |\n|-----------------|--------------------------------|\n| 169 Hydrate of potash | 1 p + 1 w = 7.125 |\n| 170 Hydrate of soda | 1 s + 2 w = 10.125 |\n| 171 Hydrate of lime | 1 l + 1 w = 4.750 |\n| 172 Hydrate of barytes | 1 b + 1 w = 10.875 |\n| 173 Hydrate of strontian | 1 st + 1 w = 7.725 |\n| 174 Hydrate of magnesia | 2 m + 1 w = 6.125 |\n| 175 Hydrate of alumina | 1 a + 1 w = 3.250 |\n| 176 Hydrate of glucina | 1 g + 1 w = 10.965 |\n| 177 Hydrate of yttria | 1 y + 3 w = 11.750 |\n| 178 Hydrate of zirconia | 1 z + 1 w = 6.750 |\n| 179 Hydrate of silica | 1 si + 1 w = 3.125 |\n| 180 Hydro-sulphuric acid, or acid of 1.85 | 1 s + 1 w = 6.125 |\n| 181 2d hydrate of sulphuric acid, or acid of 1.780 | 1 s + 2 w = 7.250 |\n| 182 3d hydrate of sulphuric acid, or acid of 1.65 | 1 s + 3 w = 8.375 |\n| 183 Hydronitric acid, or acid of 1.62 | 2 n + 1 w = 14.625 |\n| 184 2d hydrate of nitric acid, or acid of 1.54 | 1 n + 1 w = 7.875 |\n| 185 3d hydrate of nitric acid, or acid of 1.42 | 1 n + 2 w = 9.000 |\n| 186 4th hydrate of nitric acid, or acid of 1.350 | 1 n + 3 w = 10.125 |\n| 187 Hydrophosphorous acid | 2 p + 1 w = 6.375 |\n| 188 Hydrate of boracic acid | 1 b + 2 w = 4.997 |\n| 189 Hydrate of peroxide of copper | 1 c + 1 w = 11.125 |\n| 190 Hydrate of black oxide of iron | 1 i + 1 w = 10.240 |\n| 191 Hydrate of red oxide of iron | 1 i + 1 w = 11.240 |\n| 192 Hydrate of deutoxide of tin | 1 t + 1 w = 17.875 |\n| 193 Hydrate of peroxide of tin | 1 t + 1 w = 19.875 |\n| 194 Hydrate of deutoxide of nickel | 1 n + 3 w = 12.701 |\n| 195 Hydrate of deutoxide of cobalt | 1 c + 1 w = 11.458 |\n| 196 Hydrate of protoxide of manganese | 1 m + 1 w = 9.250 |\n| 197 Hydrate of oxide of arsenic | 1 o + 1 w = 7.125 |\n| 198 Hydrate of antimony | 2 a + 1 w = 31.625 |\n| 199 Hydrate of oxalic acid | 1 o + 12 w = 31.724 |\n| 200 Hydrate of tartaric acid | 1 t + 2 w = 18.932 |\n| 201 Hydrate of citric acid | 2 c + 3 w = 10.664 |\n\nVOL. I. PART II.\nBy hydrate of potash is understood caustic potash, that has been exposed to a red heat. For it is well known, that the whole water cannot be expelled from potash by heat. The statement in the table supposes this hydrate to be composed of 100 potash + 18.867 water. Now Davy, by heating potash and boracic acid together, actually separated between 17 and 18 water. Berzelius obtained 16 per cent., which is very near the exact quantity. For if our determination be correct, 100 potash ought to contain 15.872 water.\n\nHydrate of soda has never been analyzed. The number in the table is given from this analogy. Berzelius has shown, that the hydrates of the salifiable bases, are in fact salts, the water acting the part of an acid, and saturating the base. Now, in all the salts of soda hitherto examined, 1 integrant particle of the soda is always combined with 2 integrant particles of acid. We suppose the same thing to hold with water.\n\nSlacked lime, which is the hydrate, according to the experiments of Lavoisier, is composed of 100 lime + 28.7 water; according to Dalton, of 100 lime + 33.333 water. The mean of these two results gives the statement in the table almost precisely.\n\nThe experiments of Berthollet and Berzelius prove, that hydrate of barytes is a compound of 100 barytes + 12.121 water. The statement in the table supposes it a compound of 100 barytes + 11.632, which coincides very nearly.\n\nHydrate of strontian is given merely from analogy. Crystallized strontian is a compound of 1 particle strontian + 13 particles of water.\n\nAccording to Davy, hydrate of magnesia contains one-fifth of its weight of water. Hence the statement in the table. Probably there may be another hydrate composed of 1 integrant particle magnesia, and 1 integrant particle water, but which cannot be obtained in a separate state.\n\nWavelite, which is a native hydrate of alumina, is composed of 74 alumina + 26 water. Hence the composition of the hydrate in the table.\n\nHydrate of glucina has never been analyzed. According to Klaproth, hydrate of yttria is composed of 69 yttria + 31 water. According to Davy, zirconia, when in the state of a hydrate, contains more than one-fifth of its weight of water.\n\nHydrate of silica has never been analyzed. But silica absorbs about one-fourth of its weight of water.\n\nThe hydrate of sulphuric and nitric acids were determined by Mr Dalton. Sulphuric acid of 1.85 is the strongest that can be made. It is composed of 100 real acid + 22.64 water. The second hydrate is composed of 100 acid + 45.28 water. It freezes at the temperature of 42\u00b0. It was upon it that Mr Keir made his experiments.\n\nThe hydrate of phosphorous acid was determined by Sir Humphry Davy. See his Elements of Chemical Philosophy, p. 289.\n\nDavy found hydrate of boracic acid composed of 57 acid + 43 water. Now, this agrees very nearly with the statement in the table.\n\nHydrate of peroxide of copper is obtained by precipitating the sulphate or nitrate of copper, by means of an alkali. It is a blue powder composed, according to Davy, of 9 peroxide of copper + 1 water. This agrees nearly with the statement in the table.\n\nAccording to Berzelius, when iron is kept in water, a hydrate is formed, composed of 128 parts of black oxide of iron + 15.866 water. Now, this coincides almost exactly with 1 integrant particle of black oxide, 1 integrant particle of water.\n\nHydrate of the red oxide of iron is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">orange</a> powder obtained from persulphate of iron by an alkali. It has never been analyzed.\n\nThe hydrate of deutoxide of tin, is the white powder obtained by precipitating the recent solution of tin in muriatic acid. According to Proust, it is composed of 95 oxide + 5 water. This approaches most nearly to the statement in the table. The other hydrate of tin has never been analyzed.\n\nThe hydrate of nickel is a green powder obtained by precipitating sulphate of nickel by an alkali. According to Davy, more than one-fourth of its weight is water. This statement approaches most nearly to the supposition, that it contains 3 particles of water + 1 oxide of nickel.\n\nThe hydrates of cobalt, manganese, and arsenic, have never been analyzed. They are stated merely from analogy.\n\nAccording to Berzelius, the tritoxide of antimony forms a hydrate composed of 95.22 oxide + 4.78 water. This approaches most nearly to the statement in the table; but does not agree with it.\n\nThe hydrates of oxalic acid, tartaric acid, and citric acid, were determined by Berzelius. Crystallized oxalic acid is composed of 58 acid + 42 water; crystallized tartaric acid of 58.75 acid, and + 11.25 water; and crystallized citric acid of 100 acid + 20.5 water. These proportions coincide with the statements in the table very nearly.\n\nThus, it appears that the composition of the hydrates, as far as they have been examined, agree perfectly with the atomic theory. We see, likewise, that the number of particles of water which enter into combination with other bodies is not confined within such narrow limits as most of the other primary compounds are. In many hydrates, only a single particle of water is found; while, in others, no fewer than 12 particles exist.\n\nLet us now proceed to examine the salts, in order to judge how far their composition is regulated by the laws of the atomic theory.\n\n2. Salts.\n\nThe salts are very numerous, and have been divided into as many genera as there are acids entering into their composition. Some of these genera have been carefully analyzed, while others still remain in a great measure unknown.\n\n**<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENUS\">Genus</a> I.\u2014Sulphates.**\n\n| Number of Atoms | Weight of an Integrant Particle |\n|-----------------|--------------------------------|\n| 202 Sulphate of potash | 1 s + 1 p = 11.000 |\n| 203 Bisulphate of potash | 2 s + 1 p = 16.000 |\nDr Thomson found sulphate of potash composed of 42.2 acid + 50.1 potash, which corresponds with the tabular statement almost exactly. Dr Wollaston has shown, that the bisulphate contains just double the acid in the sulphate.\n\nSulphate of soda, according to Wenzel, is composed of 100 acid + 78.32 base; according to Berzelius, of 100 acid + 79.34. The tabular statement supposes a combination of 100 acid + 78.82 soda. Now, this is the mean of the two experiments.\n\nAccording to Berzelius, sulphate of ammonia is composed of 100 acid + 42.561 ammonia. Now 100:42.561::5:2.128 = weight of an integrant particle of ammonia very nearly.\n\nAccording to Berzelius, sulphate of magnesia is composed of 100 acid + 50.06 magnesia. Now 100:50.06::5:2.508 = weight of an integrant particle of magnesia very nearly.\n\nSulphate of lime, according to the analysis of Berzelius, is composed of 100 acid + 72.41 base. Now,\n\n\\[ 100:72.41::5:3.620 = \\text{weight of an integrant particle of lime almost exactly.} \\]\n\nSulphate of barytes, according to the analysis of Berzelius, is composed of 100 acid + 194 barytes. Now 100:194::5:9.700 = weight of an atom of barytes very nearly.\n\nThe weight of an integrant particle of strontian was deduced from an accurate analysis of carbonate of strontian, which was found to consist of 29.9 carbonic acid + 70.1 strontian.\n\nAccording to Berzelius's analysis, sulphate of alumina is composed of 100 acid + 42.722 alumina. It was from this analysis, that the weight of an integrant particle of alumina was determined. Of course, the statement in the table must coincide with it entirely.\n\nThe sulphates of yttria, glucina, and zirconia, have not hitherto been analyzed. Their composition is stated merely from analogy.\n\nAlum, according to the experiments of Berzelius, is composed of\n\n- Sulphuric acid: 34.33\n- Alumina: 10.86\n- Potash: 9.81\n- Water: 45.00\n\nNow, this will be found to consist of an integrant particle of sulphate of potash, combined with five integrant particles of sulphate of alumina.\n\nSulphate of potash and ammonia is a compound of 1 integrant particle of sulphate of potash, and 1 integrant particle of sulphate of ammonia. All the other triple salts are formed in the same way, by the combination of 1 integrant particle of 1 salt, with 1 or more integrant particles of another salt. Sulphate of potash and magnesia consists of 1 integrant particle of sulphate of potash, united with 2 integrant particles of sulphate of magnesia; sulphate of soda and ammonia is composed of 1 integrant particle of sulphate of soda, united with 6 integrant particles of sulphate of ammonia; sulphate of soda and magnesia of 1 integrant particle of sulphate of soda, and 3 integrant particles of sulphate of magnesia; and sulphate of magnesia and ammonia of 2 integrant particles of sulphate of magnesia, and 1 integrant particle of sulphate of ammonia.\n\nAs an atom of sulphuric acid weighs 5, and an atom of black oxide of copper 10, it is obvious that if sulphate of copper contains 2 particles of acid, and 1 of oxide, the weight of the two constituents must be equal. Now, according to Proust, the salt is composed of 33 acid + 32 base; according to Berzelius of 49.1 acid + 50.9 oxide. The mean of these two experiments gives us the salt composed of 100 acid + 100.317 base, which almost coincides with theory. According to Proust, the subsulphate of copper is composed of 18 acid + 68 oxide. Now 5:10 \u00d7 2 :: 18:72, this does not differ much from the analysis, if we consider the difficulty in getting the salt quite pure, and in a proper state for examination.\n\nSulphate of iron, according to the analysis of Ber-\nAccording to Berzelius, sulphate of silver is composed of 25.78 acid + 74.22 oxide. Now 5:14:714 :: 25.78:75.865, which corresponds with the analysis very nearly.\n\nLagerhjelm found sulphate of bismuth composed of 33.647 acid + 66.653 oxide. Now, this corresponds almost exactly with the statement in the table.\n\nAccording to Tapputi, sulphate of nickel is composed of 100 acid + 87.266. Now, this does not differ very much from the statement in the table, which supposes the salt composed of 100 acid + 93.05 oxide.\n\nAccording to the analysis of Rolhoff, sulphate of cobalt is composed of 52.11 acid + 47.89 oxide. If the statement in the table be correct, it will be composed of 51.744 acid + 48.256 oxide. Now, this may be considered as agreeing with the analysis, since the difference is within the limits of the unavoidable errors of experiment.\n\nAccording to John, sulphate of manganese is composed of 100 acid + 91.326 protoxide. Dr Thomson lately analyzed this salt, and obtained for its constituents 100 acid + 71 protoxide. Now 100:71 :: 10:7.1; and 7.1 does not differ much from the weight of a particle of protoxide of manganese. The mean of the two experiments gives 8.113, which comes still nearer the true result.\n\nSulphate of uranium has hitherto been analyzed by Bucholz only. He makes it a compound of 22.1 acid + 77.9 peroxide. If the statement in the table be correct, as is probable, it ought to be a compound of 25 acid + 75 peroxide.\n\nThe persulphate of platinum, according to Berzelius, is composed of 41.223 acid + 58.777 peroxide. Supposing the tabular statement correct, it ought to be a compound of 41.389 acid + 58.611 peroxide. Now, this is identical with the experimental result of Berzelius.\n\nThus we have gone over the sulphates, the genus of salts, which has been most accurately examined, and have found the whole of them to correspond most accurately with the atomic theory. They all agree with Berzelius's law, that the oxygen in the acid is a multiple by a whole number of the oxygen in the base, except in the instance of subsulphate of iron. But perhaps his law was only meant to ap-\nply to the neutral salts, and not to the subsalts or supersalts. His law, that the oxygen in the acid amounts to three times the oxygen in the base, holds in all the neutral sulphates, except the persulphate of mercury, and sulphate of uranium; and neither of these salts can be considered as analyzed with such accuracy as to lay much stress upon their composition, as stated in the table. Let us now examine the carbonates, which are likewise pretty accurately known.\n\n**Genus II.\u2014Carbonates.**\n\n| Number of Atoms | Weight of an Integrant Particle |\n|-----------------|--------------------------------|\n| 237 Bicarbonate of potash | 2 c + 1 p 11.500 |\n| 238 Carbonate of potash | 1 c + 1 p 8.750 |\n| 239 Supercarbonate of soda | 3 c + 1 s 16.125 |\n| 240 Carbonate of soda | 2 c + 1 s 13.375 |\n| 241 Bicarbonate of ammonia | 2 c + 1 a 7.625 |\n| 242 Carbonate of ammonia | 1 c + 1 a 4.875 |\n| 243 Carbonate of lime | 1 c + 1 l 6.375 |\n| 244 Carbonate of barytes | 1 c + 1 b 12.500 |\n| 245 Carbonate of strontian | 1 c + 1 str 9.250 |\n| 246 Bicarbonate of magnesia | 2 c + 1 m 8.000 |\n| 247 Carbonate of magnesia | 1 c + 1 m 5.250 |\n| 248 Carbonate of yttria | 1 c + 1 y 11.151 |\n| 249 Carbonate of zirconia | 1 c + 1 z 8.375 |\n| 250 Carbonate of glucina | 1 c + 1 g 12.584 |\n| 251 Carbonate of silver | 1 c + 1 s 17.500 |\n| 252 Percarbonate of mercury | 1 c + 2 m 56.750 |\n| 253 Percarbonate of copper | 1 c + 1 cop 19.750 |\n| 254 Carbonate of iron | 2 c + 1 i 14.615 |\n| 255 Carbonate of nickel | 2 c + 1 n 14.805 |\n| 256 Carbonate of cobalt | 2 c + 1 cob 14.826 |\n| 257 Carbonate of lead | 2 c + 1 l 33.500 |\n| 258 Carbonate of zinc | 1 c + 1 z 7.845 |\n| 259 Carbonate of manganese | 2 c + 1 m 13.335 |\n| 260 Carbonate of cerium | 2 c + 1 ce 19.349 |\n| 261 Percarbonate of cerium | 3 c + 1 ce 23.100 |\n\nThe bicarbonate of potash is the common crystallized carbonate of the shops. If it be a compound of 2 integrant particles of carbonic acid, and 1 integrant particle of potash, it ought to consist of 47.835 acid + 52.165 base. Now, Berthelot obtained 47.64 acid + 52.36 base, a result which may be considered as quite identical with the theory, the difference being greatly within the limits of error from experiment. Dr Wollaston has shown, that the deliquescent carbonate contains just half the carbonic acid which exists in the bicarbonate.\n\nThe supercarbonate of soda is found native in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>, and may be formed artificially, by passing a current of carbonic acid gas through common carbonate of soda dissolved in water. According to the analysis of Klaproth, it is composed of 39 acid + 38 base. Now, the tabular statement supposes it a compound of 39 acid + 37.247 base. We have different analyses of the carbonate of soda; but they do not agree well with each other. Bergman obtained 16 acid + 20 base; Darcey 16.04 acid + 20.85 base; and Klaproth 16 acid + 22 base. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> is the most correct. According to the tabular statement, which must be correct, the salt ought to be a compound of 16 acid + 22.021 base.\n\nThe analysis of the ammoniacal salts is attended with such difficulties, that great exactness can hardly be expected, except in those cases when the acid has a gaseous form. It is then easy to determine the volume of ammoniacal gas capable of saturating a given volume of the acid gas. Carbonic acid being a gas, the composition ammoniacal carbonates may be determined with accuracy. Now, 100 measures of carbonic acid condense and neutralize 100 measures of ammoniacal gas. This will be found, on making the calculation, to be 2 integrant particles of carbonic acid, and 1 integrant particle of ammonia, constituting the first of the ammoniacal salts in the table. Fifty measures of carbonic acid are likewise capable of combining with 100 measures of ammoniacal gas, constituting the second ammoniacal salt in the table. It has not been proved that any other carbonate of ammonia exists.\n\nSupposing carbonate of lime a compound of 1 integrant particle of carbonic acid, and 1 integrant particle of lime, it should be a compound of 43.18 acid + 56.82 lime. Now, Dr Marcet obtained 43.9 acid + 56.1 base; and Dr Thomson, by a careful analysis of very pure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CALCAREOUS_SPAR\">calcareous <a c</a>lass=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAR\">spar</a>, obtained 43.2 acid + 56.8 base. This last result is almost the very same with the theoretical result.\n\nCarbonate of barytes, by the statement in the table, is a compound of 22.04 acid + 77.96 barytes. Now, Kirwan obtained 22 acid + 78 base; and Berzelius 21.6 acid + 78.4 base. Both of these results agree sufficiently with our theoretical result; the first, indeed, coincides with it.\n\nThe analyses of carbonate of strontian hitherto made cannot be expected to agree completely with our theoretical statement, because they have been all made upon the native carbonate of that earth, which always contains a certain proportion of carbonate of lime. According to an accurate analysis by the writer of this article, it is composed of 29.9 acid + 70.1 base. Klaproth's analysis gives us 30 acid + 69.5 base. The excess of acid is obviously owing to the presence of carbonate of lime in the native salt.\n\nWe have never seen any specimen of carbonate of magnesia composed of 1 integrant particle of acid, and one integrant particle of base, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>. But it occurs native in abundance, constituting an ingredient in the magnesian limestone, which is so abundant in the counties of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURHAM\">Durham</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DERBY\">Derby</a>, and which seems to constitute a peculiar formation. The bicarbonate may be formed by passing a current of carbonic acid through water in which magnesia is suspended. The salt is soluble in water, and crystallizes. It is composed of 69.911 acid + 30.089 base. Kirwan and Fourcroy found 66.6 acid + 33.3 base. Probably their salt was mixed with a little carbonate.\n\nCarbonate of yttria was analyzed by Klaproth; and the tabular statement exactly coincides with\nhis result. We have no analysis of carbonates of zirconia, and glucina.\n\nBerzelius found carbonate of silver a compound of 15.9 acid + 84.1 base. According to the statement in the table, it ought to be composed of 15.9 acid + 81.407 base, numbers which do not deviate far from those given by Berzelius.\n\nWe have no good analysis of the percarbonate of mercury. The statement in the table is given on the authority of Bergman; but is not very likely to be correct.\n\nPercarbonate of copper, according to the analysis of Berzelius, is composed of 19.73 acid + 71.7 peroxide. Dr Thomson analyzed it, with precisely the same result. This analysis coincides exactly with the statement in the table.\n\nKlaproth analyzed the carbonate of iron, and found it a compound of 38.3 acid + 61.6 base. This analysis corresponds sufficiently with the statement in the table.\n\nNickel and cobalt have so striking an analogy with iron in most particulars, that there is every reason for believing that the salts of the three metals are similarly constituted. Hence, as the carbonate of iron consists of 2 integrant particles of carbonic acid, and 1 integrant particle of black oxide of iron, we have supposed, in the table, that this is the case likewise with the carbonates of nickel and cobalt. The carbonate of nickel has been analyzed by Proust, and his result does not differ much from the tabular statement; but we have no analysis of the carbonate of cobalt.\n\nBerzelius analyzed carbonate of lead, and found it a compound of 16.444 acid + 83.333. The analysis of other chemists corresponds nearly with this result. Now, our statement in the table supposes the salt a compound of 16.446 acid + 83.554 base, which may be considered as absolutely the same with the numbers given by Berzelius.\n\nAccording to Mr Smithson, the carbonate of zinc is composed of 1 acid + 2 oxide. Now, the statement in the table supposes it a compound of 1 acid + 1.852 base; a coincidence as near as can be expected, when we consider the small quantity of salt upon which Mr Smithson makes his experiments.\n\nIf the carbonate of manganese be composed as stated in the table, it will be a compound of 34.16 acid + 50.476 base. John's analysis gives us 34.16 acid + 55.84 base; a result which does not correspond well. Hence there is reason to suspect inaccuracy.\n\nThe carbonates of cerium have been analyzed by Hisinger, and the results which he obtained agree tolerably well with the tabular statement.\n\nThus the carbonates correspond likewise with the Atomic Theory. They all agree with Berzelius's law, that the oxygen in the acid is a multiple by a whole number of the oxygen in the base. Most of them agree with his law, that the oxygen in the acid is double that in the base. But the carbonate of copper constitutes an exception to this rule. Indeed, we must expect to find some exceptions to these laws of Berzelius in almost every genus of salts. But it is surprising in how many unexpected cases they hold. Let us now examine the nitrates.\n\n| Genus III.\u2014Nitrates | Number of Atoms | Weight of an Integrant Particle |\n|---------------------|----------------|-------------------------------|\n| 262 Nitrate of potash | 1 n + 1 p      | 12.750                        |\n| 263 Nitrate of soda  | 2 n + 1 s      | 21.375                        |\n| 264 Nitrate of ammonia | 1 n + 1 a    | 8.875                         |\n| 265 Nitrate of magnesia | 1 n + 1 m   | 9.250                         |\n| 266 Nitrate of lime   | 1 n + 1 l      | 10.375                        |\n| 267 Nitrate of barytes | 1 n + 1 b    | 16.500                        |\n| 268 Nitrate of strontian | 1 n + 1 str | 13.250                        |\n| 269 Nitrate of ammonia and magnesia | 4 n + 3 m + 1 a | 36.625                        |\n| 270 Nitrate of copper | 2 n + 1 c      | 23.500                        |\n| 271 Subnitrate of copper | 1 n + 2 c  | 26.750                        |\n| 272 Nitrate of iron   | 2 n + 1 i      | 22.625                        |\n| 273 Pernitrate of iron | 3 n + 1 i    | 29.375                        |\n| 274 Nitrate of zinc   | 1 n + 1 l      | 10.840                        |\n| 275 Nitrate of lead    | 2 n + 1 l      | 41.500                        |\n| 276 1st subnitrate of lead | 1 n + 1 l | 34.750                        |\n| 277 2d subnitrate of lead | 2 n + 3 l | 97.500                        |\n| 278 3d subnitrate of lead | 1 n + 3 l | 90.750                        |\n| 279 Nitrate of nickel  | 3 n + 1 nick   | 29.555                        |\n| 280 Subnitrate of nickel | 1 n + 7 nick | 71.885                        |\n| 281 Nitrate of silver  | 1 n + 1 s      | 21.500                        |\n| 282 Nitrate of mercury | 1 n + 1 m      | 32.750                        |\n| 283 Pernitrate of mercury | 1 n + 2 m  | 60.750                        |\n| 284 Subnitrate of platinum | 1 n + 4 pl | 53.250                        |\n| 285 Nitrate of bismuth | 1 n + 1 b      | 16.750                        |\n| 286 Nitrate of uranium | 1 n + 1 u      | 21.750                        |\n\nThe analysis of the nitrates is attended with considerable difficulty, because we have no substance which forms an insoluble compound with nitric acid. We cannot, therefore, separate the acid by precipitation, as we do in the case of the sulphates, neither does it fly off when another acid is applied, as happens in the carbonates, so as to enable us to determine, by the loss of weight, how much acid the salt contains. Nevertheless, as a considerable number of the nitrates are destinate of water of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CRYSTALLIZATION\">crystallization</a>, and composed only of the acid and base united together, we have the means of ascertaining the composition of such salts very accurately, by determining the proportion of base which they contain.\n\nAccording to the analysis of Dr Thomson, nitre is composed of 100 acid + 83.823 base. According to Dr Wollaston, it is composed of 100 acid + 86.764 base. The statement in the table supposes it a compound of 100 acid + 88.8 potash. The difference between this result and experiment may be owing to our having made an atom of nitric acid a very little too great.\n\nAccording to Dr Thomson, nitrate of soda is composed of 100 acid + 57.8 soda. According to Wenzel, it is composed of 100 acid + 60 base. Our tabular statement supposes 100 acid + 57.92, which almost coincides with the result of Dr Thomson.\n\nBerzelius found nitrate of ammonia composed of 100 acid + 31.266 ammonia. Our tabular state-\nment supposes the salt to be composed of 100 acid + 30.853 ammonia, which very nearly coincides with the experiment of Berzelius.\n\nAccording to Wenzel, nitrate of magnesia is composed of 100 acid + 38.88 base. According to Dr Thomson, of 100 acid + 34.729 base. Our tabular statement supposes it a compound of 100 acid + 37.881 base, which comes very near the experiment of Wenzel.\n\nAccording to Kirwan, nitrate of lime is composed of 100 acid + 55.70 lime. According to Dr Thomson, of 100 acid + 53.091 lime. The tabular statement supposes it composed of 100 acid + 53.2 lime; a number which comes sufficiently near experiment.\n\nAccording to Berzelius, nitrate of barytes is composed of 100 acid + 140.73 barytes. The tabular statement supposes 100 acid + 143.02 base, which does not differ more than 1 per cent. from experiment.\n\nVauquelin informs us that nitrate of strontian is composed of 100 acid + 98.341 base. Now, our statement supposes it a compound of 100 acid + 101.42 base, which is within less than 1 per cent. of the experimental result.\n\nWe suppose nitrate of ammonia and magnesia to be a compound of 3 integrant particles of nitrate of magnesia, and 1 integrant particle of nitrate of ammonia; because that comes nearest the analysis of Fourcroy. But indeed his analyses are very seldom to be depended on.\n\nThe nitrate of copper has not been analyzed. Its composition is inferred from the sulphate of copper, which has been examined with accuracy. Berzelius found the subnitrate composed of 100 acid + 349.2 base. Proust obtained from the same salt 100 acid + 418.7 base. The mean of these two experiments gives 100 acid + 383.95 base. Now, the constitution of the salt which we have supposed in the table requires its composition to be 100 acid + 386.67 base, which comes within half a percent. of the preceding mean, and cannot, therefore, be far from the truth.\n\nThe nitrates of iron are given from theory and from analogy, as it would be scarcely possible, in the present state of the science of chemistry, to analyze them with accuracy.\n\nNeither has the nitrate of zinc been analyzed; yet we do not think there can be any hesitation in admitting the statement given in the table to be correct.\n\nAccording to Berzelius, octahedral nitrate of lead is composed of 100 acid + 205.1 oxide. This analysis, which we consider as exact, corresponds well with our statement in the table. The three subnitrates are described and analyzed by Berzelius (Annals of Philosophy, II. 278). The first contains 2 cc as much oxide as the octahedral nitrate, the second thrice as much, and the third six times as much. The second of these salts exhibits one of Berzelius's exceptions to the Atomic Theory. Its symbol would be, \\(1(a^o) + \\frac{1}{3}(l^o)\\), or 1 integrant particle of nitric acid united with \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) integrant particles of oxide of lead. This appears an absurdity at first sight, because half an integrant particle can have no existence. But when stated, as we have done in the table, the absurdity vanishes: the symbol then becomes \\(2(a^o) + 3(l^o)\\), or two integrant particles of nitric acid, united to three integrant particles of oxide of lead. There is nothing in such an union <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a> with the Atomic Theory; though it is inconsistent with one of Berzelius's general laws, that, in all unorganic compounds, one of the elements enters always in the state of a single atom. In this compound there is no single atom. It consists of 11 atoms of oxygen, + 3 atoms of lead, + 2 atoms of azote.\n\nNitrate of nickel, according to Proust, is composed of 100 acid + 45.45 base. If so, its composition must be as represented in the table. Proust found the subnitrate composed of 100 acid + 735.3 oxide. This leads to the constitution of the salt in the table; if any confidence can be put in the accuracy of the analysis.\n\nThe analysis of Berzelius makes nitrate of silver a compound of 100 acid + 216.45 base. Proust gives us 100 acid + 233.33 base. The statement in the table supposes 100 acid + 216.286, which almost coincides with the result obtained by Berzelius.\n\nNitrate of mercury has not been analyzed. But Messrs Braamchamp and Siguiera Oliva found the pernitrate composed of 100 acid + 733.33 base. This constitutes a very near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROXIMATION\">approximation</a> to the tabular statement, especially when we consider the difficulty of the analysis.\n\nChenevix found the subnitrate of platinum composed of 100 acid + 809.09. This comes within \\(1\\frac{1}{2}\\) per cent. of our statement in the table; a sufficiently near coincidence, if the difficulty of analysis be attended to.\n\nAccording to Berzelius, nitrate of bismuth is composed of 100 acid + 142.69 base. Our statement supposes it composed of 100 acid + 145.42; a sufficiently near coincidence for our purpose.\n\nNitrate of uranium, according to Bucholz, is composed of 100 acid + 292 base. This approaches pretty nearly to the statement in the table, which supposes the salt to be composed of 100 acid + 290.4 base.\n\nThus, we have gone over the composition of the nitrates, without finding anything inconsistent with the Atomic Theory. On the contrary, they agree with that theory so exactly, wherever accurate methods of analysis can be had recourse to, that we may apply the theory, without hesitation, to determine the composition of those nitrates which cannot, in the present state of the science, be analyzed correctly. But, when we apply Berzelius's law, that the oxygen in the acid is a multiple of the oxygen in the base, by a whole number to the nitrates, we find that it fails in several cases, though it holds in the greatest number. As nitric acid contains 5 atoms of oxygen, it is obvious that it cannot combine with a single particle of a deutoxide, without transgressing the rule. But Berzelius has fallen upon a way of reconciling the nitrates to his law. According to him, azote is a compound of 1 atom of oxygen, and 1 atom of nitricum, so that nitric acid, according to him, is a compound of 6 atoms oxygen, and 1 atom nitricum. This opinion is certainly plausible, though it cannot\nbe adopted till something better than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> theory is brought forward in support of it. Let us now examine the phosphates, a genus of salts still much more imperfectly analyzed than any of the three preceding genera.\n\n**Genus IV.\u2014Phosphates.**\n\n| Number of Atoms | Weight of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEGRAL\">Integral</a> Particle |\n|-----------------|----------------------------|\n| 287 Phosphate of potash | 1 ph + 1 p 9.625 |\n| 288 Biphosphate of potash | 2 ph + 1 p 13.250 |\n| 289 Subphosphate of potash | 1 ph + 2 p 15.625 |\n| 290 Phosphate of soda | 2 ph + 1 s 15.125 |\n| 291 Biphosphate of soda | 4 ph + 1 s 22.375 |\n| 292 Phosphate of ammonia | 5 ph + 4 a 26.625 |\n| 293 Biphosphate of ammonia | 5 ph + 2 a 22.875 |\n| 294 Quadrostophosphate of lime | 5 ph + 1 l 21.750 |\n| 295 Binostophosphate of lime | 5 ph + 2 l 25.375 |\n| 296 Bigephosphate of lime | 5 ph + 3 l 29.000 |\n| 297 Osteophosphate of lime | 5 ph + 4 l 32.625 |\n| 298 Phosphate of lime | 5 ph + 5 l 36.350 |\n| 299 Gephosphate of lime \u2020 | 5 ph + 6 l 39.975 |\n| 300 Phosphate of barytes | 1 ph + 1 b 13.375 |\n| 301 Phosphate of strontian | 1 ph + 1 s 10.125 |\n| 302 Phosphate of magnesia | 1 ph + 2 m 8.625 |\n| 303 Protophosphate of copper | 1 ph + 1 c 12.625 |\n| 304 Perphosphate of copper | 1 ph + 2 c 23.625 |\n| 305 Protophosphate of iron | 2 ph + 1 i 16.393 |\n| 306 Perphosphate of iron | 2 ph + 1 i 17.393 |\n| 307 Phosphate of lead | 2 ph + 1 l 35.250 |\n| 308 Phosphate of zinc | 1 ph + 1 z 8.720 |\n| 309 Biphosphate of zinc | 2 ph + 1 z 12.345 |\n| 310 Phosphate of nickel | 2 ph + 1 n 16.553 |\n\nPhosphate of potash, supposing it composed of 1 integrant particle of acid, and 1 integrant particle of base, ought to consist of 100 acid + 166.762 potash. Now, according to the analysis of Saussure jun. it is composed of 100 acid + 185.714 base. According to Berthollet, it is composed of 100 acid + 199.242 base. The author of this article lately subjected all the three phosphates of potash to a careful analysis. The results agree exactly with the tabular number.\n\nWe are not acquainted with any analysis of phosphate of soda, except one made lately by Dr Thomson. He found it composed of 100 acid + 109.59 soda. Now, according to the statement in the table, it is composed of 100 acid + 109.533. In this salt, the difference between the theoretical and experimental result may be considered as nothing.\n\nThe phosphates of ammonia and of magnesia are given from analyses of these salts made by the author of this article, but not yet published.\n\nPhosphate of magnesia and ammonium, according to the analysis of Fourcroy, is composed of equal parts of phosphate of magnesia and phosphate of ammonia. But this result not agreeing with the constituents of these salts, as determined by experiment, this triple salt has been left out of the table.\n\nThere can be no doubt that phosphate of lime is composed of an integrant particle of phosphoric acid, united with an integrant particle of lime. This is the case with the sulphate, carbonate, and nitrate of lime, and unless the phosphate of lime were so formed, Richter's law could not hold good. According to this constitution, the salt must consist of 100 acid + 100 base. We have a considerable number of analyses of phosphate of lime; but all deviating so much from each other, that little confidence can be put in any of them. According to Klaproth, it is composed of 100 acid + 254.281 lime. But the salt which he formed by saturating phosphoric acid with marble, certainly was not the common phosphate of lime, but a subsalt, which has not yet been accurately examined. According to Ekeberg (when his calculations are rectified), phosphate of lime is composed of 100 acid + 82.186 base. This approaches much nearer the true composition, though it is not correct. The salt which Ekeberg found exists, and constitutes earth of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a>. It is the ostcophosphate of the table. According to Fourcroy and Vauquelin, phosphate of lime is composed of 100 acid + 143.9 lime. Here there is still a greater error on the opposite side than that fallen into by Ekeberg. But their analysis approaches to that of apatite, the gephosphate of the table. The other phosphates of lime in the table were discovered by the author of this article, and are detailed by him in a paper on phosphoric acid, read to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a>, but not yet published.\n\nPhosphate of barytes, according to the experiments of Berzelius, is composed of 100 acid + 259.715 barytes. Our statement in the table, founded on evidence, which seems quite satisfactory, supposes it a compound of 100 acid + 270.477 base. The difference here between experiment and theory does not exceed 3 per cent.\n\nIf phosphate of strontian be composed of 1 integrant particle of phosphoric acid, and 1 integrant particle of strontian, as there can be no doubt is the case, then its composition must be 100 acid + 191.773 base. We have an analysis of this salt by Vauquelin, according to whom it is composed of 100 acid + 192.48 base. But the data upon which he founded his conclusions, were necessarily so inaccurate, in consequence of the erroneous notions which he entertained respecting the composition of phosphate of lime, that a nearer approach to accuracy could not, in his case, be expected. The numbers in the table are the result of experiments by the author of this article.\n\nIt seems to be a law in saline combinations, that a deutoxide always combines with two integrant particles of acid. Thus, black oxide of copper unites with two integrant particles of sulphuric acid, and likewise with two integrant particles of nitric acid.\n\n---\n\n* So called, because it is a constituent of bones.\n\u2020 This is the apatite of mineralogists.\nHence we may conclude, that it will combine likewise with two integrant particles of phosphoric acid. According to this statement, it must be composed of 100 acid + 138.854 black oxide of copper. Now, according to the analysis of Chenevix, it is composed of 100 acid + 141.428 black oxide of copper. This agrees with the tabular statement very nearly.\n\nWe have the same reason for considering phosphate of iron as a compound of two integrant particles of acid, and one of deutoxide of iron. According to this statement, it ought to be composed of 100 acid + 126.667 black oxide of iron. We have no analysis of this sort. Lougier, indeed, has analyzed a substance which occurs in small prisms in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRAZIL\">Brazil</a>, and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLE\">Isle</a> of France. He found it composed of 100 acid + 214.285 black oxide. This approaches to a compound of 1 integrant particle of acid, and 1 integrant particle of oxide. Dr Thomson found two phosphates composed as in the table.\n\nThe perphosphate of iron is a white insoluble powder, obtained by precipitating persulphate of iron by phosphate of ammonia. It has not been analyzed. Nor do we know whether the theoretical result, as stated in the table, can be admitted to much confidence. This salt is converted into a subsalt, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of an alkali.\n\nPhosphate of lead has been analyzed with great care by three different chemists. According to Berzelius, it is composed of 100 acid + 380.565 base; according to Dr Wollaston, of 100 acid + 370.72 base; and according to Dr Thomson, of 100 acid + 398.49 base. The mean of these experiments gives us 100 acid + 38, nearly 3.258 base. This agrees with the composition of the salt, as stated in the table. It was from it, in part, that we deduced the weight and composition of phosphoric acid.\n\nThe phosphates of zinc, and phosphate of nickel, have been analyzed by Dr Thomson. The composition of these salts in the table is stated from this analysis.\n\nThere is no analysis of the phosphate of mercury. We do not even know if it exists. But the perphosphate of mercury has been analyzed by Messrs Braamcamp and Siguiera. According to them, it is composed of 100 acid + 250.857 peroxide of mercury. Now, if it be a compound of 3 integrant particles of acid and 1 integrant particle of base, its constituents ought to be 100 acid + 250.159 base. This may be considered as identical with the experiment, since the difference is far within the limits of unavoidable error, from the imperfection of our methods.\n\nThus it appears, not only that no exception to the atomic theory exists among the salts; but that it puts it in our power to determine the composition of all the genera of salts, provided we know the analysis of one species, with more accuracy than would result from ordinary experiment. We have not the least doubt, that, when an accurate analysis of the phosphates is published, it will be found in almost every instance to agree with our table. We shall give another example of a genus of salts, the constituents of which we have determined almost entire-\n\n**Genus V.\u2014Borates.**\n\n| Number of Atoms | Weight of an Integrant Particle |\n|-----------------|--------------------------------|\n| 311 Borate of potash | 1 b + 1 p | 8.733 |\n| 312 Sub-borate of potash | 1 b + 2 p | 14.733 |\n| 313 Borate of soda | 2 b + 1 s | 13.341 |\n| 314 Sub-borate of soda | 1 b + 2 s | 18.483 |\n| 315 Borate of ammonia | 1 b + 1 a | 4.858 |\n| 316 Sub-borate of ammonia | 1 b + 2 a | 6.983 |\n| 317 Borate of magnesia | 1 b + 1 m | 5.283 |\n| 318 Borate of lime | 1 b + 1 l | 6.358 |\n| 319 Borate of barytes | 1 b + 1 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> | 12.483 |\n| 320 Borate of strontian | 1 b + 1 str | 9.233 |\n| 321 Borate of alumina | 1 b + 1 a | 4.858 |\n| 322 Borate of yttria | 1 b + 1 y | 11.138 |\n| 323 Borate of glucina | 1 b + 1 g | 12.566 |\n| 324 Borate of zirconia | 1 b + 1 z | 8.358 |\n| 325 Borate of copper | 2 b + 1 c | 15.466 |\n| 326 Borate of iron | 2 b + 1 i | 14.581 |\n| 327 Borate of nickel | 2 b + 1 n | 14.771 |\n| 328 Borate of cobalt | 2 b + 1 c | 14.792 |\n| 329 Borate of lead | 2 b + 1 l | 33.466 |\n| 330 Borate of zinc | 1 b + 1 z | 7.828 |\n| 331 Borate of mercury | 1 b + 1 m | 28.733 |\n| 332 Borate of silver | 1 b + 1 s | 17.483 |\n| 333 Borate of bismuth | 1 b + 1 b | 12.733 |\n| 334 Borate of manganese | 2 b + 1 m | 10.566 |\n| 335 Borate of uranium | 1 b + 1 u | 15.733 |\n| 336 Borate of platinum | 1 b + 1 p | 15.894 |\n\nWe shall take one other genus of salts, as a farther elucidation of the atomic theory; and we shall select one of the vegetable acids, which have been analyzed by Berzelius, that we may be able to judge how far the weight of an integrant particle of the acid derived from his analysis, will agree with the constitution of the salts.\n\n**Genus VI.\u2014Oxalates.**\n\n| Number of Atoms | Weight of an Integrant Particle |\n|-----------------|--------------------------------|\n| 337 Oxalate of potash | 1 ox + 1 p | 10.634 |\n| 338 Binoxalate of potash | 2 ox + 1 p | 15.268 |\n| 339 Quadroxalate of potash | 4 ox + 1 p | 24.536 |\n| 340 Oxalate of soda | 2 ox + 1 s | 17.150 |\n| 341 Oxalate of ammonia | 1 ox + 1 a | 6.783 |\n| 342 Oxalate of magnesia | 1 ox + 1 m | 7.211 |\n| 343 Oxalate of lime | 1 ox + 1 l | 8.254 |\n| 344 Binoxalate of lime | 2 ox + 1 l | 12.888 |\n| 345 Oxalate of barytes | 1 ox + 1 b | 14.365 |\n| 346 Oxalate of strontian | 1 ox + 1 str | 11.534 |\n| 347 Oxalate of alumina | 1 ox + 1 a | 6.770 |\n| 348 Oxalate of yttria | 1 ox + 1 y | 13.034 |\n| 349 Oxalate of glucina | 1 ox + 1 gl | 14.467 |\n| 350 Oxalate of zirconia | 1 ox + 1 z | 10.290 |\n| 351 Oxalate of copper | 2 ox + 1 c | 19.268 |\n\nVOL. I. PART II.\nAccording to the analysis of Berzelius, exhibited in a preceding part of this article, oxalic acid is a compound of 21 atoms, namely, 12 atoms of oxygen, 8 atoms of carbon, and 1 atom of hydrogen. But there can be little hesitation in doubling the quantity of hydrogen found in this acid by Berzelius; because this will greatly increase the simplicity of the composition of the acid, and the difference is considerably within the unavoidable errors in such experiments. In that case, the acid would be constituted of 11 atoms; namely, 6 of oxygen, 4 of carbon, and 1 of hydrogen; and its weight would be 9.070. But the weight of an atom of oxalic acid, even when thus corrected, will not agree with the known constitution of the oxalates. Berzelius analyzed oxalate of lead with great care, and found it composed of 100 acid + 307.5 oxide of lead. Now, it appears from all the genera of salts which we have examined, that the yellow oxide of lead unites always with 2 integrant particles of acid. The weight of an integrant particle of yellow oxide of lead is 28.\n\nNow, \\( \\frac{307.5}{2} : \\frac{100}{2} : 57 : 4.528 = \\) the weight of an integrant particle of oxalic acid. Now, this is very nearly one half of the weight resulting from analysis. To obtain this weight, it would be necessary to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRUPLE\">quadruple</a> the quantity of hydrogen found in oxalic acid by Berzelius, and to consider it as composed of 3 atoms oxygen, 2 atoms carbon, and 1 atom hydrogen. Now, it deserves to be noticed, that this is the constitution of oxalic acid adopted by Mr Dalton (Annals of Philosophy, III. 179.), obtained, we presume, from an examination of the composition of the oxalates, and from the analysis of oxalic acid, previously made by Dr Thomson and by Gay-Lussac and Thenard. Whatever confidence the analytical experiments of Berzelius may be entitled to, we have no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ALTERNATIVE\">alternative</a> in the present case but to adopt the conclusion suggested by the oxalates. The analysis of these bodies is much easier, and therefore more likely to prove correct, than that of oxalic acid itself. We may adopt 4.625 as the weight of an atom of oxalic acid; and consider it as a compound of 6 atoms, 3 of oxygen, 2 of carbon, and 1 of hydrogen. Its composition would then be:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Oxygen} & : 64.789 \\\\\n\\text{Carbon} & : 32.413 \\\\\n\\text{Hydrogen} & : 2.848 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nWe do not pretend to reconcile this result with that obtained by Berzelius; but the constitution of the oxalates obliges us to adopt it as nearest the truth.\n\nWe have three analyses of the oxalate of potash, one by Dr Thomson (Phil. Trans. 1807), one by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-VOGEL\">Vogel</a> (Schweigger's Journal, II. 470), and one by M. Berard (Annales de Chimie, 73. 270). The statement in the table supposes the salt a compound of 100 acid + 129.477 potash. Now, Dr Thomson's analysis gives us 100 acid + 122.86 base, Vogel's 100 acid + 132.558 base, and Berard's 100 acid + 102.757 base. The first two analyses, especially the second, are very near the truth. Berard's is a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> more incorrect. Dr Wollaston has shown, that binoxalate of potash contains exactly twice as much acid, and quadroxalate of potash four times as much acid as neutral oxalate of potash.\n\nIf oxalate of soda be composed of two integrant particles of acid, and 1 of soda, it must be composed of 100 acid + 85.045 soda. Now, the analysis of Vogel gives us 100 acid + 82.563 base, which agrees very nearly with theory. The analysis of Thomson and Berard are both considerably more incorrect.\n\nSupposing oxalate of ammonia to be constituted as represented in the table, it must be a compound of 100 acid + 46.374 ammonia. Now, the analysis of Berzelius gives us 100 acid + 45.264 base, and that of Berard 100 acid + 44.369 base. Both of these agree well with the tabular statement.\n\nSuperoxalates of soda and of ammonia exist, but we did not give them a place in the table, as they have been but superficially examined. The first is probably a compound of 3 integrant particles of acid, and 1 integrant particle of soda; the second no doubt contains 2 integrant particles of acid and 1 of ammonia. Oxalate of magnesia, supposing it constituted as in the table, is a compound of 100 acid + 55.610 magnesia. Now, Bergman's analysis gives us 100 acid + 53.846 base. This agrees sufficiently with the theory. The analysis of Thomson and Berard are both very faulty. It is not difficult to see how they were misled.\n\nOxalate of lime has been analyzed with great care by different chemists, Bergman, Thomson, Berard, Vogel, Gay-Lussac, and Thenard, &c. But the results differ considerably from each other. The reason is, that various oxalates of lime exist, and that experimenters are always sure to get a mixture of them, when they form oxalate of lime by precipitation. The neutral salt must be composed of 100 acid + 78.117 lime. Now, Vogel's analysis gives us 100 acid + 76 lime, which is sufficiently near to show us, that he calculated the composition of the neutral salt. Dr Thomson gives 100 acid + 60 lime,\nthis must have been a mixture of neutral oxalate and binoxalate of lime. Berard found 100 acid + 61.2 lime, and Thenard, and Gay-Lussac, nearly the same proportions. All these must have been mixtures.\n\nThe analyses of the oxalate of barytes hitherto made, do not correspond with its composition as represented in the table; owing, probably, to the same causes that have occasioned inaccuracy in the analysis of oxalate of lime. This salt ought to be composed of 100 acid + 209.991 barytes. Dr Thomson's analysis gives us 100 acid + 142.86 base, and Berard's 100 acid + 164.3 base. Both of these are very far from accurate.\n\nOxalate of strontian, according to the statement in the table, ought to be composed of 100 acid + 148.894 strontian. Now, according to Dr Thomson's analysis, it is composed of 100 acid + 151.51 base. This agrees sufficiently. Berard's analysis is much less accurate. He obtained 100 acid + 119.5 base. The oxalates of alumina, yttria, glucina, and zirconia, have not been analyzed. But there can be no hesitation in considering their composition as stated in the table to be correct.\n\nOxalate of copper, according to the constitution of it given in the table, is composed of 100 acid + 107.898 black oxide of copper. Now, Vogel found it composed of 100 oxide + 100 acid, including a little water. This agrees sufficiently with the theoretic statement. The three triple oxalates are composed respectively as follows:\n\n1. One integrant particle oxalate of potash, + 1 integrant particle oxalate of copper.\n2. 1 oxalate of soda + 1 oxalate of copper.\n3. 1 oxalate of ammonia + 1 oxalate of copper.\n\nThis agrees with Vogel's analysis. He found oxalate of potash and copper composed of\n\n| Acid | Potash | Oxide of copper |\n|------|--------|----------------|\n| 45   | 30     | 25             |\n\n100\n\nAnd oxalate of ammonia and copper of\n\n| Acid | Ammonia | Oxide of copper |\n|------|---------|----------------|\n| 47.5 | 10.5    | 25.0           |\n\n100.0\n\nThe remaining oxalates, if we except the oxalate of lead, have not yet been subjected to an accurate analysis. The composition, as stated in the table, is deduced from a comparison with the other genera of salts, and there can be no doubt that, in general, it is correct.\n\nIt would be easy for us to exhibit the composition of the remaining genera of salts; but we have already extended this article to as great a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> as is consistent with our limits. The remaining genera, indeed, have been so imperfectly examined, that they would throw no additional light on the atomic theory; though that theory would enable us to calculate their compositions in most cases with sufficient precision. We have omitted, likewise, the chlorides and iodes, two numerous classes of bodies analogous to the oxides to which the atomic theory applies, with as much precision as it does to those substances which we have examined in this article. But these two classes of bodies being but recently discovered, are not probably so familiar to the reader, as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARRANT\">warrant</a> our introducing them without any previous explanation.\n\n(J.)\n\n**<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">Attraction</a>.**\n\nThe word **Attraction** (see *Encyclopaedia*), is used to denote what we observe, when one body approaches another, or tends to approach it, without any apparent impulse, or other cause, to which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> can be ascribed.\n\nWe have instances of attraction when iron approaches the magnet,\u2014when certain bodies are placed near an excited electric,\u2014when a stone falls to the earth. We say likewise that the earth attracts the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>; by this mode of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> meaning no more than that the moon is continually deflected towards the earth, from the rectilineal course which it would otherwise pursue. It is likewise in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> that we must be understood, when we say that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> attracts all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANETS\">planets</a>.\n\nIn the instances already mentioned, attraction extends to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a>. In other cases, it is confined within limits so extremely narrow, as to become imperceptible at an interval which cannot be appreciated by the senses. Of this kind is the attraction which takes place between the particles of the same fluid, as is apparent from the round <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of small drops. To this class likewise belongs the attraction between fluid and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> bodies; whence originate the very interesting appearances observed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CAPILLARY\">capillary</a> tubes, and other kindred phenomena. An attraction between the small elementary particles of all solid bodies, is manifest from the force with which they cohere, or resist an endeavour to separate them. In many cases, the intensity of this force is prodigiously great in contact, or at the nearest distances; while it ceases to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a>, upon making the smallest separation between the parts. Lastly, Chemistry develops innumerable instances of attraction between the molecules of the bodies about which it is conversant; insomuch, that it is to this principle, under the name of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a>,\nAttraction. that we must ultimately ascribe the various decompositions and new combinations which occur in that science.\n\nAll these phenomena, although very different from one another in other respects, yet have this in common, that we observe, in certain bodies, a tendency to approach one another, and to resist a separation, with some degree of force. The facts are certain, and are attended with no ambiguity; and it is to express these facts that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> attraction is used in physics.\n\nWe likewise observe, in some bodies, a tendency to fly off from one another when they are brought near. This is called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REPULSION\">repulsion</a>.\n\nThe word force has, in general, some degree of obscurity. It is used to denote the cause of motion; but we have no direct knowledge of it, and we judge of its intensity by the effect which we suppose it to produce. In all our reasoning concerning forces, it is the changes of motion which we measure and compare together, and which are really the subjects of our thoughts. Attraction and repulsion are forces, or principles of motion, known to us only by the phenomena we observe; but the circumstance of their implying action at a distance, is an additional source of obscurity, in which other kinds of force do not participate.\n\nIt certainly is inconceivable, that motion should be produced at a distance, when no connection can be traced between the body moved and that which is supposed to produce the motion. We are strongly impressed with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a>, that a body cannot act but where it is; and we find difficulty in admitting that the mere presence of two bodies, without the intervention of any mechanical means, can be a satisfactory cause of motion. On this account, Attraction has been classed by some with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCCULT\">occult</a> qualities of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a>; and the favourers of this doctrine have been reproached with reviving exploded notions in philosophy. Impulse is a principle of motion more familiar to us, and to which we are not disposed to make equal objection. Whenever the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> of motion can be traced to this source, we are satisfied that the effect is justly explained. Hence, many philosophers have been of opinion, that impulse is the only cause of motion that can be admitted in physical science; and many attempts have been made to reduce to this principle, all cases in which distant bodies act on one another.\n\nWith regard to these attempts, it will be sufficient to remark here, that they are all built upon hypothesis: no evidence is adduced to prove that such things exist, as the elastic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ETHER\">ether</a>, or gravific matter, which they set out with supposing. And, as far as such systems have no other object but to obviate the difficulty of action at a distance, this argument alone is sufficient to confute them, without adverting to the difficulties that attend each of them separately\u2014their inconsistency with the received laws of motion\u2014and the innumerable contradictions and improbabilities to which they are liable on every side.\n\nA little reflection is sufficient to show, that, in reality, we have no clearer notion of impulse as the cause of motion, than we have of attraction. We can as little give a satisfactory reason why motion should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> out of one body into another, on their Attraction contact, as we can, why one body should begin to move, or have its motion increased, when it is placed near another body. It is equally impossible in both cases to prove that there is a necessary connection between the related facts; in this respect, both the phenomena are alike inexplicable.\n\nWhen motion is produced by impulse, it is probably the circumstance of contact apparently taking place, which leads us to think that the effect is so clearly explained. It is in this manner only, or by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> contact, that we ourselves can move <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> objects. We have no power to produce motion in distant bodies, except by the intervention of other bodies on which we act immediately. Impulse is, therefore, a cause of motion familiar to us, and strikes us as the plainest, and most satisfactory, ultimate principle at which we can arrive. On the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, when one body attracts another at a distance, there is nothing familiar to us with which we can compare it; our curiosity is excited, and we are led to seek out some hidden connection between them.\n\nBut, it may be doubted whether there is actual contact in any case of the communication of motion. When a body is impelled by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, it will hardly be affirmed that the particles of that elastic fluid are in contact with one another, since there is no space, however small, within which a given bulk of it may not be compressed, by applying an external force sufficiently great. The particles of air, therefore, act on one another at a distance; and the same thing must be true of all other elastic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a>. And, by the way, what is here said is sufficient to prove, that no scheme, founded on the hypothesis of an elastic ether, will enable us to account for attraction; because such a contrivance can do nothing more than substitute one species of action at a distance in the room of another. There is good reason to think that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> contact never takes place in the component parts of the hardest and most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a> solid bodies. This seems to be an unavoidable consequence of the fact, well established by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, that all bodies <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> in their bulk by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, and expand by heat. It is, therefore, not only not impossible, but it is even in some degree probable, that the communication of motion may, in every instance, be a case of action at a distance.\n\nIf, then, we are apt to think that impulse is a clearer physical principle than attraction, there is, in reality, no good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a>; it has its origin in prejudice, and in our mistaking the proper object of natural philosophy. All our researches in nature are confined to the phenomena we observe, and to the laws by which they are regulated. A physical cause is no other than a general fact discovered by a careful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>, and an attentive comparison, of many particular and subordinate facts. We have no evidence, independent of experience, that any consequence, deduced from a physical cause, will actually take place. There is, in this case, no necessary connection from which we can, with absolute certainty, infer the expected event. If, then, we regard impulse and attraction as princi-\nAttraction. ples founded in fact, and regulated by laws, confirmed by observation and experiment, they are both equally entitled to be classed as physical causes, and they ought both to be admitted as of equal authority in explaining the phenomena of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSE\">universe</a>.\n\nIf we turn our attention to the different kinds of attraction enumerated above, and inquire what progress has been made in the investigation of their laws of action, we shall find that, generally speaking, this branch of physics is little advanced. We are very imperfectly acquainted with magnetical and electrical attraction. We know still less of those attractive powers which take place at small distances, and which are confined within such narrow limits, that their mode of action escapes the observation of our senses. Attraction is, indeed, much used by philosophers to account for many important natural phenomena; but their explanations are often vague, and destitute of that precision which ought always to be aimed at in physical science. There is only one class of phenomena in which the laws of attraction have been fully developed. We allude to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAVITATION\">gravitation</a>, that principle which occasions the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> of heavy bodies at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a> of the earth, and which retains the planets and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMETS\">comets</a> in their orbits. Referring the other species of attraction, which are little susceptible of general discussion, to their several heads, we shall now confine our attention to gravitation.\n\nTraces of the principle of gravitation are to be found in writers of great antiquity. But their speculations on this subject do not go beyond a vague notion of a tendency which the planets have to one another, or to a common centre. It would contribute little either to entertainment or instruction, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLECT\">collect</a> all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> authors that speak of this principle. The revival of the true system of the world by Copernicus, introduced the most admirable simplicity in the explanation of the planetary motions, and likewise led to more just conjectures concerning the laws by which they are upheld. Copernicus himself attributed the round figure of the planets to a tendency which their parts possess of uniting with one another; thus extending to all the planets which we observe at the surface of the earth. He stopt short, indeed, at this point; conceiving attraction to be confined to the matter of each planet, without making it extend from one planet to another, so as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTUATE\">actuate</a> all the bodies of the system. This step was made by the bold and systematic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> of Kepler. Adopting the opinion of Dr Gilbert of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLCHESTER\">Colchester</a>, that the earth is a great magnet, Kepler formed to himself a notion of attraction, in some respects remarkably just. He says that the earth and moon attract one another; and, were it not for some powers which retain them in their orbits, they would move towards one another, and would meet in their common centre of gravity. He attributes the tide to the moon's attraction (virtus tractive qua in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUNA\">luna</a> est), which heaps up the waters of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCEAN\">ocean</a> immediately under her. But in many respects, his notions of attraction were fanciful and extravagant; a more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> knowledge of the laws of motion than had been attained to in his time, and a new geometry, were both wanting, in order to guide him in this research without danger of wandering. Yet he was able to penetrate so far into the causes of the planetary motions, as to foresee that they would not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> continue latent; he tells us, he was persuaded that \"the full discovery of those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MYSTERIES\">mysteries</a> was reserved for the next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, when God would reveal them.\" So full an exposition of a physical system of the world, as is contained in the writings of Kepler, could not fail to draw the attention of succeeding philosophers. Many remarks concerning the principle of gravitation are to be found in the writings of Fermat, Roberval, Borelli, and other authors. But no one, before Newton, entertained so clear and systematic a view of the doctrine of universal gravitation as Dr Robert Hook. In his work on the motion of the earth, published in 1674, twelve years before the appearance of Newton's Principia, he lays down these three positions as the foundations of his system, viz.\n\n\"1st, That all the heavenly bodies have not only a gravitation of their parts to their own proper centre, but likewise that they mutually attract each other within their spheres of action.\n\n\"2ndly, That all bodies having a simple motion, will continue to move in a straight line, unless continually deflected from it by some extraneous force, causing them to describe a circle, or an ellipse, or some other curve.\n\n\"3rdly, This attraction is so much the greater, as the bodies are nearer.\"\n\nThe principle of universal gravitation is here very precisely enunciated. Dr Hook seems to have clearly perceived, that the planetary motions are the result of an attraction towards the sun, and of a rectilineal motion produced by a projectile force. Not having discovered the law according to which the force diminishes, as the distance from the sun increases, he contrived experiments to elucidate his theory. Having suspended a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> by means of a long thread, he placed another ball upon a table immediately under the point of suspension, and he caused the suspended ball to revolve round the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a> one. When the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOVEABLE\">moveable</a> ball was pushed laterally with a force properly adjusted to its deviation from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a>, it described an exact circle round the ball on the table; in other cases, it described an ellipse, or an oval resembling an ellipse, having the other ball in the centre. Dr Hook observed, that although this experiment, in some measure, illustrated the planetary motions, yet it did not represent them accurately; because the ellipses which the planets describe, have the sun placed in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FOCUS\">focus</a>, and not in the centre. Thus, at the appearance of Newton, many things were known, or rather surmised, that prepared the way for the discovery of the principle which regulates the celestial motions. This does not detract, in any degree, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> of Newton, who, discarding the conjectures of his predecessors, proposed to himself to investigate, with mathematical strictness, the law of the attractive force, and to ascertain, with precision, its sufficiency to retain the planets in their orbits. He invented a new kind of geometry, which was necessary to enable him to accomplish his purpose. With this help, and by admitting no-\nAttraction.\n\nthing without the sanction of the established principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DYNAMICS\">Dynamics</a>, he deduced from the motions of the celestial bodies, the law of universal gravitation, the most important and the most general truth hitherto discovered by the industry and sagacity of man, viz. \"That all the particles of matter attract one another, directly as their masses, and inversely as the squares of their distances.\" The particular occasion which gave rise to the speculations of Newton, on the subject of gravity, is noticed in the life of that great man in the Encyclopedia; and, in the article <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">Astronomy</a> (Part IV. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">Chapter</a> II.) there is an account of the several steps of the analytical process of reasoning, by which the above general law is inferred from the motions of the celestial bodies.\n\nHaving arrived at a principle which belongs to every part of matter, another inquiry comes into view. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SETTING\">Setting</a> out from this principle, it is now necessary to proceed in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERTED\">inverted</a> order, and deduce from it, by synthetical reasoning, the phenomena which we observe in the universe. The first step in this process, is to find out the attractive force of the planets, which arises from the united attractions of their component parts. Two things only are involved in this investigation, viz. the known law of attraction between the particles of matter, and the figure of the attracting bodies. This is a subject of great importance, and it is connected with some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of the system of the world, with the theory of the figure of the planets, that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-TIDES\">tides</a>, and many other phenomena. It is but imperfectly discussed in Newton's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMMORTAL\">immortal</a> work; and there is no part of his philosophy which has been improved more slowly by the labours of his followers. We now propose to treat of it at some length, endeavouring to lay before our readers as complete a view of this part of science as the nature of our work will permit.\n\nWe begin with laying down some definitions, and demonstrating some properties of elliptical spheroids.\n\nDef. 1. A solid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> by the revolving of an ellipse about either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AXIS\">axis</a> is called a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPHEROID\">spheroid</a> of revolution. If the ellipse revolve about the less axis, the spheroid is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBLATE\">oblate</a>; if about the greater axis, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a>.\n\nLet \\( k \\) and \\( k' \\) denote the two axes of the spheroid, \\( k \\) being that of revolution; and let \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) be two coordinates of a point in the surface of the spheroid, having their origin in the centre, \\( x \\) being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to the axis of revolution, and \\( y \\) perpendicular to it; then the equation of the spheroid, whether oblate or oblong, will be\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x^2}{k^2} + \\frac{y^2}{k'^2} = 1.\n\\]\n\nDef. 2. An elliptical spheroid, in general, or an ellipsoid, is a solid bounded by a finite surface of the second order. Let ACB and ADE (Plate XXX. fig. 1). This figure represents one eighth of an ellipsoid contained in one of the solid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> formed by the three principal sections) be two ellipses that have the same axis AO, the same centre O, and their planes perpendicular to one another; from any point K in the common axis, let there be drawn ordinates in both ellipses, as KC and KD; then, having described an ellipse of which KC and Attraction. KD are the semiaxes, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIPHERY\">periphery</a> DMC of that ellipse will be in the surface of the ellipsoid. This solid figure has a centre; three axes crossing one another at right angles in the centre; and three principal sections made by planes passing through every two of its axes.\n\nLet \\( k, k', k'' \\), denote the three semiaxes; viz. \\( k = OB, k' = OE, k'' = OA \\); and let \\( x, y, z \\) denote three rectangular coordinates of a point M in the surface, the coordinates being parallel to the axes, and having their origin in the centre; viz. \\( MN = x, NK = y, OK = z \\); then the equation of the surface will be\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x^2}{k^2} + \\frac{y^2}{k'^2} + \\frac{z^2}{k''^2} = 1;\n\\]\n\nit is easy to prove from the foregoing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a>.\n\nThe ellipsoid becomes a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPHERE\">sphere</a>, when all the three axes are equal; it becomes a spheroid of revolution, when two of them are equal.\n\n1. If any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> cut an elliptical spheroid, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> will be an ellipse. In the spheroid of revolution, a section made by a plane perpendicular to the axis of revolution is a circle.\u2014All this follows so easily from the nature of the solids, that we need not stop to give a formal demonstration.\n\n2. If a straight line cut two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCENTRIC\">concentric</a> ellipses, that are similar and similarly situated, the parts of it between the outer and inner peripheries are equal to one another.\n\nLet AHBK and MDNC (Plate XXX. fig. 2.) be two similar and similarly situated ellipses that have the same centre O; and let the straight line <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">AB</a> cut them both; then AC and BD are equal. Bisect CD in L, and through L and the common centre draw the straight line HMNK to cut both ellipses. Because the ellipses are similar and similarly situated, and that CD is an ordinate of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a> MN, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> that AB will be an ordinate of the diameter HK; therefore, AB and CD being both bisected in L, AC is equal to BD.\n\n3. If there be two ellipses, one within the other, such that, any straight line being drawn to cut them, the parts of it between their peripheries are equal to one another; these ellipses are concentric, similar, and similarly situated.\n\nLet D (fig. 2.) be any point in the inner ellipse, and through D draw EF, terminating in the outer ellipse; then, if we make FG = DE, G must be a point in the inner ellipse. Hence all the points of the inner curve are determined, when the outer ellipse and the point D are given; wherefore there cannot be two different curves, both passing through D, that will answer the conditions. But an ellipse described through D, concentric with the outer ellipse, and similar to it, and similarly situated, will answer the conditions (2). Wherefore the two ellipses are concentric, and similar, and similarly situated.\n\n4. If a straight line be drawn to cut two elliptical spheroids, that have the same centre, and are similar and similarly situated, the part of it between the outer and inner surfaces will be equal to one another.\n\nConceive a plane, which contains the straight line, to pass through the common centre of the solids;\nAttraction. the sections made by the plane will be concentric ellipses (1.) ; and these will be similar and similarly situated, because the solids are so; wherefore the parts of the straight line between the surfaces are equal (2.).\n\n5. If two elliptical spheroids that have the same centre, and are similar and similarly situated, be cut by a plane, the two sections will be concentric ellipses that are similar and similarly situated.\n\nFor the sections are ellipses (1.) ; and, any straight line being drawn to cut them, the parts of it between the peripheries will be equal (4.) ; wherefore the ellipses are concentric, similar, and similarly situated (3.)\n\n6. Let ADE and CFG (fig. 3.) be two concentric ellipses that are similar and similarly situated; let AO and CO, in the same straight line, be two of their axes, and let DE, drawn through C, be perpendicular to AO; then if CF and CG be two chords of the interior ellipse that make equal angles with the axis CO, and if the chords DM and DN of the exterior ellipse be drawn respectively parallel to CF and CG; the sum of CF and CG will be equal to the sum or difference of DM and DN, according as they both fall on the same side, or on different sides of DE.\n\nFor draw EP parallel to CF, and it will likewise be parallel to DM. Because CF and CG are equally inclined to CO and to DE, it is plain that DN and RP, which are parallel to CF and CG, are likewise equally inclined to DE; consequently DN = EP.\n\nDraw a straight line through the common centre to bisect DM in L, and that straight line will likewise bisect EP, parallel to DM, in H; and because the ellipses are similar and similarly situated, the same straight line will likewise bisect the chord CF of the interior ellipse, in K. Because DC = CE, therefore DL + EH = 2CK = CF. Wherefore DM + DN = 2DL + 2EH = 2CF = CF + CG.\n\nThe demonstration of the other case, when DM and DN fall on different sides of DE, is entirely similar.\n\nSome general Properties, resulting from the Law of Attraction, that obtains in Nature.\n\n7. Let AB and EF (fig. 4.) be two indefinitely slender pyramids, that are similar to one another, and both composed of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMOGENEOUS\">homogeneous</a> matter, which attracts in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERSE\">inverse</a> proportion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> of the distance; the attractions of the pyramids upon particles placed at the vertices A and E, are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to the length of the pyramids.\n\nConceive each of the pyramids to be divided into an indefinitely great number of thin slices of equal thickness, by planes parallel to its base; then, if CD and GH be any two of these slices, their attractions upon particles placed at A and E, will be proportional to \\(\\frac{CD}{AC}\\) and \\(\\frac{GH}{EG^2}\\). Now, these are equal: for, the solids CD and GH, having the same thickness, they are proportional to the sections CM and GN, that is, to \\(AC^2\\) and \\(EG^2\\), because the pyramids are similar. Wherefore, the attraction of any one of the slices in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYRAMID\">pyramid</a> AB, upon a particle placed at A, is equal to the attraction of any one of the slices in EF upon a particle placed at E. Consequently, the whole attraction of the pyramid AB, is to the whole attraction of the pyramid EF, as the number of slices in AB to the number of slices in EF, that is, as the length AB to the length EF.\n\nCor. 1. The attractions of any portions of the pyramid, are as the lengths of the portions. For the attractions are proportional to the number of slices in the portions, that is, as the lengths.\n\nCor. 2. If the pyramids have different densities, their attractions are proportional to the lengths multiplied by the densities. For, in this case, the attraction of each slice will be proportional to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol7.html#article-DENSITY\">density</a>: wherefore, the attractions will be as the densities multiplied by the number of slices; or, as the densities multiplied by the lengths.\n\n8. If there be two similar solids composed of the same homogeneous matter, which attracts in the inverse proportion of the square of the distance; any two particles of matter, similarly situated with regard to the solids, will be attracted by them with forces that are proportional to any of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMOLOGOUS\">homologous</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> of the solids.\n\nBecause the solids are similar, they may be resolved into an indefinitely great number of slender pyramids, and frustums of pyramids, that are similar to one another, and similarly placed in the solids; each pyramid having its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERTEX\">vertex</a> at one of the attracted particles. The direct attractions of any corresponding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of pyramids will have constantly the same ratio to one another: for they will be as the lengths of the pyramids or frustums (7.) ; that is, because the solids are similar, as any two homologous lines of the solids. Therefore, the whole attractive forces, compounded of all the direct attractions which act in directions that make the same angles with one another, will likewise have to one another the proportion of any two of the homologous lines of the solids.\n\nCor. If the two solids have different densities, their attractions will be proportional to the densities multiplied by any homologous lines of the solids (7. Cor. 2.).\n\n9. If there be two concentric elliptical spheroids that are similar and similarly situated, a particle placed anywhere within the inner surface will be in equilibrium, or will be urged equally in all opposite directions by the shell of homogeneous matter contained between the two surfaces, supposing the law of attraction to be that of the inverse proportion of the square of the distance.\n\nLet P (Plate XXX. fig. 5.) be a particle placed within such a shell, and let a slender double pyramid, having P for the common vertex, be extended to meet the surfaces of the solid on both sides of P. The portions of the pyramid, AGHB and CEF between the surfaces on opposite sides of P, will have equal lengths (4.) ; wherefore, these portions will attract a particle placed at P with equal forces (7. Cor. 1.). The same thing may be proved of all the pyramids which have their vertices at P, and fill the spheroids. Wherefore, P is attracted equally in all opposite directions by the homogeneous matter contained between the surfaces of the spheroids.\n\n10. To find the attractive force of an indefinitely slender <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRISM\">prism</a>, acting in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> parallel to the prism, upon a particle of matter placed anywhere.\nLet BC (Plate XXX. fig. 6.) be a prism of homogeneous matter, upon the indefinitely slender base CH, and let a particle of matter be placed at A; draw AB and AC to the extremities of the prism, and AE to any point in it; and draw <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-AD\">AD</a> perpendicular to BC. Let S = base CH, and put AD = a, DE = x; the element of the prism is \\( S \\times dx \\); the element of the attraction in the direction AE, is \\( \\frac{S \\times dx}{AE^2} \\); and the element of the attraction in the direction parallel to the prism, is \\( \\frac{S \\times dx}{AE^2} \\times \\frac{DE}{AE} = \\frac{S \\times dx}{(a^2 + x^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}}} \\).\n\nNow, \\( \\int \\frac{S \\times dx}{(a^2 + x^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}}} = \\text{Const.} - \\frac{S}{\\sqrt{a^2 + x^2}} = \\text{Const.} \\)\n\n\\( \\frac{S}{AE} \\); and the constant quantity is determined by making the fluent begin at the end of the prism nearer to A; wherefore, the whole attractive force of the prism, in the direction parallel to the prism, is\n\n\\[ S \\times \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{AB} - \\frac{1}{AC} \\right\\}. \\]\n\nCor. In like manner may the attractive force of the prism be found, when the attraction of the particles is proportional to any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a> of the distance.\n\nLet \\( AB = f, AC = f' \\); suppose that \\( \\varphi(f) \\) is the function of the distance that expresses the law of attraction; and put \\( \\int df \\cdot \\varphi(f) = \\Psi(f) \\); then the attraction parallel to the prism, is\n\n\\[ S \\times \\left\\{ \\Psi(f) - \\Psi(f') \\right\\}, \\]\n\nobserving that the attraction is always positive.\n\nAttraction of Spheres.\n\n11. Spheres of the same homogeneous matter, attract particles placed on their surfaces, with forces proportional to their radii.\n\nSpheres being similar solid figures, this proposition is no more than a particular case of what was before proved (8.).\n\nCor. If the spheres have different densities, the attractions at their surfaces are proportional to their radii multiplied by their densities (8. Cor.).\n\n12. The force with which a particle, placed anywhere within a sphere of homogeneous matter, is urged towards the centre, is proportional to its distance from the centre.\n\nConceive a concentric sphere to be described, which contains the attracted particle in its surface; the matter between the two surfaces will exert no force on the particle (9.), which will therefore be urged to the centre, only by the attraction of the inner sphere, in the surface of which it is placed: but this force is proportional to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RADIUS\">radius</a> of the sphere, or to the distance of the particle from the centre (11.).\n\n13. Let PNQ and ABC (fig. 7.) be two spheres of the same homogeneous matter, which attracts in the inverse proportion of the square of the distance: let the centres of the spheres be at M and D, and take MR equal to the radius of the sphere ABC, and ED equal to the radius of the sphere PNQ; the attractions of the spheres upon particles placed at R and E are to one another as the squares of the radii of the spheres.\n\nIn the spheres draw two great circles perpendicular to the diameters PQ and AC, that pass through the points R and E; and let PpQ and AbC be two great circles, making equal indefinitely small angles NMp and BD6 with the great circles PNQ and ABC. Let HK and FG, parallel to PQ and AC, be any two chords of the circles PpQ and AbC, that subtend similar arcs, or arcs containing the same number of degrees; and through HK and FG, let planes perpendicular to the circles PpQ and AbC, be drawn to cut the portions of the spheres contained in the angles NMp and BD6: join RH, RK, MH, MK, DF, DG, EF, EG. Because the arcs subtended by HK and FG, are like parts of their circumferences, it is plain, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> RMH = EDF, and RMK = EDG. And because ED = MH = MK, and RM = DF = DG (hyp.), therefore RH = EF, and RK = EG.\n\nConceive the chords HK and FG, together with the planes passing through them, to change their place a little, so as to describe two slender prisms, or elements of the portions of the spheres contained in the angles NMp and BD6. It is plain that MR and DO, the distances of the chords HG and FG from the centres of their circles, are constantly proportional to MN and DB, the radii of the spheres; wherefore RT and OS, the perpendicular sections of the small prisms, are similar figures, and have to one another the same ratio that MX\u00b2 has to DO\u00b2, or MN\u00b2 to DB\u00b2. Now, the attraction of the prism HK urging a particle at R to the centre M, is\n\n\\[ XT \\times \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{RH} - \\frac{1}{RK} \\right\\} \\] (10.); and the attraction of the prism FG urging a particle at E to the centre D, is\n\n\\[ OS \\times \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{EF} - \\frac{1}{EG} \\right\\}. \\]\n\nBut, in consequence of what was proved,\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{RH} - \\frac{1}{RK} = \\frac{1}{EF} - \\frac{1}{EG}; \\]\n\nwherefore the attractions of the prisms are to one another as XT to OS, or as MN\u00b2 to DB\u00b2.\u2014The same thing may be proved of all the elements of the two portions of the spheres contained in the angles NMp and BD6; wherefore those portions attract particles at R and E with forces proportional to the squares of the radii of the spheres. But because the small angles NMp and BD6 are equal, each of the spheres may be divided into an equal number of such portions; wherefore the attractions of the whole spheres upon particles placed at R and E, are proportional to the squares of the radii of the spheres.\n\nCor. This proposition is true, when the particles of matter attract one another with forces proportional to any proposed function of the distance.\n\nLet RH = EF = f, and RK = EG = f'; then, adopting the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOTATION\">notation</a> as before (8. Cor.), the attractions of the prisms urging particles placed at R and E to the centres M and D, are respectively XT \\( \\times \\left\\{ \\Psi(f) - \\Psi(f') \\right\\} \\), and OS \\( \\times \\left\\{ \\Psi(f) - \\Psi(f') \\right\\} \\); consequently, those attractions have the same pro-\nportion that RT has to SO, or MN\u00b2 to DB\u00b2. Wherefore the attractions of the whole spheres are in the same proportion.\n\n14. A particle placed anywhere without a sphere of homogeneous matter which attracts in the inverse proportion of the square of the distance, will be urged to the centre of the sphere, with a force that is inversely proportional to the square of the particle's distance from the centre.\n\nLet ABC (Plate XXX. fig. 8.) be the sphere, O its centre, and P a particle without the sphere: conceive a concentric sphere PMN, of the same homogeneous matter with the sphere ABC, to be described with the radius PO. Then, by the last proposition, the attraction of the sphere ABC upon the particle P, is to the attraction of the sphere PMN upon a particle placed at A, as AO\u00b2 to PO\u00b2. But the attraction of the sphere PMN upon a particle placed at A, is equal to the attraction of the sphere ABC upon the same particle; for the attraction of the matter between the two spherical surfaces exerts no force upon a particle at A (9.). Therefore, in the proportion set down above, the two middle terms are constantly the same wherever the point P is placed without the sphere ABC. Consequently, the first term of the proportion must follow the inverse ratio of the last term; that is, the attraction of the sphere ABC upon the external particle at P is inversely proportional to PO\u00b2.\n\n15. The same law of attraction being supposed, a homogeneous sphere will attract a particle placed without it, with the same force as if all the matter of the sphere were collected in the centre.\n\nLet f denote the distance of the particle from the centre; then it follows, from the last proposition, that the attraction of the sphere upon the particle will have, for its measure, \\( \\frac{A}{f^2} \\); A denoting a constant quantity that will be determined by any particular case; that is, by the actual attractive force corresponding to any determinate distance from the centre. Let r denote the radius of the sphere, and M its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>; then no part of the matter of the sphere being nearer the attracted particle than \\((f-r)\\), and none of it more remote than \\((f+r)\\), the attraction of the sphere on the particle will be greater than \\( \\frac{M}{(f-r)^2} \\), and less than \\( \\frac{M}{(f+r)^2} \\). Therefore \\( \\frac{A}{f^2} \\) is always contained between those limits, which requires that \\( A = M \\). For, if A were greater than M, such values of f might be found as would make \\( \\frac{A}{f^2} \\) equal to, or greater than \\( \\frac{M}{(f-r)^2} \\); and, if A were less than M, such values of f might be found as would make \\( \\frac{A}{f^2} \\) equal to, or less than \\( \\frac{M}{(f+r)^2} \\).\n\nTherefore \\( A = M \\); and the attraction of the sphere is equal to \\( \\frac{M}{f^2} \\), or the same as if all the matter were collected in the centre.\n\nIf the radius of the sphere \\( = r \\), the density of the Attraction matter contained in it \\( = d \\); then the mass, or \\( M = \\frac{4\\pi r^3d}{3} \\) (\\( \\pi \\) being the circumference of the circle whose diameter is unit), and the attraction of the sphere at the distance \\( f \\) from the centre \\( = \\frac{4\\pi r^3d}{3f^2} \\). This is still true at the surface of the sphere when \\( f = r \\), so that the attraction at the surface \\( = \\frac{4\\pi rd}{3} \\); which expression, with the help of what is proved in (12.), enables us to compare the intensities of the attractions of homogeneous spheres, at all distances from the centre, without or within the surfaces.\n\nCor. 1. A shell of homogeneous matter contained between two concentric spherical surfaces, will attract a particle placed without it, with the same force as if all the matter of the shell were collected in its centre.\n\nFor the attractive force of such a shell is equal to the difference of the attractions of two concentric spheres of the same homogeneous matter with the shell.\n\nCor. 2. A sphere composed of concentric shells, that vary in their densities according to any law, will attract a particle placed without it, with the same force as if all the matter were collected in the centre.\n\nFor this having been proved of one shell (Cor. 1.), it must be true of any number of shells.\n\nIf \\( \\varphi(r) \\) denote the density at the distance \\( r \\) from the centre, the quantity of matter in the sphere will be \\( = \\int_0^r \\varphi(r) r^2 dr \\); and the attraction on a particle without the sphere at the distance \\( f \\) from the centre \\( = \\frac{4\\pi f \\varphi(r) r^2 dr}{f^2} \\).\n\n16. Two spheres, each composed of concentric shells of variable density, attract one another with the same force as if all the matter of each were collected in its centre.\n\nFor the attraction of a sphere A upon every particle of another sphere B will remain the same, if we suppose all the matter of A to be collected in its centre (15.). But the attraction of any particles of matter placed in A's centre, upon the sphere B, is equal and opposite to the attraction of B, upon the same matter so placed: and, again, the attraction of B upon all the particles placed in the centre of A, will remain unchanged, if we suppose the matter of B to be collected in its centre. Wherefore A attracts B with the same force as if the matter of each were collected in its centre.\n\n17. Supposing that the particles of matter attract with a force proportional to the distance, a body of any shape will attract a particle of matter placed anywhere with the same force, and in the same direction, as if all the matter of the body were collected in its centre of gravity.\n\nSuppose that the attracted particle is placed at P (fig. 9.), and the centre of gravity of the attracting body at G; join PG, and let any plane pass through that line. Let L be a small part, or element of the body, and\nAttraction. From L draw LK perpendicular to the plane passing through PG, and KF perpendicular to PG; join PL and PK. Put dm to denote the quantity of matter, or the mass of the element L; then its attractive force, urging the particle in the direction PL, is \\( PL \\times dm \\), which, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> of forces, is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to the two forces, \\( PK \\times dm \\) and \\( KL \\times dm \\); and, again, the single force \\( PK \\times dm \\) is equivalent to the two forces \\( FK \\times dm \\) and \\( PF \\times dm = PG \\times dm + GF \\times dm \\). Therefore, the attraction of the element L, upon the particle at P, is equivalent to these four separate forces, viz. \\( PG \\times dm \\), \\( GF \\times dm \\), \\( FK \\times dm \\), \\( KL \\times dm \\), which urge the particle P respectively in the directions, PG, GF, FK, KL. But, from the nature of the centre of gravity, the sum of all the forces, \\( KL \\times dm \\), that urge the particle P to one side of the plane passing through PG, is just equal to the sum of the forces that urge it to the other side of the same plane; and the sum of all the forces, \\( FK \\times dm \\), that urge P to one side of the line PG, is just equal to the sum of the forces that urge it to the other side of the same line; and the sum of all the forces, \\( GF \\times dm \\), that urge P towards the point G, is just equal to the sum of the forces that urge it from the same point. Therefore all the preceding forces mutually destroy one another, excepting the forces, \\( PG \\times dm \\), the sum of which, when extended to all the elements of the attracting body, is \\( = PG \\times \\text{mass of the body} \\). Therefore the whole attraction upon P is the same as if all the matter of the body were collected in its centre of gravity.\n\nCor. Supposing that the particles of matter attract with a force proportional to the distance, a homogeneous sphere will attract a particle placed anywhere in the same manner as if all the matter of the sphere were collected in the centre.\n\nFor the centre of gravity of a homogeneous sphere, is the same as the centre of its figure. This corollary is likewise true of a sphere composed of concentric shells of variable density; and it is easy to apply the demonstration of (16.) to prove that, in this law of attraction, two spheres, each composed of concentric shells of variable density, will attract one another with the same force as if the matter of each were collected in its centre.\n\n18. To investigate what are the laws of attraction, in regard to the distance, according to which a shell of homogeneous matter, contained between two concentric spherical surfaces, will attract a particle placed without it, in the same manner as if all the matter of the shell were collected in the centre.\n\nIt has been proved that this property actually belongs to homogeneous shells in the law of attraction which obtains in nature, and likewise when the particles of matter attract with a force proportional to the distance; but it is interesting to know whether it is confined to these two cases alone, or extends to other laws of attraction. This can only be discovered by a direct analysis.\n\nLet \\( r = PC \\) (fig. 10.), the distance of the attracted point from the centre of the shell; \\( u = CA \\) the radius of the inner surface of the shell; \\( f = PM \\), the distance of P from any point in the surface. Having drawn the diameter AD through P, let AMD and AND be two great circles, making, with one another, an indefinitely small angle MAN = \\( dq \\); and let two Attraction, small circles BMG, bmg, indefinitely near one another, of which A and D are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-POLES\">poles</a>, meet the former circles in M, N, m, n; and draw MS, NS to the centre of the circle BMG. Put \\( \\delta \\) for the measure of the arc AM; then \\( MS = u \\sin \\delta \\); \\( MN = dq \\cdot u \\sin \\delta \\); \\( MM = u^2 dq \\cdot d\\delta \\sin \\delta \\); and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRILATERAL\">quadrilateral</a> space \\( MNmm = u^2 dq \\cdot d\\delta \\sin \\delta \\). We may suppose the thickness of the shell indefinitely small; since, if the property belong to an elementary shell indefinitely thin, it will be true of one of a determinate thickness, which can be resolved into such elements. Suppose the thickness of the shell to be \\( = du \\); then, the quantity of matter in the part standing upon the quadrilateral space \\( MNmm = u^2 du \\cdot dq \\cdot d\\delta \\sin \\delta \\). Let \\( \\varphi(f) \\) represent the direct attraction of a particle at M in the direction PM; then its attraction directed to the centre C \\( = \\varphi(f) \\times \\frac{PS}{PM} = \\frac{r - u \\cos \\delta}{f} \\times \\varphi(f) \\); and the attraction of the element of the shell in the same direction \\( = u^2 du \\cdot dq \\cdot d\\delta \\sin \\delta \\times \\frac{r - u \\cos \\delta}{f} \\cdot \\varphi(f) \\).\n\nThis expression is proportional to \\( dq \\), when \\( \\delta \\) and \\( f \\) remain constant; and, therefore (denoting by \\( \\sigma \\) the circumference of the circle whose diameter is unit), the attraction of the whole zone contained between the small circles BMG, bmg, will be \\( = 2 \\pi u^2 du \\cdot d\\delta \\sin \\delta \\cdot \\frac{r - u \\cos \\delta}{f} \\cdot \\varphi(f) \\); and the attractive force of the whole shell will be\n\n\\[ 2 \\pi u^2 du \\int d\\delta \\sin \\delta \\cdot \\frac{r - u \\cos \\delta}{f} \\cdot \\varphi(f) \\]\n\nthe fluent to be extended from \\( \\delta = 0 \\) to \\( \\delta = \\pi \\).\n\nAgain, the quantity of matter in the shell is \\( = 4 \\pi u^2 du \\); and the attraction of this matter placed in the centre, at the distance \\( r \\) from P, is \\( = 4 \\pi u^2 du \\cdot \\varphi(r) \\).\n\nIf now we equate the attraction of the shell, to the attraction of its matter placed in the centre, and leave out the factors common to both, we shall get\n\n\\[ 2 \\pi u^2 \\int d\\delta \\sin \\delta \\cdot \\frac{r - u \\cos \\delta}{f} \\cdot \\varphi(f) \\]\n\nthe limits of the integral being the same as before.\n\nBut \\( f^2 = r^2 - 2ru \\cos \\delta + u^2 \\); then \\( d\\delta \\sin \\delta = \\frac{fd\\delta}{ru} \\); also \\( r - u \\cos \\delta = \\frac{f^2 + r^2 - u^2}{2r} \\); wherefore, by substitution, we get\n\n\\[ 4 \\pi u^2 \\varphi(r) \\cdot u = \\int (f^2 + r^2 - u^2) \\cdot df \\cdot \\varphi(f) \\]\n\nor, which is equivalent, \\( 4 \\pi u^2 \\varphi(r) \\cdot u = \\int (f^2 + r^2 - u^2) \\cdot df \\cdot \\varphi(f) - 2 \\int fdf \\cdot \\int df \\cdot \\varphi(f) \\),\n\nthe limits of this integral being from \\( f = r - u \\) to \\( f = r + u \\), which correspond to \\( \\delta = 0 \\) and \\( \\delta = \\pi \\).\n\nNow let \\( \\int df \\cdot \\varphi(f) = \\psi(f) \\); and \\( \\int fdf \\cdot \\int df \\cdot \\varphi(f) = \\int fdf \\cdot \\psi(f) = \\psi'(f) \\); then, by taking the fluents between the proper limits, we get\nAttraction.\n\n\\[ \\varphi(r) = 2r \\left\\{ (r+u)^n - (r-u)^n \\right\\} - 2 \\left\\{ r^n + u^n \\right\\}. \\]\n\nIf we develope the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BINOMIAL\">binomial</a> functions in the last expression, all the even powers of \\( u \\) will disappear, and the odd powers only will remain; these last terms being all contained in this general formula,\n\n\\[ \\text{viz. } \\frac{4}{1,2,3 \\ldots 2n+1} \\left\\{ r \\cdot \\frac{d^{2n+1}}{dr^{2n+1}} \\varphi(r) \\right\\}^n. \\]\n\nand, observing that \\( \\frac{d}{dr} \\varphi(r) = r \\varphi(r) \\), the same expression will become\n\n\\[ \\frac{4}{1,2,3 \\ldots 2n+1} \\left\\{ r \\cdot \\frac{d^{2n+1}}{dr^{2n+1}} \\varphi(r) \\right\\}^n. \\]\n\nwhich, again, is more simply expressed thus, viz.\n\n\\[ \\frac{4}{1,2,3 \\ldots 2n+1} \\left\\{ r \\cdot \\frac{d^{2n+1}}{dr^{2n+1}} \\varphi(r) \\right\\}^n. \\]\n\nWherefore, by substituting the development instead of the functions, and then, by dividing by \\( 4r^2 \\), we get\n\n\\[ \\varphi(r) = \\frac{d}{dr} \\varphi(r) + \\frac{1}{1,2,3} \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{r} \\cdot \\frac{d^2}{dr^2} \\varphi(r) \\right\\}^n. \\]\n\nFrom the nature of the function \\( \\varphi(r) \\), we get \\( \\varphi(r) = \\frac{d}{dr} \\varphi(r) \\); therefore each of the remaining terms must be separately equal to nothing: Hence\n\n\\[ \\frac{d}{dr} \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{r} \\cdot \\frac{d^2}{dr^2} \\varphi(r) \\right\\} = 0; \\]\n\nfrom which we find \\( r \\varphi(r) = \\frac{1}{2} A r^2 + A' r - A'' \\),\n\n\\( A, A', A'' \\) being arbitrary constant quantities; and this value of \\( r \\varphi(r) \\), it is plain, will likewise render all the succeeding terms of the development evanescent. Therefore\n\n\\[ \\varphi(r) = \\frac{d}{dr} \\varphi(r) = A r + \\frac{A'}{r}. \\]\n\nThus the most general expression of the law of attraction, that possesses the property in question, is a combination of the two laws above mentioned, with each of which it coincides, according as we make the one or other of the constant quantities equal to nothing. We have therefore a direct proof, that the law of nature is the only one which will make the attraction decrease as the distance increases, and in which a spherical shell, or a sphere, will attract in the same manner as if all the matter were collected in the centre.\n\nLaplace has arrived at the same conclusion by a different process. (Mech. Celeste, Liv. 2d. Chap. 2. No. 12. Rem. Part.)\n\nAttraction of Spheroids of Revolution.\n\n19. Let \\( APBQ \\) (Plate XXXI, fig. 11.) and \\( CMDN \\) be two concentric ellipses, similar to one another, and similarly situated, of which \\( AB \\) and \\( CD \\) are either the greater, or less, axes; and let \\( PCQ \\) be perpendicular to \\( AB \\). Conceive the ellipse to revolve about \\( PQ \\) so as to describe an indefinitely small angle; then, supposing the law of attraction to be inversely proportional to the square of the distance, the thin solid of homogeneous matter described by the ellipse \\( APBQ \\) will attract a particle placed at \\( P \\), in a direction perpendicular to any plane passing through \\( PQ \\), with the same force that the thin solid of the same matter described by the ellipse \\( CMDN \\), will attract a particle placed at \\( C \\) perpendicularly to the same plane.\n\nFrom \\( C \\) draw \\( CM, CN \\), making equal angles with \\( CD \\), and \\( PR, PT \\) respectively parallel to \\( CM, CN \\); and let \\( Cm, Ca, Pr, Pt \\) be drawn in the same manner, and indefinitely near the former lines. While the ellipses revolve about \\( PQ \\), the small sectors will describe pyramids that have their vertices at \\( C \\) and \\( P \\).\n\nIt is manifest that the pyramids so described are similar; for their angles at \\( C \\) and \\( P \\) in the planes of the ellipses are equal; and their other angles described by revolving about \\( PQ \\) are likewise equal, because the sectors are equally inclined to that axis. Wherefore, the direct attractions of all the small pyramids upon the particles \\( P \\) and \\( C \\), are proportional to the lengths \\( PR, PT, CM, CN \\); and consequently the forces that urge the particles \\( P \\) and \\( C \\) in a direction at right angles to any plane passing through \\( PQ \\), are proportional to the perpendiculars let fall upon that plane from \\( R, T, M, N \\). But, because \\( PR, PT, CM, CN \\) are equally inclined to \\( PQ \\), they will make equal angles with any plane passing through \\( PQ \\); wherefore the perpendiculars drawn to the plane from \\( R, T, M, N \\), will be respectively proportional to \\( CM, CN, PR, PT \\). But \\( CM + CN = PR + PT \\); wherefore, the sum of the perpendiculars drawn to the plane from \\( M \\) and \\( N \\), will be equal to the sum of the perpendiculars drawn to it from \\( R \\) and \\( T \\). Consequently the force of the pyramids \\( PR \\) and \\( PT \\), which urges the particle \\( P \\) at right angles to the plane, is equal to the force of the pyramids \\( CM \\) and \\( CN \\), which urges the particle \\( C \\) in a parallel direction. The same thing is true of all the small pyramids that make up the thin solids described by the ellipses \\( APBQ \\) and \\( CMDN \\); and it is therefore true of the whole solids.\n\nIt is to be observed, that when the pyramids \\( PR \\) and \\( PT \\) fall on opposite sides of \\( PQ \\), it is the difference of their attractions which is equal to the sum of the attractions of \\( CM \\) and \\( CN \\); and it is the difference of the perpendiculars let fall from \\( T \\) and \\( R \\) on opposite sides of the plane, which is equal to the sum of the perpendiculars let fall from \\( M \\) and \\( N \\).\n20. Let \\( APBQ \\) be a spheroid of revolution, \\( PQ \\) the axis of revolution, and \\( ACB \\) a plane through the centre perpendicular to \\( PQ \\) (Plate XXXI, fig. 12.). If \\( D \\) be a particle in the surface of the spheroid, and \\( DL \\) perpendicular to the plane \\( ACB \\); then the attraction of the spheroid on a particle placed at the pole \\( P \\), will be to the force with which a particle placed at \\( C \\), is attracted in the direction \\( DL \\), as \\( PC \\) is to \\( DL \\).\n\nThrough \\( D \\) draw a plane parallel to the plane \\( ACB \\), and let the plane so drawn cut the axis \\( PQ \\) in \\( F \\): draw the straight line \\( DFE \\) to terminate in the spheroid, and describe another spheroid through \\( F \\), having the same centre with the spheroid \\( APBQ \\), and similar to it, and similarly situated. Conceive an indefinitely great number of planes, making indefinitely small angles with one another, to be drawn through \\( DE \\), so as to divide the two spheroids into an indefinitely great number of thin solids, or slices; then the sections which every one of the planes makes with the spheroids will be similar ellipses, having the same centre (\\( s_1 \\)); and it is manifest that a straight line drawn through \\( F \\) at right angles to \\( DE \\), in any one of the planes, will pass through the centre of the two ellipses contained in it, and will coincide with an axis of each. Therefore, the force with which every one of the slices, or elements, of the spheroid \\( APBQ \\) attracts a particle placed at \\( D \\) in the direction \\( DL \\), is equal to the force with which the corresponding slice, or element, of the spheroid \\( GFHK \\), attracts a particle placed at \\( F \\) in the direction \\( FC \\) (19.). Therefore, the whole attraction of the spheroid \\( APBQ \\) upon a particle at \\( D \\), in the direction \\( DL \\), is equal to the whole attraction of the spheroid \\( GFHK \\), upon a particle at \\( F \\). But the attractions of the spheroids \\( APBQ \\) and \\( GFHK \\), upon particles placed at \\( P \\) and \\( F \\), are to one another as \\( PC \\) to \\( FC \\) (8.). Therefore, the attraction of the spheroid \\( APBQ \\) upon a particle at \\( P \\), is to the force with which the same spheroid attracts a particle at \\( D \\), in the direction \\( DL \\), as \\( PC \\) is to \\( FC \\) or \\( DL \\).\n\n21. Let \\( APBQ \\) be a spheroid of revolution, and \\( PQ \\) the axis of revolution, as before. If \\( D \\) be a particle in the surface, \\( ADPB \\) (fig. 13.) a section through \\( D \\), and the axis \\( PQ \\), and \\( DL \\) perpendicular to \\( PQ \\); the attraction of the spheroid upon a particle at \\( A \\), will be to the force with which a particle at \\( D \\) is attracted, in the direction \\( DL \\), as \\( AC \\) is to \\( DL \\).\n\nThrough \\( D \\) draw a plane perpendicular to \\( AB \\), which cuts the section \\( ADB \\) in the straight line \\( DFE \\); and let a spheroid \\( FGHK \\) be described through \\( F \\), having the same centre with the spheroid \\( APBQ \\), and similar to it, and similarly situated. Then, conceiving the two spheroids to be divided into an indefinitely great number of thin slices by planes passing through \\( DE \\), the force with which every slice, or element, of the spheroid \\( APBQ \\) attracts a particle at \\( D \\) in the direction \\( DL \\), will be equal to the force with which the corresponding slice, or element, of the spheroid \\( FGHK \\) attracts a particle at \\( F \\) (19.). But the attractions of the spheroids \\( APBQ \\) and \\( FGHK \\) upon particles placed at \\( A \\) and \\( F \\), are to one another as \\( AC \\) to \\( CF \\) (8.). Therefore, the attraction of the spheroid \\( APBQ \\) upon a particle at \\( A \\), is to the force with which the same spheroid attracts a particle at \\( D \\), in the direction \\( DL \\), as \\( AC \\) to \\( FL \\) or \\( DL \\).\n\nThe two last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a> will enable us to find both the direction and the intensity of the attraction of a homogeneous spheroid of revolution upon a particle placed anywhere on the surface, when we have ascertained the attractive forces at the poles, and at the circumference of the circular section made by a plane through the centre perpendicular to the axis. For the whole attraction at any point, is the compound force arising from the attractions perpendicular to the axis, and parallel to it. The next object of our research is, therefore, to determine the two forces above-mentioned, viz. the attraction at the poles, and at the circular section, equally distant from both poles.\n\n22. Let \\( ADB \\) be an indefinitely slender pyramid, of which the base \\( BD \\) is perpendicular to the edge \\( AD \\) (fig. 14.): let \\( B = \\text{base } BD \\), and \\( f = \\text{length } AD \\); then \\( \\frac{B}{f} \\) is the attraction of the whole matter of the pyramid upon a particle placed at the vertex \\( A \\).\n\nLet \\( AM = x \\); then the section \\( MN \\) parallel to the base \\( BD = \\frac{Bx^2}{f^2} \\); and, \\( MP = \\text{element of the prism} = \\frac{Bx^2dx}{f^2} \\); and the attraction of the element upon a particle placed at \\( A = \\frac{MP}{AM^2} = \\frac{Bdx}{f^2} \\); the fluent of which is \\( \\frac{Bx}{f^2} = \\text{attraction of the pyramid } AM \\) upon a particle at \\( A \\). And, when \\( x = f \\), this becomes \\( \\frac{B}{f} = \\text{attraction of the pyramid } AD \\) upon a particle placed at \\( A \\).\n\n23. To investigate the attraction of a homogeneous spheroid of revolution, upon a particle placed at the pole.\n\nLet \\( P \\) (fig. 15.) be the pole, \\( PCQ \\) the axis of revolution, and \\( APBQ \\) a section of the spheroid by a plane passing through \\( PQ \\), and any point \\( M \\), in the surface; draw \\( PM, PM' \\) indefinitely near \\( PM \\), and \\( MM' \\) perpendicular to \\( PM \\). Conceive the plane \\( PMQ \\) to revolve about \\( PQ \\), so as to describe the indefinitely small angle \\( BCO \\); then the small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a> \\( MMP' \\) will describe a slender pyramid, having its vertex at \\( P \\), and of which the base is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECTANGLE\">rectangle</a>, contained by \\( MM' \\) and \\( RT \\); for the point \\( M \\) moving parallel to \\( R \\), it will describe a line equal and parallel to that described by \\( R \\), namely, to \\( RT \\).\n\nLet \\( PM = f \\); and the angle \\( KPM \\), which \\( PM \\) makes with a perpendicular to the axis, \\( = \\phi \\); and the indefinitely small angle \\( BCO = d\\phi \\).

To investigate the attraction of a homogeneous spheroid of revolution, on a particle placed in the circumference of the circular section, made by a plane through the centre, at right angles, to the axis of revolution.\n\nLet P (Plate XXXI. fig. 16.) be the pole, PC the axis of revolution. A, a point in the circular section AOB, made by a plane through the centre perpendicular to PC. Let M be any point in the surface of the spheroid; AMO a section through A and M by a plane perpendicular to AOB; AM a line in that plane indefinitely near AM, and MM perpendicular to AM; MR perpendicular to AO, and RS to AB. Conceive the plane AMO to revolve about A, so as to describe an indefinitely small angle OAM; then the triangle AMR will describe a slender pyramid, having its vertex at A, and of which the base is equal to a rectangle contained by MM and RT; for the point M moving parallel to the point R, it will describe a line equal to that described by R, namely to RT.\n\nLet AM = \\( f \\); the angle MAR = \\( \\varphi \\); and the angle OAQ = \\( d\\varphi \\); then MM = \\( f d\\varphi \\); and TR = AR \\( \\times \\) \\( d\\varphi \\) \\( = f \\cos \\varphi \\cdot d\\varphi \\). Wherefore, B = base of the pyramid described by MM = \\( d\\varphi \\cdot d\\theta \\cos \\varphi \\cdot f^2 \\); and the direct attraction of the pyramid in the direction AM = \\( \\frac{B}{f} \\)\n\n\\( = d\\varphi \\cdot d\\theta \\cos \\varphi \\cdot f \\). Therefore, the elementary attraction of the spheroid, in the direction AC = direct attraction of the pyramid \\( \\times \\frac{AR}{AM} \\times \\frac{AS}{AR} = d\\varphi \\cos \\varphi \\cdot d\\theta \\cos \\varphi \\cdot f \\cdot f \\).\n\nAgain, let MR = x, RS = y, CS = z, CP = k and AC = \\( k' \\); then (1.)\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x^2}{k^2} + \\frac{y^2}{k^2} + \\frac{z^2}{k^2} = 1.\n\\]\n\nBut \\( x = f \\sin \\varphi; y = AR \\cdot \\sin \\varphi = f \\cos \\varphi \\cdot \\sin \\varphi \\); and \\( z = k' - f \\cos \\varphi \\cdot \\cos \\varphi \\); therefore, by substitution, we get\n\n\\[\n\\frac{f^2 \\sin^2 \\varphi}{k^2} + \\frac{f^2 \\cos^2 \\varphi \\sin^2 \\varphi}{k^2} + \\frac{(k' - f \\cos \\varphi \\cdot \\cos \\varphi)^2}{k^2} = 1.\n\\]\n\nFrom this equation we get\n\n\\[\nf = 2k \\cdot \\frac{\\cos \\varphi \\cdot \\cos \\varphi}{\\cos^2 \\varphi + \\frac{k^2}{k^2} \\sin^2 \\varphi}.\n\\]\n\nLet this value of \\( f \\) be substituted in the expression of the elementary attraction of the spheroid before found, and it will become\nwhich expression, when integrated from $\\phi = 0$ to $\\phi = \\pi$, and from $z = 0$ to $z = 1$, will give the attraction of half the spheroid; and the double of it, viz.\n\n$$4k' \\cdot d\\phi \\cos^2 \\phi \\cdot \\frac{dz}{\\cos^2 \\phi + k'^2 \\sin^2 \\phi},$$\n\nbeing integrated between the same limits, will give the whole attraction of the spheroid.\n\nIn the oblate spheroid, $k$ is less than $k'$; Let $k'^2 = k^2 - k'^2 e^2$, and $z = \\sin \\theta$; and, by substitution, the element of the attractive force will become\n\n$$4k' \\cdot d\\phi \\cos^2 \\phi \\cdot \\frac{dz(1 - z^2)}{1 + e^2 z^2} =$$\n\n$$4k' \\cdot d\\phi \\cos^2 \\phi \\cdot \\frac{1 + e^2}{e^2} \\left\\{ \\frac{dz}{1 + e^2 z^2} - \\frac{dz}{1 + e^2} \\right\\}.$$\n\nAnd, by integrating from $z = 0$ to $z = 1$, we get\n\n$$4k' \\cdot d\\phi \\cos^2 \\phi \\cdot \\frac{1 + e^2}{e^2} \\left\\{ \\text{arc.tan.e} - \\frac{e}{1 + e^2} \\right\\},$$\n\nfor the force with which the matter between the sections that contain the angle OAQ, attracts the particle A to the centre. But\n\n$$\\int d\\phi \\cos^2 \\phi = \\frac{\\pi}{2} (1 + \\cos^2 \\phi) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} \\sin 2\\phi,$$\n\nthe value of which, between the limits $\\phi = 0$, and $\\phi = \\pi$, is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$;\n\nwherefore, the attraction of the spheroid on a particle at A, is equal to\n\n$$2\\pi \\cdot k' \\cdot \\frac{1 + e^2}{e^2} \\left\\{ \\text{arc.tan.e} - \\frac{e}{1 + e^2} \\right\\}.$$ \n\nBecause\n\n$$\\frac{4\\pi k'^2 k}{3} = \\frac{4\\pi k^2 (1 + e^2)}{3} = M,$$\n\nwe get\n\n$$2\\pi \\cdot (1 + e^2) = \\frac{3M}{2k^2}:$$\n\nwherefore, the measure of the attractive force of the oblate spheroid on a particle placed anywhere in the circumference of the circular section made by a plane through the centre at right angles to the axis, is equal to\n\n$$k' \\cdot \\frac{3M}{2k^2 e^2} \\left\\{ \\text{arc.tan.e} - \\frac{e}{1 + e^2} \\right\\}.$$\n\nIn the oblong spheroid, $k$ is greater than $k'$; put $k'^2 = k^2 - k'^2 e^2$: then the element of the attractive force will become, by substitution,\n\n$$4k' \\cdot d\\phi \\cos^2 \\phi \\cdot \\frac{dz(1 - z^2)}{1 - e^2 z^2} = 4k' \\cdot d\\phi \\cos^2 \\phi \\cdot \\frac{1 - e^2}{e^2} \\left\\{ \\frac{dz}{1 - e^2 z^2} - \\frac{dz}{1 - e^2} \\right\\},$$\n\nwhence, by proceeding as before, we get the measure of the attractive force of the oblong spheroid upon a particle placed anywhere in the circumference of the circular section, made by a plane through the centre at right angles to the axis, equal to\n\n$$k' \\cdot \\frac{3M}{2k^2 e^2} \\left\\{ \\text{arc.tan.e} - \\frac{e}{1 + e^2} \\right\\}.$$ \n\nCor. In an oblate spheroid, differing little from a sphere, the higher powers of $e^2$ may be neglected. The expression of the attractive force at the equator, viz.\n\n$$2\\pi \\cdot k' \\cdot \\frac{1 + e^2}{e^2} \\left\\{ \\text{arc.tan.e} - \\frac{e}{1 + e^2} \\right\\},$$\n\nwill then become\n\n$$2\\pi \\cdot k' \\cdot (1 + e^2) \\left( \\frac{2}{3} - \\frac{4}{5} e^2 \\right) = \\frac{4\\pi k'}{3} \\cdot (1 - \\frac{1}{5} e^2).$$\n\nAnd if $k'$, the radius of the equator, $= k + r$; then\n\n$$\\frac{2\\pi}{k} = e^2 (23, Cor.)$$\n\nand the attraction at the equator will be equal to\n\n$$\\frac{4\\pi k}{3} \\cdot (1 + \\frac{r}{k}) \\cdot \\left( 1 - \\frac{2}{5} \\frac{r}{k} \\right) = \\frac{4\\pi k}{3} \\cdot \\left( 1 + \\frac{3}{5} \\frac{r}{k} \\right).$$\n\n25. An oblate spheroid of revolution being given, it is required to find the measures of the attractive forces that urge a particle placed anywhere in the surface, in a direction perpendicular to the axis, and in a direction parallel to it.\n\nLet $k$ and $k'$ be the semiaxes of the ellipse by the revolution of which the spheroid is described, $k$ being the axis about which it revolves; and let $b$ be the perpendicular distance of the particle from the axis, and $a$ its distance from the plane, drawn through the centre at right angles to the axis: Then, from which was proved in (20,) and (21,), the attractions sought will be found by multiplying the attractions at the pole, and at the circular section equally distant from both poles, by $\\frac{a}{k}$ and $\\frac{b}{k'}$.\n\nThus we get the attraction in the direction of $a$, equal to\n\n$$a \\times \\frac{3M}{k e^2} \\left\\{ e - \\text{arc.tan.e} \\right\\};$$\n\nand the attraction in the direction of $b$, equal to\n\n$$b \\times \\frac{3M}{2k^2 e^2} \\left\\{ \\text{arc.tan.e} - \\frac{e}{1 + e^2} \\right\\}.$$ \n\nThe same formul\u00e6 likewise serve for finding the attractions upon a particle placed anywhere within the spheroid. For the attraction upon a particle within the spheroid is equal to the attraction of a similar concentric spheroid, which contains the particle in its surface (9.) and it is evident, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COEFFICIENTS\">coefficients</a>, which multiply $a$ and $b$ in the above expressions, depend only upon the proportion of $k$ and $k'$; and they are therefore the same for all similar spheroids.\n\nIf we denote by $A$ and $B$ the coefficients of $a$ and $b$ in the expressions of the attractive force found above, the whole attraction of the spheroid, which is compounded of the forces $a \\cdot A$ and $b \\cdot B$, will be $\\sqrt{a^2 A^2 + b^2 B^2}$. And if $\\psi$ denote the angle which the direction of this force makes with $a$, or with the axis of the spheroid; then tan. $\\psi = \\frac{b.B}{a.A}$.\nAttraction.\n\nCor. In the very same manner we may determine the attractions of an oblong spheroid of revolution, upon a point in the surface, or within the solid.\n\n26. If \\( k, k', k'' \\), the semiaxes of a homogeneous ellipsoid, be related to those of another ellipsoid of the same matter, \\( h, h', h'' \\), so that \\( k^2 - k'^2 = h^2 - h'^2 \\) and \\( k''^2 - h''^2 = h^2 - h'^2 \\), the attractions perpendicular to the planes of the principal sections, which the first ellipsoid (Plate XXXI., fig. 17.) exerts upon a point determined by the coordinates \\( k \\sin m, h' \\cos m \\sin n, h'' \\cos m \\cos n \\), respectively parallel to \\( k, k', k'' \\), will be to the attractions which the second ellipsoid exerts upon a point determined by the coordinates \\( k \\sin m, h' \\cos m \\sin n, h'' \\cos m \\cos n \\), respectively parallel to \\( h, h', h'' \\), in the direct proportion of the areas of the principal sections to which the attractions are perpendicular.\n\nThis proposition is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> to all elliptical spheroids of what was proved of the sphere in (13.). It is here enunciated of the ellipsoid, because the demonstration is not more difficult for that solid than for spheroids of revolution.\n\nLet \\( ABDM \\) be an ellipsoid, the semiaxes of which are \\( BC = k, EC = k', AC = k'' \\); and \\( acdm \\) another ellipsoid, of which the semiaxes are \\( bc = h, ec = h', ac = h'' \\); those quantities being so related, that \\( k^2 - k'^2 = h^2 - h'^2 \\), and \\( k''^2 - h''^2 = h^2 - h'^2 \\).

Then the force with which the ellipsoid \\( ABDM \\) attracts a particle placed at \\( G \\) in the direction \\( GH \\), will be to the force with which the ellipsoid \\( acdm \\) attracts a particle placed at \\( g \\) in the direction \\( gh \\), as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a> of the section \\( AEDM \\) to the area of the section \\( acdm \\), or as \\( k' k'' \\) to \\( h' h'' \\).\n\nLet \\( RP = k \\sin \\phi; PO = k' \\cos \\phi \\sin \\varphi; \\) and \\( CO = k'' \\cos \\phi \\cos \\varphi; \\) which suppositions are allowable, because they satisfy the equation of the ellipsoid (1.), whatever be the angles \\( \\phi \\) and \\( \\varphi \\).

But the two spheroids may be divided into an equal number of such portions; therefore the spheroids attract particles placed at G and g, in the directions GH and gh, with forces proportional to $k'k''$ and $k''k'$, or to the sections AMDE and amde.\n\nCor. 1. This proposition is true when the law of attraction is expressed by any function of the distance. The demonstration is the same as in the corollary of (13).\n\nCor. 2. If the two ellipsoids be so placed, that their centres, and the planes of their principal sections, shall coincide, the surface of the one will be entirely within the other. Also the point which one ellipsoid attracts, will be in the surface of the other, as is plain from the expressions of the coordinate. And hence, the attraction of one ellipsoid upon a point without the surface, is made to depend upon the attraction of another ellipsoid upon a point within the surface.\n\nCor. 3. When the ellipsoids become spheroids of revolution, the two principal sections through the axis of revolution become equal, and will be represented by any two sections whatever passing through the axis at right angles to one another. But, in this case, the attractions of the spheroids on the points may be reduced to two, one acting perpendicular to the axis, and one parallel to it: And it is plain, that these attractions will be to one another as the areas of the sections, perpendicular to their directions.\n\n27. To find the attraction of an oblate spheroid upon a particle placed without the surface.\n\nLet $k'$ be the radius of the equator, and $k$ the axis of revolution: and let $a$ be the perpendicular distance of the point without the spheroid from the plane of the equator, and $b$ its distance from the axis. In the first place, it is necessary to determine the semiaxis of another oblate spheroid that shall contain the given point in its surface, and such, that it shall have the same centre, and its equator in the same plane, as the given spheroid; and likewise, the difference of the squares of its semiaxes equal to the difference of the squares of the semiaxes of the given spheroid. Let $k'$ denote the radius of the equator, and $h$ the semiaxis of the required spheroid: then, because the attracted point is to be in the surface of the solid, we have\n\n$$\\frac{a^2}{k'^2} + \\frac{b^2}{k^2} = 1$$\n\nand, because\n\n$$k'^2 - k^2 = k'^2 - k^2 = v^2$$\n\nwe get\n\n$$\\frac{a^2}{k'^2} + \\frac{b^2}{k^2} = 1$$\n\nWhence,\n\n$$2k^2 = a^2 + b^2 - v^2 + \\sqrt{(a^2 + b^2 - v^2)^2 + 4a^2v^2}$$\n\nand when $h$ is determined, then $k' = \\sqrt{k'^2 + v^2}$.\n\nIn consequence of the equation $\\frac{a^2}{k'^2} + \\frac{b^2}{k^2} = 1$, we may suppose, $a = k \\sin m$, and $b = k' \\cos m$; let $a' = k \\sin m$, and $b' = k' \\cos m$; or $a' = \\frac{k}{h} a$, and $b' = \\frac{k'}{k} \\times b$: then the point determined by the coordinates $a'$ and $b'$ will be in the surface of the given spheroid, and, consequently, it will be within the surface of the other spheroid. Let $M'$ denote the mass of the spheroid of which the axis is $h$; and let\n\n$$e'^2 = \\frac{k'^2 - k^2}{k^2} = \\frac{k'^2 - k^2}{k^2}$$\n\nthen (25.) the attractions of this spheroid upon the point within its surface, determined by the coordinates $a$ and $b$, are these, viz.\n\nThat perpendicular to the equator, equal to\n\n$$a' \\times \\frac{3M'}{k^2 e'^2} \\left\\{ e' - \\text{arc. tan. } e' \\right\\}$$\n\nand that perpendicular to the axis, equal to\n\n$$b' \\times \\frac{3M'}{2k^2 e'^2} \\left\\{ \\text{arc. tan. } e' - \\frac{e'}{1 + e'^2} \\right\\}$$\n\nBut (26. Cor. 3.) the attractions of the given spheroid, whose semiaxis are $k$ and $k'$ upon the point without its surface determined by the coordinates $a$ and $b$, will be found by multiplying the preceding expressions respectively by $\\frac{k'^2}{k^2}$ and $\\frac{k^2}{k'^2}$. Let $M$ be the mass of the given spheroid; then\n\n$$M = \\frac{k'^2 k}{M'}$$\n\nconsequently\n\n$$\\frac{k'^2}{k^2} = \\frac{M}{M'} \\cdot \\frac{h}{k} = \\frac{M}{M'} \\cdot \\frac{a}{a'}$$\n\nand $\\frac{k^2}{k'^2} = \\frac{M}{M'} \\cdot \\frac{h}{k} = \\frac{M}{M'} \\cdot \\frac{b}{b'}$: Wherefore, the attractions of the given oblate spheroid upon a point, without the surface determined by the coordinates $a$ and $b$, are as follows, viz.\n\nThe attraction perpendicular to the equator, equal to\n\n$$a \\times \\frac{3M}{k^2 e'^2} \\left\\{ e' - \\text{arc. tan. } e' \\right\\}$$\n\nand that perpendicular to the axis, equal to\n\n$$b \\times \\frac{3M}{2k^2 e'^2} \\left\\{ \\text{arc. tan. } e' - \\frac{e'}{1 + e'^2} \\right\\}$$\n\nCor. In the very same manner we may determine the attractions of an oblong spheroid of revolution upon a point without the surface.\n\nAttractions of Ellipsoids.\n\n28. Let AMBN be one of the principal sections of an ellipsoid, C the centre, AB and MN the axes, D a point in the periphery of the section, and DO perpendicular to MN (Plate XXXI., fig. 18.); the attraction of the ellipsoid upon a particle placed at the pole A, is to the force with which a particle placed at D is attracted in the direction DO, as AC to DO.\nAttraction. Draw DFG perpendicular to AB, and through F describe an ellipsoid similar to the given ellipsoid, and similarly situated, and having the same centre. Conceive an indefinitely great number of planes making indefinitely small angles with one another, to be drawn through DG, so as to divide the two ellipsoids into an indefinitely great number of thin solids or slices; Then, the sections of the ellipsoids made by every one of the planes will be similar and concentric ellipses, each of them having an axis perpendicular to DG (5.). Wherefore the attractions of the elements of the ellipsoid FHKL upon a particle at F, are respectively equal to the attractions of the elements of the ellipsoid AMBN, upon a particle at D in the direction DO (19.). Therefore, the whole attraction of the ellipsoid FHKL upon a particle at F, is equal to the attraction of the ellipsoid AMBN upon a particle at D, in the direction DO. But the attractions of the ellipsoids AMBN, and FHKL upon particles at A and F, are to one another as AC to CF (8.). Therefore, the attraction of the ellipsoid AMBN upon a particle at the pole A, is to the force with which it attracts a particle at D in the direction DO, as AC to DO.\n\n29. The attractions of ellipsoids upon particles placed in the surface, urging them in directions perpendicular to any of the principal sections, are proportional to the distances of the particles from that section.\n\nLet AMBN be one of the principal sections of an ellipsoid, C the centre, AB and MN the axes of the section, and P a point in the surface of the solid; the attraction of the ellipsoid upon a particle at the pole A (Plate XXXI. fig. 19.), is to the force with which a particle at P is attracted in a direction parallel to AB, as the semiaxis AC is to the distance of P from the principal section perpendicular to AC.\n\nDraw PDQ perpendicular to the section AMBN, and let it meet the surface again in Q; through D describe an ellipsoid similar to AMBN, similarly situated, and having the same centre; and through P draw a section SPRQ perpendicular to AB. As before, divide the solids into an indefinitely great number of thin slices by planes drawn through PQ; the sections made by every one of those planes will be similar, and concentric ellipses having an axis of each perpendicular to PQ (5.). Wherefore, the attractions of the elements of the ellipsoid AMBN, upon a particle at P, in a direction perpendicular to the plane PRQS, are respectively equal to the attractions of the elements of the ellipsoid FHKL, upon a particle at D, in a direction perpendicular to the same plane (19.). Therefore, the attraction of the ellipsoid AMBN, upon a particle at P, in a direction parallel to the axis AB, is equal to the attraction of the ellipsoid FHKL, upon a particle at D in the same direction. But the ellipsoids AMBN and FHKL being similar, their attractions upon particles at A and F, are to one another as AC to CF (8.) ; and the attraction of the ellipsoid FHKL, upon a particle at the pole F, is to its attraction upon a particle at D, in a direction parallel to AC, as FC to CN (28.). Therefore (ex aequali), the attraction of the ellipsoid AMBN, upon a particle at the pole A, is to the force with which it attracts a particle at P, in the direction AC, as AC to CN.\n\nThis proposition will enable us to find the attractions of an ellipsoid on all points on the surface, or Attraction within the solid, when the attractions at the poles are determined.\n\n30. To investigate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENTIAL\">differential</a> expressions of the attractions at the poles of an ellipsoid.\n\nLet APD be an ellipsoid; C the centre; AC, CE, and PC, the semiaxes; and PMB a section made by a plane through PC and any point, M in the surface; draw PM (fig. 20.) PM indefinitely near PM, and MM perpendicular to PM; also MR perpendicular to the plane ADB, MS perpendicular to PC, and RH perpendicular to AD. Conceive the plane PCB to revolve about PC, so as to describe an indefinitely small angle BCO; and let PM = f; the angle KPM, which PM makes with a perpendicular to the axis, = \u03b8; and the angle DGB = \u03d5: then by proceeding as in (23.), it will be found that the attraction of the small pyramid described by the triangle MPm, urging a particle at P to the centre of the ellipsoid, is = dp d\u03b8 cos \u03b8 sin \u03b8 f.\n\nAgain, let MR = x, HR = y, CII = z; also let PC = k, AC = k', CE = k\"; then x = k - f sin \u03b8; y = f cos \u03b8 sin \u03d5; z = f cos \u03b8 cos \u03d5; and if we substitute these values in the equation of the ellipsoid (1.), we shall get\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(k-f \\sin \\theta)^2}{k^2} + \\frac{f^2 \\cos^2 \\theta \\sin^2 \\phi}{k'^2} + \\frac{f^2 \\cos^2 \\theta \\cos^2 \\phi}{k''^2} = 1\n\\]\n\nwhence\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{k}{k'^2} \\cdot \\frac{2 \\sin \\theta}{\\sin^2 \\theta + \\cos^2 \\theta \\sin^2 \\phi + \\cos^2 \\theta \\cos^2 \\phi}\n\\]\n\nThis is the value of f at the pole of k; and, by a like procedure, its values at the poles of k' and k\" may be found, viz.\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{k'}{k'^2} \\cdot \\frac{2 \\sin \\theta}{\\sin^2 \\theta + \\cos^2 \\theta \\sin^2 \\phi + \\cos^2 \\theta \\cos^2 \\phi}\n\\]\n\nSuppose that k is the least of the semiaxes; and let \\(k^2 = \\frac{k^2}{m}\\) and \\(k'^2 = \\frac{k^2}{n}\\); then the values of f at the poles of k, k', k\", will be, respectively,\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{2 k \\sin \\theta}{\\sin^2 \\theta + m \\cos^2 \\theta \\sin^2 \\phi + n \\cos^2 \\theta \\cos^2 \\phi}\n\\]\n\nNow, let A, A', A\", denote the attractions of the spheroid upon particles placed at the poles of k, k', k\"; then, by substituting the values of f just found in the foregoing differential expression, we get\n\n\\[\nA = k \\times \\int \\int \\frac{2 dp d\\theta \\cos \\theta \\sin \\theta}{\\sin^2 \\theta + m \\cos^2 \\theta \\sin^2 \\phi + n \\cos^2 \\theta \\cos^2 \\phi}\n\\]\nAttraction.\n\n\\[ A' = k' \\times \\int \\int \\frac{m \\times 2 dp \\cdot d \\cos \\theta \\sin^2 \\phi}{\\sin \\theta + \\cos \\theta \\sin^2 \\phi + n \\cos \\theta \\cos^2 \\phi} \\]\n\n\\[ A'' = k'' \\times \\int \\int \\frac{n \\times 2 dp \\cdot d \\cos \\theta \\sin^2 \\phi}{\\sin \\theta + \\cos \\theta \\sin^2 \\phi + m \\cos \\theta \\cos^2 \\phi} \\]\n\nthe limits of the integrals being from \\( \\theta = 0 \\) and \\( \\phi = 0 \\) to \\( \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\) and \\( \\phi = 2\\pi \\).\n\n31.

To find the forces with which a homogeneous ellipsoid attracts a particle placed in the surface, or within the solid, in directions perpendicular to the principal sections.\n\nLet \\( k, k', k'' \\), denote the semiaxes of an ellipsoid,\nAttraction, and \\(a, b, c\\) (respectively parallel to \\(k, k', k''\\)), the perpendicular distances of a particle placed in the surface, or within the solid, from the principal sections; then, from what is proved in (29.), the attractions we are seeking will be found by multiplying the polar attractions by \\(\\frac{a}{k}, \\frac{b}{k'}, \\frac{c}{k''}\\). Therefore the forces that urge the particle in the directions of \\(a, b,\\) and \\(c\\), are respectively,\n\n\\[a \\times \\frac{3M}{k^3} \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(1 + \\lambda^2)(1 + \\lambda'^2)}} + \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\left( \\frac{dF}{d\\lambda} \\right) + \\frac{1}{\\lambda'} \\left( \\frac{dF}{d\\lambda'} \\right) \\right\\};\\]\n\n\\[b \\times \\frac{3M}{k'^3} \\times \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\left( \\frac{dF}{d\\lambda} \\right);\\]\n\n\\[c \\times \\frac{3M}{k''^3} \\times \\frac{1}{\\lambda'} \\left( \\frac{dF}{d\\lambda'} \\right);\\]\n\nWhich formulas serve both for points in the surface, and within the solid, for the reason already explained in (25.).\n\n33. To find the attractions of an ellipsoid upon a particle placed without the surface.\n\nLet \\(k, k', k''\\) be the semiaxis of the ellipsoid, and \\(a, b, c\\) (respectively parallel to \\(k, k', k''\\)), the coordinates of a particle without the surface. Let \\(h, h', h''\\), so related to \\(k, k', k''\\), that \\(h^2 = k^2 - k'^2\\) and \\(h'^2 = k'^2 - k''^2\\), denote the semiaxis of another ellipsoid, which contains the attracted point in its surface, and has its principal sections in the same planes as the given ellipsoid; then, because the attracted point is in the surface, we have\n\n\\[\\frac{a^2}{h^2} + \\frac{b^2}{h'^2} + \\frac{c^2}{h''^2} = 1;\\]\n\nAnd, because \\(h'^2 = k'^2 - k''^2 = s^2\\), and \\(h''^2 = k''^2 - k'^2 = t^2\\), we get\n\n\\[\\frac{a^2}{h^2} + \\frac{b^2}{s^2} + \\frac{c^2}{t^2} = 1.\\]\n\nThis equation now contains only one unknown quantity; and it is plain, that one value of \\(h\\), and only one, can be found from it. For, when \\(h = 0\\), the function on the left hand side is infinitely great; And while \\(h\\) increases from 0 ad infinitum, the same function decreases continually from being infinitely great, to be infinitely little. When \\(h\\) is found, then \\(h' = \\sqrt{h^2 + s^2}\\), and \\(h'' = \\sqrt{h^2 + t^2}\\). Because \\(a, b, c\\), are the coordinates of a point in the surface of the ellipsoid, we may suppose \\(a = h \\sin m, b = h' \\cos m \\sin n, c = h'' \\cos m \\cos n\\); let \\(a' = k \\sin m, b' = k' \\cos m \\sin n, c' = k'' \\cos m \\cos n\\); or \\(a' = \\frac{k}{h} \\times a\\),\n\n\\[b' = \\frac{k'}{h'} \\times b, c' = \\frac{k''}{h''} \\times c;\\] then \\(a', b', c'\\) will be the coordinates of a point in the surface of the given ellipsoid, and consequently, it will be within the other solid. Let \\(M'\\) denote the mass of the ellipsoid of which \\(h, h', h''\\) are the semiaxes; also let \\(\\lambda^2 = \\text{Attraction.}\\)\n\n\\[\\frac{h'^2}{h^2} = \\frac{k'^2 - k''^2}{k^2}; \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\lambda'^2 = \\frac{h''^2}{h'^2} = \\frac{k''^2 - k'^2}{k'^2};\\]\n\nthen, \\(F\\) denoting the same fluent as before, the attractions of this ellipsoid upon the point within it, determined by the coordinates \\(a', b', c'\\), in the directions of those coordinates, are (32.) respectively equal to\n\n\\[a' \\times \\frac{3M'}{h^3} \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(1 + \\lambda^2)(1 + \\lambda'^2)}} + \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\left( \\frac{dF}{d\\lambda} \\right) + \\frac{1}{\\lambda'} \\left( \\frac{dF}{d\\lambda'} \\right) \\right\\};\\]\n\n\\[b' \\times \\frac{3M'}{h'^3} \\times \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\left( \\frac{dF}{d\\lambda} \\right);\\]\n\n\\[c' \\times \\frac{3M'}{h''^3} \\times \\frac{1}{\\lambda'} \\left( \\frac{dF}{d\\lambda'} \\right).\\]\n\nNow, the attractions of the given ellipsoid upon the point without the surface, determined by the coordinates \\(a, b, c\\), will be found (26.) by multiplying the preceding expressions respectively by \\(\\frac{k}{h}, \\frac{k'}{h'}, \\frac{k''}{h''}, \\frac{k}{h'}\\). Let \\(M\\) be the mass of the given ellipsoid; then\n\n\\[\\frac{M}{M'} = \\frac{k}{h} \\frac{k'}{h'} \\frac{k''}{h''}; \\quad \\text{consequently} \\quad \\frac{k'}{h'} = \\frac{M}{M'} \\frac{h}{k} = \\frac{M}{M'} \\frac{a}{a'};\\]\n\n\\[\\frac{b}{b'} = \\frac{M}{M'} \\frac{b}{b'}; \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{k''}{h''} = \\frac{M}{M'} \\frac{c}{c'};\\]\n\nwherefore, the attractions of the given ellipsoid upon the point without the surface, determined by \\(a, b, c\\), in the directions of those coordinates, are respectively equal to\n\n\\[a \\times \\frac{3M}{k^3} \\times \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(1 + \\lambda^2)(1 + \\lambda'^2)}} + \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\left( \\frac{dF}{d\\lambda} \\right) + \\frac{1}{\\lambda'} \\left( \\frac{dF}{d\\lambda'} \\right) \\right\\};\\]\n\n\\[b \\times \\frac{3M}{k'^3} \\times \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\left( \\frac{dF}{d\\lambda} \\right);\\]\n\n\\[c \\times \\frac{3M}{k''^3} \\times \\frac{1}{\\lambda'} \\left( \\frac{dF}{d\\lambda'} \\right).\\]\n\nThe preceding propositions contain a complete theory of homogeneous elliptical spheroids. They enable us to compute the attractive force with which a solid of this kind urges a particle placed anywhere in the surface, or within the solid, or without it. It remains, indeed, to find the exact value of the function \\(F\\) in its general form, to which we can do no more than approximate by series; but this is an analytical difficulty, which it is impossible to overcome; because the nature of this function is such, that it cannot be expressed in finite terms by the received notation of analysis.\nIn the preceding investigations, we have followed the method of Maclaurin for points situated in the surface of a spheroid, or within the solid. This method has always been justly admired; but neither its inventor, nor, as far as we know, any other Geometer, has applied it, excepting to spheroids of revolution; and it is here, for the first time, extended to ellipsoids. In regard to points without the surface, we have employed the method first given by Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IVORY\">Ivory</a>, in the Philosophical Transactions for 1809. The combination of these two methods has enabled us to derive the attractions of an ellipsoid on a point placed anywhere, from the attractions at the poles. Thus, this extremely complicated problem has, by geometrical reasoning of no great difficulty, been reduced to the investigation of the polar attractions, which are the only cases that require a direct computation.\n\n**Attraction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">Mountains</a>.** See Mountains, Attraction of, in the Encyclopedia, and in this Supplement.\n\n**Atwood (George),** an Author celebrated for the accuracy of his mathematical and mechanical investigations, and considered as particularly happy in the clearness of his explanations, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEGANCE\">elegance</a> of his experimental illustrations, was born in the early part of the year 1746. He was educated at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WESTMINSTER\">Westminster</a> school, where he was admitted in 1759. Six years afterwards he was elected off to Trinity <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">College</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>. He took his degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1769, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of third wrangler, Dr Parkinson, of Christ's College, being senior of the year. This distinction was amply sufficient to give him a claim to further advancement in his own College, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of which he stood foremost of his contemporaries; and, in due time, he obtained a fellowship, and was afterwards one of the tutors of the College. He became <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">Master</a> of Arts in 1772; and, in 1776, was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>.\n\nThe higher branches of the Mathematics had, at this period, been making some important advances at Cambridge, under the auspices of Dr Waring, and many of the younger members of the University became diligent labourers in this extensive field. Mr Atwood chose, for his peculiar department, the illustration of mechanical and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIMENTAL_PHILOSOPHY\">experimental philosophy</a>, by elementary investigations and ocular demonstrations of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> truths. He delivered, for several successive years, a course of lectures in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATORY\">Observatory</a> of Trinity College, which were very generally attended, and greatly admired. In the year 1784, some circumstances occurred which made it desirable for him to discontinue his residence at Cambridge; and soon afterwards Mr Pitt, who had become acquainted with his merits by attending his lectures, bestowed on him a patent office, which required but little of his attendance, in order to have a claim on the employment of his mathematical abilities in a variety of financial calculations, to which he continued to devote a considerable portion of his time and attention throughout the remainder of his life.*\n\nThe following, we believe, is a correct list of Mr Atwood's publications:\n\n1. *A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">Description</a> of Experiments to illustrate a Course of Lectures.* 8vo.

Part II. By the author of the first part. 4to, Lond. 1804. Dated 24th Nov. 1803.\n\n11. A Treatise on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPTICS\">Optics</a> is mentioned by Nichols as having been partly printed by Bowyer in 1776, but never completed.\n\nIt may be very truly asserted, that several of these works of Mr Atwood have materially contributed to the progress of science, by multiplying the modes of illustration, which experimental exhibitions afford for the assistance of the instructor; at the same time, they can scarcely be said to have extended very considerably the bounds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> knowledge, or to demonstrate that their author was possessed of any extraordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a> or energy of mind in overcoming great difficulties, or in inventing new methods of reasoning. The Analysis of a Course of Lectures has been little read: and it bears evident marks of having been composed before Mr Atwood had acquired a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of accurate reasoning on Physical subjects. In the first page, for example, the forces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COHESION\">cohesion</a> and gravitation are completely confounded; and in the third we find the idea of perfect spheres touching each other in a greater or less number of points, notwithstanding the appearance of precision which the author attempts to maintain in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>.\n\nThe object of the paper on Reflection is, to illustrate and improve the construction of Hadley's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRANT\">quadrant</a>; and Mr Atwood proposes, for some particular purposes in practical Astronomy, two new arrangements of the speculums, by which the rays are caused to move in different planes, and which he considers as affording greater accuracy for the measurement of small angles than the common form of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a>, although not of general utility, nor very easily adjusted for observation.\n\nThe treatise on Rectilinear motion and rotation exhibits a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPENDIUM\">compendium</a> of the elementary doctrines of mathematical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICS\">Mechanics</a>; but it shows a great deficiency in the knowledge of the higher refinements which had been introduced into that science by Daniel Bernoulli, and Euler, and Lagrange. The properties of simply accelerated and retarded motion are first discussed, and the phenomena of penetration experimentally examined; the laws of varying forces are then investigated, and the properties of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PENDULUM\">pendulum</a> demonstrated; the vibrations of an elastic chord are calculated, \"considering the whole mass to be concentrated in the middle point,\" as an approximation; and then, instead of imitating and simplifying the elegant but complicated demonstrations of the continental mathematicians, the author most erroneously repeats, in the words of Dr Smith, the exploded doctrine, that \"the string, during any instant of its vibration, will coincide with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARMONIC\">harmonic</a> curve.\" The subject of a resistance, varying as the square of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a>, is next examined; and some useful experiments on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> of bodies in water are stated in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> of the theory. On this occasion, the author observes, with regard to the formation of the different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRATA\">strata</a> of the earth, that bodies disposed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> masses, though specifically <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a>, may easily have descended more rapidly through a fluid, than denser but more brittle bodies, so that the natural order of densities may thus have become inverted. He next examines the theory of rotation, and relates some very interesting experiments on rectilinear and rotatory motions; and he shows that Emerson and Desaguliers were totally mistaken in asserting \"that the momentum produced is always equal to the momentum which produces it.\" The last section of the work, which is devoted to the subject of free rotation, is the most elaborate of the whole; but it exhibits no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-MATERIAL\">material</a> extension of the earlier investigations of the Bernoullis and Professor Vince; nor does it contain the important proposition of Segner, relating to the existence of three axes of permanent rotation, at right angles to each other, in every body, however <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a>.\n\nNotwithstanding these partial objections, the work may still, in many respects, be considered as classical. The paper on Watch-balances is principally intended to show the advantages which may be obtained, in Mr Mudge's construction, from the effect of subsidiary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a> in rendering the vibrations isochronous, their actions being limited to certain portions of the arc of motion. If the author has here again omitted to follow the Continental Mathematicians in some of their refinements of calculation, it must be confessed that his view of the subject has, in this instance, not only the advantage of simplicity, but also that of a nearer approach to the true practical state of the question, than is to be found in the more complicated determinations which had been the result of the labours of some of his predecessors.\n\nBut, whatever may be the merits of these investigations, they appear to be far exceeded in importance by the papers on Ships, the first of which obtained for its author the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of a Copleian Medal. Its principal object is to show how much the stability of a ship will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> vary, when her situation, with respect to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZON\">horizon</a>, is materially altered; and how far the assumptions of theoretical writers, respecting many others of the forces concerned in Naval <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">Architecture</a>, will generally differ from the true state of these forces when they actually occur in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEAMANSHIP\">Seamanship</a>. In the second part of the investigation, some errors of Bouguer and of Clairbois are pointed out, and the theoretical principles of stability are exemplified by a detailed calculation, adapted to the form and dimensions of a particular vessel, built for the service of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EAST\">East</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">Company</a>.\n\nThe latter years of our author's life do not appear to have been productive of any material advantage to Science. His application to his accustomed pursuits was unremitting; but his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> was gradually declining. He had no amusement, except such as was afforded by the continued <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of his mind, with\na change of the object only; the laborious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAME\">game</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHESS\">chess</a> occupying, under the name of recreation, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a> which he could spare from more productive exertions. He became paralytic some time before his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>; and though he partially recovered his health, he did not live to complete his 62d year.\n\nHis researches concerning the history of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ASSIZE\">Assize</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">Bread</a> must have required the employment of considerable diligence, and some judgment, in the discovery and selection of materials; although certainly the subject was not chosen for the purpose of affording a display of talent. His opinion respecting the operation of the assize, as favourable to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a>, may by some be thought to be justified by the want of success which has hitherto attended the experiment on its suspension; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a> of that measure would certainly not admit the trial of a year to be sufficient for appreciating its utility.\n\nThe title-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAGES\">pages</a> of the works on Arches explain the occasion on which they were brought forwards, and at the same time exhibit a specimen of the want of order and precision which seems to have begun to prevail in the author's faculties: and the works themselves betray a neglect of the fundamental principles of Mechanics, which is inconceivable in a person who had once reasoned with considerable accuracy on mathematical subjects. An anonymous Critic, who is supposed to have been the late Professor Robison (British Critic, Vol. XXI. Jan. 1804), very decidedly, and, at the same time, very respectfully asserted Mr Atwood's error in maintaining, that there was no manner of necessity for the condition, that the general curve of equilibrium of an arch should pass through some part of every one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a> by which it is divided; and in fact we may very easily be convinced of the truth of this principle, if we reflect that the curve of equilibrium is the true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REPRESENTATIVE\">representative</a> of the direction of all the forces acting upon each of the blocks; and that if the whole pressure be anywhere directed to a point situated beyond the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIMIT\">limit</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a>, there can be nothing whatever to prevent the rotation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLOCK\">block</a> on the end of the joint as a centre, until some new position of the block shall have altered the direction of the forces, or until the whole fabric be destroyed. The Critic has also very truly remarked, that the effects of friction have never been sufficiently considered in such arrangements: but a later Author has removed a considerable part of this difficulty in an anonymous publication, by showing, that no other condition is required for determining these effects, than that every joint should be perpendicular to the direction of the curve of equilibrium, either accurately, or within the limit of a certain angle, which is constant for every substance of the same kind, and which he has termed the angle of repose.\n\nIn the appointment which enabled Mr Atwood to devote a considerable part of his life to scientific researches, he appears to have had no successor. It was held, and perhaps wisely, that such sinecures have regularly become, in process of time, mere instruments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PARTY\">party</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>, instead of being bestowed as encouragements to merit; and it seems to be the invariable maxim of the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">Government</a>, that talents deserve no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-PROTECTION\">protection</a>, unless they are immediately employed in the service of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">Church</a> or of the State; that ornamental accomplishments repay their possessor by the splendour which they confer on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> existence, but that, in a commercial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, the actual utility of mental as well as of corporal powers, must be measured by their effects; and that these effects must be of a negotiable kind, in order to have a claim to reward. Other Nations, and other Sovereigns, have often thought and acted differently; and they have, perhaps, obtained a forced growth of Science or of Literature, which has contributed, in some degree, to the embellishment of their age; but where the native forest tree acquires so often a form at once beautiful and magnificent, though exposed to all the storms of the seasons, there is little reason to lament the want of the shelter of the Plantation, or of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> warmth of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSERVATORY\">Conservatory</a>.","sp":891,"ep":940},{"h":"CANCERIDES","t":"a Shore <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CRABS\">Crabs</a>.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENUS\">Genus</a> 1.

It appeared under the sanction of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERIAL\">Imperial</a> Academy, to which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> had been in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> communicated; and it is said <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> page to be Instar Supplementi Comment. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ACAD\">Acad</a>. Petropolitanae. The work indeed merited this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a>, as being the first systematic and successful attempt to apply mathematical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> to the subjects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTRICITY\">electricity</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNETISM\">magnetism</a>. Already the theory of Franklin, with regard to the former, was very generally received, and was supposed to afford a satisfactory explanation of the phenomena. But though it seemed sufficient for this purpose in\nthe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> and somewhat loose manner in which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> had hitherto been treated, it was not certain that the same would hold when the conclusions were accurately and mathematically deduced. To apply this test was what \u00c6pinus undertook, and what he has executed in a manner very satisfactory and complete. He has treated very fully, and perhaps has nearly exhausted what may be called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATICS\">statics</a> of electricity and magnetism, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> the equilibrium of their forces. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a> yet remains, where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of the electric fluid is to be considered, and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a> over the surfaces of bodies of a given <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>; where greater difficulties are to be encountered, and where the latest improvements of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEGRAL\">integral</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CALCULUS\">calculus</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of La <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">Place</a> and Poisson have begun to be applied. The investigations of \u00c6pinus in their own department led to very satisfactory results, and the exact agreement between them and the phenomena actually exhibited was extensively observed. Notwithstanding this agreement, we cannot consider the theory of positive and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a> electricity as being yet sufficiently established. Though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSUMPTION\">assumption</a> on which it is founded appear very simple at first, it is found more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPLEX\">complex</a> on a nearer inspection. The assumption is, that a fluid resides in the surfaces of all the bodies termed electrics, which is highly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a>, and strongly attracted, at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, by the particles of the body, and that while this fluid remains equally diffused over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a> of the body, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> phenomenon whatever gives any information of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a>. By certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> operations, however, the equilibrium of this fluid may be destroyed; the fluid may be accumulated at one end, or on one side of a body, and entirely withdrawn from the opposite. It is when an electric is brought into this state that it exhibits the phenomena of electricity, between which, and the calculus instituted on the suppositions <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>, \u00c6pinus has everywhere remarked the most exact agreement. One great difficulty, however, still remains. The negative ends of two electrified bodies repel one another, just as much as the ends which are reckoned positive. But such an effect cannot result from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> absence of a substance; when the electric fluid is withdrawn, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REPULSION\">repulsion</a> still continue, it must arise from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the particles of the body itself. Thus it would appear, that, in the absence of the electric fluid, the tendency of the particles of matter is to repel one another. This is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> part of the theory; and it is not accurate to say, that the doctrine of Franklin or \u00c6pinus supposes no more than the existence of an elastic fluid diffused over the surfaces, and strongly attracted by the particles of bodies. It supposes, besides, that those particles, in the absence of this fluid, mutually repel one another. This not only takes away from the simplicity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>, but it is obviously a very unnatural, not to say a contradictory supposition; because, when the electric matter is removed, how comes it to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> that the particles of the body, notwithstanding their mutual repulsion, still cohere together as firmly as before? This difficulty is acknowledged by \u00c6pinus himself; but it would seem that the theory had taken a strong hold of his mind before he was aware of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> from it, so that he became by degrees reconciled to a supposition which appeared to him at first not a little incongruous. This must not surprise us: It is not always that, even among philosophers, we meet with the candour, or perhaps we should say the courage, with which Newton suspended his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> in his own great discovery, the principle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> gravity, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> as the erroneous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> then existing, about the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, made the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>'s motion in her orbit appear inconsistent with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> of falling bodies.\n\nAnother remark, made by \u00c6pinus himself, involves in it a difficulty which should have induced him to view his theory with considerable diffidence. Though he considers the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of the two electricities to be the same as between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a> and defect, or to consist in this, that the fluid which is deficient in the one part is in excess in the other, he admits that no phenomenon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> out on which side the excess, or on which the defect lies. This is a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDICATION\">indication</a> that the difference is not of the kind supposed. We are not left at a loss to tell whether <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> is the absence of a substance which we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CALL\">call</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, or heat the absence of a substance which we call cold. If there were just as much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> for asserting the one of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a> as the other, one would certainly be inclined to reject both. The same should be done with respect to electricity and magnetism.\n\nThe investigations of \u00c6pinus, however, are by no means rendered useless, even if the theory of positive and negative electricity, or of positive and negative magnetism be exchanged for that of two elastic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a>, each attracting the other, and both attracted by the particles of bodies. Most of his investigations may be easily accommodated to this supposition; and, therefore, they are, fortunately for themselves and for their author, of a more permanent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> than the principles from which they were deduced.\n\nIt is to be added to this, that \u00c6pinus was the first who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> between electricity and magnetism, in its full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, and perceived the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> that these two mutually <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> on one another. He instituted a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of experiments on the nature of the Tourmaline, on which he wrote a small treatise, published in 1762. He is to be regarded also as the inventor of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONDENSER\">Condenser</a> of Electricity, and of the Electrophorus, of which he gave the complete theory.\n\nA very excellent view of the theory of \u00c6pinus was published at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> by M. Ha\u00fcy, in 1787, in 8vo. The same author has, however, adopted the theory of the two fluids in his own treatise, Le\u00e7ons de Physique. There is a remarkable coincidence between \u00c6pinus's work on electricity and magnetism, and that of Mr Cavendish, given in the Philosophical Transactions for 1771, p. 584. The principles from which they set out, and the conclusions at which they arrive, are in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> the same. It appears, however, quite certain, that Mr Cavendish knew nothing of the work of the Russian philosopher till his own was completed. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of proceeding is more geometrical, and in some parts he has gone farther.\n\nThe researches of \u00c6pinus were not confined to the subjects now mentioned, but extended to most of the branches of natural philosophy. Beside the treatise\non the Tourmaline, he published, in 1762, a work, in 4to, *On the distribution of heat at the surface of the earth*; a work which, though translated into French, has hardly, we believe, made its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> into this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, and of which we are therefore unable to speak from our own knowledge. He is also the author of many valuable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMOIRS\">memoirs</a> on different subjects in pure mathematics, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPTICS\">optics</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METEOROLOGY\">meteorology</a>, contained in the 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and 12th volumes of the *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVI\">Novi</a> Commentarii Petropolitanae*, and in the volumes of the *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BERLIN\">Berlin</a> Memoirs*, for 1755, 1756. In a memoir contained in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> of these is the first account of his experiments on the Tourmaline, which were conducted with great accuracy and judgment, and do <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> to the author as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> and philosophical understanding, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> instructed in the true principles of inductive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>. Indeed, notwithstanding the objections we have made to his theories of electricity and magnetism, we must acknowledge that this is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> produced by the perusal of his works. He appears to have been well acquainted with practical astronomy, and sometimes to have had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of the Imperial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATORY\">Observatory</a>. He made improvements on the Micrometer and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol16.html#article-RETICULUM\">Reticulum</a>, and wrote a memoir on the effects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARALLAX\">parallax</a> in the transit of a planet over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>; a difficult subject, and one rendered at that time (1764) peculiarly interesting, on account of the transit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VENUS\">Venus</a> which was just past, and that which was soon expected. (*Novi Com. Pet.* Tom. X. p. 433.) In the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> he has a memoir on the subject of accidental colours, which at that time had hardly been treated of by any author but Buffon; and another on the affinity between electricity and magnetism. In the 12th volume he notices, we believe for the first time, the electric <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of the Brazilian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMERALD\">emerald</a>. He was not aware that this emerald is in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a> the green Tourmaline (*Brogniart*, Tom. I. p. 418.), a variety of that mineral on which he had already exercised his ingenuity with so much success.\n\nIt is rare, in an advanced state of science, to have the satisfaction of making a new discovery with regard to a subject quite elementary, and one that has been long a subject of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>. This, however, happened to \u00c6pinus with respect to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEVER\">Lever</a>, and to the simplest kind of lever\u2014that which has equal arms; of which he has demonstrated a new property in the 8th volume of the *Commentaries* above referred to. It is this:\u2014If a lever, with equal arms, be acted on at its opposite ends by forces, in a given <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a> to one another, and having their directions <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to straight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> given in position, and if these forces be resolved each into two, one at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> to the lever, and the other in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of it: in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of equilibrium, the sum of the two forces, having the same direction with the lever, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be the greatest possible. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEOREM\">theorem</a>, remarkable for its simplicity, and for illustrating the connection between the equilibrium of bodies, and certain problems concerning the maxima or minima of variable quantities, occurred when he was pursuing some of his inquiries concerning magnetism. He seems not to have been very fortunate, however, in his investigation, which is more complex than is necessary, as the proposition admits of a geometrical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a>, remarkable for its simplicity.\n\n(*l.*) AEROLITE, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> recently, but perhaps improperly, applied to those singular substances <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> called METEORIC <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">STONES</a>.

Of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a> of France before the Revolution, a very full and accurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> has been furnished by Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTHUR\">Arthur</a> Young, from which it is sufficiently evident how much the general produce of that country, the best cultivated perhaps next to Britain, was inferior to that of even our middling lands; and the progress it has made since, has not, according to the latest and apparently exaggerated accounts, been marked by any very great improvement either in live stock or machinery, the two most distinguishing parts of British husbandry.\n\nIt is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> to ask\u2014to what causes this superiority is owing?\u2014And why it is confined to a part of our territory, instead of being extended, as our great demand of late for foreign corn would have led us to expect, to all soils that are capable of profitable improvement? <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">On</a> these two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> we now propose to offer a few very general remarks; and we shall submit them to the reader without affecting that precision of arrangement which more ample details would have required.\n\n1. The territory of Britain is not engrossed by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">Division</a> few individuals, as that of the northern countries of Europe, nor divided into such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> portions as that of some of the small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> of the Continent. The vast tracts of country held by a Russian or Polish nobleman, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIMINUTIVE\">diminutive</a> possessions of the Swiss, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">Large</a> and more lately of the French peasantry, are almost Estates; equally inconsistent with the more productive systems of rural economy. The former are too large for the superintendence of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a>, with a view to profitable cultivation; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> of such extensive properties implies the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEGRADATION\">degradation</a> and poverty of the great body of the people, and the absence of a middle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a>, possessed of disposable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a>, or at least of opportunities for its investment in the soil. Minute The latter, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, afford <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> room for the employment of capital, nor of those inventions by which the charges of cultivation are diminished, and its products augmented. Such small landed properties return little more than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WAGES\">wages</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANUAL\">manual</a> labour by which they must necessarily be cultivated. Their small surplus produce, which every bad season annihilates, cannot afford subsistence to those other classes, whose labours are necessary to national prosperity and individual comfort; and a part of the families of the cultivators themselves, having neither\nfood nor employment at home, must either emigrate or perish. To a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> these consequences have been already experienced, both in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a> and the Highlands of Scotland; for it would be idle to maintain, that a minute division of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> in tenancy, does not produce all the unhappy effects which must result from the minute division of land in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>.\n\nOf two countries, in one of which estates are in general too large for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> superintendence of the proprietors, and, in the other, the land is parcelled out into shires, little more than sufficient for the subsistence of their owners, the condition of the great body of the people must be very much alike. In neither can there exist that middle class, from which all valuable improvements proceed, nor any of those inventions which multiply and augment the productive powers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> industry. Both of these states of property must appear decidedly hostile to national prosperity, when measured by this unerring test\u2014the quantity of the products of the soil which remains after defraying the charges of obtaining them; for upon this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">net</a> surplus depend all the enjoyments of mankind beyond the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> necessaries of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, as well as the means of repelling foreign aggression, and preserving internal tranquillity.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a> of the landed property of Britain is equally distant from both these extremes. Though it is necessary, perhaps, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of the country, that there should be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of large estates, yet their extent is seldom so great as to produce any of the bad effects <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> mentioned, even within the bounds of a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a>. Over the rural economy of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> these large properties exert scarcely any influence at all, excepting such of them as are held by entail, which is certainly a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TENURE\">tenure</a> greatly at variance with the full improvement of the soil. Many instances might be pointed out, of very extensive estates, fully as well cultivated, and yielding as large a surplus for the general consumption, as our agriculture, in its present state, obtains from any equal extent of similar land. It is true, that to increase the political influence of great proprietors, too many of these estates are possessed by tenants at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a>; but this grievance is not peculiar to estates of this class; the largest estates of Scotland being occupied on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LEASES\">leases</a>. This most serious obstacle to spirited cultivation, must therefore be ascribed to political causes, and not to the engrossing of landed property.\n\n2. Another arrangement, which may serve to account for the superiority of British agriculture, is somewhat akin to that division of labour, by which all the arts have been carried to so great a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a> in this country. Few great proprietors, comparatively, cultivate their own lands beyond the demands of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> and convenience. The far greater part of Britain is cultivated by professional men, with their own capital, and for their own profit. The price which they must pay for their temporary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> in the soil, in the shape of rent, instead of checking their exertions, has a powerful tendency to promote every profitable improvement, to discourage dangerous speculation, and to restrain wasteful expenditure. And as it is clearly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> of such General men, still more than of proprietors themselves, to obtain the largest produce at the least possible expense, the intermediate portion of the produce\u2014that which is disposable for the general consumption\u2014is consequently as large as industry and economy, in the present state of our agriculture, can make it. It is true, almost to a proverb, that farming, upon an extensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a>, is never profitable to a great landholder; and, with a view to the interest of the nation, it ought to be discouraged, as both wasteful and unproductive. In some countries this mode of farming is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a>,\u2014as in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> of Europe, where a class of free tenants does not exist;\u2014in others, the business of cultivation must be carried on as a sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARTNERSHIP\">partnership</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> concern between the proprietor and tenant, as on the metairies of France. Fortunately, the general distribution of wealth has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> since removed the necessity for either of these methods in Britain.\n\nTo give full effect to the professional <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a>, it is necessary that the rights of the landlord and tenant, respectively, should be clearly defined, and well secured by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a> and the private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> of the parties. The principle general principle which should regulate the terms of this connection seems to be, that, while the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARM\">farm</a> ought to be restored to the owner at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-EXPIRATION\">expiration</a> of the tenant's interest, at least without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DETERIORATION\">deterioration</a>, the tenant should be encouraged to render it as productive as possible during his possession. In both of these views, a lease for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> of years is scarcely less necessary for the interest of the landlord than of the tenant; and so much is the public interested in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, that it has been proposed by intelligent men, to impose a penal tax on the rent of lands held by tenants at will.\n\nThat the value of the property is enhanced by the security which such a lease confers on the tenant, will be put beyond all doubt, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the rents of two estates for half a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a> back are compared; the one occupied by tenants at will, and the other by tenants on leases for a moderate term, and where the soil and situation are nearly alike in every respect. If the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> be made between two tracts, originally very different in point of value, the advantages of leases will be still more striking. While that which is held by tenants at will remains nearly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a>, the other is gradually, yet effectually, improved, under the security of leases, by the tenant's capital; and, in no long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, the latter takes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> of the former, both in the amount of the revenue which it yields to the proprietor, and in the quantity of produce which it furnishes for the general consumption. The higher rents and greater produce of some parts of Scotland, than of many of the English counties, where the soil, climate, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARKETS\">markets</a> are much more favourable, must be ascribed to the almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> practice of holding on leases in the former country, in a much greater degree than to any of the causes which have been frequently assigned. Less than a century ago, what are now the best cultivated districts of Scotland were very far behind the greater part of England; and, indeed, had made very little progress from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of the\nfeudal system. It is not fifty years since the farmers of Scotland were in the practice of going to learn from their southern neighbours an art, which was then very imperfectly known in their own country. But in several parts of England there has been little or no improvement since, while the southern counties of Scotland have uniformly advanced; and at present exhibit, very generally, a happy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTRAST\">contrast</a> to their condition at the middle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> century.\n\nIn respect to farmers themselves, it cannot be necessary to point out the advantages of leases. It may be true, that, under the security of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of an English landlord, tenants at will have been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> in possession from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a> to generation, and acquired wealth which he has never, like the landholders of some other countries, attempted to wrest from them. But there are few individuals in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of life, who continue for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> of time to sacrifice their just claims on the altar of pure generosity. Something is almost always expected in return. A portion of revenue in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> is exchanged for power, and that power is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> not only in the habitual degradation of the tenantry, but in the control over them, which the landlord never fails to exert at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a> of members of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a>, and on all other political emergencies. No prudent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> will ever invest his fortune in the improvement of another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a>'s property, unless, from the length of his lease, he has a reasonable prospect of being reimbursed with profit; and the servility which holding at will necessarily exacts, is altogether <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a> with that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of enterprise which belongs to an enlightened and independent mind.\n\nThe people at large are evidently most deeply affected by every measure which has a tendency to fetter the productive powers of the soil, and, at the same time, to depress one of their largest and most valuable classes. It is clearly their interest, that corn and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> should be supplied in abundance; and the people of England may justly complain of the want of leases, as one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> causes which checks the improvement of their own territory.\n\nWhat ought to be the term of a lease, can only be determined by a reference to the circumstances of each particular case. Lands naturally rich, or such as have already been brought to a high degree of fertility, requiring no great investment of capital, and returning all or nearly all the necessary outlay within the year, may be advantageously held upon short leases\u2014such perhaps as give time for two, or at most three, of the rotations or courses of crops to which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of the soil is best adapted. The practice of England in this respect is extremely various,\u2014almost every term, from twenty years downwards, being found in different parts of it. In Scotland, by far the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> period is nineteen years, to which it was formerly the practice, in some places, to add the life of the tenant. In that country, even when it is thought expedient to agree for a much longer term, this is still expressed in periods of nineteen years,\u2014a sort of mysterious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CYCLE\">cycle</a>, which seems to be no less a favourite with the courts of law, than with landholders and farmers. Yet this term is somewhat inconvenient, as it can never correspond with any number of the recognized rotations of arable General Observations.\n\nIt has been maintained by several writers, that a lease for twenty years is not sufficient to reimburse a Long tenant for any considerable improvements, and landholders have often been urged to agree to a much of longer term, which, it is alleged, would be not less for their own interest than for that of the tenant. This is a question which our limits do not permit us to discuss, but, after viewing it in different lights, assisted by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> of long leases in different parts of Scotland, we cannot help expressing some doubts of their utility, even in so far only as regards the parties themselves; and we are decidedly of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that a greater produce will be brought to market, from any given extent of land held on successive leases of twenty years, for half a century, than if held on one lease of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>, whether the term be specified, or indefinite, as in the case of a lease for life. As a general mode of tenure, leases for lives seem to us particularly objectionable.\n\nThe great advantages of a lease are so well known <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> in Scotland, that one of her best agricultural writers, Kames himself a landed proprietor, has suggested a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of conferring on it the character of perpetuity, to period, such an extent as, he thinks, would give ample security to the tenant for every profitable improvement, without preventing the landlord from resuming possession upon equitable terms, at the expiration of every specified period. But the author of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> (Lord Kames), in his ardent wishes for the advancement of agriculture, at that time in a very backward state in his native country, seems to have overlooked the difficulties that stood in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADOPTION\">adoption</a>; and the great advance in the price of produce, and consequently in the rate of rents, since his Lordship wrote, have long since put an end to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a> which his proposal excited. For a form of a lease on his plan, the reader may consult <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELL\">Bell</a>'s Treatise on Leases; and the objections to the plan itself are shortly stated in the supplement to the sixth edition of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">Gentleman</a> Farmer, recently published.\n\nThere have been instances of long leases granted, Long upon condition of receiving an advance of rent at the Leases, end of a certain number of years; but covenants of this kind, meant to apply to the circumstances of a distant period, cannot possibly be framed in such a manner as to do equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> to both parties; and it ought not to be concealed, that, in every case of a very long lease, the chances are rather more unfavourable to the landholder than to the farmer. If the price of produce shall continue to rise as it has done, till very lately, for the last forty years, no improvements which a tenant can be expected to execute will compensate the landlord's loss; and if, on the other hand, prices shall decline, the capital of most tenants must be exhausted in a few years, and the lands will necessarily revert to the proprietor, as has been the case late in many instances. Hence a landholder, in agreeing to a long lease, can hardly assure himself that the obligations on the part of the tenant will be fully discharged throughout its whole term, while the obligations he incurs himself may always be easily enforced. He runs the risk of\ngreat loss from a depreciation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, but can look forward to very little benefit from a depreciation of produce, except for a few years at most. Of this advantage a generous man would seldom avail himself; and, indeed, in most instances, the advantage must be only imaginary, for it would be overbalanced by the deterioration of his property.\n\nWhere the circumstances of a landholder, the state of his property, and the wealth and enterprising character of the tenantry, are such as to render long leases, or leases for an indefinite period, expedient, the most equitable mode, in regard to rent, would be to make it rise and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> with the price of corn or other produce. A rent paid in corn is, indeed, liable to serious objections, and can seldom be advisable in a commercial country. It necessarily bears hardest on a tenant when he is least able to discharge it. In very bad seasons, his crop may be so scanty as scarcely to return seed and the expenses of cultivation, and the share which he ought to receive himself, as the profits of his capital, as well as the quantity allotted to the landlord, may not exist at all. Though, in this case, if he pays a money-rent, his loss may be considerable, it may be twice or three times greater if the rent is to be paid in corn, or according to the high price of such seasons. In less favourable years, which often occur in the variable climate of Britain, a corn-rent would, in numerous instances, absorb nearly the whole free or disposable produce, as it is by no means uncommon to find the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> produce of even good land reduced from twenty to fifty per cent. below an average, in particular seasons. And it ought to be considered, in regard to the landlord himself, that his income would thus be doubled or trebled, at a time when all other classes were suffering from scarcity and consequent dearth; while, in times of plenty and cheapness, he might find it difficult to make his expenses correspond with the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIMINUTION\">diminution</a> of his receipts. It is of much importance to both parties, that the amount of the rent should vary as little as possible from any unforeseen causes, though tenants in general would be perhaps the most injured by such fluctuations.\n\nTo obviate these and other objections to a corn-rent, and to do equal justice at all times to both landlord and tenant, a plan has been lately suggested for converting the corn into money, adopting for its price, not the price of the year for which the rent is payable, but the average price of a certain number of years. The rent, according to this plan, may be calculated every year, by omitting the first year of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a>, and adding a new one; or, it may continue the same for a certain number of years, and then be fixed according to a new average. Let us suppose the lease to be for twenty-one years, the average agreed on being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> years, and the first year's rent, that is, the price of so many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of corn, will be calculated from the average price of the crop of that year, and of the six years preceding. If it be meant to take a new average for the second and every succeeding year's rent, all that is necessary is, to strike off the first of these seven years, adding the year for which the rent is payable, and so on during all the years of the lease. But this labour, slight as it is, may be dispensed with, by continuing the rent without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> for the first seven years of the lease, according to the average price of the seven years immediately preceding its commencement, and, at the end of this period, fixing a new rent, according to the average price of the seven years just expired, to continue for the next seven years. Thus, in the course of twenty-one years, the rent would be calculated only three times; and for whatever quantity of corn the parties had agreed, the money payments would be equal to the average price of fourteen years of the lease itself, and of the seven years preceding it; and the price of the last seven years of the old lease, would determine the rent during the first seven years of the new one.\n\nThe landlord and tenant, it has been thought, could not suffer either from bad seasons or any change in the value of the currency, should such a lease as this be extended to several periods of twenty-one years. The quantity of corn, to be taken as rent, is the only point that would require to be settled at the commencement of each of these periods; and though this would no doubt be greater or less, according to the state of the lands at the time, yet it may be expected, that, in the twenty-one years preceding, all the tenant's judicious expenditure had been fully replaced. Instead of the twofold difficulty in fixing a rent for a long lease, arising from uncertainty as to the quantity of produce, which must depend on the state of improvement, and still more perhaps from the variations in the price of that produce, the latter objection is entirely removed by this plan; and in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> where land is already brought to a high degree of fertility, the question about the quantity of produce may likewise be dispensed with.\n\nUpon this plan we shall take leave to observe, that, if it be applied to leases of nineteen or twenty-one years, the inconvenience resulting from uncertainty as to the amount of rent, as well as other difficulties which must necessarily attend it, would be as great as one year, perhaps as any advantages which it holds out to either of the parties. If it be said that a rent, determined by a seven years average, could not suddenly nor materially alter, this is at once to admit the inutility of the contrivance. The first thing which must strike every practical man is, that corn is not the only produce of a farm, and in most parts of Britain, perhaps not the principal source from which rent is paid; and there is no authentic record of the prices of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUTCHER\">butcher</a> meat, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a>, cheese, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a>, and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> in every county to refer to, as there is of corn. This is not the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> to inquire whether the price of corn regulates the price of all the other products of land, in a country whose statute books are full of duties, bounties, drawbacks, &c., to say nothing of its internal regulations; but it is sufficiently evident, that, if corn does possess this power, its price operates too slowly on that of other products, to serve as a just criterion for determining rent on a lease of this duration. Besides, in the progress of agriculture, new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> or varieties of the cerealia themselves are established even in so short a period as twenty-one years, the price of which may be very different from that of the corn specified in the lease. What security for a full rent, for instance, would it give to a landlord, to make the rent payable according to the price of\nbarley, when the tenant might find it more for his interest to cultivate some of the varieties of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> wheat lately brought from the Continent? Or, according to the price of a particular variety of oats, when, within a few years, we have seen all the old varieties superseded, throughout extensive districts, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-INTRODUCTION\">introduction</a> of a new one, the potatoe-oat, which may not be more permanent than those that preceded it? There can be no impropriety, indeed, in adopting this plan, for ascertaining the rent of land kept always in tillage, but it would be idle to expect any important benefits from it, during such a lease as we have mentioned.\n\nWith regard to much longer leases, this plan will no doubt diminish the evils which we think are inseparable from them, but it cannot possibly reach some of the most considerable. Its utmost effect is to secure to the landholder a rent, which shall in all time to come be an adequate rent, according to the state of the lands and the mode of cultivation known at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a> of the lease. But it can make no provision that will apply to the enlargement of the gross produce from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> improvement of the lands themselves, or of the disposable produce from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of machinery and other plans for economizing labour. And the objections just stated, in reference to a lease of twenty-one years, evidently apply much more forcibly to one of two or three times that length. Old corn-rents therefore, though much higher at present than old money rents, are seldom or never so high as the rents that could now be paid on a lease of twenty-one years. But, independent of these considerations, which more immediately bear upon the interests of the parties themselves, one insuperable objection to all such leases is, that they partake too much of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of entails, and depart too far from that commercial character which is most favourable to the investment of capital, and consequently to the greatest increase of land produce.\n\nA lease for a term of years is not, however, in all cases, a sufficient encouragement to spirited cultivation; its covenants in respect to the management of the lands may be injudicious; the tenant may be so strictly confined to a particular mode of culture, or a particular course of crops, as not to be able to avail himself of the beneficial discoveries which a progressive state of agriculture never fails to introduce. Or, on the other hand, though this is much more rare, the tenant may be left so entirely at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, that either the necessity of his circumstances during the currency of the lease, or his interest towards its expiration, may lead him to exhaust the soil, instead of rendering it more productive. When a lease therefore is either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUNDANT\">redundant</a> or deficient in this respect\u2014where it either permits the lands to be deteriorated or prevents their improvement,\u2014the connection between landlord and tenant is formed upon other views, and regulated by some other principle, than the general one on which we think it should be founded.\n\nNotwithstanding the high authority of Dr Smith, restrictive covenants are always necessary to the security of the landlord, and in some cases beneficial also to the tenant. Their expediency cannot well be questioned, in those parts of the country where an improved system of agriculture has made little progress. A landholder, assisted by the advice of experienced men in framing these covenants, cannot adopt any easier or less offensive plan for the improvement of his property, and the ultimate advantages of his tenantry. Even in the best cultivated districts, while farms continue to be let to the highest responsible offerers, a few restrictive covenants cannot be dispensed with. The supposed interest of the tenant is too feeble a security for correct management, even during the earlier part of a lease, and in the latter part of it, it is thought to be his interest, in most cases, to exhaust the soil as much as possible, not only for the sake of immediate profit, but frequently in order to deter competitors, and thus to obtain a renewal of his lease at a rent somewhat less than the lands would otherwise bring.\n\nWith tenants at will, and such as hold on short leases, restrictive covenants are more necessary than with tenants on leases of nineteen or twenty years; but, in many instances, they are too numerous and complicated, and sometimes even inconsistent with the best courses of modern husbandry. The great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> lies, in prescribing rules by which a tenant is positively required to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a>\u2014not in prohibiting such practices, and such crops, as experience has not sanctioned. The improved knowledge, and the liberality of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, have now expurgated the most objectionable of these covenants; and throughout whole counties, almost the only restriction in reference to the course of crops is, that the tenant shall not take two culmiferous crops, ripening their seeds, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> succession. This single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STIPULATION\">stipulation</a>, combined with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBLIGATION\">obligation</a> to consume the straw upon the farm, and to apply to it all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANURE\">manure</a> made from its produce, is sufficient not only to protect the land from exhaustion, but to ensure, in a great measure, its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> cultivation; for half the farm at least must, in this case, be always under either fallow or green crops. The only other necessary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COVENANT\">covenant</a>, when the soil is naturally too weak for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> annual crops without intermission, is, that a certain portion of the land shall be always in grass, not to be cut for hay, but depastured. According to the extent of this will be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> between the succession of corn crops on the same fields: if it is agreed that half the farm, for instance, shall always be under grass, there can be only two crops of corn from the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a> in six years. In this case not more than two-sixths being in corn, one-sixth in green crops or fallow, and three-sixths in clovers or grasses, it becomes almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to exhaust any soil at all fitted for tillage. There are few indeed that do not gradually become more fertile under this course of cropping. It is sufficiently evident, that other covenants are necessary in particular circumstances, such as permission to dispose of straw, hay, and other crops from which manure is made, when a quantity of manure equal to what they would have furnished, is got from other places; and a prohibition against converting rich old grazing lands or meadows into corn lands. In this place we speak only of general rules, such as are applicable to perhaps nine-tenths of all the arable land of Britain, and such as are actually observed in our best cultivated counties.\n\nFor the last four years of a lease, the same cove-\nnants are generally sufficient, only they require to be applied with more precision. Instead of taking for granted, that the proportion of the farm that cannot be under corn will be properly cultivated, from the tenant's regard to his own interest, it becomes necessary to take him bound to this effect in express terms; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> generally being to enable the tenant, upon a new lease, to carry on the cultivation of the lands, as if the former lease had not terminated. What these additional stipulations should be, must depend in part on the season of the year at which the new lease commences, and in part on the course of crops best adapted to the soil, and the particular circumstances of every farm.\n\n3. The enlargement of farms to such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> as admits of arrangements and machinery for saving labour is the natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the progress of agriculture, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACQUISITION\">acquisition</a> of capital by cultivators, and becomes, in its turn, the cause of further improvements. We have not room to examine here the various objections to large farms which were urged by Dr Price, Lord Kames, and most of the economical writers of the last century. Much stronger reasons, certainly, than any that have been hitherto advanced, must be required to justify the interference of the Legislature with the rights of the agricultural classes\u2014with that of a landholder to draw the greatest revenue from his property, and with that of a farmer to extend his concerns as far as his capital and abilities will permit. Even though it should be conceded to Dr Price, that a given extent of land yields a greater produce in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of several small farmers than of one great farmer, it still remains to inquire, what part of that produce can be spared for the general consumption?\u2014and whether the labour of these people might not be employed with more advantage than on such minute portions of land as yield, even in the best seasons, little more than food for their own subsistence? In Britain, of which the families employed in agriculture are to those of the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> only as 1 to 2.84, and in which the proportion of lands cultivated, or that may be cultivated, is not four acres to every individual, the great object ought certainly to be, to increase the disposable produce of the country for the supply of the general population.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> objection to large farms, that they depopulate the country, is not supported by facts. The population of the country has not only greatly increased since the enlargement of farms, but, in the ten years from 1801 to 1811, this increase appears to have been only two per cent. less than that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWN\">town</a> population. The fact is, that the increase of the rural population has been in a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a> than that of the town population, in those counties, such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTHUMBERLAND\">Northumberland</a>, where very large farms abound; and where, indeed, as is usually the case, this state of things is combined with a spirited and productive system of agriculture. Even in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-LANCASHIRE\">Lancashire</a>, the ratio of increase is only two per cent. in favour of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>; but no one will ascribe this to the enlargement of farms. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> seems to be, that, wherever agriculture has made the greatest progress, whatever may be the size of farms, the increase of employment has been attended with a corresponding increase of population; and that the ratio of increase General has been kept <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> below that of towns, by no other causes than the stationary condition or slow progress of agriculture in some parts, and the superior allurements of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> in others.\n\nIt is farther to be remarked, that, throughout the whole of the arable districts of Scotland, the number of people is proportionally greater on large than on small farms. The number of hands required on the former is too great to be lodged in the farmer's own Married <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>; and, therefore, on all such farms cottages are Farm-Servants built for their residence. These cottages are generally inhabited by married men, whose families find employment in hoeing green crops, and other easy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, from a very early age. In the less improved counties, on the other hand, where small farms still prevail, unmarried servants are preferred, as, on such farms, there is little or no employment for the families of married servants. Our limits do not permit us to inquire how far the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> laws of England operate against the employment of married servants, living in cottages on every farm; but the happy effects of this arrangement are manifest in the southeastern counties of Scotland, as we shall notice immediately.\n\nThe possession of land is held by some writers to Cottage-be so important, with a view to the comforts of the Farms, labouring classes, as well as to the increase of the rural population, that they have not been contented with objecting to large farms, but have proceeded to recommend what are called cottage-farms, for country labourers generally. Of this plan we might say at once, that it must be limited everywhere by the demand for labour; and that, wherever such small allotments are required by the state of agriculture, they will gradually be formed from motives of interest, without the necessity of any higher control. They are at this time common in many parts of Britain; and a different system has been established in other parts, for no other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> than because of its superior advantages to all concerned. Yet, as cottage-farms bear a very plausible appearance in the eye of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a> men, it seems necessary to offer some farther remarks on a question which has been so often agitated.\n\nIf every labourer had a comfortable cottage, and four acres of land at a moderate rent, as recommended by some of the correspondents of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOARD\">Board</a> of Agriculture, there is reason to believe that his condition might be much improved for a few years, supposing the demand for labour to continue the same as at present. Even the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a> which this class would every year send forth in quest of new cottages might be supplied for a time; and though the wages of labour must sink very fast, still this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREMIUM\">premium</a> might enable the labourers to multiply with little interruption for several generations. At last, however, the multiplication of cottage-farms must necessarily stop, and a great proportion of the people, without land and without the means of employment, would either sink into helpless misery, or be driven by despair to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> of every species of enormity. Such was the state of England at the breaking up of the feudal system, the policy of which also was to increase the number of the people, without regard to\nthe means of their employment; and such, though in a much less degree, is the present state of those parts of the united <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> in which cottage-farms are the most prevalent.\n\nThe whole question, we think, is capable of being most satisfactorily decided, by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> mercantile criterion of rent. If a hundred labourers, each of them possessing four acres, can pay a higher rent than one farmer can pay for the whole four hundred, buildings, fences, and repairs, being estimated, we can see no reason why they should not be preferred; but if this be not the case, we are greatly at a loss to conceive with what justice landholders can be called upon to submit to sacrifices which no other class of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a> is ever expected to make. We might, with just as much reason and justice, require a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANUFACTURER\">manufacturer</a> to employ a certain number of hands in proportion to the amount of his capital, however unprofitable to him might be their labour.\n\nBut, farther, in all our best agricultural counties, there are two sorts of cottages occupied by two distinct classes of labourers. Of the first sort are the small agricultural villages, where those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a> and other labourers reside, who could not find full employment on any one farm. To such men small farms are advantageous, or otherwise, according to the nature and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTANCY\">constancy</a> of their employment.\n\nThe other class of cottagers, to which we have already alluded, are ploughmen and other servants employed throughout the year on a particular farm. To these men small possessions of land are almost as unsuitable as they would be to a country gentleman's domestics. But a small garden is usually attached to each cottage; and they are also allowed to keep a cow, as part of their wages,\u2014not upon any particular spot of their own, but along with their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>'s cows. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a> is carried home by their master's teams, and a part of his own field, ready dressed, is assigned them for raising potatoes, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAX\">flax</a>, or other crops for their families. Thus, with little risk from the seasons or markets, and without any other demand on their time than a few leisure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a> will satisfy, these people enjoy all the advantages which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCCUPANCY\">occupancy</a> of land can confer on a labourer. And there is not a more useful, we may also add, a more comfortable, body of men among the industrious classes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>.\n\nTo give this class of labourers four acres of land, along with every cottage, would be to render them bad servants, and worse farmers; and either a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NUISANCE\">nuisance</a> to the person on whose farm they reside, or his abject dependents for employment. The only proper residence for men who do not choose to engage, or are not wanted, as constant labourers, is in such central agricultural villages as we have just mentioned, and not on separate farms, where they are excluded from the general market for labour.\n\nBut it is needless to proceed further with this discussion. Of all the witnesses examined before the late Committees of Parliament on the corn laws, there is only one whose sentiments are opposed to the general feeling of all well-informed men, regarding the advantages that have resulted from the enlargement of farms. We shall, therefore, content ourselves with noticing what appears to be the natural progress in the size of farms,\u2014the circumstances which prevent any possible enlargement of them from ever becoming injurious to the public,\u2014and the influence which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> liberty in this respect has exerted in the improvement of our agriculture.\n\nDuring the feudal system, that part of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESTATE\">estate</a> which was not cultivated under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of the proprietor himself, was let out in small allotments to his vassals, from whom he received <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> or other services, or a portion of the produce, in return. In these times of turbulence and ferocity, the power of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> mainly depended on the number of his tenants; and it was therefore his policy to increase them as much as possible, by dividing his land into very small possessions. That they might assist one another in their rural labours, and in repelling the incursions to which they were incessantly exposed, these tenants were collected in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VILLAGE\">village</a> near the castle of their lord. A certain extent of arable land was appropriated to it, on which they raised corn, and a much larger tract of waste or wood land, where their live stock pastured in common. Spirited cultivation could never be introduced into this system of occupancy; nothing more than the means of subsistence was sought by the tenantry, and power, not revenue, was the great object of the landholder.\n\nFor a long time after the fall of the feudal system, this arrangement continued to prevail with little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a>; its vestiges are still to be traced in every part of Britain; and it exists in several counties, though in a modified form, even at the present time. The common fields and commons of England, and the infield and outfield divisions of Scotland, did not originate in any regard for the welfare of the lower classes, to whom the tenancy of land is now thought to be so necessary, but in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANARCHY\">anarchy</a> and oppression of those dark ages in which all the landed property of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> was engrossed by a few great barons.\n\nWhen these petty sovereigns were at last overthrown, and when commerce and the arts held up to them new objects of desire, and to their depressed tenantry new modes of employment and subsistence, the bond which had hitherto connected the landholder and cultivator became more and more feeble, and it was soon found necessary to establish it upon other foundations than those of feudal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-PROTECTION\">protection</a> and dependence. The connection between landlord and tenant came gradually and generally to assume that commercial form, which is at once most conducive to their own interest, and to the general welfare.\n\nOne great obstacle to this change was the want of capital ready to be embarked in agricultural pursuits. Under the feudal system there could be little or no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCUMULATION\">accumulation</a>. Property in land was the only means of obtaining the command of labour, and a share of the produce its only recompense. Accordingly, upon the breaking up of the feudal system, large tracts were taken into the immediate possession of landholders themselves, because no suitable tenants could be found.

Externally it assumes the form of an uninterrupted shell <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> covering, which is called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a> part, and a very delicate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEXTURE\">texture</a> of fine plates or fibres intersecting each other, and leaving small spaces between them, projects internally from this, which is called the cellular or reticulated part. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> of these two, varies in different bones.\n\nB. Of the Marrow.\n\n172. The chemical properties of the oily matter of the marrow, have not yet been sufficiently investigated.\n\nC. The Periosteum.\n\n173. This covering distinctly possesses the structure of tendinous substance.\n\n174. We cannot regard it as correct, that it is prolonged from one bone to another over <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a>. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> it covers the whole outer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a> of the compact substance, except at those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> where one bone is united to another.\n\n2. The Connections of Bones.\n\n175. The connections between bones are of two kinds; some admit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, others do not.\n\nA. Connections admitting Motion.\n\n176. It may be remarked of those bones which are united in such a manner as to enjoy motion <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> each other, that their touching surfaces never consist of bare osseous substance, nor even of osseous substance covered with periosteum. They are either provided with separate crusts or prolongations of cartilage, the surfaces of which play directly on each other, constituting what is denominated a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> or articulation; or they are united to one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> intermediate substance, which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEXIBLE\">flexible</a>, or admits of compression.\n\na. Articulations or Joints.\n\na. The Cartilages.\n\n177. The surfaces of the portions of cartilage, which are in contact with each other in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of connection, are always as smooth as the finest polished <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IVORY\">ivory</a>.\n\n178. It was affirmed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> ago by Dr Nesbit (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">Human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OSTEOLOGY\">Osteology</a>), and Dr Hunter (Phil. Trans. 1743), and has been much insisted on of late years by Bichat (Anat. G\u00e9n\u00e9r.), that these surfaces are covered with a very delicate prolongation of synovial membrane. We are very much inclined to think, however, from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of experiments, that these anatomists have been mistaken.\n\nb. The Ligaments.\n\n179. All articulated bones are partly held together by means of ligaments. These are composed of tendinous substance, and may be divided into fascicular and capsular. The fascicular ligaments are disposed in cords, at intervals, around the joint; the capsular form a continuous web, including the united surfaces in a kind of shut sac.\n\n\u03b3. The Synovial Membrane.\n\n180. In all the intervals between fascicular ligaments, portions of synovial membrane may be distinctly seen filling up these intervals. They are attached to the ligaments on the one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, and to the articulated bones on the other, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> at the edge of the cartilaginous surfaces.\n\n181. It does not seem to us, however, to have been yet satisfactorily ascertained, whether this synovial membrane be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> over the inner surface of the fascicular ligaments; or how it is disposed in joints, of which the ligaments are of the capsular kind.\n\nb. Without Articulation.\n\n182. The small bones of the spine called vertebrae, are united to each other chiefly in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>. The portions of them denominated their bodies, are directly connected to pieces of a flexible and compressible substance, somewhat between cartilage and tendon in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, one piece being common to two vertebrae.\n\nB. Connections not admitting Motion.\n\n183. These may be divided into two kinds, suture and synchondrosis.\n\na. Suture.\n\n184. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>, the bones are united by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> contact of their osseous substance. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTIGUOUS\">contiguous</a> parts, however, are in general more or less indented or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERRATED\">serrated</a>, the projecting parts of the one being fixed into holes or grooves in the other. The periosteum passes across the line of junction, and does not dip <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> between the united surfaces.\n\nb. Synchondrosis.\n\n185. In this mode, a piece of cartilage, or some\n3. Dimensions and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">Weight</a> of the Skeleton.\n\n186. The height of the skeleton of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> five feet eight inches, we believe, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be found in general to be about five feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> inches.\n\n187. Soemmerring (De Corp. Hum. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-TAB\">Tab</a>. I.) has made some trials of the weight of the skeleton; and, according to him, it varies from 150 to 200 ounces. But we are uncertain as to the weights he employed, and ignorant of the manner in which his estimates were made.\n\nII. In the Adult <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEMALE\">Female</a>.\n\n188. The same general remarks which have just been made with respect to the skeleton of the adult male, apply equally to that of the adult female; only the skeleton of the latter is a little lower, and not so heavy. According to Soemmerring, it weighs in general only from 100 to 150 ounces.\n\nIII. Before and after Maturity.\n\n189. Parts corresponding to the skeleton may be distinctly perceived in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMBRYO\">embryo</a> of seven or eight weeks. At this early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, however, osseous substance has not yet appeared. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> bones, we find either a pellucid substance like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JELLY\">jelly</a>, moulded into their general form, and surrounded with periosteum, or else a simple membrane resembling the periosteum in structure. Some bones are wholly gelatinous, others wholly membranous, and others partly in the one state and partly in the other.\n\n190. About the end of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OSSIFICATION\">ossification</a> begins. It does not commence, however, in all parts of the skeleton at once, but takes place at different periods in different bones, or even in different parts of the same bone. Its commencement in some is delayed until a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> after birth.\n\n191. When we attend to the progress of ossification in those parts of the fetal skeleton which are at first gelatinous, we observe, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> any of these parts are converted into osseous substance so early as the second or third month after conception, they seem to undergo very little previous change of consistence. If they are not ossified, however, till the fourth or fifth month, they gradually lose their resemblance to jelly, becoming firmer, more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a>, and more opaque; and if the ossification is still further delayed, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPACITY\">opacity</a>, firmness, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTICITY\">elasticity</a>, rapidly increase, they acquire a pearly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, and are converted into a substance in every respect the same as cartilage.\n\n192. When the ossification commences in this gelatinous or cartilaginous basis, the first part which is ossified is always observed to be situated towards the centre of the jelly or cartilage; and from this point the process gradually extends in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>. In early ossifications, the parts are so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a>, that it is difficult to perceive the appearances in the gelatinous basis which immediately precede the formation of the osseous substance. But in those which commence at a later period, the parts of the cartilage which are just about to be converted into bone, uniformly exhibit a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of vascularity; and a number of little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> specks are observed in them, in each of which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CAPILLARY\">capillary</a> blood-vessel seems to terminate, and in which the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BONY\">bony</a> particles that are formed generally appear.\n\n193. When ossification commences in a membranous part of the fetal skeleton, the osseous substance first appears in the form of a fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">net</a>-work of slender fibres, confined to a small spot in the middle of the membrane. But by the formation of additional osseous particles, this net-work is converted into a plate of bone of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> thinness and delicacy, and having a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LAYER\">layer</a> of the membrane covering each surface, which may be regarded as its periosteum. Innumerable bony fibres are then observed to shoot out, in a radiated direction, from the margins of this little plate, and these are soon connected by short transverse threads of osseous substance, in such a manner, as to give the bone for a time a slightly reticular appearance. The spaces between the fibres seem entirely filled up by blood-vessels.\n\n194. In this manner, the ossification extends through the whole membrane, splitting it, as it proceeds, into two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAYERS\">layers</a>, which become the periosteum of the opposite surfaces of the new bone, but remain united into one single membrane around the whole of its margin. At the same time, however, that the bone is thus enlarging in breadth, it is also increasing in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOLIDITY\">solidity</a>, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEPOSITION\">deposition</a> of new osseous particles between those already formed. At <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a>, it assumes the form of a continuous plate of compact substance, the different parts of which are proportioned in their thickness to the corresponding parts of the future bone; and if the adult bone contains any reticulated substance, the cells are generally developed in the middle of this compact plate.\n\n195. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a> sooner are the cancelli developed in any part of a young bone, than they are lined with a very vascular medullary membrane. This membrane, however, contains only a slightly viscid, reddish, and transparent fluid. It does not appear to begin to receive any admixture of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> till after birth. At first, the proportion of oily matter is small, and it increases in general so gradually, that the fluid does not acquire the consistence or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of true medullary oil, until the period of maturity.\n\n196. In old persons, the medullary membrane seems to become less vascular, and the oil acquires a yellower colour.\n\n197. The periosteum in the fetus is much thicker, and more tender than in the adult. It is more vascular too, and particularly at those parts of a bone where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> ossification is going on. In old persons, it is thinner and less vascular.\n\n198. As soon as the soft <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> of the future bones are visible in the fetus, divisions may be observed in them corresponding to the articulations and synchondroses, but none to the sutures.\n\n199. The ligaments and synovial membranes in the young person seem to differ in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> only from those of the adult.\n200. For a considerable time after the margins of bones, that are intended to be united by suture, first come into contact, they adhere so slightly to each other, that the bones seem chiefly held together by the periosteum which passes from the one to the other. By degrees, however, as the bones are more fully developed, they are locked more firmly into each other.\n\n201. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> of the articulations seems to undergo very little change in the decline of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. But it is not unusual, in very advanced <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, to find the cartilages partially converted into osseous substance. On the approach of old age too, we may almost always observe that the sutures begin to be obliterated. Particles of osseous substance are formed between the margins of the bones, the line of the suture is gradually filled up, and at last the bones are fairly continued into each other.","sp":524,"ep":526},{"h":"OXYRHYNCI","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENUS\">Genus</a> 13.

The chieftain who prepares to attack a rival <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a>, marshals his followers; and, after the bloody conflict has terminated, he reckons up the slain, and marks his unhappy and devoted captives. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> those numbers were small, they could easily be represented by very portable emblems, by round <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEBBLES\">pebbles</a>, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DWARF\">dwarf</a>-shells, by fine nuts, by hard grains, by small beans, or by knots tied on a string. But to express the larger numbers, it became necessary, for the sake of distinctness, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> those little objects or counters in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> rows, which the eye could comprehend at a single glance; as, in the telling of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, it would soon have become customary to dispose the rude counters, in two, three, four, or more ranks, as circumstances might suggest. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> would then be less distracted, resting chiefly on the number of marks presented by each separate row.\n\nLanguage insensibly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOULDS\">moulds</a> itself to our wants. But it was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to furnish a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> for each particular number: <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> could supply such a multitude of words as would be necessary, and no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> could ever retain them. The only practical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of proceeding was to have recourse, as on other occasions, to the powers of classification. By conceiving the individuals of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> to be distributed into successive ranks and divisions, a few component terms might be made sufficient to express the whole. We may discern around us traces, accordingly, of the progress of numeration, through all its gradations.\n\nThe earliest and simplest mode of reckoning was by pairs, arising naturally from the circumstance of both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> being employed for the sake of expedition. It is now familiar among sportsmen, who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> the names of brace and couple, words that signify pairing or yoking.\u2014To count by threes was another step, though not practised to the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>. It has been preserved, how-\never, by the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a> of men, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEASH\">leash</a>, meaning the strings by which three dogs and no more can be held at once in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>.\u2014The numbering by fours has had a more extensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a>: It was evidently suggested by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>, in rapid tale, of taking a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> in each hand. Our fishermen, who generally reckon in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CALL\">call</a> every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> pair of herrings, for instance, a throw or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a>; and the term <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WARP\">warp</a>, which, from its German origin, has exactly the same import, is employed to denote four, in various <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of trade.\n\nThose simple arrangements would, at their first application, carry the reckoning but a very little way. To express larger numbers, it was necessary to repeat the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of classification. The ordinary steps, by which language ascends from particular to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> objects, might point out the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> path. A collection of individuals forms a species; a cluster of species makes a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENUS\">genus</a>; a bundle of genera composes an order; and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUP\">group</a> of orders perhaps constitutes a class. Such is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> indispensably required in framing the successive arrangement of the almost unbounded subjects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">Natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a>. A similar mode is pursued in the subdivision and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a> of the members of a vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>.\n\nIn following out the classification of numbers, it seemed easy and natural, after the first step had been made, to repeat the same procedure. If a heap of pebbles were disposed in certain rows, it would evidently facilitate their enumeration, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> each of those rows into similar parcels, and thus carry forward the successive subdivision till it stopped. The heap, so analysed by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of partition, might then be expressed with a very few low numbers easily formed, and capable of being distinctly retained. The particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> adopted, would soon become clothed with terms borrowed from the vernacular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IDIOM\">idiom</a>.\n\nLet us endeavour to trace the steps by which a child or a savage, prompted by native curiosity, would proceed in classing, for instance, thirty-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> similar objects. He might be conceived first to arrange them by successive pairs. Selecting thirty-nine of the smallest shells or grains he could find, he would dispose these in two rows, each containing nineteen counters, with one over. Having thus reduced the number to nineteen, he might subdivide this again, by representing only one of the rows with shells twice as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> as before. He would consequently obtain two rows of nine each, with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a> of one. Instead of these shells, were he to employ shells of a double <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIZE\">size</a>, it would be sufficient to denote one of the rows, or to dispose it into two rows. These rows contain only four counters with one over. Again, by adopting counters of a double size, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> row might be represented by one pair, each containing only two marks exactly. These again could be denoted by a single pair of counters, having twice the former dimensions. As a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a>, one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTER\">counter</a>, of double dimensions, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> express the last row.\u2014Hence the number thirty-nine, decomposed by repeated pairing, would be denoted by one counter of the sixth order, one of the third, one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, and another of the first.\n\nSuppose a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> should attempt to represent the same number, by triple rows of shells or counters. He would first have thirteen of the smallest shells in each row, and no more. Then, expressing one of the rows by shells of three times the size or value, it would be again resolved into three rows, each containing four counters, with an excess of one. Taking the last of these rows, therefore, and employing counters of triple size, it would be represented by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> of single counters, with one over. Finally, this column would be marked by a single tripled counter.\u2014The number thirty-nine is thus expressed, on the system of triplication, by a counter of the fourth order, one of the third, and another of the second.\n\nLastly, conceive the number thirty-nine to be reckoned by double pairs or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRUPLE\">quadruple</a> rows. Each row would then contain only nine counters, with an excess of three. But a single row would express the same as all these four, if each counter in it were changed into another of quadruple size or value; and, consequently, this row might be again distributed into four ranks, each consisting of only two marks, with one left. Retain one of these ranks, and substitute counters of quadruple effect, and two such will express the whole amount.\u2014Hence thirty-nine, analysed by the system of double pairs or warps, would be represented by two counters of the third order, one of the second, and three of the first.\n\nIn the ruder periods of society, a gradation of counters, accommodated to such a process of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMERICAL\">numerical</a> analysis, was supplied by pebbles, grains, or shells of different sizes. This series, however, is very limited, and would soon confine the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANGE\">range</a> of decomposition. To reach a greater extent, it was necessary to proceed by a swifter analysis; to distribute the counters, for instance, successively into ten or twenty rows, and to make pebbles, shells, or other marks, having their size only doubled perhaps or tripled, to represent values increased ten or twenty\nBeyond this stage in the progress of numeration, none of the various tribes dispersed over the vast American Continent seem ever to have passed. In the Old World, it is probable that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PAUSE\">pause</a> of improvement had ensued among the nations which were advanced to the same point in the arts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a>, in such arithmetical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOTATION\">notation</a>, of employing the natural objects to signify a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> more than their relative size imports, would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> at last to a most important step in the ascent. Instead of distinguishing the different orders of counters by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a>, they might be made to derive an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> value from their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> alone. It would be sufficient, for that purpose, to employ marks all of the same kind, but disposed on a graduating series of vertical bars or columns. The augmented value which these marks acquire in rising through the successive bars, would evidently be quite arbitrary, depending, in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KEY\">key</a> to be fixed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVENTION\">convention</a>. This point in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a> of discovery was attained by the Greeks at a very early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, and communicated to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>, during their whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAREER\">career</a> of empire, to practise a sort of tangible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARITHMETIC\">arithmetic</a>, which they transmitted to their successors in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. The Chinese also have, from the remotest antiquity, been accustomed to employ a similar mode of calculation, which they are said to manage with singular skill and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a>.\n\nResuming, therefore, the number thirty-nine; if it were distributed by successive pairing, it would be thus denoted on a series of six vertical bars.\n\nThe same number, decomposed by a repeated trisection, will assume a simpler appearance, being comprised in four bars.\n\nBut thirty-nine, when analysed by a succession of double pairs, would require for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> six counters arranged on three bars.\n\nSuppose the objects to be reckoned were so numerous, that one hundred and sixty-five counters might be required to represent them. Placed in a single row, these counters would only give the very confused idea of multitude. But, if counted by pairs, or divided into two rows of eighty-two each, with an odd one, they would become a little more distinct. Were every counter now, in each row to denote a pair, a single row of them would have the power of both. Let this row be reckoned again by pairs, and it will change into two higher rows, each consisting of forty-one counters, without any excess. But one of these third rows would be sufficient alone, if each counter in it were esteemed equal to a pair in the second rows, or equal to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUPLICATE\">duplicate</a> pair, or four in the first row. Again, tell one of the third rows over by pairs, and the forty-one counters will be converted into two fourth rows, containing twenty each, and one over. In like manner, each counter of a fourth row, being conceived equal to a pair in the third row, or a triplicate pair, that is, eight on the first row, a Palpable single row, including twenty of those higher counters, would have the same effect. Now, this twenty would be reduced to a pair of rows of ten counters each. Let each counter in the fifth row have the power of two in the fourth row, or of a quadruplicate pair, or sixteen in the first row; and ten such counters would be sufficient. But ten would give five pairs of sixth rows, one of which might denote the whole, if each counter in it were held equal to two in the preceding row, or to a quintuplicate pair, or thirty-two on the first row. Again, the last five counters would be divided into two pairs and one counter, and these two pairs into a single pair of a higher order.\n\nThis analysis appears tedious when so detailed, but it would proceed with great ease and rapidity in practice. The number one hundred and sixty-five would, therefore, on the system of successive pairings, be expressed by one septuplicate pair, one quintuplicate pair, one duplicate pair, and one. The language seems very uncouth, merely from its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a> and inaptness to our idiom; but its elements are extremely clear and simple. If a few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COGNATE\">cognate</a> words had been devised to express the several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a> of pairs, or the ascending <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a> of the powers of two; it would have removed every objection.\n\nThis arrangement, whereby a number is analysed into certain elements by the operation of distributing it and its sections into successive pairs or duads, may be called the Binary Scale, of which two is the root or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">index</a>. This scale, resting on so narrow a basis, expands slowly, and is therefore not very fit for expressing large numbers by words. But it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> adapted for the simplicity of emblematic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXHIBITION\">exhibition</a>. Suppose marks or counters were placed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> rows or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> bars, proceeding from the right hand to the left, such that a counter on any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> should be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to two laid on the bar immediately before it. Instead of putting the hundred and sixty-five counters on the first bar, it would be the same thing to leave one on that bar, and place eighty-two on the next. But instead of eighty-two counters on the second bar, the effect would be the same, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> over it, and put forty-one on the third bar. Counting these forty-one also by pairs, we should leave one on the third bar, and carry twenty to the next. But twenty divided into successive pairs, would leave the fourth and fifth bars vacant, and throw five on the next. The five again would, after bisection, leave one on the sixth bar, and transfer two to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEVENTH\">seventh</a>; or, passing over this, they would carry one to the eighth bar. The decomposition thus effected would appear as below; where only four counters, and as many blanks, are sufficient to exhibit the number one hundred and sixty-five. By this elementary arrangement, a very distinct idea is conveyed: The eye can easily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CATCH\">catch</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a>, and the memory preserve it.\n\n**BINARY SCALE**\n\nA similar effect would be produced, though much less clearly, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of strokes, or of Runic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCULPTURE\">sculpture</a>, as thus represented.\nThe advantages of the binary scale of notation were prodigiously extolled by the celebrated Leibnitz, who condescended even to write a discourse on its use and mode of adaptation. This very learned, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a>, and indefatigable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>, had the satisfaction to discover, from the researches of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> Missionaries, and particularly from the letters of Father Bouvet, some feeble traces of the Binary Notation in the early history of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHINA\">China</a>. Fou-hi, the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">Emperor</a> and founder of that vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONARCHY\">monarchy</a>, is venerated in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EAST\">East</a> as a promoter of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">Geometry</a>, and the inventor of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>, the knowledge of which has been since lost. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMBLEM\">emblem</a> of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCCULT\">occult</a> science consists of eight separate clusters of three parallel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> or trigrams, drawn one above another, after the Chinese manner of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>, and represented either entire or broken in the middle. Those varied trigrams were called Koua or suspended symbols, from the circumstance of their being exposed in the public places. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of such varied clusters, it was not difficult for the sagacity of Leibnitz to perceive the application of the Binary Scale carried only to three ranks, or as far as the number eight. The entire lines signify one, two, or four, according to their order, while the broken lines are void, and serve merely to indicate the rank of the others. Before this invention, the only mode of reckoning used in China was by knots tied on a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CORD\">cord</a>. In Plate XXVII. the Emperor is figured, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTING\">pointing</a> with a stylus at the two-fold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROGRESSION\">progression</a>; being copied exactly from the third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the M\u00e9moires sur les Chinois, omitting only the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GROTESQUE\">grotesque</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PORTRAIT\">portrait</a> of the Sage. Those emblems were besides intended to convey a store of mystical or mythological knowledge. In the trigrams of Fou-hi, the pious and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORTHODOX\">orthodox</a> Missionaries could not fail to discover certain edifying traces of the mystery of the Trinity, at an epoch perhaps as remote as that of the Deluge.\n\nThe next Emperor, Chen-noung, devoted his attention chiefly to the improvement of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>. But he likewise extended the Kona or the dualic system of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREDECESSOR\">predecessor</a>, employing hexagrams instead of trigrams. These hexagrams were formed with six parallel lines, broken or entire, and placed one above the other. In short, they were the first six bars of the binary scale, of which the last term would represent thirty-two, and all the terms together would reach to sixty-four. Chen-noung contrived that the hexagrams should likewise exhibit sixty-four varieties of combination, by placing them in eight rays issuing from the same central space which was occupied by one of the eight trigrams. See M\u00e9moires sur les Chinois, Tome II. p. 189, Planche viii.\n\nThe Ternary Scale of numeration, which reckons by successive threes or triads, advances with more speed. Thus, suppose, as before, that one hundred and sixty-five were to be exhibited on it. Counted by threes, or, in the sportsman's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHRASE\">phrase</a>, by leashes, no counter would be left on the first bar, but fifty-five thrown to the next bar or that of the simple triads. These fifty-five counters, being again told by threes, would leave one on the second bar, and carry eighteen to the third bar, or that of duplicate triads. This eighteen, counted twice in succession, would pass over the fourth and fifth bars, and throw two marks to sixth bar, or that of quintuple triads. The original number so decomposed, might therefore be denominated two quintuple triads, and one single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-TRIAD\">triad</a>. It is denoted by three counters, as in the form here annexed.\n\nThe number might likewise be readily expressed, though less perfectly, by combined strokes or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>.\n\nIt is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> that the Ternary Scale, though more powerful than the Binary, requires two sets of marks or counters. In the example now taken, each counter on the ascending bars represents three, nine, twenty-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a>, or eighty-one; and the number itself is consequently split into two eighty-ones and three.\n\nLet still the same number be arranged on the Quaternary Scale which proceeds by Fours or Tetrad. One hundred and sixty-five, told over by double pairs or warps, would leave one counter on the first bar, and carry forty-one to the next. This forty-one again, reckoned by warps or throws, would drop one counter on the second bar, and transfer ten counters to the third bar. The ten being now counted, would leave two counters on the next bar, and carry two to the fourth bar. The original number would therefore be described as containing two triplicate tetrads, two duplicate tetrads, one tetrad and one; and it would be designated in this manner:\n\nOr, if the less satisfactory mode of strokes were employed, one hundred and sixty-five would be thus exhibited.\n\nThis number is analysed into twice sixty-four, twice sixteen, four, and one. Three sets of counters would evidently be required to fit this scale for its application.\n\nThe Quaternary Scale may be considered as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-REDUPLICATION\">reduplication</a> of the Binary, each bar of the former comprising two bars of the latter. This effect will appear more conspicuous by comparing the same number as it was exhibited on both scales. It is alleged that the Guaranis and Lulos, two of the very lowest races of savages which inhabit the boundless forests of South <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>, count only by fours; at least that they express five by four and one, six by four and two, and so forth. We may gather from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>, that a certain tribe of Thracians were accustomed to use the quaternary scale of numeration; for he says that they proceeded no farther than four.*\n\n*Mosse \u1f00\u03bd \u03b4\u03b5\u03ba\u03b1\u03c0\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f48\u03c1\u03c7\u03b1\u03af\u03c9\u03bd \u03b3\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03a4\u0395\u03a4\u03a4\u0391\u03a0\u0391. Arist. Problemata. xv. 3.\nwhich they would doubtless continue to repeat. If such was the historical fact, those simple people must have never advanced beyond the early practice of reckoning successively by casts or warps. It seems probable that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYTHAGORAS\">Pythagoras</a> was acquainted with the quaternary system, which he brought from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>. Hence perhaps the mystical veneration which the followers of that philosopher professed to entertain for the tetractys or quaternion, the root of the scale, which contains besides, within itself, the number denoting the elementary musical proportions. Near the end of the seventeenth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, Weigelius seriously proposed, in Germany, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADOPTION\">adoption</a> of the Tetractys or Quaternary numeration, which he explained, with copious detail, in a learned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> entitled Aretologistica.*\n\nTo advance a step farther, let the same number be represented on the Quinary Scale, which reckons by the series of fives or pentads. Classed in this way, it would pass over the first bar, and throw thirty-three counters to the second. Told over again, it would leave three counters on the second bar, and carry six to the third; and the six, reckoned by fives, would drop one counter on the third bar, and advance one to the next. One hundred and sixty-five would therefore be denominated one triplicate pentad, one duplicate pentad, and three single pentads; and it would be thus denoted:\n\nThis number might also be exhibited on the same scale by the combination of strokes with dots:\n\nBy this classification, the number one hundred and sixty-five is divided into one hundred and twenty-five, twenty-five, and three fives. The root or index of the scale being five, it would require four sets of counters to adapt it for practice.\n\nThe first bar of the Quinary Scale is actually used in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> among traders. In reckoning articles delivered, the person who takes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of the tale, having traced a long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> line, continues to draw, alternately above and below it, a warp or four vertical strokes, each set of which he crosses by an oblique score, and generally, we believe, calls out <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TALLY\">tally</a>! as often as the number five is completed.\n\nThe Quinary system has its foundation in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, being evidently derived from the practice of counting over the fingers of one hand. It appears accordingly, at a certain stage of society, to have been adopted among different nations. Thus, the Omaguas and the Zanucas of South America reckon generally by fives, which they call hands. The Toupinambos, a most ferocious and warlike <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> that inhabit the wilds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRAZIL\">Brazil</a>, would seem, according to the relation of Lery, to use the same kind of numeration. To denominate six, seven, and eight, those tribes only join to the word hand, the names for one, two, and three. The same mode, as we learn from Mungo <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARK\">Park</a>, is practised by some African nations; particularly the Yolofs and Foulahs, who designate ten by two hands, fifteen by three hands, and so progressively. The Quinary Numeration seems likewise, at a former period, to have obtained in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a>, for the word pentcha, which denotes five, is obviously derived from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RADICAL\">radical</a> term pendji, signifying a hand.\n\nWhen the index of the scale is larger, it often becomes inconvenient to place so many counters as are wanted on the same bar. But this notation may be abridged in the case where the index is even, by adopting a counter of greater dimensions, to signify the half of it. Suppose one hundred and sixty-five to be disposed in the Senary Scale, which proceeds by successive sixes or hextads. Parted into six rows, that number would leave three counters on the first bar, and cast twenty-seven to the next; this twenty-seven, being reckoned by sixes, would drop three counters on the second bar, and transfer four to the third bar. The original number would hence be described as four duplicate hextads, three single hextads, and three. But instead of placing three counters on the first and second bars, and four on the third bar, one large counter may supply the place of three; as in the form here annexed.\n\nThe Senary arrangement has few advantages to recommend it; yet it seems at one period to have been adopted in China, at the mandate of the Emperor Che-hoang-ti. This capricious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRANT\">tyrant</a>, who murdered the literati and burnt their books, having conceived an astrological fancy for the number six, commanded this to be used in all concerns of business or learning throughout his vast Empire. He directed a sort of arithmetic to be composed, with six for its basis; and he enjoined, that all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-WEIGHTS_AND_MEASURES\">weights and <a class</a>=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> should be arranged on the same scale. He divided China into six times six, or thirty-six, provinces; and was so much enamoured of this favourite number, as to order his chariot to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> six feet long, and to be drawn by six horses, with only six attendants.\n\n* This writer even goes so far as to invent names for the several orders of his Tetractys System. They will appear to have a sufficiently German <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, though not harsher than the terms we now use.\n\nSecond Order, or 4, - Erff.\nThird Order, or 16, - Zwerrf.\nFourth Order, or 64, - Secht.\nFifth Order, or 256, - Schock.\n\nSixth Order, or 1024, - Erff Schock.\nSeventh Order, or 4096, - Secht Schock.\nEighth Order, or 16384, - Schock mahl schock.\n\nWeigelii, Aretologistica vel Logistica Virtutum Genetrix. Norimbergae, 1687.\nLet this Octary Scale, which proceeds by successive eights or octads, be treated in a similar way. The original number, being reckoned by eights, would leave five counters on the first bar; and throw twenty to the next; and this twenty being told over again by eights, would leave four counters on the second bar, and carry two to the third. If, therefore, the large counter signify half the index, or four, one hundred and sixty-five will be thus denoted:\n\nThe number is denominated two duplicate octads, four single octads, and five; and it has been decomposed into two sixty-fours, four eights, and five.\n\nSuppose now that the Denary Scale of Notation were employed. The same number, reckoned by tens or decades, would leave five counters on the first bar, and cast sixteen to the next bar; which, being told again, would leave six counters on the second bar, and carry one to the third. This arrangement furnishes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DENOMINATION\">denomination</a> of one duplicate decad, six single decades, and five; which is simpler than any of the former appellations, and yet it sounds uncouth, owing merely to our want of familiarity with the terms. It would be marked in this way:\n\nWe are thus conducted by successive advances to that system of numeration which has prevailed among all civilized nations, and become incorporated with the very structure of language. This almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> consent clearly bespeaks the influence of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> principle. Nor is it difficult to perceive that the arrangement of numbers by tens would naturally flow from the practice so familiar in the earlier periods of society\u2014that of counting by the fingers on both hands. Aristotle in his Queries points at this origin, but with a less decided <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TONE\">tone</a> than might have been expected from him. The philosopher even hints at other concurring causes, some of which appear to be very fanciful. Such, for instance, is his conjecture, that the root of the denary scale might be derived from the summation of the numbers one, two, three, and four, included in the Pythagorean tetractys. If the original import and composition of the Greek terms \u1f11\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd, \u1f11\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd, \u1f11\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd, and \u03bc\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 for ten, a hundred, a thousand, and ten thousand, could be safely traced, we might discern the influence of the denary system in the formation of those words. The Roman terms for numerals proceed not farther than mille, a thousand; but they are evidently of the same family, with some of the slighter modifications.\n\nBut the origin of the names imposed on the radical numbers, appears most conspicuously <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> in the nakedness of the savage dialects. The Muyseca Indians, who formerly occupied the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> of Bogota in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of Grenada, were accustomed to reckon first as far as ten, which they called quihicha or a foot, meaning no doubt the number of toes on both feet, with which they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> went bare and exposed; and, beyond this number, they used terms equivalent to foot one, foot two, &c., corresponding to twelve, thirteen, &c. Another tribe, who likewise inhabits South America, the Sabiconos, call ten, the root of the scale, tunca, and repeat only the same word, to signify an hundred and a thousand, the former being termed tunca-tunca; and the latter tunca-tunca-tunca.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ETYMOLOGY\">Etymology</a>, guided by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, furnishes a sure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> for disclosing the monuments of early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a>, preserved though disguised, in the structure of language. Our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIALECT\">dialect</a> as immediately derived from its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOTHIC\">Gothic</a> stem, betrays a composition not less rude or expressive than the simple articulation of the Sabiconos. According to the authorities collected by a celebrated German philologist, the late very laborious and accurate Aedelung, the word eleven was most anciently written ciilif or ciilicin, being compounded of ei or one and the verb liban, to leave, and therefore signified merely one, leave; that is, retain one, and set aside no doubt ten, the root of the scale. Twelve has the same etymon. The names twenty, thirty, forty, &c., have the terminating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYLLABLE\">syllable</a> ty, which corresponds to zig in German, and zig or zuch among the oldest writers of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a> tongue. This termination is derived from the verb ziehen, to draw, and hence twenty means simply two drawings, thirty, three drawings, &c., intimating evidently, that so many tens are separated from the heap. The term hundred, which also runs unvaried through all the filiations of the Gothic, is formed of hund, which anciently signified only ten, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> or ret, a participle from the verb recitan, to reckon or place in rows: The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> would therefore intimate as much as ten times told, that is the reduplication of ten, or ten added ten times.\n\nIn the Gothic Translation of the Gospels made by Ulphilas, in the fourth century, one hundred is expressed by tackund tackund, or the word for ten merely doubled; exactly like the tunca tunca of the Sabiconos of South America. But in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANGLO_SAXON\">Anglo-Saxon</a> version, which was made about three centuries later, one hundred is denoted by hund teontig, meaning ten of ten drawings.

Problemata xv. 3.\nIt seems probable, that *hund* and *ten* or *teon* were only variations of the same word. The term *thousand* is merely an abbreviation of *divis-hund*, its earliest form. The prefix *divis* is the same as the word *twice*, and *hund* was probably contracted for *one hundred*. The combined expression would, therefore, signify a redoubled hundred, or one hundred repeated ten times.\n\nIt is remarkable that the Peruvian language was actually richer in the names for numerals than the polished dialects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Rome or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>. The Romans, we have seen, went not farther than *mille*, a thousand; and the Greeks made no distinctive word beyond *myriar*, or ten thousand. But, the inhabitants of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERU\">Peru</a>, under the Incas, following the Denary System, had the term *hue*, to denote one; *chacan*, ten; *pachae*, one hundred; *huarancay*, a thousand; and *hunu*, a million. These words are either original, or have been formed, like our numerical terms, by the abbreviation of certain compound expressions.\n\nPhilosophers, from Aristotle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to Locke, have too hastily given <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> to the vague reports of travelers, concerning the very scanty knowledge which savages possess of the art of numeration. Even the cautious and discriminating historian Dr Robertson, thinks himself warranted to conclude, from authorities which he quotes, that certain tribes of native Americans could reckon no further than ten; or perhaps twenty, while others advanced not beyond three. But, it is utterly repugnant to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONGRUITY\">congruity</a>, to suppose that any people should be found so destitute of mental faculties, as not to rise above those low numbers. It seems far more probable, that such numbers were merely the roots of the systems of classification adopted by the several tribes, and mistaken by unphilosophical travellers for the whole extent of their numeration. Every savage <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> must surely be supposed capable of reckoning up the bands of warriors which they can bring into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a>, amounting generally to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HUNDREDS\">hundreds</a>, and often to thousands.\n\nRoger Williams, one of the earliest settlers of New England, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>, though deeply tinged with the enthusiasm of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, published in 1643, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMALL_KEY\">small Key</a> to the language and manners of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> nations who then surrounded that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANT\">infant</a> colony, in which he gives an ample <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of the numerals employed by the native tribes. It hence appears, that those people used the Denary Scale of arrangement, and had a set of distinct words to express the numbers as far as a thousand, and could even advance as high as one hundred thousand, by help of combined terms. Thus, one they named *niqui*; ten, *piuck*; an hundred, *piwuck*; and a thousand, *mittonug*. But these words are apparently compound, and would doubtless be found to throw much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> on the subject of numeration, if we had any means of analysing them. The same author assures us, that the Indians, employing grains of corn for symbols, were very expert in their computations.\n\nAccording to the testimony of Leems, a respectable Moravian missionary, the Laplanders, in their computations, join very significantly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARDINAL\">cardinal</a> to the ordinal numbers. Thus, to express eleven and twelve, they say *auft nubbe lokkai*, and *gouft nubbe lokkai*; that is, one to the second ten, and two to the second ten. In like manner, to signify twenty-one and twenty-two, those rude people use the expression *auft gouft nubbe lokkai*; and *gouft gouft nubbe lokkai*, meaning one added to the third ten, and two added to the third ten. This procedure affords a curious and very happy illustration of the principle of numeral arrangement.\n\nThe Duodenary System of arrangement was introduced at a more advanced stage of society. It plainly drew its origin from the observation of the celestial phenomena, there being twelve months or lunations commonly reckoned in a solar year. The Romans adopted that index, to mark their subdivision of the unit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> or of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>. They distinguished the foot into three hand-breaths or palms, and each palm into four lengths of the thumb-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGIT\">digit</a>; and, in like manner, they first bisected the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a>, next bisected this again, and then divided the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> into three final portions. The twelfth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of a foot and that of a pound were alike termed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNCIA\">uncia</a>, which has branched into the modern words <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a> and ounce, applied more discriminately with us to the subdivisions of measure and of weight.\n\nThe mode of reckoning by twelves or dozens has been very generally adopted in the wholesale trade. Nor is its application confined to the first term of the progression; but extends to the second or even the third. Twelve dozen, or an hundred and forty-four, makes the long or great hundred of the Northern Nations, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROSS\">Gross</a> of traders. Twelve times this again, or seventeen hundred and twenty-eight, forms the Double Gross.\n\nLet the same number, one hundred and sixty-five, as before, be reckoned on the Duodenary Scale. It contains thirteen dozen and nine, or one gross one dozen and nine, and consequently, will be represented as here annexed.\n\nNext to the Denary Scale itself, the system of counting by progressive scores or twenties, derived from the same source, appears to have been the most prevalent. The savage who had reckoned the fingers on both hands, and then the toes on both feet, making twenty in all, might seem to have reached the utmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIMIT\">limit</a> of natural calculation. The Guaranis, a very simple and inoffensive tribe, who live on the shores of the Maranon, are accordingly said to proceed no farther in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> numeration. When these people want to signify an hundred, they only place in a row five heaps of maize, each composed of twenty grains. The Mexicans, however, being more advanced in society, were accustomed to employ the higher terms of the same progression, thus combining the Denary with the Binary scales. In the ancient hieroglyphic paintings of that unfortunate race, units, as far as a score, are exhibited by small balls; and twenty is denoted by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, which some authors, and particularly Clavigero, have mistaken for a club, but which was really a small standard or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAG\">flag</a>. In the same curious monuments, twenty scores, or four hun-\nPalpable dred, is signified by a spreading open feather; probably, because the grains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>, lodged in the hollow of a quill, represented, in some places, money or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDIUM\">medium</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a>. This symbol has, from the rudeness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a>, been taken at times for a pine-apple, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EAR\">ear</a> of maize, or even the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of a spear; but its application to intimate the duplicate scores is certain and invariable. A sack or bag, was also painted by those ingenious people, to represent twenty times twenty scores, or eight thousand. It was of the same form as a purse called xiquipilli, and supposed to hold eight thousand grains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CACAO\">cacao</a>. To avoid the multiplication of the balls, and other symbols, the Mexicans sometimes divided the flag denoting a score by two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> lines, and coloured the one half of it to signify ten, or covered three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of it with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> to mark fifteen. This mode of abbreviating the signs was evidently capable of farther <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a>. Plate XXVII. exhibits the series of Mexican hieroglyphic numerals, copied from Humboldt's splendid work entitled Vues des Cordilleres; and to illustrate their application, we have represented the current year 1816, by help of them, having its circle prefixed as indicating a complete revolution of the four seasons.\n\nTraces of numeration by scores or twenties still exist in the old continent. The expression three score and ten, in our own language, is more venerable than seventy; and the compound quatre-vingts et dix, is the ordinary mode in French for signifying ninety. The Arabians, according to Sylvestre de Sacy, counted no farther than four hundred or twenty scores, before the sixth century of the Hejira, which corresponds to about the middle of the eleventh century of the Christian era. To denote nine hundred, they had recourse to the clumsy expedient of redoubling the alphabetic character of four hundred, and joining to it the character of one hundred. The inhabitants of the province of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISCAY\">Biscay</a>, and of Armorica, people descended from the ancient Celts, are said to reckon like the Mexicans, by the powers of twenty, or the terms of progressive scores.\n\nAnother progression, still swifter in its operation than that by scores, and long familiar to Astronomers, was introduced into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALEXANDRIAN\">Alexandrian</a> school by the famous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMY\">Ptolemy</a>, who had the merit of digesting the results of celestial observations into a body of regular science. We allude to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEXAGENARY\">Sexagenary</a> Scale, which proceeds, as its name implies, by the successive powers of Sixty. This arrangement of numbers appears quite artificial, and was no doubt suggested by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of the circle founded on astronomical phenomena. Since the year is composed of twelve months, containing each about thirty days, the round number, three hundred and sixty, was chosen as the most convenient for subdividing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECLIPTIC\">ecliptic</a> into degrees. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RADIUS\">radius</a> of the circle, was naturally employed as a standard for the measuring of lines and arcs in general; and this being nearly the sixth part of the circumference, and comprising, therefore, about sixty degrees, the arcs themselves, or their multiples, when expressed by degrees, came to be reckoned by Sixties. The notation was effected by annexing a single dash for Sixty, two dashes for its duplicate, and three dashes for its triplicate.\n\nSince, in the notation by numeral scales, the import of a counter depends on the position of the bar on which it stands, any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> of the place of units must produce a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> change on the value of the whole amount of an expression. Thus, in the binary classification, the shifting of the bar of units one place lower, would, in effect, double all the preceding terms, and a second shift would double these again. In like manner, to carry the beginning of the scale a bar lower would, in the denary system, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> the units into tens, the tens into hundreds, and the hundreds into thousands; thus augmenting the whole tenfold. On the contrary, if the units were moved to a bar higher, the amount of any expression, would, in the binary scale, be reduced to one-half, and, in the denary, to the tenth part of its former value. Hence, to multiply or divide by the index of any scale or its powers, we have only to change the names of the bars, or to shift the place of the units.\n\nThe systems of progressive numeration are as well adapted to represent a descending as an ascending series; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> which greatly facilitates and simplifies the exhibition of fractions. Suppose, for example, it were sought to express eleven-sixteenths on the Binary Scale. Since a counter depressed by four bars will signify only the sixteenth of its original value, so eleven, reckoning upwards from the low bar, will express the value required.\n\nBut the analysis of the fraction might be performed otherwise. It is evident, that eleven-sixteenths on the first bar, or the bar of units, are only equivalent to twenty-two such parts, that is, one counter and sixteen-sixteenths, placed on the next descending bar. This excess again corresponds to twelve parts on the second bar, or twenty-four carried to the third bar, making one counter and eight-sixteenths. But these eight-sixteenths are equivalent to a whole counter on the fourth bar, where the exhibition stops. Hence the fraction proposed appears to consist of one-half, one-eighth, and one-sixteenth.\n\nOn the Quaternary Scale, this fraction would require only two bars, since sixteen is only the second power of the index four.\n\nBut the second mode of decomposition is, on the whole, simpler. The eleven-sixteenths of a counter on the bar of units, are equivalent to forty-four, or two counters, and twelve such parts on the next bar; and these twelve-sixteenths correspond to forty-eight, which compose three entire counters on the third bar. The original fraction is thus analysed into two-fourths and three-sixteenths.\n\nTo express the fraction on the Senary Scale, more bars are wanted. It is now equivalent, on the bar immediately after that of units, to sixty-six-sixteenths, or four counters and two parts. This small excess corresponds to twelve on the third bar, or seventy-two on the fourth bar, making four counters and eight\nThe fraction is thus resolved into four-sixths, four-two-hundred and sixteenths, and three-twelve-hundred and ninety-sixths.\n\nLet the same fraction be represented on the Denary Scale. It might be found, that sixteen, multiplied by six hundred and twenty-five, produces ten thousand, or the fourth power of the index, ten. Wherefore eleven times six hundred and twenty-five, or six thousand, eight hundred and seventy-five, reckoned upwards from the fourth bar; below the rank of units, will denote the fraction proposed.\n\nBut the expression of this fraction on the descending scale is more easily and directly obtained, by the process of successive decomposition. Ten times eleven sixteenths, or one hundred and ten parts on the bar immediately below the units, make six counters and fourteen parts. These fourteen parts are equivalent to one hundred and forty parts, or eight counters and twelve parts on the third bar. This excess again gives one hundred and twenty parts, or seven counters and eight parts, for the fourth bar. And lastly, these remaining eight parts are represented by five counters placed on the fifth bar. The fraction eleven sixteenths is thus analysed into sixteenths, eight-hundredths, seven-thousandths, and five-ten-thousandths.\n\nThere is not the same facility, however, in decomposing all fractions, and reducing them to the terms of a descending scale. It often happens that the expressions for these will run through many bars, or even maintain a perpetual circulation, without ever drawing to a termination. Suppose, for example, that four sevenths were to be represented on the Binary Scale: It would correspond to eight-sevenths, or a counter and one part of the second bar; which excess would be equivalent to two parts on the third bar; four on the fourth, eight, or a counter and one part on the fifth bar. This bar would therefore leave out the same portion as the second bar; and consequently the notation would be continually repeated at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> of three bars.\n\nIt is curious to remark with regard to the present example, that if the expression on the Denary Scale were multiplied by any number whatever, the same counters, and after the same order, would always appear to occupy the inferior bars: Thus, when doubled, it will assume this form, commencing like the fourth bar of the single expression.\nIf the expression for four-sevenths be tripled, it will show the same aspect, only beginning at the third bar:\n\nA little reflection will discover the case to be an unexpected result. Since the perpetual succession of six bars, or only one less than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DENOMINATOR\">denominator</a>, was necessary to represent the value of the given fraction; it follows, that every possible remainder arising from the repeated subdivision or decomposition by seven, must have some corresponding bar from which the same recurrence will take place. Thus, in the analysis of four-sevenths, the remainders on the successive bars were five, one, three, two, four and six; and consequently every fraction having seven for its denominator would belong to one of these.\n\nTo reduce a fraction to any descending scale, may therefore prove a tedious, and often impossible task. But the converted expression approximates rapidly to its true value, and a very few terms will be sufficient for every practical use. The numerical scales are thus equally fitted by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> for ascending or descending,\u2014whether for exhibiting huge multitudes or the minutest subdivision of parts. But men were, in general, very slow to perceive or to avail themselves of this most valuable though distinguishing property of such progressions. The Chinese are the only people who have for ages been accustomed to employ the descending terms of the Denary Scale, or to reckon by Decimal parts in all their commercial transactions. The same uniform system directs the whole subdivision of their weights and measures; an advantage of the highest importance, since it gives to the calculations of those ingenious traders the utmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of simplicity and readiness. The natives of India, who have so long been acquainted with the use of the Denary Scale of numeration, are yet ignorant of its application to denote fractions. Below the place of unity they change the rate of progression, and descend merely by a continued bisection, adopting successively the half, the fourth, the eighth, and the sixteenth; beyond which partition they seldom advance.\n\nPtolemy, and succeeding Astronomers, having adopted the Sexagenary Scale in their measures and calculations of the lines about a circle, likewise employed its descending terms to express the fractional parts. This sexagesimal subdivision, called sometimes logistic arithmetic, is still retained in expressing arcs by degrees, minutes, and seconds; though it has at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> been superseded by the decimal system, in the exhibition of chords, or of the sines and tangents which came to displace these in the modern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIGONOMETRY\">Trigonometry</a>. Nor was the latter improvement embraced, or even contemplated at once. The Arabs, though well acquainted with the advantages of the Denary Scale, appeared satisfied with the sexagenary numeration derived from their Greek instructors. The great restorer of mathematical science in Europe, George Purbach of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIENNA\">Vienna</a>, a man of original and extensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a>, who died at an early age in 1462, in the tables for sines which he computed to every ten minutes of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRANT\">quadrant</a>, distinguished the radius into six hundred thousand parts; thus blending the sexagesimal with the decimal notation. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a> and successor, John M\u00fcller, commonly styled Regiomontanus from K\u00f6nigsberg, the name of his place of birth, after some hesitation laid aside this subdivision of the radius in 1464, and enlarged it to a million of parts, having recalculated the sines, and likewise joined to them tables of tangents. But his work lay many years after his decease in manuscript, and was not printed until 1533. A very long period still elapsed before mathematicians were trained to the use of decimals. Simon Stevinus, a celebrated Flemish geometer and engineer, was the first who composed, in 1582, a distinct treatise on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of those fractions.\n\nWe might suppose that the properties of the Denary Scale, whether in ascending or descending, would soon be discerned and reduced to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> practice. But the use of fractions is associated with a more advanced state of society. Men very seldom take large and connected views of things; they generally grope their way step by step, as actual wants and circumstances chance to direct them. In the subdivision of the unit, they have often proceeded by bisection, sometimes by trisection, and frequently by joining together these modes, or combining them with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECIMATION\">decimation</a>. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> and unsteady procedure is apparent in our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISSECTION\">dissection</a> of weights and measures. The simplest division is that of halving, which seems very naturally to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> from the competition between seller and buyer.\u2014Our dry measure is, accordingly, broken down by a series of bisections. Thus, the chaldron is divided by a redoubled bisection into four quarters, each of these by a triple bisection into eight bushels, each of these again by a redoubled bisection into four pecks, each peck bisected into two gallons, each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALLON\">gallon</a> by a redoubled bisection divided into four quarts, and each of these bisected into two pints. The avoirdupois weight, which is the sort generally used in business, appears both to ascend and descend, from a common point. The pound is divided by a quadruple bisection into sixteen ounces, and each of these again into sixteen drams. But were it desired that a hundred pounds should constitute the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUINTAL\">quintal</a>, this would be reduced, by a successive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTERING\">quartering</a>, to six and a fraction. Wherefore the nearest round number, seven, was taken, which being doubled gives fourteen pounds for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> of horseman's weight, and this doubled again makes twenty-eight for the quarter, which consequently furnishes one hundred and twelve pounds for the nominal hundred weight. Twenty times this composes the ton. In the subdivision of money, the progression is still more irregular. The pound is\nPalpable Arithmetic is first divided into twenty shillings, next each of those into twelve pence, and then each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PENNY\">penny</a> into four farthings.\n\nAll the calculations in theoretical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a> are now conducted invariably on the decimal scale. The same kind of subdivision has, to a certain extent, been introduced, for the sake of its great convenience, into the practice of gauging and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a>-surveying. But we may despair of ever seeing the decimal progression adopted in the general intercourse of society. The French have, indeed, set an example to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> of Europe, in this case, at least, perfectly harmless, and highly worthy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a>,\u2014by framing a consistent and universal system of measures, weights, and coins, drawn from nature itself, and disposed with admirable simplicity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEGANCE\">elegance</a>. Yet, even in France, that seductive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> has, amidst the collision of opposite views and interests, experienced only a partial success. National <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a>, inflamed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a>, is too often opposed to every species of improvement; and the influence of a country, now shorn of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>, is not likely to extend beyond her own frontiers.\n\nWhen the index of a Numerical Scale is large, the notation may be conveniently abridged, by marking only what counters are wanted to complete any bar, or render its expression equivalent to that of an additional counter placed on the bar immediately before it. Thus, instead of eight counters on a particular bar, it would be sufficient to join one to the preceding bar, and put two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFECTIVE\">defective</a> or open counters in the Denary Scale, or four such counters on the Duodenary Scale. The same mode of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a> is alike applicable to the expression of integers, or of fractions. For the sake of illustration, let some of the former examples be resumed. The number one hundred and sixty-five was thus represented on the Octary Scale; there being one counter, and the substitute for four on the first bar, the same substitute on the second bar, and two counters on the first bar. Now add a counter to the second bar, and lay three open counters on the third bar, and this will be changed into the form annexed.\n\nThis expression again is, by a similar process, converted into another, consisting of three open counters on the first and on the second bar, with three full counters on the third bar. Hence the number proposed, must consist of three duplicate octads, abating three octads and three, or is equal to one hundred and ninety-two, diminished by twenty-seven.\n\nOn the Denary Scale, the same number was denoted as under I. and will be successively changed into two other forms.\n\nThe last expression, therefore, signifies two hundred, abating thirty-five.\n\nAgain, the number one hundred and sixty-five, which, on the Duodenary Scale, stood as annexed, will be reduced to the simpler expression; by changing the three counters, and six on the first bar for three open counters, and an additional counter on the second bar, intimating one gross and two dozens, abating three.\n\nThis method of employing open or deficient counters is applicable likewise to the notation of fractions. Thus, eleven-sixteenths expressed on the Quaternary Scale, may have these three different forms:\n\nOn the Senary Scale this fraction will admit of more varieties:\n\nVOL. I. PART II.\nOn the Denary Scale, this fraction may have its first expression changed, by successive modifications, into a simpler form.\n\nThe fraction four-sevenths, which, on the Denary Scale, formed a perpetual recurrence, may be abbreviated in the same way. The first expression is converted into another more commodious one, by changing the counters that exceed five on any bar into deficient counters.\n\nWe shall now investigate some general properties of those Numerical Scales. Suppose, in the Binary Progression, there was standing but a single counter on a high bar. It is obvious, that this might be removed, and two placed on the inferior bar. But one of these might likewise be removed, and two counters substituted for it on the next bar lower. The same process could be pursued through any number of bars, the removed counters being always marked by a dot, and the one which is finally rejected placed on the outside of the last bar with two dots over it. It hence appears, that one placed on any bar of the Binary Scale, is equal in value to one joined to the sum of a series of units running through all the inferior bars. Thus, in the example now produced, one counter occupying the sixth bar, and therefore indicating the number thirty-two, is equal in effect to one annexed to the sum of sixteen, eight, four, two, and one.\n\nLet similar modifications be introduced into the Ternary Scale. Suppose a single counter to stand by itself, all the rest of the bars being empty. It may be taken away, and three counters substituted for it on the next inferior bar. But one of these may be withdrawn, and three others placed on the following bar: Of this triplet, the undermost might again be removed, and three substituted for it on the next bar. The same process, it is evident, could be repeated, till the change reached the lowest bar, leaving out an excess of one, marked by two dots to signify its being transferred. Hence the single counter on the Ternary Scale is, by successive mutations, converted into two rows of counters extending through all the inferior counters, and leaving an excess of one. Thus the number two hundred and forty-three, the value of a counter placed on the fifth bar of the Ternary Scale, is equal to one added to double the sum of eighty-one, twenty-seven, nine, three, and one, the values of counters occupying all the inferior bars.\n\nIn like manner, if a solitary counter in the Quaternary Scale be withdrawn, four counters may be substituted on the next bar. Remove the undermost of these, and set four more on the succeeding bar. Take away one of these again, and put other four counters on the adjacent bar. Proceed in the same way, till the quaternion reaches the last bar, and is reduced to a triplet, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCLUSION\">exclusion</a> of one counter. By this analysis, therefore, the simple counter is resolved with an excess of one, into three rows of counters which run through the whole of the lower bars. In the present instance, the number two hundred and fifty-six, the import of a counter on the fifth bar of the Quaternary Scale, is equivalent to one joined to triple the sum of sixty-four, sixteen, four, and one, the values of all the succeeding bars.\n\nIt may seem scarcely necessary to pursue this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> farther; but we shall extend it likewise to the Quinary Scale. A single counter, it is obvious, may now be removed, and five substituted for it on the next bar. The undermost of these again may be withdrawn, and five placed instead of it on the following bar. One of these may then be taken away, and five substituted for it on the adjacent bar. The same procedure is repeated to the last bar, leaving four rows, with an excess of one counter. In the present instance, a single counter on the fourth bar, and corresponding, therefore, on this scale the number to six hundred and twenty-five, is equivalent to one added to four times the sum of one hundred and twenty-five, twenty-five, five, and one, the values of all the inferior bars.\nWe may hence conclude in general, that if one be taken from any power of the index of any numerical scale, the remainder will be equal to all the inferior powers repeated as often as the index, when diminished by one, contains unit. Wherefore if the counters, reckoned as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> units, be separated from any compound expression, the whole will be converted into as many trains of counters, occupying all the inferior bars as correspond to the index of the scale diminished by one. Suppose, for example, the expression here noted, which is disposed on five bars, of the Quaternary Scale, and is equivalent to seven hundred and eleven.\n\nBy decomposing separately each successive bar, and placing the excluded counters <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> beside the place of units, it will be changed into this regular but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPLEX\">complex</a> form, which consists of three rows of double counters, leaving out two; three rows of triple counters, leaving out three; a single counter, leaving out one; and three counters on the last bar left out. If we omit the nine excluded counters, and take only each single row of the rest, the result will be greatly simplified. This reduced expression corresponds to two hundred and thirty-four. But seven hundred and eleven, diminished by nine, the number of counters at first employed, leaves seven hundred and two; and this again, being divided by three, gives two hundred and thirty-four.\n\nApplying this principle to the Denary Scale, it must follow, that if the sum of the integers be subtracted from any number, the remainder will be divisible by nine, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUOTIENT\">quotient</a> will be equal to the sum of the separate numbers denoted by each of those integers repeated through all the inferior places.\n\nAnother similar property, belonging to numerical Palpable scales, may be deduced from the combination of the deficient or open counters. Let us begin with the Binary System. Suppose a solitary counter to occupy the sixth bar. It may be removed, if two counters be placed in its stead on the next bar. But, without changing its value, we may to this pair evidently join another, composed of a full and an open counter, which perfectly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> each other. Withdraw the open counter that stands undermost, and substitute for it two open counters on the fourth bar.\n\nTo these again, add a balanced pair, consisting of an open and a full counter. Take away the undermost counter, set two similar counters on the third bar, and to this pair annex a full and an open counter. By continuing this process, the single counter will be decomposed into three rows of counters, alternately full and open; with an excluded counter, which is open when the number of the bars, as in the present case, is even, but a full counter if that number be odd. Thus thirty-two, the value of the counter on the sixth bar, is equal to three times all the inferior alternating bars, or the excess of sixteen above eight, joined to the excess of four above two, and together with one, that is, eleven; abating, however, the excluded counter which is here open; but thrice eleven, omitting one, is thirty-two.\n\nLet a similar analysis be applied to the Ternary Scale. Change the solitary counter for three counters laid on the next bar, and to these join a balanced pair consisting of a full and an open counter. Remove this open counter, and substitute three open counters for it on the succeeding bar, and to the triplet annex an open and a full counter. Take away the full counter, and place three such counters on the following bar. Repeat the procedure, till the first bar comes to be occupied; and there will evidently emerge four rows of counters extending through all the inferior bars, and alternately full and open, with an excluded counter of an opposite character to those which terminate the decomposition. In the present instance, where the single counter stood on the fifth bar, a counter of the ordinary kind is left out. Wherefore the number eighty-one is equal to four times the amount of the excess of twenty-seven above nine, and of that of three above one, or twenty, together with the unit excluded.\n\nIt may be deemed sufficient for grounding a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONCLUSION\">conclusion</a>, to repeat the same process on the\nPalpable Arithmetic.\n\nQuaternary Scale. Instead of the solitary counter, place four counters on the next bar, and conjoin with these a balanced pair of counters, composed of a full and an open one. Remove the undermost of these, and substitute four open counters on the following bar. To these again, add an open and a full counter, which will not affect the value of the column. Pursue the operation till all the bars are occupied by counters, and one excluded. It is evident therefore that, on the Quaternary Scale, the decomposition of a single counter produces five rows of alternating counters through all the inferior bars, with an excluded counter of an opposite nature to that of the row which completes the analysis. In the example now given, the number two hundred and fifty-six, the value of the counter on the fifth bar, is equal to five times the amount of the excess of sixty-four above sixteen, and of four above one, or fifty-one, together with the unit left out.\n\nThe conclusion may, therefore, be extended to any progressive scale: If the value of unit on a separate bar be increased or diminished by one, according as the rank is even or odd, the remainder will be divisible by one greater than the index of the scale, and the quotient will be equal to the amount of the values of units alternating in excess and defect through all the inferior bars.\n\nThe same property, it is evident, could be transferred to any compound expression: Nothing is wanted but to change the counters on each successive bar into alternating rows. Thus, in the Binary Scale, the expression which signifies one hundred and seven, will be converted into another composed of triple and alternating rows, with an exclusion of two counters in excess, and three in defect, or the balance of an open counter.\n\nIf this arrangement be now divided by three, the result, after restoring the deficient unit, will be\n\nBy collecting and condensing the counters on each bar, the whole will be reduced to another very simple form; which indicates thirty-six, the third part of one hundred and eight.\n\nLet another example be selected from the notation of the Quaternary Scale. The counters on these six bars will represent the number two thousand three hundred and fifty-four. The excluded counters will stand thus; and, consequently, there is on the whole an excess of four counters which must be rejected. The original number is therefore reduced to two thousand three hundred and fifty, of which the fifth part will be denoted by repeating the counters alternately full and open on the lower bars.\n\nThis last expression being condensed and abridged will stand thus,\nIn all these decompositions, we have stopped at the bar of units; but if we pursue the analysis through the descending bars, we shall discover trains of equivalent fractions which never terminate. Thus, to begin with the Binary Scale: A counter on the bar of units may be taken away, and two counters placed instead of it on the following bar. Of this pair again, one may be removed, and another pair substituted for it on the next lower bar. One of these again may be withdrawn, and two placed on the following bar. The same operation of exchange, it is obvious, may be repeated for ever. Wherefore, the value of a single counter is here the same as that of a single row of counters, extending indefinitely over the lower bars. But the counter on the bar immediately below the place of units, indicates one-half, that on the next one-fourth, that on the following bar one-eighth, and so forth continually. Wherefore the sum of the fractions one-half, one-fourth, one-eighth, one-sixteenth, extended without limit, must always approach to one.\n\nLet a similar transformation be carried through the Ternary Scale. Suppose a half counter to stand on the bar of units: It may be removed, and three half counters, or a whole counter and half of one substituted on the next bar. Take away this half counter, and set three such, or a counter and a half on the succeeding bar. Repeat the same process continually, and the half counter on the bar of units, will be converted into a single row of entire counters, extending without limitation through all the inferior bars. But these successive counters signify one-third, one-ninth, one-twenty-seventh, &c. Whence the fraction one-half is equal to the sum of one-third, one-ninth, one-twenty-seventh, &c. continued <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-AD\">ad</a> infinitum.\n\nIn the Quaternary Scale, let the third of a counter occupy alone the bar of units. It may be withdrawn, and four such parts, or a whole counter, and the third of one placed in its stead on the next bar. This third again may be removed, and a counter, with another third, substituted for it on the following bar. The same procedure being repeated, the third part of a counter in the place of units will be changed into a row of entire counters running through all the inferior bars. It therefore follows, that the fraction one-third, is equal to the sum of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFINITE\">infinite</a> series one-fourth, one-sixteenth, one-sixty-fourth, &c.\n\nAgain, let similar modifications be carried through the Quinary Scale. The fourth of a counter on the bar of units may be exchanged for five such parts, or one counter and a quarter on the following bar; and this quarter may now be removed, and five quarters, or one counter and a quarter set on the next bar. The process of decomposition may thus be continued perpetually, leaving, instead of the fourth of a counter, an unlimited range of counters stretching over the interior bars. Consequently the fraction one-fourth is equal to the aggregate terms of the progressive one-fifth, one-twenty-fifth, one-hundred and twenty-fifth, one-six hundred and twenty-fifth, continued without termination.\n\nFrom these very simple analyses, we may therefore conclude in general, that the fraction of unit, which has for its denominator one less than the index of any numerical scale, is equal to the sum of all the descending powers, or the value of a single row of counters, extending indefinitely through the inferior bars. Thus one-ninth is equal to a tenth, a hundredth, a thousandth, &c. or one-eleventh is equal to a twelfth part, a hundred and forty-fourth, a thousand seven hundred and twenty-eighth, &c.\n\nBut the summation of a descending series, whose terms <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a>, may with equal facility be discovered, by introducing the admixture of deficient counters. Thus, in the Binary Scale, if the third part of a counter stood on the bar of units, it could be removed, and two-thirds of a counter, that is, a whole counter abating the third part, substituted for it on the next bar. But this open part of a counter might be taken away, and a whole open counter diminished by the third part of a full counter placed on the following bar. This third again could be withdrawn, and a full counter with a deficient third part of one set on the next bar. This alternate exchange might easily be repeated over the suc-\ncessive bars. The third part of a counter is thus converted into an unlimited row of full and open counters. Hence the fraction one-third is equal to the sum of one-half abating one-fourth, of one-eighth abating one-sixteenth, of one-thirty-second abating one sixty-fourth, or equal to the excess of the continued series one-half, one eighth, one thirty-second, &c. above the corresponding series one-fourth, one-sixteenth, one sixty-fourth, &c.\n\nThe substitution may, in like manner, be performed on the Ternary Scale. Suppose the fourth part of a counter to occupy the bar of units. Remove this fragment and substitute three-quarters, or a whole counter abating one-quarter, on the next bar. Instead of this deficient quarter again, place three such, or one open counter, conjoined with the quarter of a full one, on the succeeding bar. Pursue the same procedure, and the quarter of a counter will be transformed into a single row of counters, alternately full and open, extending without limitation over the lower bars. Therefore the fraction one-fourth is equal to the sum of one-third abating one-ninth, of one twenty-seventh abating one eighty-first of one two hundred and forty-third, abating one seven-hundred and twenty-ninth, &c.; or one-fourth is equal to the excess of the perpetual series one-third, one twenty-seventh, &c. above the similar series, one-ninth, one eighty-first, &c.\n\nAnother instance will be sufficient to point out the general principle. Let one-fifth part of a counter stand on the bar of units in the Quaternary Scale. It may be removed, if four-fifths, or one counter wanting a fifth, were placed on the next bar. Instead of this open fifth, let four open fifths, or one open counter, joined to a fifth of excess, be put on the following bar. Change this fifth again for a full counter, with a deficient fifth on the following bar. A series of alternating counters is thus successively formed. Whence the fraction of one-fifth is equal to the continued series one-fourth, abating one-sixteenth, one sixty-fourth, abating one two hundred fifty-sixth, &c.\n\nWe may hence infer generally, that the fraction of unit, divided by one greater than the index of a numerical scale, is equal to the amount of all the descending powers taken alternatively as additive and subtractive. Thus, one-eleventh part is equal to the excess of a tenth above a one-hundredth, that of a thousandth above a ten-thousandth, that of a hundred thousandth above a millionth, and so forth continually. In like manner, on the Duodenary Scale, the thirteenth part is equal to a twelfth, abating the hundred and forty-fourth, the seventeen-hundred and twenty-eighth, abating the twenty thousand seven hundred and thirty-sixth, &c.\n\nIn all these transformations of fractions, arising from the index of the numerical scale, increased or diminished by one, the operation is repeated or alternated at each successive bar. But similar changes may be made on fractions derived from the same modifications of the powers of the index, which will regularly circulate along the bars at a corresponding interval. Thus, on the Binary Scale, the fraction one-third, or the second power of the index two diminished by one, will form by decomposition an intermitting row, or a perpetual circulation, passing over the successive alternate bars. For one-third of a counter on the bar of units is equivalent to two-thirds on the following bar, which again are equal to four-thirds, or an entire counter and a third, on the next bar. Pursuing the same analysis, a row of counters emerges on the alternate bars. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a>, if the intermediate bars, which here serve only for the transit of the pair of thirds, were left out altogether, the notation would pass into that of the Quaternary Scale, and obey the general rule.\n\nAgain, on the same Binary Scale, the fraction one-seventh, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECIPROCAL\">reciprocal</a> of the third power of two, diminished by one, will be found to circulate at every third bar. Thus, one-seventh of a counter on the bar of units gives two such parts for the second bar, four for the third and eighth, or a whole counter and an excess of one-seventh for the fourth counter; and if this kind of decomposition be carried forward, another counter will appear on the seventh bar, a third on the tenth bar; and so forth in perpetual succession.\n\nBut the same conclusion might also be drawn from the general principle, if we consider that the Binary Progression, by omitting always two consecutive bars, is converted into the Octary Scale.\n\nIt is not difficult to perceive, that every fraction is capable of being either exactly represented on any given scale, or of being denoted by an expression which circulates after an interval of fewer bars than the denominator of the fraction contains units. In fact, the moment the same set of fractional counters comes to appear a second <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, the whole expression must evidently recur in the same order. But all the possible variations or series of remainders must ever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> within the number itself, which constitutes the di-\nvisor. Thus, it was found that the expression for any fraction having the denominator seven, circulates on the Binary Scale; at the interval of three bars. The same fraction represented on the Quaternary Scale has a like recurrence; but, on the Octary Scale, the expression is renewed at every two bars, while it does not circulate till after passing over six bars, in the Ternary, Quaternary, Quinary, and Denary Scales. Employing a similar decomposition, it will appear that a fraction, with eleven for its denominator, will, in the Quaternary and Quinary Scales, circulate on five bars, but will embrace no fewer than ten bars, by its circulation in the Ternary, Quaternary, Senary, Octary, and Denary Scales.\n\nWe may hence reverse the operation, and determine the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> value of any circulating expression, or discover the fraction of which it is only the continued <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPANSION\">expansion</a>. Suppose the group of counters here presented to circulate perpetually, at an interval of six bars on the Quinary Scale. If these counters were all transferred to the seventh, or last bar, they would signify four thousand four hundred and sixty-four.\n\nBut another scale might be substituted, such that each single bar shall correspond in effect to this condensed seventh bar. Consequently the index of this new scale, or the sixth power of five, being diminished by one, will denote the denominator of the absolute fraction; which is therefore four thousand four hundred and sixty-four divided by fifteen thousand six hundred and twenty-four, or by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> two-sevenths.\n\nIn like manner, on the Denary Scale, let a set of counters always circulate, spreading over six successive bars. Conceive them transferred to the last bar, and they will express seventy-six thousand nine hundred and twenty-three. But if another scale were adopted, each bar of which had a power equal to six of these bars, its index would be a million. One less than this is consequently the denominator of the fraction, which is therefore equal to one thirteenth.\n\nHaving considered at some length the properties of numerical scales, and their various transformations, we have now to explain the ordinary operations performed on numbers themselves. These operations are all reducible to two very simple changes,\u2014the conjoining and the separating of numbers. When two or more numerical expressions are conjoined, that is, condensed into a single expression, or collected into one sum, the process is called Addition. But palpable when one numerical expression is separated or drawn out from another, leaving only a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> or remainder, the process is called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUBTRACTION\">Subtraction</a>. If the addition should be employed merely in repeating the same number, it admits of abbreviation, and is then termed Multiplication. On the contrary, if the subtraction be limited to the continued withdrawing of the same number from another, the process becomes capable of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ABRIDGMENT\">abridgment</a>, and is termed Division.\n\n**Addition.**\n\nThe whole operation consists in collecting and condensing the separate expressions. Beginning with the lowest bar, the counters are gathered together, and if they exceed the index of the scale, this excess only is retained, and one counter annexed or carried to the next bar. But if the counters on any bar should contain the index more than once, the number of repetitions is transferred a place higher, while the remainder of the reckoning is left as it stood. A very few examples will render the mode of proceeding quite clear. Let it be required to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLECT\">collect</a> the expressions here disposed on the Quaternary Scale.\n\nOn the bar of units, two counters occur, which are brought together at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a>. Two counters are likewise found on the next bar, and each of the three following bars has each three counters. But four counters are found on the next bar, which are equal to one transferred to the highest bar, leaving a blank in their own place. In this case very little change in the notation is wanted; and except in a single transfer to a higher bar, the counters are merely brought closer together, and form the expression at the bottom. This again might be somewhat abridged by introducing open counters, as represented here, below the other. The sum of the three compound numbers thus represented on the Quaternary Scale, is therefore by reduction nine thousand two hundred and ten.\n\nSuppose the same numbers were converted into the Denary Scale. They would be respectively three thousand five hundred and twenty-eight, one thousand and seventy-three, and four thou-\nPalpable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> six hundred and nine; which are thus exhibited successively on four bars. Now, collecting all the single counters on the first bar to the right, they amount to ten, which joined to the two fives make twenty; they consequently, in their summation, leave that bar void, and throw two counters to the next. These two counters now joined to the four which occur on the second bar, make six, and again with the five, eleven, leaving one counter on the second bar, and furnishing one to the next. This counter, with another already on the third bar, leaves two; while the two fives on it deliver one on the fourth bar. The result, as before, is nine thousand three hundred and ten. The final expression may be somewhat abridged, by employing deficient counters; it gives ten thousand, abating one thousand, and two hundred and ten, the same result as before.\n\nBut perhaps it is more natural and more like the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPONTANEOUS\">spontaneous</a> practice of uninstructed men, to proceed by successive steps, and only conjoin two numbers at the same time. Nor is it requisite, in this mode of proceeding, that the numbers to be severally added should be actually expressed; it may be sufficient, at each step, to retain them mentally. Thus, when the second number is to be added to the first, the three counters which should occupy the first bar being joined, the three single ones already noted make six, or leave one, and change the other five into ten, which furnishes one counter to the second bar; and one counter on the fourth bar increases its stock to four. Again, when the third number is added, it would give nine counters to the first Palpable bar, and hence change it into ten, leaving the Arithmetic bar void, and throwing a counter to the next bar. But the six counters on the third bar, convert the five counters into ten, and thus furnish one to the next bar, while they leave two counters behind them.\n\nThe working of this example would be simplified by employing the notation of deficient counters. Thus the several numbers are changed into other expressions as here expressed. On the first bar, the full and the open counters, being three of each kind, exactly balance each other; but, on the second bar, the full counters leave an excess of one. The full counters on the third bar, being eight in all, exceed the open ones by two; while, on the fourth bar, they leave a defect of one.\n\nLet another example be taken of addition from numbers arranged on the Quinary Scale. The counters on the first bar amount to six, which leaves one counter, and furnishes one to the next bar. This bar now holds eight counters, leaving three consequently, and throwing one to the third bar. The third bar has then ten counters, or is left void, and gives two counters to the next bar. This bar, holding eleven counters, leaves one, and supplies two to the highest bar. The total amount of the numbers is therefore three quadruplicate pentads, one triplicate pentad, three pentads and one, or by reduction, two thousand and sixteen.\nBy introducing deficient counters, the process might be simplified and abridged. The first bar continues the same as before; but in the next bar, after one had been carried to the second bar, and joined to the full counters, there yet is an excess of three full counters. In the third bar, the opposite counters, being two each, are quite balanced, and leave a void; but the fourth bar yields an excess of one full counter, while the fifth collects three full counters. The result is every way the same as before.\n\nLet these numbers be transformed on the Denary Scale. They will stand as here expressed, occupying three bars. The first number furnishes to the successive bar two, three, and six counters; the next number gives seven, eight, and two; the third number delivers four to the third bar, passes over the second, and deposits seven on the first; and the last number, supplies five, nine, and two to the successive bars. In the first bar, the single counters collected together make six, and the two fives contribute one to the next bar. The second bar, holding four fives with a surplus counter, leaves one, and throws two to the next bar. This increase raises the third bar to four fives, and therefore, leaving it void, advances two counters to the fourth bar. The amount of the addition is therefore, as before, being two thousand and sixteen.\n\nIf the operation were performed in its utmost simplicity, by annexing one of the numbers always after the other, the progress of summation would be thus exhibited. The first number being actually represented by counters, the second, which is only retained in the memory, changes by its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSORPTION\">absorption</a> the several bars, and produces one thousand and seventeen. To this again is joined mentally the third number, which gives one thousand four hundred and twenty-four, as another step in the progress. And, lastly, the fourth number, being annexed to this, completes the transformation, and produces the final result, two thousand and sixteen.\n\nBut, in most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, the work of summing different numbers may be sensibly shortened, by a judicious application of open counters; which, by their intermixture, effecting in a long operation a sort of balance, will, for the most part, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> the trouble of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> to the higher bars. Whenever the full counters on a bar exceed half the index of the scale, it is preferable to substitute for them open counters. Thus, in the last example, the four numbers to be added may be denoted as here expressed. In the first bar, there is, on the whole, an excess of four open counters; in the second, an excess of two full counters; but, in the third bar, the opposite counters are exactly balanced, and leave a void. The result is consequently two thousand and twenty, abating four.\nIt is evident that all these operations are conducted in the same way, whether the counters occupy the bars of an ascending or of a descending series. The position of the bar of units determines the values of all the rest. Decimal fractions are, therefore, no more entitled to a separate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a> than those derived from any other scale.\n\n**Subtraction**\n\nis the process by which a number is separated or extracted from another; the difference sought being the remainder left after this operation. If the counters representing the larger number should exceed on each bar those denoting the subtrahend, we have only to mark the several excesses. But, if the upper number has fewer counters on any bar than the subtrahend, it will be necessary to take one from the higher bar, and augment the expression of the other, by joining as many counters as the index of the scale contains units. Suppose it were required on the Senary Scale to subtract two thousand seven hundred and forty-five, from six thousand three hundred and eighteen. The numbers will appear thus arranged. The upper bar of units being vacant, we put six on it, and withdraw or borrow from the next bar an equivalent counter marked with a dot. The three counters on the corresponding bar of the subtrahend, being then set aside, leave other three counters for the difference. On the next bar, a counter, answering to the one below, being removed from the two remaining counters, gives a difference of one. On the third bar, the four counters of the subtrahend cannot be taken away from the single counter above, till it has been augmented to seven, at the expense of one counter withdrawn from the next bar, and therefore marked with a dot. The fourth bar leaves all its four counters, and the fifth bar drops its excess of two.\n\nThe operation is varied and shortened, by adopting open counters. To take away the three open counters on the bar of units from the vacancy above it, substitute for that void the counterpoise of three full and three open counters, and then separating the last, there are left three full counters. On the second bar, one counter only remains. The single counter of the third bar may have annexed to it two full and two open counters, and the latter being removed, will consequently leave three full counters.\n\nOn the fourth bar, conceive an open and a full Palpable counter to be joined, and then, omitting the latter, there will remain two open counters. The single open counter of the fifth bar may likewise have a pair of open and of full counters combined with it without changing its import, and consequently three open counters will be left. On the sixth bar the single counter is left standing. The same expression is easily denoted by full counters, and gives, on reduction, the number three thousand five hundred and seventy-three, as the result of the subtraction.\n\nSuppose the same numbers were expressed on the Denary Scale. Beginning with the bar of units, the five counters corresponding to those of the subtrahend being set aside, leave three. In the next bar, the single counter is first increased by ten, which are equivalent to a counter withdrawn from the third bar, and then four being separated from these, gives seven for a remainder. In the third bar, a single counter borrowed from the next, furnishes two fives, one of which, with the remaining two counters, being taken away, leave five. The counters on the last bar, now reduced to five, leave only three, after the separation of the two in the subtraction. The remainder is consequently three thousand four hundred and seventy-three.\n\nIn every instance where a counter is borrowed from a higher bar, the effect would evidently be unaltered, if a counter were added on the same bar to the number below. This modification of the process is what has been generally termed carrying. It is\nMultiplication is nothing but a process of repeated Addition. When the terms, however, to be multiplied are complex, and the index of the Numerical Scale is large, the operation will admit of being very considerably abridged. It has been already shown, that a number is virtually multiplied by the index of the scale, by advancing its expression one bar; that it is multiplied by the second power of that index by advancing it two bars; and so forth continually, according to the progressive powers. Again, if any term of the multiplier be great, it is preferable, instead of repeating the counters of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MULTIPLICAND\">multiplicand</a>, to collect them mentally, and only mark the result. The ready performance of multiplication depends entirely on the right application of these two principles. A few examples will elucidate the process.\n\nSuppose it were required to multiply the number forty-five by twenty-three, that is, to add the units contained in forty-five twenty-three times. First, let those numbers be disposed on the Binary Scale. The counter on the unit bar of the multiplier shows that the whole of the multiplicand is to be set down once as it stands.","sp":769,"ep":789},{"h":"PLATE VII","t":"The names of the different figures, and of the divisions of fig. 5, being marked <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the engraving itself; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> further explanation can be necessary.

The rollers are supported by a wooden frame, GG. Two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> frames, HH, are bolted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> upon it, having grooves, or openings in them, of nearly the whole length, to receive the brasses for the pivots of the rollers, as shown in fig. 2. At the upper ends of these grooves, are screws, h h, by which the rollers can be made to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> at a greater or less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> from each other, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> of the bones which are to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> through them require. Two pinions, k l, are placed upon the ends of the axles of the two rollers, and by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a> acting together, they compel the two rollers to accompany each other. The surfaces of the rollers are filled with indentations and strong teeth, which penetrate and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> the bones to pieces. This is accomplished, by employing separate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> iron <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHEELS\">wheels</a> placed side by side upon an axis, to compose the rollers; the wheels have coarse teeth similar to those of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a>, or ratchet wheel; each wheel of the lower <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROLLER\">roller</a>, F, is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a> thick; and they are placed at distances of an inch and a half asunder, having circles of hard wood or iron, placed between them, which are two inches less in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a>. Thus they leave grooves, between the toothed wheels, which have the effect of rendering the teeth upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a> of the roller insulated. The wheels of the opposite roller, E, are 1\u00bd inch wide, and the spaces between them only 1 inch; and the two are so situated, with respect to each other, that the teeth upon one, are opposite to the spaces between the teeth of the other, as is clearly explained by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPPER\">hopper</a>, II, is fixed above the machine, over the rollers, and into this the bones are filled, so that they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> upon the two rollers, and are drawn in by their motion, the teeth penetrating and breaking every piece however <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> it may be. The bones should be supplied rather gradually to the machine at first, to avoid choking it, and the rollers should then be adjusted to a considerable distance asunder; but when the bones have once passed through in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>, the rollers are screwed closer by the screws, h h, and the fragments <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> generally be found sufficient, as it is not advisable to reduce the bones to a state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a>. The pinions must have deep cogs, to enable them to take deep hold of each other, when the rollers are set at only half an inch distance to grind fine, and without the cogs being liable to slip when the centres are separated, so far as to leave a space of 1 inch, or 1\u00bd inches, between the rollers, for the passage of the large bones the first time. The rollers will act most effectually, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the different wheels are fixed upon their axles in such a position, that the teeth will not correspond, or form <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to the axes, and then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> piece of bone can escape without being broken by some of the teeth.

Machine for A, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a> covered with tin-plates, pierced with holes, so as to leave a rough surface, in the same manner as the graters used for nutmegs, &c., but the holes in this are larger. This cylinder is situate beneath a hopper B, into which the potatoes are thrown, and thence admitted into a kind of trough C, where they are forced against the cylinder, which, as it revolves, grinds the potatoes to a pulp. Motion is given to the machine by a handle fixed upon the end of the axis of the grating cylinder A, and on the opposite extremity of this axis is a fly-wheel D, to regulate and equalize the movement. The potatoes, when put into the hopper, press by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> upon the top of the cylinder, and, as it revolves, they are in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> grated away. On one side of the lower part of the hopper is an opening, closed or opened, more or less, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>, by a slider d, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of opening which this has regulates the passage of the potatoes from the hopper into the trough C. This is as wide as the length of the cylinder, and has a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCAVE\">concave</a> board R fitted into it, which slides backwards and forwards by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of levers a, fixed to an axis extended across the frame of the machine, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEVER\">lever</a> N is fixed upon this axis, and carries a weight which acts upon the board R, by means of the levers, to force or press forwards the potatoes contained in the trough C against the cylinder, and complete the grating of them into a pulp. The tin-plate covering the cylinder is of course pierced from the inside outwards, and the bur or rough edge, left round each hole, forms an excellent rasping surface.\n\nFig. 4. A Potatoe-scop.

Their shell, although apparently bivalve, is formed but of one piece, open in front. Their head is terminated by a kind of pointed but immovable beak. Their mouth is placed within the shell. The eye is absolutely single, and not formed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNION\">union</a> of two eyes, and is covered by granules. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of legs is not known. One of the species is called Pulex caudatus by Scheffer, 1755, t. 1. f. 1. 8. and in the Encyclopaedia Britannica, Pl. 37. fig. 1, a species is rudely figured as an animalcule.\n\nSp. 1. Pulex.

The members of the body of the cyprides are not known; they move with such quickness whilst living, and are so soft when dead, that it is scarcely possible to investigate their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> more fully. Their antennae are long, and very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEXIBLE\">flexible</a>; these organs are furnished at their tips with a brush or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a>, composed of hairs. The hinder part of their bodies is formed of a tail, which is almost entirely concealed within their shell. Their head is terminated by an elongate point, and they have but one eye. Of their economy nothing is known, but they have been observed to change their covering like other Entomostraca.\n\nPlate XX. fig. 1. Cypris nephroides natural size; 2. magnified.\n\nSp. 1.

Latr. Bosc, Leach.*\nAntennae simply pilose.\n\nThis genus was first discovered and established by M\u00fcller, who first observed all the species described in his Entomostraca. It is distinguished from *Cypris* by the antennae, which are not terminated by a pencil of hairs. The legs are eight in number, and are rarely drawn within the shell, which is really bivalve.\n\nThe Cytheres have no tail, and their antennae, like those of the Cyprides, have their articulations pilose. They have but one eye. All the species inhabit the sea, and may be found among the conservae and corallines, which fill the pools left by the tide in most of the rocky coasts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>.\n\nSp. 1. *Viridis.* Shell reniform, velvety, and green.\n*Cythere viridis,* *M\u00fcll.

The females carry their eggs in a pouch resembling a bunch of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAPES\">grapes</a> on each side of the tail. The organs of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a> of the male are placed in the antennae; those of the female beneath the belly, at the base of the tail, which is abruptly narrower than the abdomen.

Syst. ii. 501.*\n\nInhabits the Norwegian and German Ocean. It was first discovered by the celebrated Gunnerus in the Finnmarkian Sea, and was described by M\u00fcller in his *Zoologie Danica Prodromus,* under the title Cyclops Finnarchicus, which name he afterwards changed in his *Entomostraca.*\n\n*Gen. 15. Polyphemus,* *M\u00fcll. Latr. Bosc, Leach.*\n*Cephaloculus,* *Lamarck.*\nEye one, forming the head; legs ten; two bifid, elongate, and extended horizontally.\n\nThis genus, containing one species, was established by M\u00fcller. Naturalists have generally considered it as the larva of some other genus, but the multiplied observations of M\u00fcller, Lamarck, and Bosc, have cleared up all doubts on the subject, and it is now generally admitted as a distinct and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> animal. The head is round, distinct from the thorax, and apparently composed of one large eye. The body is divided into two parts by a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a>; the anterior part contains the legs and tail; the posterior part contains only the eggs and the young. The tail is long, and is attached to the under part of the body, being terminated by two setae.\n\nThe *polyphemus* inhabits marshes and moves quickly by the combined efforts of its short legs and bifid oars, generally swimming on its back.\n\nSp. 1. *Oculus.* Body luteous, with a few blue spots.\n\nPolyphemus oculus.\n\n*M\u00fcll.

In the *Edinburgh Encyclopaedia,* Dr Leach stated it as probable that there were several species that had been confounded with *P. oculus,* but repeated observations have since convinced him of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> of this conjecture, and led to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONCLUSION\">conclusion</a> that there is but one, which is subject to very considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> in size and colour.\n\nDivision IV.\n\n*Gen. 16. Branchiopoda.*\n*Lam. Latr. Bosc, Leach.*\nBody filiform and very soft. Head divided from the thorax by a very narrow but distinct neck. Eyes two, lateral. Antennae two, short, two-jointed, capillary inserted behind and above the eyes. Front with two moveable processes (which are broader towards the apex in the male <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEX\">sex</a>), that are notched, those of the female furnished with a papilla at their point.\n\nSubsidiary Observations. In the front of the male, at the base of the moveable processes on the front, are two long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>-like filaments, and the clypeus is, as it were, double. In both sexes, the mouth is armed with a hooked rostriform papilla, supported by four little processes. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a> of the body is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KEEL\">keel</a>-shaped, and is formed of eleven joints, each of which is furnished with two branchial feet, the anterior pair with two, the posterior pairs with three lamellae. The tail is about the length of the body, composed of\nCrustacea, six or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> obscure joints, the oval segment bearing two fins.\n\nThe organs of generation are situated at the base of the tail.\n\nSp. 1. Stagnalis. Body transparent, of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> colour, slightly tinged with green or blue, particularly on the head and legs.\n\nCancer stagnalis.

Encycl. vii. 389.\n\nWe shall transcribe the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> observations made on this species by the late Dr Shaw of the British Museum, published in the first volume of the Transactions of the Linnaean Society of London.\n\n\"It is generally found in such waters as are of a soft <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, and particularly in those shallows of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a>-water which are so frequently seen in the spring and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUTUMN\">autumn</a>, and in which the Monoculus pulex of Linnaeus, and other small animals, abound. At first sight, it bears some resemblance to the larva of a dytiscus; but, when viewed closely, it is found to be of a much more curious and elegant appearance than that animal. The legs, of which there are several pair (eleven?) on each side, are flat and filmy, and have the appearance of so many waving fins, of the most delicate structure imaginable. The whole animal is extremely transparent, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> colour is brown, slightly tinged with blueish-green.\n\n\"Monoculus conchaceus\" of Linnaeus very frequently assaults them, and adheres with such force to their tails and legs, as sometimes to tear off a part in the struggle. It delights much in sunshine, during which it appears near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a> of the water, swimming on its back, and moving in various directions, by the successive undulations of its numerous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-FIN\">fin</a>-like legs, and moving its tail in the manner of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RUDDER\">rudder</a>. On the least disturbance, it starts in the manner of a small fish, and endeavours to secret itself, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVING\">diving</a> in the soft mud. It changes its skin at certain periods, as is evident from the exuviae or shoughs being frequently found in the water in which these animals are kept.\n\n\"In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a>, the females <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEPOSIT\">deposit</a> their eggs without any settled order, and perfectly loose in the water. They appear to the naked eye, like very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> globules of a light brown colour. Each ovum, when magnified, closely resembles the farina of a mallow. It is thickly beset with spines on every side, and coated over with a transparent gelatinous substance, reaching <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> to the extremities of the spines, and is most probably intended to assist in causing them to adhere to the substances on which they may chance to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a>, or as a security from the attacks of smaller animals. In about a fortnight or three weeks, the eggs are hatched, and the young animals may be seen to swim with great liveliness, by means of three very long pair of arms or rowers, which appear disproportionate to the size of the animal, and indeed it bears, in this very small state, not much resemblance to the form it afterwards assumes; but, in the short space of a very few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a>, the body assumes a lengthened form, and begins to acquire the tail-fin. The eyes in this state do not appear pedunculated. On the seventh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> after hatching, they approach pretty nearly the form of the perfect animal; they, however, still retain the two first pairs of rowers or arms. The legs are at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> very visible. About the ninth day it loses the long ears, and appears still more like the animal in its advanced state.\"\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">Doctor</a> farther observes, that it is highly probable, that a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> elapses before the animal assumes its full size, but the time he was unable to determine, as those he kept died before they had acquired any considerable size. When first hatched, they are scarcely larger than the common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MITE\">mite</a>.\n\nSubclass II. MALACOSTRACA.\n\nThis subclass has occupied a very considerable portion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, the result of which shall be given in the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAGES\">pages</a>.\n\nLegion I. PODOPHTHALMA. Eyes pedunculated or elevated on footstalks.\n\nOrder I. BRACHYURA. Tail short and simple at its extremity.\n\nOrder II. MACROURA. Tail lengthened with appendices at its extremity.\n\nLegion II. EDRIOPHTHALMA. Eyes sessile.\n\nLegion I. PODOPHTHALMA.\n\nThe Malacostraca podophthalma include those animals, which, in common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, are denominated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CRABS\">Crabs</a>, Lobsters, Cray-fish, Prawns, Pandals, and Shrimps, all of which have the power of reproducing their claws when they are lost.\n\nCrabs and Lobsters are said \"to change their crust annually,\" but this, like many other statements in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZOOLOGY\">zoology</a>, is incorrect. We have seen Maja squinado and the common Lobster (Astacus gammarus) so overgrown with Ostreae, Anomiae, Flustra, Sponge, and Sertulariae, as scarcely to be enabled to move the joints of their legs, and as the oysters were of a year's growth; and as the anomiae were above them, and the coralline matters upon the anomiae, there can be no doubt but the crust was at least two years old.\n\nOrder I. BRACHYURA.\n\nLatreille arranges the Brachyura (from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> breadth and length of the thorax or shell) into two families; but the discovery of genera, unknown to that illustrious Entomologist, has convinced us that such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a> is extremely unnatural; and although, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANT\">infant</a> state of our knowledge, we cannot venture to propose named divisions; yet we shall endeavour to dispose the genera into what appear to be natural groupes.\n\nSynopsis and distribution of the Genera.\n\nA.

It is very common on the sandy shores of southern Devon, from Torcross to the mouth of the river Ex, and is frequently found entangled in the shore-nets of the fishermen, or thrown on the shore after storms.\n\nIt is distinguished from every other discovered species, by the rounded dentations of the front, the very slight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELEVATION\">elevation</a> of the lines on the hands, and by the convexity, remarkable smoothness, and marbled appearance of the shell.\n\nYoung specimens are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> brown, and much resemble the young of P. depurator, from which they may very easily be separated by their more considerable convexity.\n\nGen. 8.

External double palpi with the second joint of the internal footstalk notched at the internal apex. Shell margined behind; orbits behind with one fissure, and externally with one fold; beneath with one fissure and externally with one fold. Anterior pair of legs unequal.\n\nSp. 1. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol0.html#article-PAGURUS\">Pagurus</a>. Shell granulated with nine folds on each side; front with three lobes.\n\nCancer pagurus of authors.\n\nThis species is the common crab of Britain. It is considered to be in season between Christmas and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EASTER\">Easter</a>, and about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARVEST\">harvest</a>, being much esteemed as an article of food. Its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\">natural history</a> is but little known. During the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> months, it is very abundant on all our rocky coasts, especially where the water is deep. At low tide, they are often found in holes of rocks, in pairs, male and female; and if the male be taken away, another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be found in the hole at the next recess of the tide. By knowing this fact, an experienced fisherman may twice a day take, with little trouble, a vast number of specimens, after having once discovered their haunts.\n\nIn the winter, they are supposed to burrow in the sand, or to retire to the deeper parts of the ocean. They are taken in wicker-baskets, resembling mousetraps, or in large nets with open meshes, which are placed at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> of the ocean, and baited with garbage.\n\nGen. 11. Xantho. Leach.\n\nExternal antennae very short, inserted in the internal corner of the eye; internal antennae received in foveole under the prominent margin of the clypeus, the peduncle sublinear.

Calappa. Dald. Fabr. Lam. Latr. Bosc, Leach.\n\nShell with the hinder angles arched, receiving the legs when contracted. Hands crested, and equal.\n\nOne of the species is very common in the Mediterranean Sea, and is mentioned by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a> and Athen\u00e6us. Of the economy of the genus nothing is known, but, from the general structure of the parts, it is probably similar to that of Cancer.\n\nSp. 1. Granulatus.

Leach.\n\nExternal double palpi, with the internal footstalk composed of two nearly equal joints; palpi inserted beneath or within; anterior pair of legs, unequal; claws and tibiae spinose; shell truncate-subcordate.\n\nThere are probably many species of this genus, but their characters have not been made out by naturalists. Travellers speak of three sorts. Their economy is very curious, and is detailed by Sloane, Catesby, and others.\n\nThey inhabit the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANTILLES\">Antilles</a>. In the beginning of the year they descend from the mountains in vast numbers, and deposit their eggs in the sea. During this march, which is said to be conducted with great regularity, and to be under the guidance of a commander, the strongest proceed first. They are often obliged to halt for want of rain, and to go into the most convenient encampment until the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> change. The main body is said to consist of females, which never leaves the mountains till the rain be set in. They chiefly proceed during the\nCrustacea, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>, sheltering in hollow trees and in shady places during the hot part of the day.\n\nSp. 1. *Ruricola*.

External double palpi, with the internal footstalk, one-jointed. Anterior pair of legs unequal. Eyes thick. Shell ovate-orbicular, orbiculate-quadrate, or transverse-subquadrate.\n\nAll the species of this most interesting genus inhabit the bivalve shells of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACEPHALOUS\">acephalous</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOLLUSCA\">Mollusca</a>, and were supposed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> to be consanguineous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INMATES\">inmates</a> with the animal, bound by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FABLE\">fable</a> is beautifully told by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OPPIAN\">Oppian</a>, and is alluded to by Cicero. \"Pinna vero (sic enim Graece dictatur), duabus grandis patulis conchis, cum parva squilla quasi societatem coit comparandi cibi. Itaque cum pisciculi parvi in concham hiantem innotaverint, tum admonita a squilla pinna morsu, comprimit concham.\" *Nat. Deor. Lib.* ii. sec. 48.\n\nAristotle supposed them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> as sentinels, and believed that they guarded the pinna (the animal in whose shell they were first observed), from the attacks of its enemies. Rondeletius and some other naturalists held the same opinion.\n\nSp. 1. *Cranchii*. Shell orbiculate-subquadrate, soft, very smooth, with the sides dilated behind; front strait, obscurely submarginate; hands <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a>, below and the thighs above with a ciliated line; thumb subcarinate; abdomen very broad, the sides of the segments arcuate, the second, and following ones distinctly notched; the fifth segment somewhat broader; the last narrower than the preceding segment. Female.\n\nPinnotheres Cranchii.\n\nLeach, *Malacost. Podophth. Britann.* tab. 14, fig. 4-5.\n\nThe male of this species, which was discovered by Mr. J. Cranch, whose name it bears, is unknown. It is distinguished from *P. pisum* (the common species), by the form of the front of the shell, which is strait and slightly notched; by the dilated hinder part of the shell, and by the abdomen, all the joints of which, excepting the first, are distinctly notched behind.\n\nPlate XXI.\n\nDivision III.

Anterior pair of legs unequal.\n\nThe economy of the Ocypodes is unknown, but it is probably not very different from that of the Uca. They inhabit the shores of the sea; and, as their name indicates, run with great swiftness.\n\nSp. 1. *Ceratophthalma*.

They multiply very much, and serve as food to otters, bears, birds, crocodiles, &c. The females carry about their eggs under the abdomen. They live on animal substances, which they devour with avidity. Their motion is rapid; Sir J. Banks assures us that he could never come up with them when running, and that the only means by which he could take them was by running to and stopping their holes before they could reach it, and which he effected by lying in ambush until the animals had gone to a very considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> from their haunts.\n\nSp. 1. *Una*.

Anterior pair of legs equal; of the male very long; of the female twice the length of the body. Antennae half of the length of the body, inserted at the internal canthus of the eyes.\n\nThe animals of this genus inhabit the ocean, preferring such parts as have a slimy bottom. They burrow laterally in the clay or slime, making two entrances to their hole; entering by one, and going out by the other. We have seen several fossil species inclosed in marle, that appear to belong to this genus.\n\nSp. 1. *Bispinosa*.

One species is well described by Aristotle under the name nymph\u00e6.\n\nAll the species are parasitical, and inhabit the cavities of turbinated univalves. They all change their habitation during their growth, first occupying the smallest shells, and latterly those of very considerable dimensions. The abdomen is naked and slender, being covered merely with a skin of a delicate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEXTURE\">texture</a>; but its extremity is furnished with appendages, by means of which it secures itself within the shell of which it makes choice. It is really astonishing with what facility these animals move, bearing at the same time the shell, which is destined to preserve the body from injury, and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> these animals from the attacks of fishes, who would otherwise devour them. All the species are termed indiscriminately Soldier-crabs and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERMIT\">Hermit</a>-crabs, from the idea of their living in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TENT\">tent</a>, or retiring to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CELL\">cell</a>.\n\nSp. 1.

His pupil J. C. Fabricius, in the Supplement to his Entomologia Systematica, placed them in a particular class named Mitosata, comprehending all the species, like Linn\u00e9, under the generic appellations of Julius and Scolopendra. G. Cuvier, in his Tableau \u00c9l\u00e9mentaire, arranged the Myriapoda with Insects, in which he was followed by A. M. C. Dum\u00e9ril, who has, however, adopted the new genera proposed by Latreille.\n\nThey were arranged in the older works of Latreille along with Insects; but in his last work he has placed them in a peculiar order of the class Arachnides, which he has denominated Myriapoda; and has divided them into two families, namely,\n\nFam. I. Chilognatha. Gen. 1. Glomeris. 2. Julius. 3. Polydesmus. 4. Pollyxenus.\n\nFam. II. Syngnatha. Gen. 5. Scutigera. 6. Scolopendra.\n\nLamarck arranged them with the Arachnides, into three genera, 1. Scolopenda; 2. Scutigera; 3 Julius; and in his last work, he had adopted a fourth genus, Pollyxenus.\n\nHaving given a slight sketch of what has been done by systematic writers, we may observe, that we differ from them merely in considering them as constituting a distinct class, and in disposing the species under some additional generic heads, which a minute examination of their structure has most fully warranted.\n\nClassification.\n\nAll the Myriapoda have their head distinct from Myriapoda, the body, furnished with two antennae. Mandibles simple, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INCISIVE\">incisive</a>. All or most of the segments of the body furnished with two or four legs.\n\nThe nervous system is composed of a series of ganglia, one in each segment of the body; these ganglia are brought into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> with each other by a longitudinal bundle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NERVES\">nerves</a>, or, as it is generally, but improperly, denominated, by a spinal marrow.\n\nThe two families established by Latreille, are adopted as Orders, and his names are retained.\n\nOrder I. Chilognatha. Maxilla none. Palpi obscure. Lip simple. (Antennae inserted on the upper margin of the head.)\n\nOrder II. Syngnatha. Maxillae two, distinct, with their bases united. Palpi, maxillary two, filiform; labial two terminated by a little hook.\n\nOrder I. Chilognatha.\u2020\n\nFam. I. Glomeridea. Body contractile into a globe. Eyes distinct.\n\nGen. 1.

Henry VIII. made his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> son, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">Duke</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RICHMOND\">Richmond</a>, Lord High Admiral of England, when he was but six years old. When the High Admiral, however, went to sea in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a>, he had usually a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEAL\">seal</a>, appointing him admiral and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">captain</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a>, sometimes with powers to confer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-KNIGHTHOOD\">knighthood</a>, and generally to punish with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> and limb. Such a commission was granted by Henry VIII. to Sir Edward Howard, who executed indention with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> to furnish 3000 men, 18 captains, 1750 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a>, 1232 mariners and gunners; the pay of himself to be 10s. a-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, of a captain 1s. 6d., of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> 5s. as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WAGES\">wages</a>, and 5s. for victuals each man, for twenty eight days, together with certain dead shares.\n\nIt appears, from Mr Pepys's Naval Collections, that the Lord High Admiral did anciently wear, on solemn occasions, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> whistle, set with precious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, hanging at the end of a gold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a>. The whistle, it would seem, has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> since descended to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a>-swain and his mates. (k.)\n\nADMIRALTY (HIGH <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">COURT</a> OF). This is a court of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, in which the authority of the Lord High Admiral is excercised, in his judicial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a>, and wherein all causes are determined appertaining to the sea, and all offences tried that are committed thereon. Very little has been left on record of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREROGATIVE\">prerogative</a> of the Admirals of England. For some time after the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> of the office, they judged all matters relating to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> and mariners, which happened on the main sea, in a summary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>, according to the laws of Oleron, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMULGATED\">promulgated</a> by Richard I. These laws, which were little more than a transcript of the Rhodian laws, became the universally received customs of the western part of the world. \"All the sea-faring nations,\" says Sir Lionel Jenkins, \"soon after their promulgation, received and entertained these laws from the English, by way of deference to the sovereignty of our kings in the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCEAN\">ocean</a>, and to the judgment of our countrymen in sea affairs.\"\n\nIn the patents granted to the early admirals, between the latter end of the reign of Henry III. and until the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of that of Edward III., no mention is made of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">marine</a> perquisites, or of civil power, nor does it appear that the Admirals enjoyed either; but, after the death of the latter, new and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> powers were granted to them, and it would appear that they usurped others. The preamble to the statute of 13th Richard II. sets forth, that \"forasmuch as a great and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> clamour and complaint hath been oftentimes made before this time, and yet is, for that the Admirals and their deputies hold their sessions within <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVERS\">divers</a> places of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REALM\">realm</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a> to them greater authority than belongeth to their office, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> of our lord the King, and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a> and impoverishing of the common people;\" and it is therefore directed that the Admirals and their deputies, shall not meddle, from henceforth, of any thing done within the realm, but only of a thing done upon the sea: and two years afterwards, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, as stated in the preamble of the statute, \"of the great and grievous complaint of all the commons;\" it was ordained that the Admiral's court should have no cognizance of any contracts, pleas, or quarrels, or of any thing done or arising within the bodies of counties, whether by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> or by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, nor of wreck of the sea; but that the Admiral should have cognizance of the death of a man, and of main-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORN\">horn</a> done in great ships, being and hovering in the main stream of great rivers, yet only beneath the bridges of the same rivers nigh the sea. He may also arrest ships in the great floats for the great voyages of the king, and of the realm; and have jurisdiction over the said floats, but during the said voyages only. But if the Admiral or his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">lieutenant</a> exceed that jurisdiction, then, by 2d Henry IV., the statute of 13th Richard II. and common law may be holden against them; and if a man pursues wrongfully in the Admiralty Court, his adversary may recover <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> damages at common-law, and the pursuant, if attainted, shall incur the penalty of L. 10 to the King.\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, which, according to Spelman, is absolutely subject to the jurisdiction of the Admiral, is the sea; which, however, comprehends public rivers, fresh waters, creeks, and all places whatsoever, within the ebbing and flowing of the sea, at the highest water, the shores or banks adjoining, from all the first bridges to the seaward; and, in these, he observes, the Admiralty hath full jurisdiction in all causes, criminal and civil, except treasons and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> of wreck. Lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COKE\">Coke</a> observes, that \"between the high-water mark and the low-water mark, the Admiral hath jurisdiction super aquam, when the sea is full, and as long as it flows, though the land be infra corpus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMITATUS\">comitatus</a>, at the reflow, so as of one place there is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> imperium at several times.\"\n\nBut, though the statute restraineth the Lord High Admiral, that he shall not hold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLEA\">plea</a> of a thing rising in the body of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, he is not restrained from making execution upon the land, but is empowered to take either body or goods upon the land; otherwise his jurisdiction would often prove a dead <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a>. He also can and does hold his court in the body of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a>. So, likewise, the civil power may apprehend and try persons who may have been guilty of offences cognizable at common law, though committed in the fleet, in any port or harbour of Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, or at sea, provided such persons have not already been tried for such offences, either by court martial, or in the Admiralty Court; and in all ports, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HARBOURS\">harbours</a>, creeks, &c. lying in any county, the High Admiral and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SHERIFF\">sheriff</a>, or coroner, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> may be, have concurrent jurisdiction.\n\nThe Lord High Admiral is assisted in his judicial functions by the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> officers:\n\n1. The Vice-Admiral.\n2. The Judge.\n3. The Registrar.\n4. The Marshal.\n5. Advocate-general.\n6. Procurator-general.\n7. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNSELLOR\">Counsellor</a>.\n8. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLICITOR\">Solicitor</a>.\n\n1. The Vice-Admiral. This officer is the admiral's deputy, or lieutenant, mentioned in the statutes of 13th and 15th Richard II., and was the person most probably who presided in the court. At present the Vice-Admiral of England is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> sinecure, generally conferred on some naval officer of high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> and distinguished character in the service, having a salary attached to it in addition to his half pay of L. 469, 5s. 8d. per annum. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REAR\">Rear</a>-Admiral of England is the same, and the salary, in addition to his half pay, is L. 370, 4s. 3d. per annum. Each county of England has its Vice-Admiral, which is little more than an honorary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a>, though the patent gives to him all the powers vested in the Admiral himself. Similar powers were also granted to the judges of the Admiralty county courts; but this was found so inconvenient and prejudicial to those who had suits to commence or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFEND\">defend</a> before them, that the Duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a>, when Lord High Admiral in 1663, caused instructions to be drawn up in order to ascertain to each his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a>; whereby the whole judicial power remained with the judge, and the upholding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> of the Admiral, and levying and receiving his perquisites, &c. appertained to the Admiralty.\n\nVice-admiral.\n\nEach of the four provinces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a> has its Vice-Admiral: there is one Vice-Admiral for all Scotland, who has a salary of L. 1000 a-year on the ordinary estimate of the navy, and one for the Shetland and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORKNEY_ISLANDS\">Orkney <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>. The governor of most of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a> has a commission of Vice-Admiral granted to him by the Lord High Admiral, or Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty; and generally a commission from the king, under the great seal, grounded on the 11th and 12th William III. and farther confirmed by 46th Geo. III. by which he is authorized to try all piracies, felonies, or robberies committed on the seas, where the parties are taken into custody in places remote from England; the court to consist of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> persons at the least, of which the governor, the lieutenant-governor, the vice-admiral, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAG\">flag</a>-officer, or commander in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUADRON\">squadron</a>, the members of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a>, the chief <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, judge of the vice admiralty court, captains of men of war, and secretary of the colony, are specially named in the commission; but any three of these, with four others selected from known merchants, factors, or planters, captains, lieutenants or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARRANT\">warrant</a>-officers of men of war, or captains, masters, or mates of merchant ships, constitute a legal court of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIRACY\">piracy</a>.\n\nThe Vice-Admiralty courts in the colonies are of two descriptions. The one has power to inquire into the causes of detention of enemies, or neutral vessels, to try and condemn the same for the benefit of the captors, as well as to take cognizance of all matters relating to the office of the Lord High Admiral. The other has power only to institute inquiries into misdemeanours committed in merchant vessels, and to determine petty suits, &c. and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> the privileges of the Admiral. The former are usually known by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIZE\">Prize</a> Courts; the latter by that of Instance Courts.\n\nThe following are the colonies and foreign possessions in which Prize Courts have been established in the course of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> war. Gibraltar, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALTA\">Malta</a>, Newfoundland, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HALIFAX\">Halifax</a>, Bermuda, Bahama Islands, Barbadoes, Antigua, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TORTOLA\">Tortola</a>, Jamaica, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> of Good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">Hope</a>, Ceylon, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOMBAY\">Bombay</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MADRAS\">Madras</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CALCUTTA\">Calcutta</a>. The following colonies had Instance Courts only; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMINICA\">Dominica</a>, Grenada, St Vincents, St Christophers, Trinidad, St Cervix, Martinique, Berbice, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEMERARA\">Demerara</a>, and Essequibo; in addition to which is a court established at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIERRA_LEONE\">Sierra Leone</a> for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONDEMNATION\">condemnation</a> of captured slaves only.\n\nIn none of the patents to the Lord High Admiral, Vice-Admiral, or Judge, is any mention made of prize jurisdiction. Lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANSFIELD\">Mansfield</a> had occasion to search into the records of the Court of Admiralty in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">Doctor</a>'s Commons, to ascertain on what foundation this jurisdiction was exercised by the judge of the Admiralty, but he could not discover any prize-act books farther back than 1649: no sentences farther back than 1648. The Registrar could go no farther back than 1690. \"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> records,\" says his Lordship, \"are in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a>, illegible, and without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">index</a>.\" The prize jurisdiction may therefore be considered as of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> authority, and distinct altogether from the ancient powers given to the Admi-\nAdmiralty. To constitute the authority for trying prize causes, a commission under the great seal issues to the Lord High Admiral, at the commencement of every war, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> and require the Court of Admiralty, and the lieutenant and judge of the said court, his surrogate or surrogates, to proceed upon all manner of captures, seizures, prizes, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REPRISALS\">reprisals</a>, of all ships and goods that are or shall be taken; and to hear and determine according to the course of the Admiralty, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW_OF_NATIONS\">law of nations</a>, and a warrant issues to the Judge of the Admiralty accordingly.\n\nThe Admiralty Court being in this respect a court in which foreigners of all nations may become suitors, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> may be had from its decisions to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMITTEE\">committee</a> of the Lords of His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJESTY\">Majesty</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-PRIVY_COUNCIL\">Privy Council</a>, who hear and determine according to the established laws of nations.\n\nAt the breaking out of a war, the Lord High Admiral also receives a special commission from the crown, under the great seal, to empower him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> letters of marque and reprisals against the enemy, he having no such power by his patent. These letters are either general or special;\u2014general, when granted to private men to fit out ships at their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> to annoy the enemy;\u2014special, when in the case of any of our merchants being robbed of their estates or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> by foreigners, the king grants them letters of reprisal against that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, though we may be in amity with it. Before the latter can be sued for, the complainant must have gone through the prosecution of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> in the courts of the state whose subjects have wronged him; where if justice be denied, or vexatiously delayed, he must first make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of his losses and charges in the Admiralty Court here; whereupon, if the King is satisfied he has pursued all lawful means to obtain redress, and his own interceding should produce no better effect, special letters of reprisal are granted; not, however, as must be evident, until a very strong case has been made out. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>, which we may now consider as obsolete, seems to be a remnant of the law of ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>, called androlepsia, by which, if a man was slain, the friends and relations of the deceased might <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> on any three citizens of the place where the murderer took refuge, and make them slaves, unless he was delivered up. Both Oliver Cromwell and King <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> II. have granted letters of reprisal. In 1638, the Duc d'Epernon seized on the ship Amity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, for the service of the French king against the Spaniards, promising full satisfaction; but none being made, the owners obtained letters of reprisal from the usurper, and afterwards, in 1665, from Charles II. In 1666, Captain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUTLER\">Butler</a> Barnes had letters of reprisal against the Danes. The Dutch having burnt six English merchant ships in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELBE\">Elbe</a>, within the territories of Hamburgh, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, instead of giving any assistance or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-PROTECTION\">protection</a>, hindered the English from defending themselves, letters of reprisal were granted to the sufferers against that city. Lastly, one Justiniani, a noble Genoese, being indebted in a great sum to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMO\">Como</a>, a merchant in London, which he had several years solicited for, but could get no satisfaction, Captain Scott, commander of his Majesty's ship the Dragon, stationed at that time in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a>, received orders to make reprisals upon the ships of that republic; upon Admiralty, which the debt was paid.\n\n2. The Judge. The patents to the Judge of the Admiralty and Vice-Admiralty courts run pretty nearly in the same manner as those of the Lord High Admiral, and point out the several matters of which he can take cognizance. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> of 1640 established the office of Judge of the Admiralty court in three persons, with a salary of L.500 a-year to each. At the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESTORATION\">Restoration</a>, there were two judges of the High Court of Admiralty, which sometimes proved inconvenient; for when they differed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> no judgment could be had. These judges, before the Revolution, held their appointment only during <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>. At that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, Sir Charles Hedges was constituted judge under the great seal of England, quamdiu se bene gesserit, with a salary of L.400 a-year, and an additional L.400 out of the proceeds of prizes and perquisites of the Admiralty; but in the year 1725 the latter sum was diminished from the ordinary estimate by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">House</a> of Commons. Sir William Scott, the present judge, in consequence of the extraordinary increase of the business in the Admiralty Court, has a salary of L.2500 a-year on the ordinary estimate of the navy.\n\nThe judges of the Vice-Admiralty courts in certain of the colonies, limited by 41st George III., are allowed a salary not exceeding to each the sum of L.2000 a-year, to be paid out of the consolidated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUND\">fund</a> of Great Britain; together with profits and emoluments, not exceeding to each the further sum of L.2000 per annum out of the fees to be taken by the said judges, of which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> is directed to be hung up in some conspicuous place in the court; and no judge is to take any fee beyond those specified, directly or indirectly, on pain of forfeiture of his office, and being proceeded against for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTORTION\">extortion</a>: and on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RETIREMENT\">retirement</a> from office, after six years' service, his Majesty may, by authority of the act above mentioned, grant unto such judge an annuity for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> of his life, not exceeding L.1000 per annum. This liberal provision puts the judges of the colonial courts of Vice-Admiralty above all suspicion of their decisions being influenced by unworthy motives; a suspicion they were not entirely free from when their emoluments depended mainly on their fees.\n\nDuring the late war, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SESSION\">session</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OYER\">oyer</a> and terminer to try Admiralty causes was held at the Old Bailey twice a-year. The commission for this purpose is of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> with those that are granted to the judges when they go the circuits: that is to say, to determine and punish all crimes, offences, misdemeanours, and abuses; the end of both being the same, their limits different; the one relating to things done upon the land, the other to things done upon the water. The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, all the members of the Privy-Council, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">Chancellor</a> and all the judges, the Lords of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURY\">Treasury</a>, the Secretary of the Admiralty, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURER\">Treasurer</a> and Commissioners of the navy, some of the Aldermen of London, and several Doctors of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CIVIL_LAW\">civil law</a>, are the members of this commission, any four of whom make a court, the quorum being the Lords of the Admiralty, Judge of the Admiralty, the Twelve Judges, and the Doctors of the civil law.\nThe session of oyer and terminer lasts generally from one to three days, and the court is entertained each day with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DINNER\">dinner</a> at the expense of the Lord High Admiral, that is to say, of the public.\n\nThe proceedings of the court are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> de die in diem, or, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a> of the court is, from tide to tide.\n\n3. The Registrar of the Admiralty has hitherto held his place by patent from the Lord High Admiral generally for life, though the admiral himself; and the Lords Commissioners of Admiralty hold their places only during pleasure; and what is still more remarkable, the office of Registrar has sometimes been granted, and is now vested in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVERSION\">reversion</a>. He had no salary; the amount of his emoluments depending on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of captures, droits, &c., condemned by the court; which, during the late war, were so enormous, that in 1810, an act was passed for regulating the offices of Registrars of Admiralty and prize courts, by which it is enacted, \"that no office of registrar of the high court of admiralty, or of the high court of appeals for prizes, or high court of delegates in Great Britain, shall, after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-EXPIRATION\">expiration</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> now vested in possession or reversion therein, be granted for a longer term than during pleasure, nor be executed by deputy; that an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> be kept in the said offices respectively of all the fees, dues, perquisites, emoluments, and profits received by and on account of the said Registrars, out of which all the expenses of their offices are to be paid; that one-third of the surplus shall belong to the Registrar and to his assistant, (if an assistant should be necessary,) and the remaining two-thirds to the consolidated fund of Great Britain, to be paid quarterly into the Exchequer, the account of such surplus to be presented to the court at least fourteen days before each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> day, and verified on oath.\"\n\n4. The Marshal. This officer receives his appointment from the Lord High Admiral or Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, and holds his situation by patent under the seal of the High Court of Admiralty, during pleasure. His duties are to arrest ships and persons, to imprison in the Marshalsea, to bear the mace before the judge, and to attend executions. His emoluments depend chiefly on the number of prizes brought into port for condemnation, and the number of ships embargoed, and may probably be reckoned in time of war, communibus annis, from L. 1500 to L. 2000 a year, out of which he has to pay about L. 400 a year to a deputy. In peace, the whole emoluments are probably not sufficient for the payment of the deputy's salary.\n\n5. The Advocate-General. This officer is appointed by warrant of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty. His duties are, to appear for the Lord High Admiral in his Court of Admiralty, Court of Delegates, and other courts; to move and debate in all causes wherein the rights of the Admiral are concerned, for which he had ancienly a salary of twenty marks a year, and an additional allowance granted to him in 1695, of L. 200 a year. At present he has L. 213, 6s. 8d. a year, voted on the ordinary estimate of the navy. Formerly, the Admiral's Advocate was always retained as leading <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNSEL\">counsel</a>, but since the droits were transferred to the crown, he has gradually been supplanted by the King's Advocate, who is generally retained in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, the Admiralty Advocate acting only as junior counsel; and while the former makes sometimes from L. 15,000 to L. 20,000 a year, the latter rarely receives from his professional duties more than from L. 1500 to L. 2000 a year. This difference however, may probably be owing in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> character of the men who hold the two situations.\n\n6. The Procurator. The Admiralty's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROCTOR\">Proctor</a> stands precisely in the same situation to the King's Proctor, that his advocate does to that of the King, though there is not quite so great a difference in their emoluments. They act as the attorneys or solicitors in all causes concerning the King's and the Lord High Admiral's affairs in the High Court of Admiralty and other courts. All prize causes are conducted by the King's Proctor, which the captors are disposed to consider as a grievance, but which the gentlemen of Doctors Commons on the contrary maintain to be for their convenience and advantage. It is supposed, that in some years of the war, the King's Proctor did not receive less than L. 20,000 a year.\n\n7. The Counsel of the Admiralty is the law officer who is chiefly consulted on matters connected with the military duties of the Lord High Admiral; his salary is L. 100 a year besides his fees, which, in time of war, may be reckoned to amount from L. 1200 to L. 1800 a year.\n\n8. The Solicitor to the Admiralty, is also an officer more immediately connected with the military functions of the Admiralty. He is stated sometimes assistant to the counsel; his salary is L. 400 in lieu of all fees; and his disbursements for the naval departments in time of war, amount to L. 14,000 or L. 15,000 a year.\n\nThe Judge Advocate of the fleet is a sinecure appointment, with a salary of L. 182, 10s. a year, on the ordinary estimate of the navy; but the Deputy Judge Advocate resides at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PORTSMOUTH\">Portsmouth</a>, and assists at all courts martial held at that port, for which he is allowed an annual salary of L. 146.

Of the apple, however, several new, and valuable varieties have lately been introduced, and advantageously cultivated.\n\nAntrim has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> been distinguished for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> manufacture; but latterly, the manufacture of cotton has, in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, supplanted it, especially in the vicinity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELFAST\">Belfast</a>. In the year 1800, about 23 years after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-INTRODUCTION\">introduction</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COTTON_MANUFACTURE\">cotton manufacture</a>, 13,500 people were directly employed in it; and including all manner of persons occupied in it in various ways, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> was 27,000, within a circuit of 10 miles; comprehending, however, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> of Belfast, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LISBURN\">Lisburn</a>. The cotton <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-YARN\">yarn</a> is chiefly brought from Scotland.\n\nThe linen manufacture, notwithstanding, is still the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAPLE\">staple</a> manufacture of Antrim. It is a peculiarity of this manufacture, as it is established in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>, that it does not remove the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEASANT\">peasant</a> from the comforts and healthiness of rural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. In Antrim, the weaver and the labourer of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> are united in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a>. Many weavers have small farms, and only employ themselves in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEAVING\">weaving</a> during the intervals of their farming occupations; and almost all who pursue this trade, possess gardens, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> for potatoes. Many of the houses have three looms, which cost from four to five guineas each: Children are hired to attend a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOOM\">loom</a> at from 13s. to 17s. the half year, with diet, washing, and lodging: they bring a weaver eight guineas per annum. A good weaver <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> 10s. per web, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he worked every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, he could weave a web in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>. A loom will employ four spinners, who are all females, and will spin five hanks in a week, the price of which is 2s. 8\u00bdd.\n\nThe consumption of food per week, by a manufacturing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, consisting of six persons, in this Peasantry County, is 3\u00bd bushels of potatoes; 14 herrings; 9 quarts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>; and one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>: the cost of which may be estimated at five shillings. The expense of a family, consisting of the same number of persons, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of which works at agricultural labours, will be 7s. 6d. per week, as he occasionally uses meat, milk, and pork.\n\nThere is a considerable salmon-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISHING\">fishing</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of Antrim, at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARRICK\">Carrick</a>-a-rede. This Fishing place is separated from the mainland by a chasm 60 feet in width, over which, every year, at the commencement of the fishery, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a> formed of two strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CABLES\">cables</a>, and a number of boards, is thrown.\n\nThe antiquities of this County consist of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CAIRNS\">cairns</a>, cromlechs, mounts, forts, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> remains, round towers, &c. There are three round towers, viz., one near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWN\">town</a> of Antrim; one at Ardmore; and one in Ram <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">Island</a>, in Lough Neagh. A few years ago, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATERA\">patera</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>, weighing 19 ounces, 10 dwts. was found in this County.\n\nThe number of houses in the County of Antrim, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">Population</a> in the year 1777, was 22,184; of which 20,519 paid for one hearth; 3667 for two or more; 1066 were newly inhabited; and 3002 belonged to paupers. In the year 1788 the number of houses was 28,254, and the population was estimated at 160,000. At this rate there were about 13 acres to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, and about 48 persons on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILE\">mile</a>. In the year 1791, the number of houses was 30,514, of which 22,353 paid for one hearth, and 8746 were inhabited by paupers. The number of men returned, in the year 1810, between the ages of 16 and 45, fit to serve in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITIA\">militia</a>, was 24,425. Mr Dubourdieu, in his Statistical Survey of Antrim, estimates the present population at 240,000.\n\nAntrim is supposed to contain a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROTESTANTS\">Protestants</a> than any other County in Ireland; and of the Protestants a very great majority is Presbyterian; being connected with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">General</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYNOD\">Synod</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ULSTER\">Ulster</a>, or with the Burghers and Antiburghers of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">Church</a> of Scotland.
