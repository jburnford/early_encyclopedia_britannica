[{"h":"ACOSTA","t":"(Jos\u00e9ph D.), a celebrated Spanish author, was born at Medina del Campo, about the year 1539. In 1571, he went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-PERU\">Peru</a> as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCIAL\">Provincial</a> of the Jesuits, having entered into that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> in his fourteenth year. After a residence in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a> of seventeen years, he returned to his native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, and became in succession visitor for his order of Arragon and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANDALUSIA\">Andalusia</a>, superior of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VALLADOLID\">Valladolid</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECTOR\">rector</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALAMANCA\">Salamanca</a>; in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> he died in February 1600.\n\nAbout ten years before his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, he published at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEVILLE\">Seville</a>, in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> quarto, his valuable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> entitled Historia <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">Natural</a> y Moral de las Indias. The two first books of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> were written during his residence in Peru, and were published separately after his return to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, in the Latin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, with this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a>: De Natura <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVI\">Novi</a> Orbis, libri duo. He afterwards translated them into Spanish, and added to them other five books, the whole composing a connected work, under the first mentioned title. This work, which has been translated into all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> languages of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, is written <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> and comprehensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>. The five first books are employed upon the physical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">geography</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\">natural history</a> of that portion of America which had been conquered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> discovered by the Spaniards; the fifth and sixth upon the manners, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> and civil institutions of the inhabitants; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a>, upon the history of the Mexicans, from their origin till the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of their subjugation. Dr Robertson pronounces Acosta, \"an accurate and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a>-informed writer.\" Among other things, he treats the subject of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> in a more philosophical manner, than could have been expected in a writer of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, and of his order. \"He was the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>,\" says the eminent author <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> quoted, \"who endeavoured to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> for the different degrees of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> in the old and new...\"\ncontinents, by the agency of the winds which blow in each;\u2014a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> which was afterwards adopted by Buffon, and supported with his usual powers of copious and eloquent illustration. In the course of these discussions, Acosta frequently comments upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>, and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> philosophers, that the middle zone of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> was so much scorched by the rays of the sun, as to be destitute of moisture and verdure, and totally uninhabitable. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> seems to have held its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> in the Schools, even after the discovery of South America had disclosed the magnificent scenery and stupendous rivers of the tropical regions. It appears to have been thought a sort of impiety to question a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOGMA\">dogma</a> of such ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a>, and sanctioned by the assent of all the school divines. We learn, from a curious passage in Osborne's Miscellany of Essays, Paradoxes, and Letters, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> of this ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> in geography, was one of the circumstances which brought upon the famous Sir Walter Ralegh the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> scepticism and atheism. Acosta mentions, that, when he went to America, his mind was deeply imbued with frightful notions of this supposed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> zone, and that his surprise was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a>, when he beheld it so different from what it had been represented in the \"ancient and received <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>.\"\n\n\"What could I do then,\" says he, \"but laugh at Aristotle's meteors and his philosophy?\"\n\nHaving said thus much in regard to one of the most curious and valuable of the earlier accounts of the new world, it may be proper to add, that, in speaking of the conduct of his countrymen, and the propagation of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>, Acosta is in no respect superior to the other prejudiced and fanatical writers of his country and age. Though he acknowledges that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CAREER\">career</a> of Spanish conquest was marked by the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> cruelty and oppression, he yet represents this people as the chosen instruments of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEITY\">Deity</a>, for spreading the truths of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOSPEL\">gospel</a> among the nations of America. He accordingly recounts a variety of miracles, as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the constant interposition of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAVEN\">Heaven</a>, in favour of these merciless and rapacious invaders. It <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> appear from the following curious passage, that he even makes the great enemy of mankind himself, a co-operator in that scheme of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVERSION\">conversion</a> for which he represents the Spaniards to have been predestined. \"That\" says he, \"which is difficult in our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a> to believe, has been made easy among the Indians; because the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEVIL\">Devil</a> had made them comprehend even the self same things, which he had stolen from our evangelical law\u2014as their manner of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONFESSION\">confession</a>, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADORATION\">adoration</a> of three in one, and such like; the which, against the will of the enemy, have holpen for the easy receiving of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>.\"\n\nBesides his History, Acosta wrote the following works: 1. De Promulgatione Evangelii apud Barbaros.\u20142. De Christo Revelato.\u20143. De Temporibus Novissimis, libros vi.\u20144. Concionum, tomos iii. All of these works were, in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, frequently reprinted; but it is only by his history that his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> is now known in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LITERARY\">literary</a> world. The English translation, from which we have taken the preceding extracts, was published at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, in quarto, in the year 1604, and is now rather a scarce book.\n\nACOUSTICS. The doctrine of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> is unquestionably the most subtle and abstruse in the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANGE\">range</a> of physical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>. It has given occasion, in recent times, to much controversy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a>, and has eventually called forth all the mighty resources of a refined and elaborate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CALCULUS\">calculus</a>. Yet an evident obscurity still remains to overcloud the subject. The discrepancies between theory and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> have been made entirely to disappear from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a>, which has at last attained a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a> befitting the sublimity of the science. But some latent suspicions pervade the structure of acoustics, sufficient to disturb that feeling of confidence which is calculated to invigorate our pursuits. The general theory of sound, and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> to a variety of curious philosophical amusements, have been explained in the body of the work. We purpose, however, to reconsider the subject at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>, and to examine closely the bases on which it rests. But we must content ourselves at present with a few sketches, reserving our extended remarks for their several distinct heads, in hopes that, during the progress of this Supplement, we shall be able to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLECT\">collect</a> more accurate and complete materials.","sp":260,"ep":261},{"h":"ADDENDUM","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ANNUITIES\">ANNUITIES</a>. As an addition to the article ANNUITIES, we beg to insert here an expeditious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of calculating the values of annuities <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> lives, from any tables or bills of mortality, with sufficient accuracy for all practical purposes.\n\nWe must begin by determining the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPLEMENT\">complement</a> of life, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of deaths during a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, which must vary according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the proposed calculation; being shorter as the rate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> is higher; and as the number of lives concerned is greater; but not requiring to be very accurately defined. If the rate of interest be \\( r \\), we must find the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> in which the number of deaths is expressed by the fraction\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{r+3}\n\\]\n\nof the whole number of survivors at the given <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, for a single life; for two lives, the fraction must be\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{r+5}\n\\]\n\nand for three,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{r+7}\n\\]\n\nand, in each of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, the time determined from the age of the oldest life must be employed for finding the complements of both the others.\n\nHaving thus calculated the complements for each of the ages, we may, in most instances, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol16.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> ourselves the trouble of further computation, by employing tables of the value of annuities on one and two lives, according to Demoivre's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>. For this purpose, we have only to subtract the complement from 86, and we obtain an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> life on this hypothesis. If we take, for example, the age of 20, the number of survivors in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTHAMPTON\">Northampton</a> tables is 5132; and, for a single life, at 3 and at 6 per cent, we must find the time at which they are reduced\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{6} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{3}{9}\n\\]\n\nrespectively; that is, to about 2566 and 3421: now at 54 and 43, the numbers are 2530 and 3404; and\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5132 \\times 34}{5132 - 2530} = 67.07, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{5132 \\times 23}{5132 - 3404} = 68.3\n\\]\n\nwhence the equivalent ages in Demoivre's tables are 18.93 and 17.7, giving 18.62 and 12.43, for the value of the annuity; while Dr Price's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>, deduced from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> decrements at all ages, gives 18.64 and 12.40.\n\nThe utility of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of calculation <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be still further illustrated by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of the very different values of lives, as indicated by different tables. Taking, for example, the age of 30, and the interest at 5 per cent, we may find the value of the annuity, by this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROXIMATION\">approximation</a>, in different situations, for which correct tables have been published by Dr Price, and may thence infer how much nearer it approaches to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> than the generality of the results approach to each other:\n\n| Location | Value |\n|----------|-------|\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>   | 11.22 |\n| Northampton | 13.09 |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a>, males | 14.04 |\n| Deparcieux | 14.28 |\n| Sweden, females | 14.58 |\n\nAccording to the bills of mortality of London for 1815, out of 9472 survivors at 30, 5573 lived to 50, and this is near enough to \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\) for our purpose; hence the complement is 48.58, and the value of an annuity at 5 per cent. 12-16 years' purchase. Where the age is much greater, the approximation is somewhat less accurate, though not often materially erroneous; thus, at 70, the values, according to the Northampton tables, at 3 and 6 per cent, are 6.23 and 5.35, instead of 6.73 and 5.72 respectively.\n\nIn the values of joint lives, there is more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a>, according to the different tables employed, than in those of single lives: thus, at 30, the value of an annuity, at 4 per cent. on a single life, differs at Northampton, and in Sweden, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> of 14.78 to 16.00, or of 12 to 13; but, for two joint lives at 30, in that of 11.31 to 12.96, or of 7 to 8; and for three lives, the disproportion would be still greater.\n\nIn the absence of Demoivre's tables, or for cases to which they do not extend, it becomes necessary to calculate the value of the annuity for each particular instance. Calling then the complement, as already determined, \\( a \\), the number of survivors after \\( x \\) years will be represented by \\( a-x \\), and the present value of any sum to be paid to each of them by\n\n\\[\nav^x - xv^x, \\quad v \\text{ being the present value of a unit payable at the end of a year: and if we suppose such payments to be made continually, their whole present value may be found by multiplying this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> by the fluxion of } x, \\text{ and finding the fluent, which will be } -pv^x (a-x-p), \\quad p \\text{ being } = \\frac{1}{Hv}, \\text{ or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECIPROCAL\">reciprocal</a> of the hyperbolical logarithm of the amount of a unit after a year. When } x \\text{ vanishes, this fluent becomes } -p(a-p), \\text{ and when } x = a, p^2v^a; \\text{ the difference, divided by } a, \\text{ gives the present value of the annuity, } p - \\frac{p^2}{a} + \\frac{p^2-a}{a}; \\text{ from which, when the annuity is supposed to become due and to be paid periodically, we must subtract in all cases half a payment; that is, } \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ for yearly payments, and } \\frac{1}{4} \\text{ for quarterly; and if, at the same time, we choose to assume that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> is capable of being improved by laying out the interest more frequently than once...\na year at the given rate, we must alter the value of \\( r \\) accordingly.\n\nFor two joint lives, the complement of the elder, determined from the fraction \\( \\frac{3}{r+5} \\) being \\( a \\), and that of the younger, deduced from the deaths in an equal number of years, \\( b \\), we have for the binary combinations of the survivors, after \\( x \\) years, \\((a-x)(b-x)\\) and the fluent will be \\(-pv^x(ab-(a+b)x+p)+x^2+2px+2p^2\\), which, corrected and divided by \\( ab \\), gives the value of the annuity \\( p - \\frac{p^2}{ab}(a+b-2p) - \\frac{p^2x}{ab}(a-b+2p) \\); and this, with the deduction of half a payment, agrees with the tables calculated on Demoivre's hypothesis, taking the same complements of life.\n\nBut for three lives we have no such tables, and this method of calculation becomes therefore of still greater importance. Employing here the fraction \\( \\frac{3}{r+7} \\) for the oldest life, we must determine the complement \\( a \\) for this life, and those of the two younger, \\( b \\) and \\( c \\), from an equal period. The combinations will then be \\((a-x)(b-x)(c-x)=abc-(ab+ac+bc)x+(a+b+c)x^2-x^3 \\), which we may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CALL\">call</a> \\( d-ex+fz^2-x^3 \\); hence the fluent is found \\(-pv^x(d-e(x+p)+f(x^2+2px+2p^2)-(x^3+3px^2+6p^2x+6p^3)) \\).\n\nThis, when \\( z \\) vanishes, becomes \\(-p(d-ep+fP^2-6p^3) \\), and calling this \\(-pg \\), the corrected fluent will give the value of the annuity \\( \\frac{pg}{d} - \\frac{pg^2}{d}(g-en+f^2a+2fpa-a^2-3pa^2-6p^2a) \\). Thus, if the ages are 10, 20, and 30, and the rate of interest 4 per cent., we find, in the Northampton tables, the survivors at 30 4385, \\( \\frac{9}{11} \\) of which are 3199; and at 40, the survivors are 3170; whence \\( a = 57.7 \\), and \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) found also from periods of 16 years after the respective ages, are 68.5 and 91.7. Calculating with these numbers, we find the value of the annuity 10.954\u20145 = 10.454. Dr Price's short table gives it 10.438; and Simpson's approximation from the tables of two joint lives 10.563, which is less accurate in this instance, even supposing such tables to have been previously calculated.\n\nIt would, indeed, be easy to form, by this mode of computation, a table of the corrections required at different ages for Simpson's approximation, since these corrections must be very nearly the same, whether Demoivre's hypothesis, or the actual decrements of lives be employed, both for the two joint lives, and for the correct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a> of the three. But the value thus found would still be less accurate, with respect to any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, or perhaps even any other time, than the immediate result of the mode of calculation here explained.\n\nIt may, perhaps, save some trouble to subjoin a table of the values of \\( p \\) and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOGARITHMS\">logarithms</a>.\n\n| \\( p \\) | log. \\( p \\) |\n|-------|------------|\n| 3     | 33.831     |\n| 4     | 25.497     |\n| 5     | 20.497     |\n| 6     | 17.162     |\n\n(NT.)\n# Table of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol8.html#article-ARTICLES\">Articles</a> and Treatises Contained in This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">Volume</a>\n\n| Abbreviation | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">Description</a> |\n|--------------|-------------|\n| ABBALLATIF, or ABBOLLATIPH. | |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABERDEENSHIRE\">ABERDEENSHIRE</a>. | |\n| ABERRATION (Spherical).

The force which kept the two bodies in contact is called adhesion. Three sets of experiments <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> this subject have been published by different philosophers.\n\nDr Brook Taylor in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNETISM\">magnetism</a>, inserted in the Philosophical Transactions for 1721, describes the result of his trials to determine the weight necessary to separate fir-boards of different sizes from the surface of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>. The result of his experiments was,\u2014that the weight necessary is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to the surface of the fir-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOARD\">board</a> to be raised.\n\nIn the year 1773, Guyton-Morveau ascertained experimentally the force of adhesion of eleven different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-METALS\">metals</a> to mercury.

Morveau ascertained likewise, that the adhesive force is not diminished by removing the pressure of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>.\n\nA <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of experiments on the same subject were made at a still later <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, by Mr Achard of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BERLIN\">Berlin</a>. He measured the force of adhesion between various substances and water. He found, that when the temperature was increased, the adhesion proportionally diminished. He even attempted to determine the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIMINUTION\">diminution</a> occasioned by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELEVATION\">elevation</a> of temperature, amounting to a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of the thermometer; and gives us a formula denoting that diminution. But it is not necessary to enter into any details respecting his experiments here, for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> appear immediately.\n\nBesides these three philosophers, many others have examined the rise of liquids in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CAPILLARY\">capillary</a> tubes, a phenomenon which is nothing else than a peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of adhesion; though we cannot with propriety treat of it here. Laplace published a dissertation on the subject in the year 1805, in which he has given us an historical detail, which however is far from accurate. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> appears to us in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> correct; though several very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> propositions are rather obscured than elucidated by his mathematical demonstrations.\n\nWhen we make experiments on the adhesion of solids to liquids, and endeavour to ascertain the force requisite to separate them from each other, two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> may occur. The solid body may separate from the liquid, dry; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> its surface may be covered with a thin coating of the liquid which it retains. If a surface of tallow be placed in contact with water, and separated from it by weights successively introduced into the opposite scale, we shall find, after the separation has taken <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, that the surface of the tallow is dry, or that it has not carried along with it a thin coating of the water. But when we employ a fir-board as Dr Brook Taylor did in his experiments, and as Mr Achard did in many of his, the case is very different. We shall find the whole surface of the board thoroughly wetted; that is to say, a thin film of the liquid remains adhering to the wood. Now, it is only the first of these two cases that can be considered as exhibiting the true force of adhesion. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> case, it is not the solid which separates from the liquid; but one portion of the liquid which separates from the other. Such experiments therefore really show the force of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-COHESION\">cohesion</a> between the particles of the liquid; not the force of adhesion between the solid and the liquid. Now, as the experiments of Brook Taylor and Achard belong all to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> case, it is obvious that they cannot be considered as experiments on adhesion. We must therefore leave them out of our consideration at present. The cohesion of the particles of liquids is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> known to diminish as the temperature increases; till at a certain temperature this cohesion disappears altogether, and the liquids assume the state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> fluids, the particles of which repel each other. Hence, the reason why, in Achard's experiments, the adhesive force diminished as the temperature increased.\n\nAdhesion is obviously an attractive force, by which the two surfaces are kept in contact. It must evidently increase as the surfaces adhering, because the number of adhering particles increase in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a>. This force is insensible, when the two surfaces are at any perceptible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> from one another; so that it acts only at insensible distances. From Morveau's experiments it appears, that it differs very much in intensity when different solids are made to adhere to the same liquid. Thus gold adheres to mercury, with a force more than twice as great as zinc does, and almost fifty-six times as great as cobalt does. Now these two properties, namely, acting only at insensible distances, and varying in intensity in different bodies, characterize that peculiar force known by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of chemical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a>. But there is one particular in which chemical affinity appears at first sight to differ from adhesion. Chemical affinity is confined to the ultimate particles or atoms of bodies; whereas, adhesion takes place between surfaces of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> whatever.\n\nBut, if we consider that these surfaces consist each of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONGERIES\">congeries</a> of atoms united into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> by the force of cohesion; that adhesion is not sensible at any perceptible distance, however great the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of surfaces may be; and that its strength increases in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to the surfaces\u2014if we consider these phenomena, we shall find reason to conclude, that adhesion is a force which acts only between the atoms or integrant particles of bodies. It is therefore merely a case of chemical affinity.\n\nThe phenomena of adhesion depend upon the strength of affinity between the adhering bodies. If the affinity be weak, the two surfaces will separate by a small force applied, and the solid will retain no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> of the liquid whatever. This happens when cobalt is brought in contact with mercury, or tallow with water. If the affinity be strong, a considerable force will be requisite to separate the two surfaces. This is the case when gold or silver is brought in contact with mercury. So great is the affinity indeed in these cases, that if the adhesion continue for a short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> actually takes place between the two metals. In that case the gold comes away <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>, or coated over with a film of mercury; the experiment is no longer an example of the force of adhesion between mercury and gold, but exhibits the cohesive force of the particles of mercury to each other. We have even found that this holds with platinum, though it be a metal which has a much weaker affinity for mercury than gold has. If a clean surface of platinum be kept for some time in contact with that of mercury, a very evident amalgamation takes place.\n\nWhen a surface of wood, marble or metal, comes in contact with water, on removing it we find that surface moist; that is to say, it has carried with it a thin film of water. This shews us, that the adhesive force of water, or the affinity of water to these different bodies, is greater than the cohesive force of the particles of water for each other. Yet this force is not sufficiently strong to produce a chemical combination between the respective bodies. When a surface of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> comes in contact with water, this surface is not merely wetted. If the contact be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> for a sufficient time the solid loses its cohesion, and is dissolved by the liquid. This is a complicated case. The water by capillary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> insinuates itself through the pores of the sugar. The\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CRYSTALS\">crystals</a> of sugar are deprived of their cohesion to each other by this intervening liquid. Being separated from each other, they gradually dissolve or enter into a chemical combination with the water. (3.)\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ADMIRAL\">ADMIRAL</a>.

According to Moreri, Florent de Valenue, in the year 1270, was the first Admiral known in France; but by the most approved writers of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> was unknown till, in 1284, Enguerand de Coussy was constituted Admiral. The first Admiral by name that we know of in England was W. de Leybourne, who was appointed to that office by Edward I. in the year 1286, under the title of Admiral de la mer du roy d'Angleterre. Mariana, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, says that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DON\">Don</a> Sancho, having resolved to make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-WAR\">war</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the barbarians, (Moors,) prepared a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a>; and as the Genoese were at that time very powerful by sea, and experienced and dexterous sailors, he sent to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENOA\">Genoa</a> to invite, with great offers, Benito Zacharias into his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>; that he accepted those offers, and brought with him twelve ships; that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> named him his Admiral, (Almirante,) and conferred on him the office for a limited time. This happened in the year 1284. Several Portuguese authors observe, that their office of Almirante was derived from the Genoese, who had it from the Sicilians, and these from the Saracens; and it appears from Souza's Historia Genealogica da <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CASA\">Casa</a> Real, that, in 1392, Micer Manuel Picagow was invited from Genoa into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PORTUGAL\">Portugal</a>, and appointed to the office of Almirante, with a salary of three thousand pounds (livras) a-year, and certain lands, &c., on condition that he should furnish, on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a>, twenty men of Genoa, all experienced in sea affairs, and qualified to be alcaldes (captains) and arraisers (masters).\nAdmiral of ships; all of which terms, *almirante*, *alc\u00e1di*, and *arrais*, are obviously of Arabic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DERIVATION\">derivation</a>.\n\nEdward I., who began his reign in 1272, went to the Holy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">Land</a>, and visited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SICILY\">Sicily</a> on his return. He must therefore have had an opportunity of informing himself concerning the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> and naval <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> of the various countries bordering on the Mediterranean\u2014an opportunity which so able and warlike a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> would not neglect; but whether the title and office of Admiral existed in England before his time, as some are inclined to think, or whether W. de Leybourne was first created to that office in 1286, as before mentioned, we believe there is no authentic record to enable us to decide. Supposing him, however, to be the first, Edward may either have adopted the office and title from the Genoese, or the Sicilians, or the Spaniards, or the French; or even had it directly from the Saracens, against whom he had fought, and with whom he had afterwards much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMICABLE\">amicable</a> intercourse. It would seem, however, that the office was, in Edward's time, merely honorary; for that monarch, in 1307, orders the Lord Mayor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, at his peril and without delay, to provide a good ship, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> equipped, to carry his pavilions and tents; and, in the same year, another order is addressed to the *Vicecomes Kantiae*, to provide, for immediate passage across the seas, \"tot et tales pontes et claias,\" as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTABLE\">constable</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOVER\">Dover</a> Castle should demand; without one word being mentioned of the admiral. (Rymer, Vol. III. p. 32.)\n\nFrom the 34th Edward II. we have a regular and uninterrupted succession of Admirals. In that year he appointed Edward <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol6.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> Admiral of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">North</a>, from the mouth of the river <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THAMES\">Thames</a> northward, and Ger-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VASE\">vase</a> Allard Admiral of the West, from the mouth of the Thames westward; and these two Admirals of the North and the West were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to the 34th Edward III., when John de Beauchamp, Lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARDEN\">Warden</a> of the Cinque Ports, constable of the Tower of London, and of the Castle of Dover, was constituted *High Admiral of England*; but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> years afterwards, the office was again divided into north and west, and so continued until the 10th Richard II., when Richard, son of Alain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARL\">Earl</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARUNDEL\">Arundel</a>, was appointed Admiral of England. Two years after this, it was again divided as before; and in the fifteenth year of the same reign, Edward Earl of Rutland and Cork, afterwards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">Duke</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALBEMARLE\">Albemarle</a>, was constituted *High Admiral of the North and West*; and after him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARQUIS\">Marquis</a> of Dorset, and Earl of Somerset, son of John of Gaunt, Duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANCASTER\">Lancaster</a>; then Percy Earl of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WINCHESTER\">Winchester</a> next succeeded to the same title, which once more was dropped in the 2d of Henry IV., and divided as before. But in the sixth of the same reign, the office of Admiral of England became permanently vested in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a>. In the 14th Henry VI., John <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a> Duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXETER\">Exeter</a> was created Admiral of England, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>, and Aquitain, for life; and in the third year of Edward VI., John <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUDLEY\">Dudley</a> Earl of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARWICK\">Warwick</a> was constituted High Admiral of England, Ireland, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CALAIS\">Calais</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOLOGNA\">Bologna</a>, the marches of the same, Normandy, Gascony, and Aquitain, also <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> of the navy and seas of the king, &c. In the 27th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a>, Charles Lord Howard had all the aforesaid titles, with the addition of Captain-general of the navy and seas of the said kingdoms.\n\nOn the 20th November 1632, the office of High Admiral was, for the first time, put in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a>, all the great officers of state being the commissioners. During the Commonwealth, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMITTEE\">committee</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> managed the affairs of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMIRALTY\">Admiralty</a>. At the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESTORATION\">Restoration</a>, in 1660, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HIGHNESS\">Highness</a> James Duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a> was constituted *Lord High Admiral of England*. The commission was revoked on the 22d May 1684, and King Charles II. held the Admiralty in his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, and managed it by the great officers of his Privy-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> until his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. He took this occasion of reserving for his own use all the droits and perquisites claimed by the Lord High Admiral. King James II. declared himself in council *Lord High Admiral and Lord General*; and he managed the affairs of the Admiralty and navy by Mr Secretary Pepys all the time of his reign. In the 1st William and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>, the Admiralty was again put in commission. In the 6th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANNE\">Anne</a>, (1707,) his Royal Highness George Prince of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DENMARK\">Denmark</a> was appointed *High Admiral of Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>*, (in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNION\">union</a> of the two crowns,) with a council to assist him; and at his death the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a> acted in the office by Mr Burchett. On the 29th November 1708, it was again put in commission, or rather, the Earl of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEMBROKE\">Pembroke</a> was constituted High Admiral, with a council to assist him; since which time, the office of Lord High Admiral has continued to be executed by seven Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty.\n\nPrince George of Denmark, when Lord High Admiral, having surrendered, by a formal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a>, all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a>, profits, perquisites, and advantages whatsoever, appertaining to the office, for the benefit and use of the public, with the exception of the sum of L. 2500 a-year, to be disposed of in such manner, and for such particular uses, as her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJESTY\">Majesty</a>, under her sign <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANUAL\">manual</a>, should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a>; the salary of the Lord High-Admiral, which had hitherto been no more than 300 marks, was now fixed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARRANT\">warrant</a> under privy-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEAL\">seal</a>, at L. 7000 a-year; which sum, by 1st George II. was divided equally among seven commissioners, and continued to be so down to the present time, the part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSIONER\">commissioner</a> who stood first in the patent having, however, been made up, from other funds, to L. 3000 a-year, and, in the year 1806, further increased by Lord Howick, then first lord-commissioner, to L. 5000 a-year. Since the surrender above mentioned, all the *droits de Admiralty*, as they are called, with all the fees, emoluments, perquisites, &c. whatsoever, have been taken from the Admiral, and applied to public purposes.","sp":280,"ep":281},{"h":"ADMIRAL OF THE FLEET","t":"is a mere honorary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a>, which gives no command, but an increase of half-pay, his being three guineas a-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, and that of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ADMIRAL\">Admiral</a> two guineas.

But since that article was drawn up, several voyages have been performed through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a> with more brilliant success, and often directed to the purposes of philosophical research. The various attempts at mounting into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, and the progress of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> among men respecting such a wonderful art, deserved likewise more notice, as interesting monuments at once of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> ingenuity and of human weakness. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> Aerostation, first used, and signifying merely the weighing of air, might seem to refer simply to the buoyant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of balloons, and to preclude all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a> concerning the circumstances which determine their floating in any given stratum, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> which regulate the force and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CELERITY\">celerity</a> of their ascension, or of their subsequent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a>.

The rudest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> learns, from his very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANCY\">infancy</a>, to imitate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWIMMING\">swimming</a> of a fish, and plays\non the surface of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGILITY\">agility</a> and a perseverance, which seem to decline with the advancement of civilization. But an art so confined in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a>, and requiring such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of bodily exertion, could not be considered of much avail. It was soon perceived, that the fatigue of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPULSION\">impulsion</a> through the water could be greatly diminished, by the support and floating of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> substance. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a> of a tree would bear its rude proprietor along the stream; or, hollowed out into a canoe, and furnished with paddles, it might enable him even to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRAVERSE\">traverse</a> a river. From this simple fabric, the step was not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARGE\">barge</a>, impelled by the force of oars. But it was a mighty stride, to fix masts and apply sails to the vessel, and thus substitute the power of wind for that of human labour. The adventurous sailor, instead of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLYING\">plying</a> on the narrow seas, or creeping timidly along the shore, could now launch with confidence into the wide <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCEAN\">ocean</a>. Navigation, in its most cultivated form, may be fairly regarded as the consummation of art, and the sublimest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIUMPH\">triumph</a> of human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a>, industry, courage, and perseverance.\n\nHaving achieved by his skill the conquest of the waters that encompass the habitable globe, it was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> to desire likewise the mastery of the air in which we breathe. In all ages, accordingly, has ingenuity been tortured in vain efforts at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a>. The story of Icarus testifies how fatal such daring attempts had generally proved to their projectors. Trials made with automatons, though less liable to risk and danger, were yet equally fallacious. Archytas, a most eminent Greek geometer and astronomer, who perished by shipwreck on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CALABRIA\">Calabria</a>, was believed by his admiring contemporaries to have constructed an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> dove, which, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of internal springs, wafted itself through the air. If such a piece of mechanism was ever made, we may be sure that its flight was really produced, as in the scenes of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPERA\">opera</a>, by means of invisible strings or wires.\n\nSo thoroughly were the ancients convinced of the impossibility of men being able to fly, that they ascribed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> rule of the sky to Divinities of the first order. The supreme <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a> alone reposed on his empyreal throne, far above the heights of Olympus; and to him was it given, from the region of the clouds, to point the winged <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a>, and to hurl the flaming thunderbolt. On special missions, he dispatched <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">Mercury</a>, as his messenger, through the wide <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANGE\">range</a> of atmosphere. The Oriental Nations, from whom we have borrowed the greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of our vulgar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MYTHOLOGY\">mythology</a>, likewise committed such journeys to certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GENII\">genii</a>, or ministering spirits. But the glowing visions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EAST\">East</a> received a darker tinge from the character and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOTHIC\">Gothic</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">Arch</a>-Fiend himself was, at no very distant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, firmly believed to have the especial control of the air, and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CAREER\">career</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHIRLWIND\">whirlwind</a>, and impel the howling tempest. Those wretched creatures, whom the unfeeling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-CREDULITY\">credulity</a> of our ancestors, particularly during the prevalence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> fanaticism, stigmatized and murdered under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DENOMINATION\">denomination</a> of witches, were supposed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> all their enchantments, to change their shapes at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a>, and to transport themselves through the air with the swiftness of thought, by a power immediately derived from their infernal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>. At a period somewhat earlier, every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> in possession of superior talents and acquirements, was believed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGIC\">magic</a>, and to perform his feats of skill, chiefly through the secret <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-AID\">aid</a> granted him by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">Prince</a> of Darkness. In spite of the incurable perverseness of his conduct, it must be confessed that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEVIL\">Devil</a> has always had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> of retaining some little inclination to assist the efforts of genius.\n\nDuring the darkness of the middle ages, every one at all distinguished by his knowledge in physics was generally reputed to have attained the power of flying in the air. Our famous countryman, Friar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACON\">Bacon</a>, among other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DREAMS\">dreams</a> engendered in his fervid genius, brain, has not scrupled to claim the invention of that envied and transcendant art. To these pretensions the credulity and indulgent admiration of some authors have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENT\">lent</a> more credit than they really deserved. Any person who will take the trouble to examine the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> of Bacon's obscure, though ponderous works, must soon be convinced, that the propositions advanced by him are very seldom founded on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a>, but ought rather to be considered as the sportive illusions of a lively and teeming fancy. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALBERTUS_MAGNUS\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALBERTUS\">Albertus</a> Magnus, who lived about the same period, and was esteemed in Germany as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> prodigy, pretended also to the art of flying. More than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a> afterwards, John M\u00fcller of K\u00f6nigsberg, and thence styled Regiomontanus, one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> restorers of genuine mathematical learning in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, was reported, by some writers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTE\">note</a>, to have, like Archytas, fashioned an artificial dove, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> its wings, and flew before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">Emperor</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol6.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> V. at his public entrance into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUREMBERG\">Nuremberg</a>. But, unfortunately for the veracity of the story, Regiomontanus died in early life, full sixty years before that visit took <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>.\n\nWhile the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECROMANCY\">necromancy</a> prevailed, such tales dark assumed colours of the most lurid hue. Fiery dragons, created by infernal machination, were imagined to rush impetuously through the sky, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOMITING\">vomiting</a> flames, and widely scattering the seeds of pestilence. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAVE\">Grave</a> writers, in those benighted ages, even ventured to describe the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of imitating the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of such terrific monsters. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> hollow reeds were to be disposed and bound together, then sheathed completely in skin, and smeared over with pitch and other inflammable matters; this light and bulky engine, partially set on fire, and launched in the thickest darkness into the air, might be sufficient, when borne along by the force of the wind, to strike the ignorant populace with affright and horror. But such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECTACLES\">spectacles</a> would come to lose their terrors by repeated failure, and the insensible progress of knowledge. So late as the year 1750, a small Catholic town in Swabia was almost entirely burnt to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASHES\">ashes</a> by an unsuccessful experiment of that sort, instigated, and probably directed, no doubt for the edification of their flock, by the lowest order of priests. It was attempted to represent the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EFFIGY\">effigy</a> of Martin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUTHER\">Luther</a>, whom the monks firmly believe to be the very imp of Satan, under the form of a winged <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERPENT\">serpent</a>, furnished with all the requisite appendages of a forked tail.\nand hideous claws. Unluckily for the skill of the machinist, this phantom directly fell against the chimney of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, to which it set fire, and the flames spreading furiously in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>, the people had soon cause to lament bitterly their intemperate zeal.\n\nThe scheme of flying in the air, which men of the first genius had once entertained, appears to have gradually descended to a lower <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a> of projectors. Those who afterwards occupied themselves with such hopeless attempts, had commonly a smattering of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a>, with some little share of ingenuity, but wrought up by excessive conceit.\n\nIn the beginning of the sixteenth century, an Italian adventurer visited Scotland, during the reign of James IV., and being a man of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a>, and at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> a pretender to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALCHEMY\">alchemy</a>, he contrived to insinuate himself into the favour of that gay and needy prince, by holding out hopes of augmenting his scanty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TREASURY\">treasury</a> by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACQUISITION\">acquisition</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>. He was collated by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> favour to the abbacy of Tungland in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GALLOWAY\">Galloway</a>; but not having succeeded in creating artificial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a>, he resolved, in the height of his enthusiasm, at once to gratify and astonish the courtiers, by the display of a feat still more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a>. Having constructed a set of ample wings, composed of various plumage, he undertook, from the walls of Stirling Castle, to fly through the air to France. This experiment he had actually the folly or hardihood to try, but he soon came to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>, and broke his thigh-bone by the violence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a>. For his unlucky failure, however, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABBOT\">Abbot</a> had the dexterity to draw a very plausible excuse from the wretched sophistry, termed science in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>. \"My wings,\" said the artful Italian, \"were composed of various feathers; among them were the feathers of dunghill fowls, and they, by a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYMPATHY\">sympathy</a>, were attracted to the dunghill; whereas, had my wings been composed of the feathers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAGLES\">eagles</a> alone, the same sympathy would have attracted them to the region of the air.\"\u2014This anecdote has furnished to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUNBAR\">Dunbar</a>, the Scottish poet, the subject of one of his rude Satires.\n\nA century afterwards, Fleyder, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECTOR\">rector</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAMMAR\">grammar</a>-school at T\u00fcbingen, entertained, in 1617, the worshipful magistrates of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, with a lecture on the art of flying, which he published at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAPSE\">lapse</a> of eleven years, yet prudently contented himself with barely explaining his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a>. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> monk, however, ambitious to reduce this theory into practice, having provided himself with spacious wings, took his flight from the top of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> tower; but, encountering a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> wind, his machinery misgave, and falling precipitously to the ground, he broke both his legs, and perished miserably. An <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCIDENT\">accident</a> of a similar kind is related to have happened not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> since near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIENNA\">Vienna</a>.\n\nThe impossibility of rising, or even remaining suspended in the air, by the action of any machinery impelled by human force, was first demonstrated by Borelli, a most eminent Italian mathematician and philosopher, who lived in the fertile age of discovery, and was thoroughly acquainted with the true principles of mechanics and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PNEUMATICS\">pneumatics</a>. In his celebrated and excellent work *De Motu Animalium*, published in 1670, he showed, by accurate calculation, the prodigious force which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PECTORAL\">pectoral</a> muscles of birds must exert and maintain. The same principles, applied to the structure of the human frame, proved how very disproportionate was the strength of the corresponding muscles in man. It is not, therefore, the mere difficulty of contriving and combining machinery which should perform the peculiar motions of wings, that has rendered all attempts of the kind futile, but the utter want of adequate force in the human body, to give such impulsion to those extended vanes as would be necessary for supporting so great a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> in the thin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDIUM\">medium</a> of the atmosphere.\n\nHaving found, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, the impossibility, from any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> of inherent strength, of ascending into the atmosphere, it was natural for men of ardent minds, who still pursued that dazzling project, to look for some extraneous aid among the varied powers of the elements. The notions entertained by the ancients respecting the composition of the world, might have suggested important hints for realizing the scheme of aerial navigation. The four elements\u2014<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, water, air, and fire, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ETHER\">ether</a>, arranged according to their several qualities and tendencies, were supposed to constitute this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> frame. Earth, being heavy and inert, occupies the centre of the system, and above it flowed the waters; air, from its lightness, rose upwards, and invested the globe with an atmosphere; while the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFUSE\">diffuse</a> ethereal substance soared, by its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> buoyancy, to the celestial regions, and filled with splendour their pure expanse. Every portion of these distinct elements, if transported from its place, was conceived as having a natural and constant appetency to return to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> situation. Earth and water sink downwards by their gravity, while air and fire, ended with an opposite principle, as invariably rise to the higher spaces. A portion of fire, joined to water or to air, communicates, in a corresponding degree, its levity or disposition to ascend. Thus, warm air always rises; water, subdued by excessive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, flies upwards in the form of vapour; and the volatile parts of inflamed bodies are borne to the sky in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a>.\n\nThe first person that seems to have formed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> Idea of idea of the principle on which a balloon could be constructed, was Albert of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAXONY\">Saxony</a>, a monk of the respectable order of St Augustin, who lived in the fourteenth century, and wrote a learned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMENTARY\">commentary</a> on Albert of Saxony, tenuated than air, and floats above the region of our atmosphere, this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> person conceived that a portion of such ethereal substance, inclosed in a light hollow globe, would raise it to a certain height, and keep it suspended in the sky. But the same philosopher rightly subjoined, that a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> of air introduced into the balloon, by rendering this heavier than before, would cause it to descend proportionally, in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> precisely, as water admitted through the seams of a ship, makes the vessel to sink in the ocean. It is evident that nothing was wanted for completing Montgolfier's discovery, but to carry those fine views into execution.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of Albert of Saxony were long after-","sp":287,"ep":289},{"h":"AERONAUTICS","t":"wards zealously embraced by Francis Mendoza, a Portuguese Jesuit, who died at Lyons in the course of a tour through France, in 1626, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of forty-six. He maintained that the combustible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of fire was no real obstacle to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> in balloons, since its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> levity, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCLUSION\">exclusion</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, would hinder it from supporting inflammation. Caspar Schott, a Jesuit likewise, pursued more soberly the same speculation in Germany. He stated, that no air of these lower regions is ever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> enough to produce an ascent, and that the lucid ethereal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> which swims above our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>, is alone fitted for aerial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a>. Were any super-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> power, therefore, to bring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> a store of that buoyant substance, to be inclosed in a hollow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> of wood, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> thin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>, the vessel, being furnished with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RUDDER\">rudder</a> and sails, might then, he conceived, boldly navigate the sky.\n\nSimilar notions have been renewed at different times. They were likewise often blended with the alchemical tenets, so generally received in the course of the fifteenth, sixteenth, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the seventeenth centuries. Conceiving with the ancients that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DEW\">dew</a> which falls during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>, is of celestial origin, and shed by the stars; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a> men still imagined this pure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HUMIDITY\">humidity</a> to be drawn up again to the heavens by the sun's rays, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>. Many persons, imbued with the wretched learning of that age, had the simplicity to believe that an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGG\">egg</a>-shell filled with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> dew, and placed at the foot of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LADDER\">ladder</a>, leaning against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, would, as the day advanced, spontaneously rise along the bars, and mount to the chimney-tops.\n\nThis whimsical fancy is confidently related as an observed fact, by Father Lauretus Laurus. \"Take,\" says he, very gravely, \"a goose egg, and having filled it with dew gathered fresh in the morning, expose it to the sun during the hottest part of the day, and it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> ascend, and rest suspended for a few moments.\" To perform the experiment <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a>, however, he proposed to employ the largest swan's egg, or a bag artificially prepared from the thinnest and lightest skin, into which, instead of dew, he would introduce the three alchemical elements, nitre, sulphur, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a>; and he imagined that these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> bodies, expanded and sublimed by the mere heat of the sun, must <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> powerfully upwards. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>, he thought the dove of Archytas might be constructed. But the visionary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a> had yet another scheme to advance, for effecting the ascent of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUTOMATON\">automaton</a>: He proposed to cram the cavity of the dove with highly condensed air, and was so grossly ignorant of the principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, as to suppose that this imprisoned fluid would impel the machine, in the same manner as wind does a sail. Should such a force be found not sufficiently efficacious, he finally recommended the application of fire; not, however, on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of its buoyant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>, but because of the propulsive power which it exerts. To prevent the fire from consuming the wooden machine, he recommends lining the inside with cloth of asbestos or other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INCOMBUSTIBLE\">incombustible</a> materials, and to feed and support steadily this fire, he suggested a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a>, salts, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORPIMENT\">orpiment</a>, lodged in metallic tubes, which he imagined would, at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, heighten the whole effect, by emitting a variety of musical tones like an organ.\n\nInfluenced by the same views, other authors, and particularly the famous Cardan, have proposed, for proposals aerial ascents, to apply fire acting as in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROCKET\">rocket</a>, and Fabry. Still later, but in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, Honoratus Fabry, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENITENTIARY\">penitentiary</a> of the Pope, and teacher in the Gymnasium at Rome, who died about the end of the seventeenth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, described a huge <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a>, consisting of very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> tin pipes, in which air was compressed by the vehement <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of fire below. In a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a> suspended from the machine, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> was to sit and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> the whole, by the opening or shutting of valves.\n\nThe projects and vagaries of learned men about the misty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESTORATION\">restoration</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>, were finely ridiculed by Cyrano de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BERGERAC\">Bergerac</a>, a very witty and eloquent French writer, in a philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-ROMANCE\">romance</a> entitled, The Comical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">States</a> and Kingdoms in the Sun and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">Moon</a>. This eccentric <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a>, born at Perigord in 1620, was noted for his impetuous temper and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> courage. He spent his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YOUTH\">youth</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISSIPATION\">dissipation</a> and feats of arms; but afterwards, in riper life, he quitted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> profession, and betook himself to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, which he prosecuted, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> ardour and success, till he died, at the early age of thirty-five. In his romance, from which perhaps Swift borrowed the idea of Gulliver's voyage to Laputa, Bergerac introduced a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of the Cartesian philosophy, then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> coming into vogue, but lashed severely the pedantry and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> of various pretenders to science.\n\nTo equip himself for performing the journey to the moon, the French traveller fastens round his body a multitude of very thin flasks, filled with the morning's dew. The heat of the sun, by its attractive power, exerted on the dew, raised him up to the middle region of the atmosphere, where some of his flasks happening unluckily to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAK\">break</a>, the adventurer sunk again to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>, and alighted in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CANADA\">Canada</a>. There he constructed a new machine, acting by a train of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHEELS\">wheels</a>, with which he mounted to some height, but falling down, he had the misfortune to break his leg. He crept aside, in search of ox-marrow to compose a salve, with which he instantly healed his bruises; and returning again, he found his engine in the possession of some soldiers, who had fixed to it a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of sky-rockets. Replacing himself now in the car, he applied fire to the rockets, and darted upwards with inconceivable swiftness; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> retired gradually from view, while the orb of the moon appeared proportionally to expand, till, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPHERE\">sphere</a> of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a>, he was borne softly along, and descended, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUNAR\">lunar</a> surface, into a most delicious and luxuriant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROVE\">grove</a>. Here, of course, he met with angelic personages, endowed with every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a> of body and mind, and far exalted above the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> vices, and the rancorous passions, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POISON\">poison</a> and inflame the inhabitants of this blood-stained globe. In the conversations which Bergerac held with those supernatural beings, he was informed that a native of our planet, utterly disgusted at the crimes which pollute its \"sin-worn mould,\" had once on a time provided himself with a pair of very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> and thin metallic vessels, which he filled with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a>, and sealed in the\nlight; and having attached himself below them, the buoyant power of the confined smoke carried him to the highest region of our atmosphere, where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> of the moon at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> prevailing, drew him to her surface, while the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of the machinery, by opposing resistance, served to break the force of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a>. The moment, however, those slender capacious vessels were liberated from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>, they rose again by the action of the smoke, till they reached a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDIUM\">medium</a> of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol7.html#article-DENSITY\">density</a>, and finally took their station in the bright fields of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ETHER\">ether</a>, where they form the constellation now called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">Balance</a>.\n\nIn farther discourse with his sublime instructor, our romantic voyager was shown how to obtain the power of ascension from the loadstone. He was directed to take two magnets, each about a foot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>, to roast them in the fire, to separate their impurities by solution, and thus concentrate their attractive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> in a mere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CALX\">calx</a>, which could be formed into a ball. Aided by such counsels, he now resolved to visit the sun. With much labour and perseverance, he constructed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEST\">chest</a> of very thin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a>, six feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> and three feet wide; an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ICOSAHEDRON\">icosahedron</a> of crystal, the highest of all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> solids, being fitted into the top, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> having a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-VALVE\">valve</a> which opened outwards. Into this chest he shut himself, while the sun's rays, concentrated and multiplied by reflexion from the numerous facets of the crystal, heated the air intensely, and drove a great part of it out below; and he ascended rapidly towards the glorious luminary, breathing ecstatically in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVINE\">divine</a> light, which gleamed with the richest tints of enamelled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> and purple.\u2014But it would be foreign to our purpose to follow the rest of the narrative, which, though disguised and mingled with fantastic visions, evidently contains the true principles of a\u00e9ronautics.\n\nThe most noted and elaborate scheme for navigating the atmosphere, was proposed by the Jesuit Francis Lana, in a book written in the Italian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, and printed at Brescia in 1670, with the aspiring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of Prodromo dell' arte Maestra. His project was, to procure four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a> balls of very large dimensions, yet so extremely thin, that, after the air had been extracted, they should become, in a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, specifically lighter than the surrounding medium. He entered into some calculations, to prove that the buoyant power thus obtained would be fully adequate to produce the desired effect. Yet he seems to have had only a slender knowledge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">geometry</a>, and but little acquaintance with the progress of physical science. For instance, he founds his computations entirely on the pneumatical discoveries of Galileo and Torricelli, without making any reference to those important facts which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of the air-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PUMP\">pump</a> by Otto Guerick\u00e9 had successively detected, in the course of near thirty years. He assumes that air is 640 times lighter than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>; that a cubic foot of water weighs 80 pounds, and consequently, that the weight of the same bulk of air is an ounce and a half. If we rectify the estimate of Lana, and reduce it to English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a>, each of his copper balls had about 25 feet in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a>, with the thickness of only the 225th part of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a>, the metal weighing 365 pounds avoirdupois, while the weight of the air which it contained must amount to 670 pounds, leaving, after a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VACUUM\">vacuum</a> had been formed, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a> of 305 pounds, for the power of ascension. Those four balls would, therefore, rise together into the atmosphere with a combined force of 1220 pounds, which was thought sufficient by the projector to transport a boat completely furnished with masts, sails, oars, and rudders, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> several passengers. To extract the air from their cavities, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> proposed was, to procure a Toricellian vacuum, by connecting each globe, fitted with a stop-cock, to a tube of at least thirty-five feet long; the whole being filled with pure water, and raised gently into a vertical position, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of liquid, exceeding the pressure of the atmosphere, would flow out, and subside to some point below the cock, which could then be shut.\n\nLana enumerates the different objections which might be urged against his scheme, and endeavours to answer them. He thinks that the spherical and perfectly arched form of the shell of copper would, notwithstanding its extreme thinness, enable it, after the exhaustion was effected, to sustain the enormous pressure of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> air, which, acting equally on every point of the surface, would rather tend to consolidate, than to crush or tear, the metal. As the atmosphere becomes always lighter in the upper regions, the machinery could only rise to a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIMIT\">limit</a>; and if this were found too high for easy breathing, the ascent could be regulated, by opening occasionally the cocks to admit some air into the cavity of the balls, and thus increase their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIFIC\">specific</a> gravity. There seemed to him no very great difficulty in directing and impelling the aerial bark, by means of rudders, oars, and sails; but the objection was more serious on account of the hazards of tremendous shipwreck, from the violence of winds and tempests. Yet what most alarmed the insinuating Jesuit, and which he earnestly prays God to avert, was the danger that would result, from the successful practice of the art of a\u00e9ronautics, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> of civil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, and of all human institutions. No walls or fortifications could then protect cities, which might be completely subdued or destroyed, without having the power to make any sort of resistance, by a mere handful of daring assailants, who should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> down fire and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONFLAGRATION\">conflagration</a> from the region of the clouds.\n\nSo sanguine was Lana, as to conceive, that the very moderate sum of an hundred ducats would be sufficient to defray the expense of all this huge and delicate apparatus. But his poverty, fortunately, no doubt, for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> as a man of learning, prevented him from proceeding farther than mere speculation; and none of the foreign princes, who, about that period, often squandered, like gamblers, much of their wealth, in the dark and chimerical search after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, seemed any way disposed to engage in the magnificent scheme of aerial navigation.\n\nThe project of Lana appears to have, in some degree, excited the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of the learned, though it was, at the same time, very generally condemned. Hook, Borelli, Leibnitz, and Sturmius, examined it, and severely exposed its defects. Indeed, any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> at all acquainted with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> experiment, must see that it was absolutely impracticable. Passing over other\ncircumstances; the attenuated shell of copper, from its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> and excessive thinness, could not have strength enough to support even its own weight, far less the slightest pressure of the atmosphere. The plate, however, that Lana has given, of his whole combined apparatus, appears very striking; and after Montgolfier's discovery, it could not fail to attract a greater share of notice than it was otherwise entitled to claim.\n\nSo late as the year 1755, and not very long before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> invention of balloons, a very fanciful scheme, yet on the grandest scale, for navigating the atmosphere, was published, with most circumstantial detail, in a small pamphlet, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a> Galien, a Dominican friar, and professor of philosophy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEOLOGY\">theology</a> in the papal university of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVIGNON\">Avignon</a>. This visionary proposed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLECT\">collect</a> the fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFUSE\">diffuse</a> air of the higher regions, where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIL\">hail</a> is formed, above the summit of the loftiest mountains, and to inclose it in a bag of a cubical shape, and of the most enormous dimensions, extending more than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> every way, and composed of the thickest and strongest sail-cloth. With such a vast machine, far outrivalling in boldness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a> the ark of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOAH\">Noah</a>, it would be possible, he thought, to transport a whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, and all their ammunitions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-WAR\">war</a>. But we need not stop one moment to consider a project so perfectly chimerical, which involves, besides, the erroneous supposition that the air of the upper regions is, independently of its diminished compression, essentially thinner and more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> than the air below.\n\nIt cannot fail to strike the reader, that the persons who have occupied themselves the most with attempts at aerial navigation, were all of them Catholic priests;\u2014whether this pursuit is to be explained, from their habits of seclusion and their ignorance of the affairs of real life, or from their familiar acquaintance with the relations of miracles and other legendary tales, which might lead them to see nothing very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> in the art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a> through the air. The various schemes of that kind, produced at different times, contain a few just principles, generally mixed up, however, with a large portion of absurdity. But very wide is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> from such speculations to the real <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXHIBITION\">exhibition</a> of the experiment itself.\n\nSome writers have stated, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACON\">Bacon</a> first published the true principles of aeronautics. This round assertion we cannot help noticing, because it has really no foundation, except in the propensity, fostered by indolence, which would gladly refer all the discoveries ever made to a few great names. They mistake, indeed, the character of Bacon, who seek to represent him as an inventor. His claim to immortality rests chiefly on the profound and comprehensive views which he took of the bearings of the different parts of human knowledge; for it would be difficult to point out a single fact or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> with which he enriched the store of physical science. On the contrary, being very deficient in mathematical learning, he disregarded, or rejected, some of the noblest discoveries made in his own time.\n\nWe can find only two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> in Lord Bacon's works, which can be considered as referring to aeronautics; and they both occur in that collection of loose facts and inconclusive reasonings, which he has entitled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">Natural</a> History. The first is styled, Experiment Solitary, touching Flying in the Air, and runs thus: \"Certainly many birds of good wing (as kites and the like) would bear up a good weight as they fly; and spreading feathers thin and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a>, and in great breadth, will likewise bear up a great weight, being even laid, without tilting upon the sides. The further <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of this experiment might be thought upon.\" This hint is not, in fairness, obnoxious to stricture, since the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> Bishop Wilkins, twenty years afterwards, still believed that men could acquire the art of flying. Nor was there any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> to despair, till Borelli at length demonstrated its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> impossibility.\u2014The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> passage is more diffuse, but less intelligible: It is styled, Experiment Solitary, touching the Flying of unequal Bodies in the Air. \"Let there be a body of unequal weight, (as of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a> and lead, or bone and lead), if you throw it from you with the light end forward, it will turn, and the weightier end will recover to be forwards, unless the body be over-long. The cause is, for that the more dense body hath a more violent pressure of the parts from the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPULSION\">impulsion</a>; which is the cause (though heretofore not found out, as hath been often said) of all violent motions: And when the hinder part moveth swifter (for that it less endureth pressure of parts) than the forward part can make way for it, it must needs be that the body turn over; for (turned) it can more easily draw forward the lighter part. The fact here alluded to, is the resistance that bodies <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> in moving through the air, which, depending on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of surface merely, must exert a proportionally greater effect on rare substances. The passage itself, however, after making every allowance for the period in which it was written, must be deemed confused, obscure, and unphilosophical.\n\nThat a body must remain suspended in a fluid denser than itself, was first established by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHIMEDES\">Archimedes</a>, whose propositions in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HYDROSTATICS\">hydrostatics</a> were farther extended in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> times by Stevinus, and other early mathematicians. But the principles on which a balloon could be made to rise in the atmosphere, were scarcely understood till very long afterwards, when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">chemistry</a>, near the latter part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> century, had succeeded in ascertaining the properties of the different kinds of aeriform substances. The Greeks of the lower empire knew that air is greatly dilated by warmth; and Sanctorio, the ingenious medical professor at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PADUA\">Padua</a>, by applying this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPANSION\">expansion</a>, about the year 1590, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of the thermometer, had happily placed it in a strong light. His countryman, Borelli, remarked, almost a century afterwards, that a heated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TAPER\">taper</a>, brought near one of the scales of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a>-poised balance, by exciting a vertical current, will cause it to mount up with force\u2014a fact which affords the only true explication of the numerous experiments of Buffon with the weighing of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>-hot balls, whose regular and constant results appeared to that eloquent philosopher to exhibit a conclusive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a> of the actual ponderability of heat. Yet warm air, alone and unassisted, has still no very great power of ascension, The buoyancy communicated to that fluid by\nthe distensible vapour of water, and other more volatile liquids, is in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> considerable, especially when combined at the same time with heat. But those aeriform substances, which are more elastic than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> air, display the most steady and powerful tendency to rise in the atmosphere. Such, in a remarkable degree, is the hydrogen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAS\">gas</a>, owing, probably, to the expansive force communicated by the very large share of heat which is embodied with it.\n\nLightness of The late most ingenious and accurate Mr Cavendish, in 1766, found, by a nice observation, this fluid to be at least seven times lighter than atmospheric air. It therefore occurred to Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">Black</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, that a very thin bag, filled with hydrogen gas, would rise to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CEILING\">ceiling</a> of a room. He provided, accordingly, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALLANTOIS\">allantois</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CALF\">calf</a>, with the view of showing, at a public lecture, such a curious experiment before his numerous auditors; but, owing to some unforeseen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCIDENT\">accident</a> or imperfection, it chanced to fail, and that celebrated professor, whose infirm state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> or indolent temper, more than once allowed the finest discoveries, when almost within reach, to escape his penetration, did not attempt to repeat the exhibition, or seek to pursue the project any farther. Several years afterwards, a similar idea occurred to Mr Cavallo, who found, however, that bladders, though carefully scraped, are too heavy, and that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHINA\">China</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERMEABLE\">permeable</a> to the gas. It is rather singular that he did not think of gold-beater's skin, which had, for like purposes, been recommended, two centuries before, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAMMARIAN\">grammarian</a> Joseph Scaliger, and some other writers. But, in 1782, this ingenious person succeeded with the pretty experiment of elevating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOAP\">soap</a>-bubbles, by inflating them with hydrogen gas.\n\nTo construct an aeronautic machine, it is only required, therefore, to provide a thin bag, of sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a>, and to fill it with hydrogen gas, or with air which is kept in a rarified state. The form and strength of the material are not so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> as in Lana's project, since it here suffers an equal pressure on both its outer and its inner side. Nor is it an absolute condition that the substance of the bag should be quite impervious to the gas or confined air; though such a defect, by allowing the partial escape of the buoyant fluid, must inevitably diminish the vigour, and abridge the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> of the power of the balloon's ascent. This power is evidently the excess of the weight of an equal bulk of atmospheric air above the aggregate weight of the included gas, joined to that of the bag, and of all its appendages: In other words, the final power of ascent is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between the weight of the included gas and of that of an equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of external air, farther diminished by the weight of the whole apparatus. But, supposing the form of the balloon to remain the same, this counteracting load, as it depends on the quantity of surface contained in the bag, must be proportioned to the square of the diameter; whereas the difference between the internal and external volume of fluid, which constitutes the whole of the buoyant force, increases in a faster <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a>, being proportioned to the capacity of the bag, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUBE\">cube</a> of its diameter. It hence follows, that however small the excess may be of the specific gravity of the external air above that of the collected fluid, there must always exist some corresponding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIMENSION\">dimension</a> which would enable a balloon to mount in the atmosphere.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of aeronautics, considered in its detail, includes three distinct things: First, The power of a balloon to rise through the air: Second, The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a> of its ascent: And Third, The stability of its suspension at any given height in the atmosphere. These <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> we shall examine separately.\n\nI. The buoyant force of balloons. Since balloons in their shape generally approach to the spherical form, it will be more convenient to ground our calculations on that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>. A globe of common air at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, and of the mean density and temperature, is found to weigh about the 25th part of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> avoirdupois. Consequently, if a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> Buoyancy vacuum could be procured, a balloon of ten feet diameter must rise with a force of 40 pounds; one of twenty feet diameter, with that of 320 pounds; and a balloon of thirty feet in diameter would mount in the atmosphere with the power of 1080 pounds;\u2014thus augmenting always in the ratio of the cube of the diameters. But air expands by heat about the 450th from Heat; part of its bulk, for each degree on Fahrenheit's scale. Supposing, therefore, that the air included within the bag were heated 50 degrees, which is as much perhaps as could be well supported, it would follow that one-ninth part of this fluid would be driven out by the warmth, and consequently, that the tendency of the balloon to rise upwards would be equal only to the ninth part of the entire power of ascension. Were it possible to maintain a heat of 75 degrees within the balloon, the buoyant force would yet exceed not the sixth part of the absolute ascensional power.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DILATATION\">dilatation</a> which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a> of humidity communicates to air, will, during fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, amount generally to one-eightieth part, though it may sometimes reach to more than the double of this quantity. But, in the tropical regions, such dilatation will commonly exceed the twentieth part of the volume of fluid. Hence moist air thrown into a bag, likewise wetted, and sufficiently large, would cause it to rise in the atmosphere. To succeed, however, in this way, the balloon constructed of coarse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol13.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> would require enormous dimensions; not less than three hundred feet in diameter.\n\nBut it is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNION\">union</a> of heat and moisture, that gives from Heat to air the greatest expansion. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> smoke, joined to which the balloons are filled on Montgolfier's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>, was found, by computation, to be at least one-third specifically lighter than the external air. This purer sort of smoke is scarcely anything but air itself <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> with vapour, being produced by the burning of chopped straw, or vine twigs, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRAZIER\">brazier</a>, under the orifice of the bag. It would have required no fewer than 150 degrees of heat alone to cause the same extent of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAREFACTION\">rarefaction</a>.\n\nWe have therefore sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATA\">data</a> for calculating the buoyant force of the common fire, or rather smoke, balloons. This force, being estimated about 12\u00bd pounds avoirdupois when the diameter of the bag is ten feet, would amount to 1562\u00bd pounds if the diameter were fifty feet, and to 12,500 pounds if it were a hundred feet. The weight of the linen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> may be reckoned at two-fifths of a pound, for a sphere\nof one foot in diameter. Consequently, a balloon of ten feet diameter would, without its appendages weigh 40 pounds; one of fifty feet diameter 1000 pounds; and one of a hundred feet diameter 4000 pounds. Such a balloon of ten feet diameter, would need 27\u00bd pounds to make it rise; but one of fifty feet diameter would ascend with a force of 562\u00bd pounds, and one of a hundred feet diameter would exert an ascending power of not less than 8500 pounds. There is besides to be deducted the weight of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CORDAGE\">cordage</a>, the car, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALLAST\">ballast</a>, and the passengers. It would require, on these estimates, a diameter of 33\u00bd feet, to procure merely an equilibrium between the weight of the canvas and the buoyant force of the rarified air.\n\nThe hydrogen gas obtained from the action of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol8.html#article-DILUTE\">dilute</a> sulphuric acid upon iron filings is only six times lighter than atmospheric air; but the gas evolved during the solution of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZINC\">zinc</a> in that acid is not less than twelve times lighter than the standard fluid. The ordinary way of examining the specific gravity of the different gases requires a very delicate operation of weighing with the most exquisite balance\u2014a serious difficulty, which long retarded our knowledge of their comparative densities. In one of the notes to his Treatise on Heat, Professor Leslie has pointed out a very simple method, founded on the principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PNEUMATICS\">pneumatics</a>, for discovering the relative specific gravities of the aeriform fluids. This consists in observing the time that a given portion of the gas, under a determinate pressure, takes to escape through a very small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APERTURE\">aperture</a>. The density of the gaseous fluid must be inversely as the square of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> elapsed. Thus, the hydrogen gas, procured from zinc, but without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEPURATION\">depuration</a>, was found, under a pressure of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> of water, to flow thrice as fast as atmospheric air. This experiment is very striking, and requires no more apparatus than a cylindrical glass jar, open below, and surmounted by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>, terminating in a fine tubular orifice.\n\nOn a very moderate supposition, therefore, and after making every allowance for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> operation, we may consider the hydrogen gas which fills a balloon as six times lighter than the like bulk of common air. Consequently, such a balloon must exert five-sixths of the whole buoyant force corresponding to its capacity, or will have a tendency to mount in the atmosphere, that is equal to the thirtieth part of a pound avoirdupois for a globe of one foot diameter. A spherical balloon of fifteen feet diameter would hence have a buoyancy of 112\u00bd pounds; one of thirty feet, 900 pounds; and one of sixty feet, no less than 7200 pounds. But thin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SILK\">silk</a>, varnished with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAOUTCHOUC\">caoutchouc</a> or elastic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUM\">gum</a>, to render it impervious to air, is found to weigh only the twentieth part of a pound, when formed into a globe of one foot diameter. A silk balloon of fifteen feet diameter would hence weigh 11\u00bd pounds; one of thirty feet diameter, 45 pounds; and one of sixty feet diameter, 180 pounds. Therefore, the power of ascension exerted by such balloons would, in pounds avoirdupois, be respectively 101\u00be, 855, and 7020. It follows, also, that a balloon of a foot and a half in diameter would barely float in the atmosphere, the weight of its varnished silk being then exactly balanced by the buoyant effort of the body of hydrogen gas.\n\nBut the calculations now given would, in strictness, require a small modification. The weight of the bag and of all the appendages, must evidently compress the included gas, and thereby render it in some degree denser. To compute this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> effect, we have only to consider, that the pressure of a column of atmosphere, at the mean temperature, and near the level of the sea, is 1632 pounds, on a circle of a foot diameter. Thus, in the large balloon of sixty feet diameter, if we suppose the whole load to have been 6000 pounds, the compression of the bag would only amount to five-thirds of a pound, for each circle of a foot diameter in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">section</a>, or correspond to the 979th part of the entire pressure of the atmosphere. But the weight of the confined gas being 1200 pounds, its buoyancy must have suffered a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIMINUTION\">diminution</a> of somewhat more than a pound, or 1\u00bd, from the incumbrance opposed to it. This correction is therefore a mere theoretical nicety, which may be totally disregarded in practice.\n\nII. The next circumstance to be considered in Celestia a\u00e9ronautics is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CELERITY\">celerity</a> with which balloons make their ascent. It is obvious that the efficient power of ascension, or the excess of the whole buoyant force above the absolute weight of the apparatus, would, by acting constantly, produce always an accelerated motion. But this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCELERATION\">acceleration</a> is very soon checked, and a uniform progress maintained, by the increasing resistance which the huge mass must experience in its passage through the air. The velocity which a balloon would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> from unobstructed acceleration, must, from the theory of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DYNAMICS\">dynamics</a>, be to that which a falling body acquires in the same time, as the efficient buoyancy is to the aggregate weight of the apparatus and of the contained fluid. Thus, if the balloon were to rise with a force equal to the eighth part of its compound weight, the celerity resulting from a constant acceleration, would be expressed, by multiplying four feet into the number of seconds elapsed since it was launched into the air. Its accelerating advance, however, being opposed, the balloon may, to all appearance, attain, though still affected with partial oscillations, the final velocity in perhaps little more than double the time required without such obstruction.\n\nThis final velocity, or the velocity at which the ascent becomes uniform, the resistance from the air being then equal to the efficient buoyancy of the balloon, is easily calculated. The resistance a circle encounters in moving through any fluid in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a>, is measured by the weight of a column of that fluid, having the circle for its base, and an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ALTITUDE\">altitude</a> equal to the height from which a heavy body in falling would acquire the given celerity. But near the level of the sea, and at the mean temperature, a column of atmospheric air 17 feet high, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCUMBENT\">incumbent</a> on a circle of one foot diameter, weighs a pound avoirdupois; which is therefore the resistance that such a circle would suffer, if carried forwards with the celerity of 33 feet each second. According to the same theory, however, which we owe to the sagacity of Newton, the resistance of a sphere is just the half of that of its generating circle, and consequently a velocity of 46\u00bd feet...\nin a second through the air would, in ordinary cases, create a resistance of one pound to a ball of one foot diameter. In other circumstances, the quantity of resistance must be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to the squares of the velocities and of the diameters. Whence, if the buoyant force were always the same, the velocity of the ascent of a balloon would be inversely as its diameter.\n\nSuppose a balloon to have thirty feet in diameter, and an ascensional power of 100 pounds. This effort is evidently the same as the ninth part of a pound for a globe of a foot diameter, and would therefore be counterbalanced by the resistance corresponding to a velocity of $46\\frac{2}{3}$ divided by 3, the square root of 9, or $15\\frac{1}{3}$ feet each second. The balloon would therefore reach the altitude of a mile in about six minutes. Its accelerating force being only the sixteenth part of its total weight, it might have acquired the uniform motion of ascent in twenty seconds, or before it had attained the height of 200 feet. This example differs very little from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a>, and the method of computation will easily be transferred to other cases.\n\nBut the resistance of the air assigned by theory is, from the circumstances omitted in the simplification of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a>, generally somewhat less than the results of observation. In low velocities, this difference amounts seldom to the fifth part of the whole effect; but, in the high velocities, it increases considerably, exceeding even the third part, in certain extreme cases. From the numerous and accurate experiments of Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol6.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> Hutton, we may, however, deduce a simple formula, for expressing the terminal velocity of balloons, or the celerity of their uniform ascent. Let $a$ denote the diameter of the balloon, in English feet, and $f$ its ascensional power, measured in pounds avoirdupois; then $\\frac{40}{a} \\sqrt{f}$ will very nearly represent, in feet, the velocity each second of its regular ascent, or that velocity which would cause a resistance from the air, precisely equal to the buoyant force. Or, to express the rule in words: As the diameter of the balloon in feet is to the constant number 40, so is the square root of the ascensional power in pounds to the terminal, or uniform velocity of ascent each second. To illustrate the application of the formula by an easy example; suppose the balloon to have a diameter of 60 feet, with an accelerating power of 144 pounds; the corresponding rate of uniform ascent becomes\n\n$$\\frac{40}{60} \\sqrt{144}, \\text{ or } \\frac{2}{3} \\times 12, \\text{ that is, } 8 \\text{ feet each second, or about a mile in eleven minutes.}$$\n\nIII. The last point which demands attention in aeronautics is, The stability of the suspension of a balloon at any given height in the atmosphere. The circumstances which might regulate or determine that stability, requiring some little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of thought, have been commonly neglected, and very seldom examined with due care. It will be proper to consider, first, the fire or smoke balloons, and second, the balloons filled with hydrogen gas.\n\n1. The warm humidified air of the balloon constructed after Montgolfier's plan, suffering less external compression as it approaches the upper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRATA\">strata</a> of the atmosphere, must at the same time necessarily expand, and partly escape by the orifice above the brasier. The weight of the included fluid, and that of the part expelled, constituting its buoyant force, will hence be reduced, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to the diminished density of the medium in which it floats. The balloon will continue to ascend, till its enfeebled buoyancy is no longer able to support the incumbent load. At the height of a mile above the surface, the power of ascension would be diminished rather more than one-fifth part, but, at an altitude of three miles and a half, it would be reduced to one-half. At the ordinary temperature, this buoyancy would suffer a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> of the hundredth part, for each ascent of 278 feet. Resuming the data formerly stated, and supposing the balloon to have a spherical shape; its actual power of ascension, estimated in pounds avoirdupois, will be denoted by $\\frac{a^3}{80}$ where $a$ signifies the diameter in feet; or the cube of the diameter divided by the constant number 80. If $m:n$ express the ratio of atmospheric density at the surface, and at any given height; then will $\\frac{n}{m} \\frac{a^3}{80}$ denote the diminished buoyant force at that altitude.\n\nWe shall select, for example, a balloon of 100 feet diameter, which is one of the largest dimensions ever actually constructed. Near the level of the sea, and at the ordinary temperature, its power of ascension would be 12,500 pounds; but, at the height of 8000 feet, or somewhat more than a mile and a half, when the density is diminished one-fourth, or $\\frac{n}{m} = \\frac{3}{4}$, that power becomes reduced to $\\frac{3}{4} \\times 12,500$, or 9375 pounds, being a deficiency of 3125 pounds. On the supposition that the balloon was at first so much loaded as to rest just suspended at the ground, a ballast of 3125 must have been thrown out, to make it rise to the altitude of a mile and a half. Hence, also, the rejection of 125 pounds would have been sufficient to give the balloon an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELEVATION\">elevation</a> of 278 feet. For the same reason, 10 pounds of ballast heaved out would raise it 22 feet at the surface, 29 feet at the height of a mile and a half, and 44 feet at that of three miles and a half.\n\n2. The stability of the suspension of balloons filled with hydrogen gas must depend on principles which charged with Hydrogen Gas, are very different, and less marked. In these aeronaumatic machines, after the gas has been once introduced, it is closely shut up; and, therefore, having constantly the same absolute weight, it should likewise, in all situations, exert the same buoyant force. Hence, if the balloon were capable of indefinite extension, it would still continue its ascent through unbounded space. The determinate capacity of the bag alone can oppose limits to its rise in the atmosphere. The upper strata being rarer than those below, will have less power to keep any given bulk suspended; and the actual buoyancy, being diminished from that cause, the balloon will find its station at a corresponding height in the diffuse medium. But\nthis diminution of the buoyant force, and the consequent increase in the density of the hydrogen gas, must necessarily be confined within very moderate limits; otherwise the thin silk case would be torn to shreds by the expansive efforts of the imprisoned fluid. A safety-valve is accordingly placed at the top of the balloon, calculated to give vent to the gas, before the distention has become such as to endanger the bursting of the case.\n\nA balloon should not at first be filled completely with hydrogen gas, but allowed to begin its ascent in rather a flaccid state. As it mounts into the rarer atmosphere, it will gradually swell, till it has attained its full distention, when the safety valve may come to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a>. But such dissipation of the gas ought, by a previous arrangement, to be as much as possible avoided. If the balloon were intended to rise to the height of four miles, it would not be requisite to fill more than half its capacity with the elastic fluid. To push the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> any farther in this case, would only occasion a superfluous waste of materials. By throwing out part of his ballast, the a\u00e9ronaut may raise himself higher, and by opening the valve to permit some of the imprisoned gas to escape, he may descend again; but both those expedients are attended by a wasteful expenditure of power.\n\nIt is evident that a balloon can have no stability of equipoise, so long as it remains in a loose or flaccid state. The slightest action would then be sufficient to make it rise or fall, since, under such circumstances, any change of its station could not in the smallest degree affect the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of its buoyant force. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> elevation to which the balloon will ascend, must be determined by its quantity of ballast, combined with the regulation of the safety-valve; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRAIN\">strain</a> of the silk case itself would be sufficient to confine the ascent within certain limits, and to procure the stability of the floating mass. Thus, if a balloon, fully distended, had yet a slight disposition to rise, the imprisoned gas, suffering more and more compression as it gradually ascends, would become proportionally denser, and therefore lose a corresponding part of its previous buoyancy. An equilibrium would hence soon obtain, which must <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARREST\">arrest</a> the floating machine at a determinate height in the atmosphere.\n\nSuppose a balloon to be capable, without any danger of bursting, of sustaining an expansion equal to the hundredth part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTICITY\">elasticity</a> of the included fluid; the whole buoyancy would, by such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a>, be diminished one five hundredth part, or this floating machine would subside 55 feet near the surface, and sink proportionally more in the upper regions. To produce the effect, it would only be requisite to throw common air into the bag, without suffering any portion of the hydrogen gas to escape. On this principle, Meunier, an ingenious French chemist, very soon after the first discovery of balloons, proposed to regulate, with nicety, their ascent and position of equilibrium in the atmosphere. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> which he suggested, was to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> within the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> balloon a much smaller one, to be filled occasionally with common air by help of bellows, or emptied again by opening an exterior valve. The a\u00e9ronaut would thus have it in his power, without depending the charge of hydrogen gas, either to sink gently through a short space, or to rise again at will, by inflating the inner balloon, or allowing it to collapse. The adjustment of the height of a balloon could hence be managed with great precision.\n\nThe command possessed by the a\u00e9ronaut of raising or depressing his machine at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>, might afford him the means of influencing the direction of its course. From the various motions of the several ranges of clouds, we may infer that different currents exist at the same time in the atmosphere. The a\u00e9ronaut has, therefore, in his ascent, only to seek the current best suited to his purpose, and, taking his station in that stratum, to commit his flimsy vessel to the guidance of the stream.\n\nAny other attempts to direct or control the flight of a balloon, are altogether fallacious. Since applying sails or rudders or sails can have any action whatever. The a\u00e9ronaut might fancy himself to float in a perfect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CALM\">calm</a>, unless he chances to encounter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> currents. The application of oars may turn a balloon, but can have no sensible effect in diverting or impelling its course. How vastly disproportionate is the force of the human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARM\">arm</a> to the overwhelming pressure of the wind against so huge a machine! To adapt machinery under these circumstances would be preposterous, and to look for help from such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> is visionary in the extreme. It must be admitted, however, that after a balloon has once gained its station of equilibrium, or passively floats in the air, the vigorous action of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> vanes, downwards or upwards, might serve to raise or depress the machine through a small space. Thus, a vertical force, exerted equal to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> pounds, would lift a balloon, of thirty feet in diameter, 278 feet higher. The application of ballast is hence infinitely preferable to any such bulky and unmanageable apparatus.\n\nAt the period where we left our narrative, the principles on which a balloon could be constructed, were therefore pretty generally known to men of science. But to reduce these principles to complete effect, was still an enterprise of the most dazzling kind. This experiment seemed unfit for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CABINET\">cabinet</a> or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LABORATORY\">laboratory</a>, and it could succeed only on a large scale, exposed to the gaze of the multitude. Without the toil of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>, or indeed any exercise of thought, all the world might <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WITNESS\">witness</a> the result, and admire the magnificent spectacle which it would present. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIUMPH\">triumph</a> over matter was at length achieved by the skill and perseverance of Stephen and Joseph Montgolfier, sons of the proprietor of an extensive and very celebrated paper manufactory established at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANNONAY\">Annonay</a>, on the banks of a rivulet which flows into the Rh\u00f4ne, near forty miles below Lyons. These remarkable persons, though bred in a remote <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCIAL\">provincial</a> town, possessed, in a high degree, ingenuity and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of observation. Without having the benefit of a liberal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>, their active curiosity had led them to acquire a more extensive and accurate stock of knowledge than is usually found in the same condition of life. Stephen was more attached to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol1.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a>, but Joseph directed his studies chiefly to chemistry and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\">natural philosophy</a>. They were asso-","sp":289,"ep":296},{"h":"AERONAUTICS","t":"cated in business with their father, who passed his quiet days, like a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRIARCH\">patriarch</a>, amidst a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, and a numerous body of workmen, and reached the very advanced <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of 93. Of the younger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>, who survived the other, and lived to make the very valuable, yet much neglected, discovery of the Hydraulic Ram, we may venture to speak from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> acquaintance. He was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a> and simplicity of character, yet firm and undaunted, of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CALM\">calm</a> and sedate aspect; tall and athletic in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a>, and of a swarthy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a>, not unlike the celebrated Mr Watt, whom he resembled in some other particulars of his fortune. He was too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a>, perhaps, to succeed in the details of business, for after trying various schemes of improvement, he quitted his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> manufactory and repaired to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a>, where he obtained a situation of trust under the late <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERIAL\">Imperial</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, at the Chamber of Models, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSPECTOR\">inspector</a> of patents and internal improvements. In 1809 he had a stroke of palsy, which induced him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a> to the waters of Bourbonne; but receiving no benefit from them, he gladly preferred those of Barlaruc, near his old friends, where he died <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the 26th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> in the following year, at the age of 60.\n\nThe two brothers, who were accustomed to form their plans in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONCERT\">concert</a>, had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> contemplated the floating and ascent of clouds in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>. It seemed to them, that a sort of fictitious cloud, formed of very thin vapour, inclosed in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> bag of immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIZE\">size</a>, would mount to the higher regions. In pursuit of this idea, they selected a fluid specifically lighter than atmospheric <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>; and, accordingly, introduced hydrogen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAS\">gas</a> into large bags of paper and of thin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SILK\">silk</a>, which rose up, as had been expected, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CEILING\">ceiling</a>, but fell <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> in a few seconds, owing to the rapid escape of the gas through the cracks and pores of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a>. This great facility with which hydrogen gas makes its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> through any substance of a loose and incompact <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEXTURE\">texture</a>, is partly due to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> fluidity, but is chiefly occasioned by its strong and obstinate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> air. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of preventing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> at least checking that escape, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> of a proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VARNISH\">varnish</a>, was yet unknown. The prospect was so discouraging, that our experimenters had recourse to another scheme, more analogous to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a>, and it rewarded their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> efforts with the most complete success. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of November 1782, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a> Montgolfier, happening, in the course of his frequent excursions, to be then at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVIGNON\">Avignon</a>, procured a small silk bag, of the form of a parallelopipedon, open below, like a lady's hoop, and having a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a> of about forty-five cubic feet; under its orifice he burnt some paper, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a>, with inexpressible transport, the bag quickly swell, and mount rapidly to the height of seventy-five feet, where it remained, till by cooling it lost its buoyancy. Returning to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANNONAY\">Annonay</a>, he communicated the happy result to his brother, and it was resolved by them to prosecute the experiment on a larger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a>. Having provided a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of coarse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol13.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a>, they formed it into the shape of a globe, about thirty feet in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a>, which they lined with paper. On lighting a fire within its cavity, to warm and expand the air, they had the delightful satisfaction of seeing the bag ascend, with a force <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to 500 pounds.\n\nIt was very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a>, that the brothers should now desire an occasion, for exhibiting this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> experiment in their native town. They invited the members of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCIAL\">provincial</a> meeting of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">States</a> of the Vivarais, then assembled at Annonay, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WITNESS\">witness</a> the first public aerial ascent. On the 5th June 1783, amidst a vast concourse of spectators, the spherical bag Ascend of a Balloon, consisting of different pieces of linen, merely buttoned together, was suspended from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> poles; two men kindled a fire under it, and kept feeding the flames with small bundles of chopped straw; the loose bag gradually swelled, assuming a graceful form, and, in the space of five minutes, it was completely distended, and made such an effort to escape, that eight men were required to hold it down. On a signal being given, the stays were slipped, and the balloon instantly rose with an accelerating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, till it reached some height, when its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a> continued uniform, and carried it to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELEVATION\">elevation</a> of more than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILE\">mile</a>. All was admiration and transport. Amidst the shouts of unbounded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCLAMATION\">acclamation</a>, the progress of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> cloud retiring from sight arrested every eye. It was hurried along by the wind; but, its buoyant force being soon spent, it remained suspended only ten minutes, and fell gently in a vineyard, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> of about a mile and a half from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of its ascension. So memorable a feat lighted up the glow of national vanity, and the two Montgolfiers were hailed and exalted by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPONTANEOUS\">spontaneous</a> impulse of their fellow-citizens.\n\nOf this splendid experiment, a very hasty and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> was transmitted to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, and quickly circulated over <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. In those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HALCYON\">halcyon</a> days, during the transient calm of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> turmoils, and the happy absence of all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> events, the prospect of navigating the atmosphere excited a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERMENT\">ferment</a>, and engrossed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVERSATION\">conversation</a> of all ranks. Yet the tale appeared so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a>, as to leave some doubts of its veracity. In many places, and especially in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, the more ignorant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a> of men, and those who affected superior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>, both agreed in considering the relation of Montgolfier's discovery as nothing but an imposition practised on the public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-CREDULITY\">credulity</a>. To dispel the suspicions which infected the subject, it was necessary to repeat the experiment in every large capital.\n\nWhen the intelligence of the first ascent of a balloon reached St Petersburgh, it found the venerable Euler in a state of great debility, worn out with years and unremitting intellectual toil. Having lost, in the middle of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CAREER\">career</a>, the sight of an eye, he had been, for several years, visited with total <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BLINDNESS\">blindness</a>. But, in this afflicting situation, his mind was still entire, and found delightful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> in his former habits of calculation. It was in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TRAINING\">training</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> as his amanuensis, that this great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> now condescended to dictate, in the German <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, to his humble pupil, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of the highest merit.\u2014The Elements of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALGEBRA\">Algebra</a>. During his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> illness, Euler made an expiring effort, and applied his favourite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a> to determine the ascending motion of a bal-\nHe dictated the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRELIMINARY\">preliminary</a> steps of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a> to one of his grandchildren; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> was already stretched over the patriarch\u2014no farther could he proceed with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>\u2014and composing himself for nobler scenes, he calmly expected the moment of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a>.\n\nThe virtuosi at Paris were eager to repeat the experiment of the ascension of a balloon. M. Faujas de St Fond, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> and zealous naturalist, set on foot a subscription for defraying the expense, which was soon filled up. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of the machine was entrusted to the skill of two brothers of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of Robert, under the superintendence of M. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol6.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a>, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> lecturer in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\">natural <a class=\"</a>xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>. It had at first been proposed merely to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of Montgolfier, but Charles preferred the application of hydrogen gas; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> which afterwards occasioned much difficulty and delay. The balloon consisted of thin silk or tiffany, varnished with a solution of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUM\">gum</a>, disposed into a globular shape, of about thirteen feet in diameter. The hydrogen gas was procured from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol8.html#article-DILUTE\">dilute</a> sulphuric acid upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>-filings, and was introduced through leaden pipes. But this gas, being rapidly formed, without having been made to pass through a body of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, entered the cavity of the balloon excessively hot, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> with acid fumes, which afterwards condensed against the inside of the bag, injuring its texture, and loading it with superfluous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HUMIDITY\">humidity</a>. Not fewer than 500 pounds of sulphuric acid were used, and twice this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of iron filings. Yet several days were spent in abortive attempts to fill the balloon completely. At last it rose, and was kept suspended at the height of 100 feet above the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>. In this state, it was conveyed with acclamations to the Place des Victoires, where it rested, and underwent some repair. About midnight, it was thence transported in silent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROCESSION\">procession</a>, preceded by torch lights, and guarded by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DETACHMENT\">detachment</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> and foot soldiers, to the Champ de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARS\">Mars</a>, at the distance of near two miles. The few passengers found at that still <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> on the streets, gazed with astonishment at the floating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>, and the very coachmen, filled with a sort of awe, respectfully saluted it as they passed.\n\nNext <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, being the 27th of August 1783, an immense concourse of people, covered the Champ de Mars, and innumerable spectators had planted themselves along the banks of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEINE\">Seine</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMPHITHEATRE\">amphitheatre</a> of Passy. By three o'clock, every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVENUE\">avenue</a> was filled with carriages, and all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> and fashion of Paris flocked towards the Ecole Militaire. The preparations being finished, a cannon was discharged, as the signal of ascent. The balloon, liberated from its stays, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a> upwards with such rapidity, as in two minutes to reach, according to calculation, the height of 3000 feet, where it seemed lost in a dark cloud; it reappeared at a greater elevation, but was soon obscured again amidst other clouds; and after performing a flight of about fifteen miles, in the space of three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of an hour, it sunk to the ground in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a> near Ecouen, where the peasants secured it, having noticed a rent in the upper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the bag, to which its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> might be imputed. The success of the experiment was complete. The incredulous were sadly mortified; but every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINOR\">minor</a> reflection was drowned in the tumult of excessive joy and exultation.\n\nIt began to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> immediately after the balloon was launched, yet this unlucky circumstance had no effect to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABATE\">abate</a> the curiosity of the spectators. Regardless of the torrents that fell, they were wholly absorbed, in following with eager gaze the progress of the machine through the air. Even elegant ladies, dressed in their finest attire, stood exposed, looking intently the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, and were drenched to the skin. This small balloon weighed only thirty pounds, and had at first a buoyant force of forty pounds avoirdupois.\n\nIf we employ the formula before given, the terminal velocity would be $\\frac{40}{13} \\sqrt{40} = 19\\frac{6}{13}$ feet in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, or 1168 feet each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a>; which appears to correspond very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> with fact.\n\nAbout this time, Joseph Montgolfier visited Paris, and was invited by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> Academy of Sciences, to repeat his experiment of Annonay on a larger scale. He constructed, with coarse linen and a paper lining, a balloon of a pear shape, and Paris, about forty-three feet wide and seventy-five feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a> of fifty pounds of dry straw, in small bundles, joined to that of twelve pounds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a>, was found sufficient to fill it, in the space of ten minutes. The bag duly swelled, and made an effort to rise, equivalent to the weight of 500 pounds; but being reserved for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXHIBITION\">exhibition</a> the next day, it was totally destroyed, by its exposure, during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>, to incessant and violent rain. It became necessary, therefore, to prepare another balloon, and such was the expedition of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol3.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a>, that in five days he got the whole completed. Early on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> of the 19th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEPTEMBER\">September</a>, it was placed upon an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCTAGON\">octagon</a> scaffold, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSAILLES\">Versailles</a>. It had a very showy appearance, being painted with ornaments in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> colours. By ten o'clock, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> from Paris was crowded with carriages of all descriptions. Every person of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> or fashion, hurried from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a> to view the experiment; ladies of distinguished <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> filled the windows; and the spacious courts and walks, and even the tops of the houses, were covered with impatient spectators. The royal family and their attendants came forth, and examined the details of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a>. About one o'clock, the discharge of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTAR\">mortar</a> gave notice that the filling of the balloon was to commence. In eleven minutes, another discharge announced, that it was completely inflated; and on the third discharge of the mortar, the cords were cut, and the balloon instantly liberated. After balancing at first in a moment of anxious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a> to the spectators, it rose majestically, in an oblique <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>, under the impulse of the wind, till it reached the height of 1500 feet, where it appeared for a while suspended, but in the space of eight minutes it dropped to the ground, at the distance of two miles from the point of its ascent. A sheep, a cock, and a duck, which had been put into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BASKET\">basket</a>, the first animals ever carried up into the air, were found perfectly safe and unhurt by the journey, and the sheep even feeding at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> ease.\n\nThis successful experiment encouraged Montgolfier to prepare, on a more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> construction, another balloon, of a spheroidal form, 45 feet wide, and 75\nfeet high. While it was filling with smoke, Pilatre de Rozier, a young naturalist, of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a>, and full of ardour and courage, leaped into the car, and was borne up to the height of 300 feet, where he continued some minutes suspended, the balloon being held down by long cords till it gently descended. The dangers of navigating the balloon being thus brought to a more correct estimate, it was resolved speedily to attempt the daring but sublime experiment. The badness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, however, at this late season of the year, made the project be deferred several days. At last, on the 21st of November, every thing was ready for the ascent in the spacious gardens of the chateau of Muette, belonging to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of the Dauphin. The sky had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOWERING\">lowering</a> aspect, being loaded with heavy clouds, driven about by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> winds. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ADVENTURERS\">adventurers</a> were not to be easily discouraged.\n\nAfter a first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>, which had nearly proved fatal to them, the balloon was again filled; and Rozier, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARQUIS\">Marquis</a> d'Arlandes, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJOR\">major</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANTRY\">infantry</a>, who had volunteered to accompany him, took their seats in the car, having a store of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALLAST\">ballast</a>, and a provision of straw to supply the fire. About two o'clock, the machine was launched, and it mounted with a steady and majestic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PACE\">pace</a>. Wonder, mingled with anxiety, was depicted in every countenance; but when, from their lofty station in the sky, the navigators calmly waved their hats, and saluted the spectators below, a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHOUT\">shout</a> of acclamation burst forth on all sides. As they rose much higher, however, they were no longer discernible by the naked eye.\n\nThis balloon soared to an elevation of more than 3000 feet, and traversed, by a circuitous and irregular course, the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of Paris, whose gay inhabitants were all absorbed in admiration and amazement.\n\nA curious circumstance occurred during the passage of the floating mass: To the gazers planted on the towers of the metropolitan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> of Notre Dame, it chanced to intercept the body of the sun, and thus gave them, for a few seconds, the spectacle of a total <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECLIPSE\">eclipse</a>.\u2014It has been alleged, that when the balloon had reached so high, that the objects on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> were no longer distinguishable, the Marquis d'Arlandes began to think that his curiosity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-AMBITION\">ambition</a> were sufficiently gratified. He was therefore anxious to descend, and murmured against his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a>, who still kept feeding the fire. At last, on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEARING\">hearing</a> some cracks from the top of the balloon, and observing holes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> in the sides, the Major became outrageously alarmed at his imminent danger, and applying wet sponges to stop the progress of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMBUSTION\">combustion</a>, he compelled the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a> to desist from his officious operations. As they now descended too fast, however, M. d'Arlandes was not less anxious and diligent in throwing fresh straw upon the fire, in order to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> such an elevation, as would clear the different obstacles. The navigators dexterously avoided the lofty buildings of Paris, by supplying <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol10.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a> as occasion required; and, after a journey of 20 or 25 minutes, they safely alighted beyond the Boulevards, having described a track of six miles.\n\nSuch was the prosperous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> of the first aerial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a> ever achieved by mortals. It was a conquest of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> which all the world could understand; and it flattered extremely the vanity of that ingenious people, who hailed its splendid progress, and enjoyed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIUMPH\">triumph</a>. The Montgolfiers had the annual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIZE\">prize</a> of six hundred livres adjudged to them by the Academy of Sciences; the elder brother was invited to Court, decorated with the badge of St Michael, and received a patent of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a>; and on Joseph a pension was bestowed, with the further sum of forty thousand livres, to enable him to prosecute his experiments with balloons.\n\nThe facility and success, however, of the smoke, or fire balloons, appeared to throw into the shade the attempts made by the application of hydrogen gas. M. Charles, the promoter of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>, was keenly reproached by M. Faujas de St Fond, for departing from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> practised by the original inventor; and he was moreover, with his associates the Roberts, held up to public derision in the smaller theatres of Paris. To silence the cavils and insinuations of his antagonists, he resolved, therefore, on making some new efforts. A subscription was opened to defray the expense of a globe twenty-eight feet in diameter, and formed of tiffany, with elastic varnish. After repeated accidents and delays, this balloon was planted, on the 1st of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> 1783, at the entrance of the great alley of the Tuileries, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFUSE\">diffuse</a> fluid was this time introduced into it from a sort of gazometer. The dilute sulphuric acid and the iron filings being put into wooden casks, disposed round a large cistern, the gas was conveyed in long leaden pipes, and made to pass through the water under a glass <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELL\">bell</a> plunged in it. The whole apparatus cost about L. 400 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">Sterling</a>, one half of which was expended on the production of the gas alone. An immense concourse of spectators had collected from all parts. The discharge of a cannon at intervals announced the progress in filling the balloon. To amuse the populace, and quiet their impatience, M. Montgolfer was desired to let off a small fire-balloon, as a mark of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRECEDENCE\">precedence</a>. At last, the globe being sufficiently inflated, and a quantity of ballast, consisting of small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> bags, lodged in the car, leaving only 22\u00bd pounds for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of the buoyant force, MM. Charles and Robert placed themselves in the appended <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a> or car, and the machine was immediately disengaged from its stays. It mounted with a slow and solemn motion. According to the formula given, the terminal velocity cent of ascent must have been only about 400 feet each minute, or at the rate of somewhat less than five miles in the hour. \"The car, ascending amidst profound silence and admiration,\" to borrow the warm and exaggerated language of the reporter, \"allowed, in its soft and measured progress, the bystanders to follow with their eyes and their hearts two interesting men, who, like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEMI\">demi</a>-gods, soared to the abode of the immortals, to receive the reward of intelligence, and carry the imperishable name of Montgolfer. After the globe had reached the height of 2000 feet, it was no longer possible to distinguish the aerial navigators; but the coloured pennants which they waved in the air testified their safety and their tranquil feelings.\" All\nfears were now dissipated; enthusiasm succeeded to astonishment; and every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a> was given of joy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLAUSE\">applause</a>.\" The balloon, describing a tortuous course, and rising or sinking according to the fancy of its conductors, was, after a flight of an hour and three quarters, made to alight on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEADOW\">meadow</a> of Nesle, about twenty-five miles from Paris. For the space of an hour, the buoyancy of the machine had been sensibly augmented, by the sun's rays striking against the surface of the bag, and heating up the contained gas to the temperature of 55 degrees by Fahrenheit's scale.\n\nAfter this prosperous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a>, the globe, though become rather flaccid and loose by its expenditure, yet still retained a great buoyant force, when relieved from the weight of the travellers. The sun had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> set, and the night was beginning to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a>; but M. Charles formed the resolution of making alone another aerial excursion. His courage was rewarded by the spectacle of one of the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVEL\">novel</a> and enchanting appearances in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>. He shot upwards with such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CELERITY\">celerity</a>, as to reach the height of near two miles in ten minutes. The sun rose again to him in full orb; and, from his lofty station in the heavens, he contemplated the fading luminary, and watched its parting beams, till it once more sunk below the remote <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZON\">horizon</a>. The vapours rising from the ground collected into clouds, and covered the earth from his sight. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">moon</a> began to shine, and her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> rays scattered gleams of various hues over the fantastic and changing forms of those accumulated masses. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> had all the impressive solemnity of the true sublime. No wonder, that the first mortal eye that ever contemplated such awful grandeur could not refrain from shedding tears of joy and admiration. The region in which M. Charles hovered was now excessively cold; and as he opened the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-VALVE\">valve</a> occasionally during his ascent, to prevent the violent distention of the balloon, the hydrogen gas, not having time to acquire the temperature of the exterior air, rushed out like misty vapour, with a whistling noise. But <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a> forbade the voyager to remain long at such an elevation, while darkness was gathering below. He therefore descended slowly to the earth, and, after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAPSE\">lapse</a> of 35 minutes, alighted near the wood of Tour du Lay, having, in that short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a>, travelled about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> miles.\n\nThis balloon, with its passengers and ballast, weighed at first 680 pounds; but, notwithstanding the care taken in filling it, the hydrogen gas must have been mixed with a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> of common air, since it was only $5\\frac{1}{2}$ times lighter than this fluid. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAROMETER\">barometer</a>, which stood at 29.24 English inches at the surface of the ground, subsided to 20.05 at the greatest elevation to which M. Charles had reached. This gives, by calculation, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ALTITUDE\">altitude</a> of 9,770 feet. The thermometer, which was at 41\u00b0 by Fahrenheit's scale at the first ascent, fell to 21\u00b0 at the highest flight; giving a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> for every 488$\\frac{1}{2}$ feet of ascent.\n\nThe next voyage through the air was performed in the largest balloon ever yet constructed. The elder Montgolfier had been persuaded to open a subscription at Lyons for the sum of L. 180 Sterling, to construct an aeronautic machine, capable of upholding a great weight, and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> a horse, or other A\u00e9ronautics quadruped. It had an elongated shape, 109 feet wide, and 134 feet high, and was formed of two folds of linen, having three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAYERS\">layers</a> of paper laid between them, and quilted over with ribbands. It showed at first enormous buoyant power. A truss of straw, moistened with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of wine, was found, when set on fire, to yield humid smoke sufficient to inflate the balloon, and the burning of five pounds weight of alder faggots kept it in full action. Though loaded with a ballast of eighteen tons, it yet lifted up six persons from the ground. Unfortunately, it was very much damaged one night, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of being exposed to rain, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FROST\">frost</a>, and snow. However, on the 19th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1784, the balloon was charged in seventeen minutes, by the combustion of 550 pounds of alder. Joseph Montgolfier, accompanied by the ardent Pilatre de Rozier, and four other persons of note, with the proper ballast, took their seats in a wicker <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GALLERY\">gallery</a>, and were launched into the atmosphere. They maneuvered over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Lyons, and near the course of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHINE\">Rhine</a>, for the space of forty minutes; but a large rent having been observed in the upper part of the balloon, they were compelled to descend abruptly, though without any farther <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCIDENT\">accident</a>.\n\nThe difficulties and dangers of aerial navigation being at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> surmounted, the ascents of balloons were now multiplied in all quarters. It <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a>, therefore, be sufficient, henceforth, to notice very succinctly some of the more distinguished attempts of that kind.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEVALIER\">Chevalier</a> Paul Andreani of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILAN\">Milan</a> had a spherical balloon, of 70 feet in diameter, formed after Montgolfier's plan, at his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a>, in which, accompanied by two companions, he ascended from that capital on the 25th February, 1784. The machine rose to the height of 1300 feet; but after having described, in twenty minutes, a very circuitous track, it settled upon a large tree, from which, however, the voyagers, by applying fresh fuel, extricated themselves, and alighted on clear ground, without receiving any hurt.\n\nOn the 2d of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-MARCH\">March</a>, Blanchard, who had been, for some years before, occupied with the chimerical project of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a> in the air, and who fancied that the same principles and contrivances might be applied to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> the motion of balloons, mounted alone, and with great intrepidity, at Paris, in a silk balloon, 40 feet in diameter, constructed by subscription, and filled with hydrogen gas. He darted rapidly to the height of above a mile, and after being driven about by cross winds for an hour and three quarters, he descended in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> of Billancourt.\n\nOn the 28th of June in the same year, an ascent was made at Lyons before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">King</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a>, who then travelled under the name of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> Haga, with a fire-balloon, having somewhat of a pear shape, and 75 feet in height. Two passengers, M. Fleurant and a Fleurant young lady, Madame Thibl\u00e9, the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> that ever adventured on such a daring voyage, entered the car, and ascended with great velocity. In four minutes the noise of the multitude was no longer audible, and in two more the eye could not distin-\nIt was inferred, from a trigonometrical calculation, that they reached the altitude of 13,500 feet. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAG\">flag</a>, with its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAFF\">staff</a> of 14 pounds weight, being thrown down, took seven minutes to fall to the ground. The thermometer had dropped to 45\u00b0 on Fahrenheit's scale; and to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a> of cold which they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> was joined that of a ringing in the ears. Different currents were found to occupy distinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRATA\">strata</a> of the atmosphere; and in passing from one stratum to another, the balloon was affected by a sensible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNDULATION\">undulation</a>. The travellers continued to feed their fire with the loppings of vines, till this provision being nearly spent, they safely alighted in a corn-field, having traversed about six miles in three quarters of an hour.\n\nAbout a fortnight afterwards, the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> was gratified by a more splendid ascent, commanded for his entertainment by the French monarch. A large fire-balloon, carrying the naturalists, Rozier and Proust, was launched from the outer court of Versailles. It soared to the height of 12,520 feet, and might appear to float in a vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONGREGATION\">congregation</a> of extended and towering <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> clouds. The thermometer stood at 21\u00b0 of Fahrenheit, and the flakes of snow fell copiously on the voyagers, while it only rained below. Descending again from that chaotic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABYSS\">abyss</a>, they were charmed with the lively aspect of a rich and populous district. They alighted at the entrance of the forest of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHANTILLY\">Chantilly</a>, about thirty-six miles from Versailles, after a flight of an hour and five minutes.\n\nWe omit the relation of a prosperous ascent performed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RHODES\">Rhodes</a>, on the 6th of August, by the Abb\u00e9 Carnus and his companion, with a fire-balloon, of a globular shape, and 57 feet in diameter.\u2014The longest aerial journey yet made was accomplished at Paris, on the 19th of September. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">Duke</a> de Chartres, afterwards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORLEANS\">Orleans</a> and the noted Egalit\u00e9, employed Roberts to construct for him a silk balloon, which should be filled with hydrogen gas. It had 56 feet in height, and 36 feet diameter, being composed of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a>, terminated by two hemispheres; a construction which was rightly supposed to give much additional <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOLIDITY\">solidity</a> to the machine. A small bag, on Meusnier's plan, had been introduced within it, and the boat was, besides, furnished with a helm and four oars. This balloon, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> the Duke himself, the two artists, and another companion, and having 500 pounds of ballast, was allowed to rise very slowly, with a buoyancy of only 27 pounds. At the height of 1400 feet, the voyagers perceived, not without uneasiness, thick dark clouds gathering along the horizon, and threatening the approach of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a>-storm. They heard the distant claps, and experienced something like the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGITATION\">agitation</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHIRLWIND\">whirlwind</a>, although they had felt not the slightest concussion in the air from the discharge of cannon. The thermometer suddenly dropped from 77\u00b0 by Fahrenheit to 61\u00b0; and the influence of this cold caused the balloon to descend within 200 feet of the tops of the trees near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEAUVAIS\">Beauvais</a>. To extricate themselves, they now threw out more than forty pounds of ballast, and rose to an elevation of 6000 feet, where it was found that the confined gas had so obstinately retained its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, as to be no less than 42\u00b0 warmer than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> air.\n\nThe Duke became alarmed, and betrayed such impatience to return again to the earth, that he is said to have pierced the lower part of the silk bag in holes with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>. After narrowly escaping the dangers from wind and thunder, the balloon at last descended in safety near Bethune; having performed a course of 135 miles in the space of five <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a>.\n\nOn the 25th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a>, in the same year, the celebrated chemist, Guyton-Morveau, with the Abb\u00e9 Bertrand, ascended from Dijon in a balloon, nearly of a globular shape, twenty-nine feet in diameter, composed of the finest varnished tiffany, and filled with hydrogen gas. They did not start till five o'clock in the evening, the barometer being at 29.3 inches, and the thermometer at 57\u00b0 on Fahrenheit's scale; and, after surmounting some accidents, they rose to an altitude of 10,465 feet, or very nearly two English miles, where the barometer had sunk to 19.8 inches, and the thermometer to 25\u00b0. They felt no inconvenience however, except from the pinching of their ears with cold. They saw an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCEAN\">ocean</a> of clouds below them, and in this situation they witnessed, as the day declined, the beautiful phenomenon of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARHELION\">parhelion</a>, or mock-sun. The real luminary was only ten degrees above the horizon, when, all at once, another sun appeared to plant itself within six degrees of the former: It consisted of numerous prismatic rings, delicately tinted on a ground of dazzling whiteness. At half past six o'clock, after a voyage of an hour and a half, they safely alighted near Magny, about fifteen miles distant from Dijon.\n\nWith the same balloon, M. Guyton-Morveau made his second ascent, on the 12th of June, accompanied by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-PRESIDENT\">President</a> de Virly. It was launched at seven o'clock in the morning, the barometer being then at 29.5 inches, the thermometer at 66\u00b0, and Saussure's hygrometer at 83\u00bd. It swelled very fast, however, owing to the effect of the sun's increasing heat; and the upper valve being at intervals opened, to give vent to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a> of the gas, this escaped with a noise like the rushing of water. As the voyagers did not mount to any very great elevation, they enjoyed an agreeable temperature, and could easily, by observing the situation of the different villages scattered below them, trace out their tortuous route on the surface of the map. By nine o'clock, they had reached the height of 6030 feet, the barometer now standing at 24.7 inches, the thermometer at 70\u00b0, and the hygrometer at 65\u00bd. Three quarters of an hour afterwards, they descended at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VILLAGE\">village</a> of Etavaux, only twelve miles from Dijon, having described at least double this distance in the air. The heat had increased so much since the morning, that notwithstanding the loss of elastic fluid, the balloon seemed yet nearly inflated, on touching the ground.\n\nAn aerial voyage, most remarkable for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> and its adventures, was performed on the 18th June, 1786, from Paris, by M. Testu, with a balloon 29 feet in diameter, constructed by himself of glazed tiffany, furnished with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol2.html#article-AUXILIARY\">auxiliary</a> wings, and filled, as usual, with hydrogen gas. It had been much injured by wind and rain during the night before its ascension; but having undergone a slight repair, it was finally launched, with its conductor, at four o'clock in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFTERNOON\">afternoon</a>. The barometer then stood at 29.68\ninches, and the thermometer as high as 84\u00b0; though the day was cloudy and threatened rain. The balloon had at first been filled only five-sixths, but it gradually swelled as it became drier and warmer, and acquired its utmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTENSION\">distension</a> at the height of 2800 feet. But to avoid the waste of gas, or the rupture of the silk, the navigator endeavoured to descend by the reaction of his wings. This force being insufficient, however, he threw out some ballast; and, at half past five o'clock, he softly alighted on a corn-field in the plain of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTMORENCY\">Montmorency</a>. Without leaving the car, he began to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLECT\">collect</a> a few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> for ballast; when he was surrounded by the proprietor of the field and a troop of peasants, who insisted on being indemnified for the damage occasioned by his idle and curious visitors. Anxious now to disengage himself, he persuaded them, that, his wings being broken, he was wholly at their mercy; they seized the stay of the balloon, which floated at some height, and dragged their prisoner through the air in a sort of triumph towards the village. But M. Testu, finding that the loss of his wings, his cloak, and some other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol8.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a>, had considerably lightened the machine, suddenly cut the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CORD\">cord</a>, and took an abrupt leave of the clamorous and mortified peasants. He rose to the region of the clouds, where he observed small frozen particles floating in the atmosphere. He heard thunder rolling beneath his feet, and, as the coolness of the evening advanced, the buoyant force diminished, and, at three quarters after six o'clock, he approached the ground, near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABBEY\">Abbey</a> of Royaumont. There he threw out some ballast, and in the space of twelve minutes rose to a height of 2400 feet, where the thermometer was only 66 degrees. He now heard the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLAST\">blast</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HORN\">horn</a>, and descried huntsmen below in full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHASE\">chase</a>. Curious to witness the sport, he pulled the valve, and descended, at eight o'clock, between Etouen and Varville, when, rejecting his ears, he set himself to gather some ballast. While he was thus occupied, the hunters galloped up to him. He mounted a third time, and passed through a dense body of clouds, in which thunder followed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a> in quick succession.\n\nWith fresh alacrity and force renew'd,\nSprings upward, like a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYRAMID\">pyramid</a> of fire,\nInto the wild expanse, and through the shock\nOf fighting elements, on all sides round\nEnvirons' wins his way.\n\nThe thermometer fell to 21\u00b0, but afterwards regained its former point of 66\u00b0, when the balloon had reached the altitude of 5000 feet. In this region, the voyager sailed till half past nine o'clock, at which time he observed from his \"watch-tower in the sky\" the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SETTING\">setting</a> of the sun. He was now quickly involved in darkness, and enveloped in the thickest mass of thunder-clouds. The lightnings flashed on all sides, and the loud claps were incessant. The thermometer, seen by the help of a phosphoric light which he struck, pointed at 21\u00b0; and snow and sleet fell copiously around him. In this most tremendous situation the intrepid adventurer remained the space of three hours, the time during which the storm lasted. The balloon was affected by a sort of undulating motion upwards and downwards, owing, he thought, to the electrical action of the clouds. The lightning appeared excessively vivid, but the thunder was sharp and loud, preceded by a sort of crackling noise. A calm at last succeeding, he had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> to see the stars, and embraced this opportunity to take some necessary refreshment. At half past two o'clock, the day broke in; but his ballast being nearly gone, and the balloon again dry and much elevated, he resolved to descend to the earth, and ascertain to what point he had been carried. At a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> before four o'clock, having already seen the sun rise, he safely alighted near the village of Campremi, about 63 miles from Paris.\n\nAt this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, ascents with balloons had been Balloons in multiplied, not only through France, but all over England. Europe. They were very seldom, however, directed to any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> than amusement, and had soon degenerated into mere exhibitions for gain. The first balloon seen in England, was constructed by an ingenious Italian, the Count Zambecari. It consisted of oiled silk, in a globular shape, about ten feet in diameter, and weighed only eleven pounds. It was entirely gilt, which not only gave it a beautiful appearance, but rendered it less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERMEABLE\">permeable</a> to the gas. On the 25th of November 1783, it was filled about three-fourths, and launched at one o'clock from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTILLERY\">Artillery</a> Ground, and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a> of a vast concourse of spectators. At half-past three in the afternoon, it was taken up at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PETWORTH\">Petworth</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SUSSEX\">Sussex</a>, about the distance of forty-eight miles. It was not till the following year, on the 21st of September, that a countryman of his, named Lunardi, first mounted Lunardi in a balloon at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>. He afterwards repeated the experiment in different parts of England, and during the following year in Scotland. This active person took an expeditious but careless method to fill his balloon with gas. He had two large casks sunk into the ground, for their better security, in which he deposited 2000 pounds of the borings of cannon, divided by layers of straw, to present a larger surface. An equal weight of sulphuric acid, or common oil of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VITRIOL\">vitriol</a>, diluted with six times as much water, was poured upon the iron, and the hydrogen gas now formed, without being cooled or washed, was immediately introduced into the balloon. To Lunardi succeeded Blanchard, who possessed just as little Blanchard-science, but had greater pretensions, and some share of dexterity and skill. This adventurer is said to have performed not fewer than thirty-six voyages through the air, and to have acquired a large sum of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> by those bold and attractive exhibitions. His most remarkable journey was across the British Channel, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> with Dr Jeffries, an American <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol10.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>. On the 7th of January 1785, in a clear frosty day, the balloon was launched from the cliff of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOVER\">Dover</a>, and, after a perilous course of two hours and three quarters, it alighted in safety on the edge of the forest of Guernes, not far beyond <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CALAIS\">Calais</a>. By the magistrates of this town were the two aerial travellers treated with the utmost kindness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITALITY\">hospitality</a>; and their wondrous arrival was welcomed as a happy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OMEN\">omen</a>, alas! how fallacious, of the lasting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a> to subsist between rival nations, now cemented by the conclusion of the famous Commercial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TREATY\">Treaty</a>.\n\nThe original smoke balloon of Montgolfier ap-\npears to have gradually fallen into disrepute, and the more elegant and expensive, but far more powerful construction, which employs varnished silk to contain hydrogen gas, came to be generally preferred. With due precaution and management, the sailing through the atmosphere is perhaps scarcely more dangerous than the navigating of the ocean. Of some hundred ascents made at different times with balloons, not above two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> are recorded to have had a fatal termination. The first was rendered memorable by the shocking death of the accomplished and interesting Rozier, who perished a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARTYR\">martyr</a> to his ardent zeal for the promotion of science. Being anxious to return the visit which Blanchard and Jeffries had paid to the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a>, by crossing the channel again and descending in England; he transported his balloon, which was of a globular shape, and forty feet in diameter, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOULOGNE\">Boulogne</a>; and after various delays, occasioned chiefly by adverse winds, he mounted on the 15th June 1785, with his companion, M. Romain. From some vague idea of being better able to regulate the ascent of the balloon, he had most cautiously suspended below it a small smoke one of ten feet diameter; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a>, to which may be imputed the disastrous issue. Scarcely a quarter of an hour had elapsed, when the whole apparatus, at the height of above three thousand feet, was observed to be on fire; and its scattered fragments, with the unfortunate voyagers, were precipitated to the ground. They fell near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>-shore, about four miles from Boulogne, and were instantly killed by the tremendous shock, their bodies being found most dreadfully mangled.\u2014The next fatal accident with balloons, happened in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, several years later, when a Venetian nobleman and his lady, after having performed successfully various ascents, fell from a vast height, and perished on the spot.\n\nBalloonists have, no doubt, been often exposed, in their aerial excursions, to the most imminent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAZARD\">hazard</a> of their lives. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> danger consists in the difficulty of preventing sometimes a rapid and premature descent. To <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a>, in some degree, against the risks arising from the occurrence of such accidents, the Parachute was afterwards introduced; being intended to enable the voyager, in cases of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALARM\">alarm</a>, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a> his balloon in mid-air, and drop, without sustaining injury, to the ground. The French language, though not very copious, has yet supplied this convenient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a>, signifying a guard for falling, as it has likewise furnished the words of analogous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>, parapluie, paravent, and parasol, to denote an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UMBRELLA\">umbrella</a>, a shade for the sun, and a door-screen. The parachute very much resembles the ordinary umbrella, but has a far greater extent. The umbrella itself, requiring such strength to bear it up against a moderate wind, might naturally have suggested the application of the same principle to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> the force of a fall. Nothing was required but to present a surface having <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIMENSION\">dimension</a> sufficient to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> from the air a resistance equal to the weight of descent, in moving through the fluid with a velocity not exceeding that of the shock which a person can sustain without any danger. Accordingly, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EAST\">East</a>, where the umbrella, or rather the parasol, has been, from the remotest ages, in familiar use, this implement appears to be occasionally employed by vaulters, for enabling them to jump safely from great heights. Father Louhere, in his curious account of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIAM\">Siam</a>, relates that a person famous, in that remote country, for his dexterity, was accustomed to divert exceedingly the king and the royal court, by the prodigious leaps which he took, having two umbrellas, with long slender handles, fastened to his girdle. He generally alighted on the ground, but was sometimes carried by the wind against trees or houses, and not unfrequently into the river.\u2014Not many years since, the umbrella was at least, on one occasion, employed in Europe, with similar views, but directed to a very different purpose. In the early part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAMPAIGN\">campaign</a> of 1793, the French general, Beurnonville, having been sent by the National <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVENTION\">Convention</a>, with four more commissioners, to treat with the Prince of Sax-Cobourg, was, contrary to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> or courtesy heretofore preserved in the fiercest wars that have raged among civilized nations, detained a prisoner with his companions, and sent to the fortress of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OLMUTZ\">Olmutz</a>, where he suffered a rigorous confinement. In this cruel situation, he made a desperate attempt to regain his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>. Having provided himself with an umbrella, he jumped from a window at the height of forty feet; but being a very large heavy man, this screen proved insufficient to check his precipitate descent; he struck against the opposite wall, fell into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DITCH\">ditch</a>, and broke his leg, and was carried in this condition back again to his dungeon.\n\nBlanchard was the first who constructed parachutes, and annexed them to balloons, for the object of affecting his escape in case of accident. During the excursion which he undertook from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LISLE\">Lisle</a>, about the end of August 1785, when this adventurous aeronaut traversed, without halting, a distance not less than 300 miles, he let down a dog from a vast height in the basket of a parachute, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> animal, falling gently through the air, reached the ground unhurt. Since that period, the practice and management of the parachute have been carried much farther by other aerial travellers, and particularly by M. Garnerin, who has dared repeatedly to descend from the region of the clouds with that very slender machine. This ingenious and spirited Frenchman visited London during the short peace of 1802, and made two fine ascents with his balloon, in the second of which he threw himself from an amazing elevation with a parachute. This consisted of thirty-two gores of white <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CANVASS\">canvass</a> formed into a hemispherical case of twenty-three feet diameter, at the top of which was a truck or round piece of wood ten inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, and having a hole in its centre, admitting short pieces of tape to fasten it to the several gores of the canvas. About four feet and a half below the top, a wooden hoop of eight feet in diameter was attached by a string from each seam; so that when the balloon rose, the parachute hung like a curtain from this hoop. Below it was suspended a cylindrical basket covered with canvas, about four feet high, and two and a quarter wide. In this basket, the aeronaut, dressed in a close jacket and a pair of trousers, placed himself, and rose majestically from an inclosure near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">North</a> Audley Street at six o'clock in the evening of the 2d of September. After ho-\nvering seven or eight minutes in the upper region of the atmosphere, he meditated a descent in his parachute. Well might he be supposed to linger there in dread suspense, and to\n\nPondering his voyage; for no narrow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>\nHe had to choose;\nHe views the breadth, and, without longer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PAUSE\">pause</a>,\nDownward into the world's first region throws\nHis light precipitant, and winds with ease,\nThrough the pure marble air, his oblique way.\n\nHe cut the cord by which his parachute was attached to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">net</a> of the balloon; it instantly expanded, and for some seconds it descended with an accelerating velocity, till it became tossed extremely, and took such wide oscillations, that the basket or car was at times thrown almost into an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> position. Borne along likewise by the influence of the wind, the parachute passed over <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>-le-bone and Somers-Town, and almost grazed the houses of St Pancras. At last it fortunately struck the ground in a neighbouring field, but so violent was the shock as to throw poor Garnier on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a>, by which accident he received some cuts, and bled considerably. He seemed to be much agitated, and trembled exceedingly at the moment he was released from the car. One of the stays of the parachute had chanced to give way, which untoward circumstance deranged the apparatus, disturbed its proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a>, and threatened the adventurer, during the whole of his descent, with immediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a>. The feeling of such extreme peril was too much for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> nature to bear.\n\nFrom the principles before explained, we may easily determine the descent of a parachute. When, with its attached load, it is abandoned in the air, it must, from the continued action of gravity, proceed at first with an accelerated motion, till its increasing velocity comes to oppose a resistance equal to the force of attraction, or to the combined weight of the whole apparatus. After this counterpoise has taken place, there existing no longer any cause of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCELERATION\">acceleration</a>, the parachute should descend uniformly with its acquired rapidity. This perfect equilibrium will not, however, be attained at once. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCUMULATION\">accumulation</a> of swiftness produced by the unceasing operation of gravity, is not immediately restrained by the corresponding increased resistance of the atmosphere. The motion of a parachute must hence, for some short time, be subject to a sort of interior oscillation, alternately accelerating and retarding. It first shoots beyond the terminal velocity, and then, suffering greater resistance, it relaxes, and contracts within the just limits. This unequal and undulating progress which a parachute exhibits, subsequent to the commencement of its fall, is calculated to excite disproportionate alarms of insecurity and danger.\n\nThe terminal velocity of a parachute, or the uniform velocity to which its motion tends, would, according to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a>, be equal, if its surface were flat, to the velocity that a heavy body must acquire in falling through the altitude of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> of air <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCUMBENT\">incumbent</a> on that surface, and having, under the usual circumstances, the same weight as the whole apparatus. But we have already seen, that a cylinder of air, one foot in diameter and height, weighs only, in ordinary cases, the seventeenth part of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> avoirdupois. Wherefore, if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> of the diameter of a parachute be divided by 17, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUOTIENT\">quotient</a> will give the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of pounds equivalent to the weight of an atmospheric column of one foot; and the weight of the apparatus being again divided by this quotient, the result will express the entire altitude of an equi-ponderant column. Of this altitude, the square root multiplied by 8, will denote the final velocity, or that with which the parachute must strike the ground.\n\nSuppose, for example, that the diameter of the parachute were 25 feet: Then $25 \\times 25 = 625$, and this, divided by 17, gives $36\\frac{1}{4}$. Consequently, if the parachute with its load weighed only $36\\frac{1}{4}$ pounds, the shock received at the surface of the earth would be precisely the same as that which is felt in dropping from an elevation of one foot. Had the weight of the apparatus, therefore, been four times greater, or $147\\frac{1}{4}$ pounds, the shock sustained would be the same as that from a fall of four feet; which is near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIMIT\">limit</a>, perhaps, of what a person can bear without suffering injury from the violence of concussion. The velocity of descent, on this latter supposition, would be $8\\sqrt{4}$, or sixteen feet each second.\n\nBut the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> resistance of the air is rather greater than what theory would give; and it is besides augmented by the concavity of the opposing surface, which occasions an accumulation of the fluid. Let $a$ denote the diameter of a parachute, and $f$ the total weight of the apparatus abandoned to its gravity in the atmosphere; if we take Dr Hutton's valuable experiments for the basis of the calculation, the terminal velocity of descent may be expressed in round numbers, by $\\frac{26}{a}\\sqrt{\\frac{f}{a}}$, in feet each second, and consequently the length of fall which would occasion the same shock, is $\\left(\\frac{13}{120}\\<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>)^2 f$, or very nearly $\\frac{10\\frac{1}{4}}{a^2} f$. Thus, if the parachute had thirty feet in diameter, and weighed, together with its appended load, 225 pounds; then $\\frac{26}{30} \\times \\frac{26}{30} \\times 15 = \\frac{13}{15} \\times 15 = 13$ feet, or the velocity with which it would strike the ground; and $\\left(\\frac{13}{120}\\right)^2 225 = 2\\frac{3}{8}$ feet, being the height from which a person dropping freely would receive the same shock.\n\nSince the resistance which air opposes to the passage of a body is diminished by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAREFACTION\">rarefaction</a>, it is evident, that the parachute disengaged from a balloon, in the more elevated regions of the atmosphere, will at first acquire a greater velocity than it can afterwards maintain as it approaches the ground. Resuming the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOTATION\">notation</a> employed before, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol7.html#article-DENSITY\">density</a> of the air at the surface, and at any given height being expressed by $n:m$, then the velocity of counterpoise at that elevation, would be $\\frac{26}{a}\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{n}} \\cdot f$, or it would be equal to what is accumulated in falling freely a height of $\\frac{10\\frac{1}{4}}{a^2} \\cdot \\frac{m}{n} \\cdot f$ feet.\n\nIt is the final velocity, however, that must be chiefly\nconsidered in parachutes, being what determines the shock sustained in alighting. The violence of the rushing through the air will seldom be attended with any serious inconvenience. If we suppose the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> velocity with which a parachute descends to be twelve feet each second, this will correspond to the rate of a mile in $7\\frac{1}{2}$ minutes; not more than that of a very gentle trot. We are not told from what height Garnerin dropped; but if he took four minutes in his descent, it was probably about half a mile.\n\nThe practice of a\u00e9ronautics has not realized those expectations of benefit to mankind which sanguine projectors were at first disposed to entertain. It was soon found, that a balloon, launched into the atmosphere, is abandoned, without guidance or command, to the mercy of the winds. To undertake to direct or impel the floating machine by any exertion of human strength, was evidently a chimerical attempt. All the influence which the a\u00e9ronaut really possesses, consists in a very limited power of raising or depressing it, according to circumstances. He cannot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">hope</a> to shape his course, unless by skilfully adapting his elevation to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CATCH\">catch</a> the prevailing currents.\n\nAlmost the only purpose to which balloons have hitherto been applied with success, had for its object that of military reconnaissance. In the early part of the French revolutionary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, when ingenuity and science were so eagerly called into active <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>, a balloon, prepared under the direction of the A\u00e9ros- tatic Institute in the Polytechnic School, and entrusted to the command of two or three experienced officers, was distributed to each of the republican armies. The decisive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VICTORY\">victory</a> which General Jourdan gained, in June 1794, over the Austrian forces in the plains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLEURUS\">Fleurus</a>, has been ascribed principally to the accurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> of the enemy's movements before and during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a>, communicated by telegraphical signals from a balloon which was sent up to a moderate height in the air. The a\u00e9ronauts, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of whom was the celebrated Guyton-Morveau, mounted twice in the course of that day, and continued, about four hours each time, hovering in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REAR\">rear</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> at an altitude of 1300 feet. In the second ascent, the enterprise being discovered by the enemy, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATTERY\">battery</a> was opened against them; but they soon gained an elevation above the reach of the cannon. Another balloon, constructed by the same skilful artist, M. Cont\u00e9, was attached to the army sent on the memorable expedition to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>. What service it rendered the daring invader in the wide plains and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a> deserts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>, we are not informed; but, after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITULATION\">capitulation</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CAIRO\">Cairo</a>, it was brought back, with the remains of the army, to France, and employed in the sequel, as we shall find, more innocently in philosophical research. These balloons, being calculated for duration, were of a more solid and perfect construction than usual. Originally they were filled with hydrogen gas, obtained from the decomposition of water on a large scale. For this purpose, six iron cylinders had been fixed by masonry in a simple kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FURNACE\">furnace</a>, each of their ends projecting, and covered with an iron lid. Two sets of metal tubes were also inserted, the one for conveying hot water, and the other for carrying off the gas which was formed. The cylinders being charged with iron-turnings, and brought to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>-heat, the humidity was instantly converted into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEAM\">steam</a> and decomposed, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OXYGEN\">oxygen</a> uniting with the iron, while the hydrogen gas was discharged, and made to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEPOSIT\">deposit</a> any carbonic gas that might adhere to it, by passing through a reservoir filled with caustic lye before it entered the balloon. By this method, there was procured, at a very moderate expense, and in the space of about four hours, a quantity of hydrogen gas sufficient to inflate a balloon of thirty feet in diameter.","sp":296,"ep":305},{"h":"AFRICA","t":"In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> article given under this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> in the body of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, the reader <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> find a pretty accurate digest of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> collected by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> travellers in regard to this obscure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of the globe; but as that article either does not touch upon, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> but slightly alludes to various disputed questions, of considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>, connected with its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> and modern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">geography</a>, it hence becomes necessary that we should here make some remarks upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> in question, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as upon the additional information which recent enterprise and inquiries have supplied.*\n\nI. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of the knowledge of this continent possessed by the ancients, forms one of the subjects of inquiry to which we allude, and upon which much learning and ingenuity have been employed.\n\n1. The first point to be considered under this head is, whether Africa was ever circumnavigated in ancient times? <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERODOTUS\">Herodotus</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECHO\">Necho</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>, fitted out an expedition under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of certain Phoenician navigators, for the purpose of circumnavigating it; and that these navigators asserted that they had succeeded in this adventurous undertaking. By some of the ancient writers, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> which Herodotus gives of this voyage was held altogether <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FABULOUS\">fabulous</a>. Among the moderns, Huet (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMERCE\">Commerce</a> et <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">Navigation</a> des Anciens, 34, 275.), the Abb\u00e9 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> (Academie des Sciences, VII. 79.), Montesquieu (Esprit des Lois, b. xxi. ch. 10.), and some others, have contended that it was really performed; while Vossius (in his Notes to Pomponius Mela), and D'Anville have intimated a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of scepticism. But the most elaborate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a> of the question has taken <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJOR\">Major</a> Rennell <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the one side, and Dr Vincent and M. Gosselin on the other. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of the two latter is also moderately espoused by Gibbon, in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSAY\">essay</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> published in the fifth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POSTHUMOUS\">posthumous</a> works.\n\nMajor Rennell (Geog. Herodot. 672-93) observes, that, though the ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of sailing, confined to a very small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a>, presented difficulties and obstructions unknown to modern navigation, it yet afforded resources for overcoming these difficulties, wholly foreign to the modern practice of the art. Navigators were thus enabled to discover all the creeks and harbours which any coast presented, and which escape vessels that steer at a distance from the shore. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of their ships, with very flat bottoms and low masts, enabled them to keep much nearer to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, than modern vessels of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a>. They could even, when the exigency required, be drawn up along the beach; and instances are quoted, in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> fleets were thus placed in a state of security. And as to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of three years, specified as having been spent in the voyage,\u2014this may be sufficiently accounted for by the slow rate of ancient sailing\u2014by the difficulties of an un-\n\n* The reader will be assisted in the perusal of this article by occasionally referring to the accompanying map of Northern and Central Africa.\nWe may observe, that there is no precise <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGISTER\">register</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> spent in sailing from the Straits to Cerne. But another and later Periplus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCYLAX\">Scylax</a>, (Geog. Graeci Minores), supplies this deficiency, by stating that distance at twelve days sail. From Cerne to the Southern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HORN\">Horn</a>, twenty-six days are counted by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HANNO\">Hanno</a>. The whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> thus appears to be thirty-eight.\n\nBougainville (Academie des Sciences, X. 45.) contends, that the space which he has supposed to be passed over in the above period of time, though considerable, does not exceed what might reasonably be expected from the most skilful navigators of antiquity. He instances the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUADRON\">squadron</a> sent, in 1641, to establish the fort of Elmina, which sailed from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LISBON\">Lisbon</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARGUIN\">Arguin</a> in twelve days, and thence to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol4.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> Three Points in twenty-six; this, by a singular coincidence, being the precise period of time employed by Hanno. It is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a>, he continues, till we arrive at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENEGAL\">Senegal</a>, to find any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> river which abounds in the wild <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMPHIBIA\">amphibia</a> mentioned in the journal. In that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> only of the coast, have travellers observed those vegetable conflagrations, which might occasion the appearance of a flaming mountain. There only are found the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORAN\">oran</a> outangs, undoubtedly pointed at by the name of gorille. Cerne has been considered as Arguin by D'Anville, and all the most eminent modern geographers. The approach to it by sailing two days west and one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EAST\">east</a>, and its situation in a recess of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, exactly correspond to the Periplus. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> is otherwise as to its magnitude, the circumference being stated at half a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILE\">mile</a>, while that of Arguin is five or six miles. But this may be an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> in the text. Cornelius Nepos states it at twenty stadia, or two miles. Hanno calculates that Cerne is opposite to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARTHAGE\">Carthage</a>, which he explains, by saying that the distance from Carthage to the Straits is equal to that from the straits to Cerne. The latter space is considerably greater; but the estimate might very probably be made by following, according to the ancient mode of navigation, all the windings of the coast. It will then be found so much more deeply indented on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a> than on the Atlantic, that if the two spaces be thus examined, they will almost exactly coincide.\n\nMajor Rennell, (Geog. Herodot. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SECT\">sect</a>. 19, 25), in Rennell, treating of the important positions of Arguin and the Senegal, follows nearly the footsteps of Bougainville. But he ridicules the idea of ancient vessels sailing at the rate of seventy geographical miles in the day, which would be required, in order to reach, in twenty-six days, from Arguin to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GULF\">Gulf</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENIN\">Benin</a>. Such a rate would be considered rapid by modern ships, with every advantage of wind and tide. In the Gulfs of Bissao and Sherbro, he finds all the islands mentioned by Hanno, which cannot be satisfactorily placed upon any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a>. He derives a curious argument, by applying, according to the literal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of the Periplus, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> Horn to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BAY\">bay</a> itself, and not, as had usually been done, to the bounding cape. This form is certainly presented by the Gulfs of Bissago and Sherbro, and it does not occur on any other part of the coast.\n\nIn the voyage between the Straits and Cerne, Major Rennell justly reproaches the idea of five cities being founded beyond Cape <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOJADOR\">Bojador</a>, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a> coast of the Sahara. Being unwilling, however, to admit the immense spaces of Bougainville, he is himself somewhat embarrassed by Scylax's estimate of twelve days sail from the Straits to Cerne, which would give a rate of 104 miles per day.\n\nThe extent of M. Gosselin's scepticism will appear from looking at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>. Instead of a space of 3000 miles, which is assigned by Bougainville, and 2200 by Rennell, he does not extend the voyage beyond 640 miles; instead of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> Hanno into the heart of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUINEA\">Guinea</a>, he scarcely allows him to have passed the limits of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOROCCO\">Morocco</a>. In support of this opinion, he makes the following observations. (Geog. des Anciens, I. 60\u2014164). Hanno's rate of sailing could not but be slow. He was upon an unknown sea, where numerous precautions were requisite,\u2014upon a voyage of discovery, which called upon him to examine minutely every part of the coast, and to sail only during the day. He was attended also by a large and encumbered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a>, in","sp":309,"ep":311},{"h":"AFRICA","t":"which the slowest sailing vessel necessarily fixed the rate of the others. M. Gosselin thus conceives twenty miles a-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> a very fair and probable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a>. He appeals to the difficulty which the Portuguese experienced in doubling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol4.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOJADOR\">Bojador</a>. After a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of fruitless attempts, they succeeded only by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-AID\">aid</a> of the compass, which enabled them to stand out to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>. Destitute of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HANNO\">Hanno</a>, he insists, never could have overcome the formidable obstacles which there presented themselves. The important position of Soloe is distinctly stated by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERODOTUS\">Herodotus</a> as the western extremity of Africa, and the point at which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> begins to take a southerly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>. This clearly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> out Cape Spartel. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of Fedala has precisely the dimensions assigned to Cerne, while those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARGUIN\">Arguin</a> totally differ. As to its equality of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARTHAGE\">Carthage</a> from the Straits, he accounts for it by supposing, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the known coast of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a>, vessels proceeded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> from cape to cape, while in an unknown sea, they would necessarily follow all the windings of the shore. The other islands mentioned by Hanno, he conceives to be merely shallows, inundated at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-TIDES\">tides</a>, as is proved by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> remaining upon them. To the objection that there are neither Ethiopians (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol7.html#article-NEGROES\">negroes</a>) nor crocodiles, nor hippopotami, nor ouran outangs now to be found in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOROCCO\">Morocco</a>; he answers, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> Ethiopians was not necessarily confined to negroes, but was extended to all people of a deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> olive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a>, and that the wild animals above mentioned formerly existed in this territory, whence they were expelled as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> became peopled.\n\nIn order to support this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a>, M. Gosselin has drawn forth and illustrated another curious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOCUMENT\">document</a>. This is the Periplus of Polybius, inserted by Pliny in the sixth book of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">Natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a>. The names are almost entirely changed from those of Hanno, which renders it difficult to compare the two together. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the distance, however, is given in Roman miles, which amount to 813, between the Straits and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">Great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-ATLAS\">Atlas</a>. M. Gosselin then undertakes to prove, that this is not only the entire space passed over by Polybius, but that it equals the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of the voyage of Hanno. Of this circumstance, indeed, Polybius himself is by no means aware. He <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> a great distance from the termination of his voyage to the Chariot of the Gods, and ten days from thence to the Western <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HORN\">Horn</a>. Our author, however, supposes, that not recognizing in the objects before him the wonders described by Hanno, he vaguely referred the latter to remote and still unexplored regions.\n\nM. Gosselin has finally to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMBAT\">combat</a> the tables of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMY\">Ptolemy</a>, with which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJOR\">Major</a> Rennell's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> pretty nearly coincide, and which delineate an extent of Africa coast, three times greater than he is willing to admit as having been known to the ancients. He contends, that, in all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> narratives, the names of places were assigned in a rude and careless manner, and that they were almost entirely different in different journals. He therefore infers, that Ptolemy might have perused three different voyages along precisely the same shores, and, from the names being different in each of the narratives, might thus be induced to delineate an extent of coast three times greater than was actually explored. Nothing can better evince the obscurity which hangs over the writings of the ancient geographers, than that it should be possible to produce even plausible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> so singular.*\n\n* Without venturing upon any very decided <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> as to the comparative merits of these three systems, we would observe, that Bougainville appears to have given an extravagant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> to the voyage of Hanno, and that we think the system of Rennell the most conformable of any to the features of the coast as delineated in the Periplus. We confess, at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, that the short diurnal progress contended for by M. Gosselin appears better suited to all the circumstances and difficulties under which the voyage was performed; but this difficulty would be removed, if, as we incline to think, a day's sail among the ancients was always fixed to a certain extent, like a day's journey by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a>.\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">Description</a> of the Coast | Peripius | Ptolemy | Gosselin | Vincent |\n|--------------------------|----------|---------|----------|---------|\n| The cape at which the coast turns to the south | Aromata | Aromata | C.

Gosselin (Geographie des Anciens, I. 165-198) considers that he is fully justified in resting chiefly on the authority of Ptolemy. That writer, from his residence at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALEXANDRIA\">Alexandria</a>, had an opportunity of examining personally the pilots who sailed upon those seas, and appears to have diligently employed his means of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a>. Following him, M. Gosselin states, that, owing to the variable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the winds, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a> is extremely slow in those latitudes; and that the space passed over in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a> and day did not exceed 400 or 500 stadia. When a day's sail only is mentioned, he therefore estimates it at not more than 250 stadia, or 25 miles. Upon this principle, he finds 7500 stadia from Aromata to Rhapta. Examining the distances along the coast, he finds 8000 stadia between Cape Guardafui and the mouth of the Doara,\u2014a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROXIMATION\">approximation</a> on so great a distance. Ptolemy, indeed, reckons Rhapta at about eight degrees of south <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LATITUDE\">latitude</a>; but, in the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, it is universally acknowledged that he has placed Aromata seven degrees too far south. Again, M. Gosselin conceives it to have been established that Ptolemy, following the error of Marinus, composed his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of only 500 stadia, instead of the real <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of 700. The degrees between Aromata and Rhapta must, therefore, be reduced two-sevenths. After these deductions are made, Rhapta <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> short of the equator, and nearly at the point to which we are conducted by the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of measurement.\n\nDr Vincent, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, (Peripius, I. 69-166), prefers the Peripius to any other source of intelligence. It is evidently, he says, the testimony of an eye-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WITNESS\">witness</a> who performed the voyage; it contains nothing marvellous or improbable, and its delineation of the coast corresponds better with that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> navigators than any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a>. He estimates the day's sail in that journal at 500 stadia, or 50 miles. Admitting Ptolemy's error as to the latitude of Aromata, he conceives that he corrected it in the course of the delineation. At Essina, under the line, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> from Brava is only 1\u00b0. At Rhapta, the difference from Quiloa is not quite 10\u00b0. The graduated distance from Aromata to Rhapta, according to the Peripius, is 19\u00b0 45\u2032. From Guardafui to Quiloa, according to D'Anville, is 20\u00b0 15\u2032,\u2014a coincidence almost too close. Still Dr Vincent rests his main argument on the correspondence of the features of the coast. He appeals, in particular, to the mention made in the Peripius of seven rivers, each at the distance of a day's sail from the other. This remarkable coincidence can be found nowhere, unless at the mouths of the great river Obii or Quillimanci, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> far beyond M. Gosselin's limits. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> does indeed seem pretty decisive; nor does that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> writer meet it with his usual intrepidity. He says, \"The author of the Peripius speaks of seven other harbours which he does not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a>. No trace of them remains.\" But the words in the Peripius are express: \u1f39\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03b9 \u03a0\u03bb\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9 (Geog. Grac. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINOR\">Minor</a>, I. 90.) The most formidable objection to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> appears to be this, that the ancients should have passed all the three Zanzibar islands without making the slightest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALLUSION\">allusion</a>, unless to one. This circumstance may have led Mr Pinkerton to fix upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PEMBA\">Pemba</a> as Menuthias. Mr Salt, who, with classical knowledge combined opportunities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> which fall to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOT\">lot</a> of few, expressed to us decidedly the same opinion. Pemba alone, he observed, corresponds exactly as to the\ndistance, the others being nearer. Mr Salt concurred also with D'Anville in viewing Cape Delgado as the Prasum of Ptolemy, and the farthest limit of ancient navigation.\n\n4. We have now to consider the knowledge of the ancients relative to the interior of this great continent.\n\nThe coast of Africa, situated on the Mediterranean, was more completely and intimately known to the ancients than it has been to the geographers of modern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. Its connection with the states of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a> and Rome was so close, as to make it form only part, as it were, of the same system. As we advance into the interior, this knowledge becomes gradually more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a>. Still, with regard to the countries watered by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGER\">Niger</a>, it was perhaps, on the whole, superior to that possessed by Europeans <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to the commencement of the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>.\n\nSo far back as the time of Herodotus, we find a notice respecting the eastern course of the Niger. That writer believed it to be the same river with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NILE\">Nile</a>,\u2014an opinion still prevalent in Africa, though it appears to be erroneous. He also states a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> between Africans and Ethiopians, which appears to coincide with the modern one between Moors and negroes. Beyond these few facts, the knowledge of Herodotus respecting the interior appears to have been exceedingly limited. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-WAR\">War</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>, however, gradually opened routes into these regions; and Alexandria, which became a great seat of geographical knowledge, afforded ample facilities for augmenting the stock of information. The best ancient description of the interior, is to be found in Ptolemy. It appears, however, that he was unacquainted with the extent of the Sahara; and, that he brought the territory of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NIGRITIA\">Nigritia</a> much too near to the coast of the Mediterranean. His ideas, likewise, do not seem to have been very precise, in regard to the Garamantes, whom Rennell has upon good grounds placed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEZZAN\">Fezzan</a>, though we suspect the ancients must have extended the term to the nations inhabiting the valley of the Gir. But his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">geography</a> displays an extensive and accurate acquaintance with the rivers of Africa. He has fixed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of the Nile too far south indeed, and even beyond the equator; but he assigns to it its real origin among the Mountains of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">Moon</a>. It was by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATA\">data</a> which he afforded, that D'Anville was enabled to ascertain the true sources of that great river. He has shewn that he was acquainted with the whole course of the Niger, and even with that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAMBIA\">Gambia</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENEGAL\">Senegal</a>. He has not, however, thrown much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> upon the celebrated question relative to the source and termination of the first mentioned stream: Major Rennell claims his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUFFRAGE\">suffrage</a> to its eastern course, while Mr Pinkerton, perhaps rather more plausibly, charges him with giving it a western direction. So far as we can discover, Ptolemy did not pay the smallest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to this circumstance, but considered merely the line of river-course. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> statement is, that the Niger \"joins together mount Thala and mount Mandrus.\" (Lib. IV. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>. 6.) If Ptolemy annexed any precise meaning to this very singular description, it could only, we apprehend, be that of two rivers, flowing from opposite points into one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> receptacle. He delineates also the course of another river called the Gir, almost equal to the Niger, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> known in ancient times. From its course and relative position to the Niger, there seems no room to hesitate in adopting the opinion of D'Anville and Rennell, that it is the river of Bornou, united, as we apprehend, with the Misselad of Browne, which we have no doubt is the same river, and forms certainly one continuous river-course.\n\nII. Among those branches of knowledge which were particularly encouraged by the Arabian princes, geography seems to have held a conspicuous place; and as Africa contained some of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> seats of Musulman power, that continent attracted a great share of their attention. The Arabian geographers were thus led to give particular descriptions of some regions in the interior, which have never been visited by Europeans, and, in regard to which, they still remain almost our only authorities. These considerations have induced us to examine their writings with much care; and not having met with any systematic attempt to estimate the extent and value of their knowledge respecting central Africa, we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">hope</a> that it will not be unacceptable to our readers to follow us into some details upon this curious subject.\n\nWe would observe in general, that the works of the Arabian geographers exhibit a remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> of correct and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> information, with meagre, unsatisfactory, and even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FABULOUS\">fabulous</a> details. The causes of some of these defects are clearly enough pointed out by themselves. Thus, Abulfeda complains, that it is \"only the Musulman provinces which they describe with any degree of accuracy.\" (Geogr. Graci Minoris, III. 21.) This, which to Abulfeda is a subject of regret, forms the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> of another Arabian geographer. \"Of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> and Ethiopians, says he, I have spoken little; for my innate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, and good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, made it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> for me to find in these people any thing deserving of praise, or even of mention.\" (Ibn Haukal, Oriental Geography.) In fact the Saracens were in a state of habitual warfare with every other people. They were separated from them by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> antipathy so deadly, as to exclude all interchange of ideas. The limit therefore of Moslem dominion will be always found to be likewise that of clear and accurate knowledge; after passing which, it gradually becomes faint, and gives place to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FABLE\">fable</a> and uncertainty.\n\nA general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> seems to have prevailed, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUBIA\">Nubia</a> was the point whence the information of the Arabians relative to central Africa was chiefly derived. This opinion rests solely on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> of Sionita and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-ERPENIUS\">Erpenius</a>, that Nubia was the native country of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EDRISI\">Edrisi</a>, the most copious of the Arabian writers on the subject of Africa. On that presumption, they published his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of the Nubian Geography, which it still retains. This idea, is treated by Gibbon with great contempt, and completely refuted by Hartmann. (Edrisi, Introd. 49. &c.) In fact, there is scarcely any district of Africa, which is described in a manner so meagre and unsatisfactory by the Arabians, and above all by Edrisi himself. Nubia was\nChristian; * and was therefore a country shut against Mahometan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>. The merchants of each country, instead of travelling into the territory of the other, brought their commodities to the opposite sides of the great cataract, where, having landed and made the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a>, they immediately reembarked. (Edrisi, 72.) But in the absence of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDIUM\">medium</a> of information, the Arabians had opened for themselves another, nearly unknown to the ancients. At some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, not quite ascertained, they had penetrated across the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a> to the eastern shores of the Niger. Attracted by the fertility of its banks, and above all by its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> sands, they were not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> of forming permanent settlements. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMIGRATION\">Emigration</a> and revolution continually swelled the tide; and in the course of one or two centuries, several great Mahometan kingdoms were established upon the Niger. Among these, Ghana, or Gana, held a decided pre-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMINENCE\">eminence</a>. It was the nearest point to Northern Africa; and it bordered immediately on Wangara, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> the overflowing of the Niger annually impregnated with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> commercial intercourse was soon established with the other Musulman states; and caravans, in every direction, traversed the vast expanse of the desert. Gana became their point of rendezvous, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> emporium of central Africa. The splendour of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">court</a> is described in glowing terms by the Arabian writers. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a>, built upon the lake, was adorned with masterpieces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCULPTURE\">sculpture</a>, and with glass windows, then a rare <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a>. The pomp of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOVEREIGN\">sovereign</a> is said to have surpassed that of any other Musulman potentate; and the circumstance, which above all excited admiration and envy, was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of native gold, which was placed immediately under the throne. Many of the neighbouring states, among which Wangara is particularly mentioned, were numbered as his subjects or tributaries. (Edrisi, 41-7. Ibn-al-Vardi, Notices, II. 37.)\n\nFrom these circumstances, it appears evident that Gana was the point whence chiefly emanated the knowledge of the Arabians relative to central Africa. It did not extend very far; for their settlements were then confined within narrower limits than now. Westwards, at the distance of about 400 miles, Tocrur and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SALA\">Sala</a> are described as flourishing commercial cities, situated on the Niger, and governed by a Mahometan sovereign. They seem to have formed the limit of precise knowledge; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of procuring a supply of salt had given a further line of sixteen days' journey to Ulil; which Edrisi describes as an island situated in the sea, at one day's sail from the mouth of the Nile of the negroes, or Niger. It is now a very general, and, we apprehend, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> opinion, that this sea of Edrisi must in fact have been an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INLAND\">inland</a> lake; and it seems, indeed, to be indicated as such by Scheabeddin. (Notices, II. 156.) The precise situation of this lake, and of the island of Ulil, will be a subject of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a>. Meanwhile, we shall observe, that no supposition has extended it much to the west of Tombuctoo. The countries beyond, watered by the Senegal, the Gambia, and the part of the Niger visited by Europeans, were entirely unknown, and were viewed as a wide expanse of trackless desert.\n\nTo the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EAST\">east</a> of Gana, the Arabs particularly describe Wangara, then celebrated over all Africa by the appellation of the \"country of gold.\" They represent it as nearly surrounded by branches of the Nile, which overflow it during the rainy season; and as containing two lakes adjacent to the cities of Reghehil and Semegonda. Cauga (now Fittre) they appear also to have been well acquainted with, though there is some difference of opinion, whether it belonged to Wangara or to Canem, (now Bornou.) Eastward from thence, their knowledge becomes indistinct; and, before reaching Nubia, seems to cease entirely.\n\nThe settlements of the Arabs, as well as their geographical knowledge, extended but a short distance to the south of the Niger. The Sahara they seem to have traversed in almost every direction, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SETTING\">setting</a> out chiefly from its western extremity. Gadamis, Segelmessa, and Vareklan, (the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> uncertain, but westmost of any,) are described as the customary routes, which led them to Gana, and the \"land of gold.\" (Bakui, Notices, II. 400, 405. Edrisi, 133-135.)\n\nIn regard to the origin of the Nile, and the first part of its course, the Arabians were excluded from the opportunities of direct observation. We cannot, however, agree with Hartmann, in thinking that they derived it from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABYSSINIA\">Abyssinia</a>, a country to which they were peculiarly strangers. We rather concur with Rennell and Pinkerton, who apprehend that their opinion nearly coincided with that of Ptolemy. The Arabians committed one very curious error, of which modern geographers have not been fully aware. They certainly considered the river of Bornou and the Nile of Egypt to be one and the same. Hartmann has remarked this in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of Scheabeddin; but has not observed, that all the rest entertained the very same idea.\u2020 Nor will this appear very wonderful, when all the circumstances are taken into consideration. The Arabs knew little of Nubia, nor had traced the course of the Nile above its confluence with the Tacazze. (Hartmann's Edrisi, 75, 76.) Observing then a great river running through Barbon northwards, which could reach the sea only by uniting with the Nile, it was not a very strained supposition, that it might, at some point, take a direction westward, and effect the supposed junction. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, however, of this opinion, the Arabs lost sight entirely of the Gir of Ptolemy, and recognized in Africa only two great rivers, the Nile of Egypt, and the Nile of the Negroes.\n\nFrom the circumstances now stated, we may form <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">Parallel</a> of\n\n---\n\n* See Bakui in Notices des Manuscrits de la Biblioth\u00e8que du Roi, II. 396.

Hence the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a> of Africa remained unexplored; for if an occasional adventurer made his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> across it, no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> was ever established. But they enjoyed the opportunity of tracing the origin, course, and termination of all the great African rivers.

The Arabs had a different and more limited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPHERE\">sphere</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>; but within it, their knowledge is more copious, precise, and satisfactory. Ptolemy's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of central Africa are good; but he does not afford the means of fixing a single position; while the materials furnished by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EDRISI\">Edrisi</a> have been familiarly used by the best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> geographers in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of maps of Africa. This does not, however, arise from any merit in the astronomical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">geography</a>, which, on the contrary, is extremely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFECTIVE\">defective</a>.

But the eastern coast, to an extent beyond any supposed limits of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> discovery, was not only explored, but colonized by them. Flourishing settlements were established at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MELINDA\">Melinda</a>, Mombaza, and at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOFALA\">Sofala</a>, called commonly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-GOLDEN\">Golden</a> Sofala. Vakvak, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Ouac Ouac, forms here the indistinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIMIT\">limit</a> of knowledge. The Arabs not only had never passed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol4.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> of Good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">Hope</a>, but had not even any idea of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a>. It appears, on the contrary, from the curious map of Edrisi, published by Dr Vincent, that, like Ptolemy, he extended it to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EAST\">east</a>, till it became contemporaneous with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHINA\">China</a>. This explains his placing the islands of Vakvak in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> of China\u2014a circumstance which causes much perplexity to Hartmann.\n\nIII. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> from the tenth to the fourteenth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, may be considered as the most flourishing era of Arabian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>. From that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> downwards, geographical discovery has been exclusively the boast of Europeans. The fifteenth century was a splendid era in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MARITIME\">maritime</a> enterprise. Africa was then circumnavigated, its form ascertained, and its coasts visited and colonized. But the geography of its interior, instead of advancing, became decidedly retrograde. The Portuguese, who almost wholly engrossed this department of inquiry, penetrated only at the two opposite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABYSSINIA\">Abyssinia</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONGO\">Congo</a>. By applying their observations upon these regions to almost the whole of Africa, and combining them with the often misunderstood notices of Edrisi, they formed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> materially erroneous. The Nile, instead of being traced, as in Ptolemy, to its real source, was supposed to rise in Abyssinia, and its southern and largest, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as longest branch, which descends from the Mountains of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">Moon</a>, was thus overlooked. They did not, however, on that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a>, abridge in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> the course of that celebrated river. They had extended Abyssinia immensely, so as to make it pass the southern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONTIER\">frontier</a> of Congo and Monomotapata, while the Mountains of the Moon were fixed mid-way between the tropic of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPRICORN\">Capricorn</a> and the Cape of Good Hope. The lake Zambre (Dembca) was thus placed about 30\u00b0 (upwards of 2000 miles) south of its real position,\u2014was made the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> source of the Nile, the Congo, and the Zambezi,\u2014and was described as \"the great mother and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> lady of all the African waters.\"* The Nile being thus derived from sources far beyond the equator, was considered as holding the longest course of any river in the known world. (Ramusio, I. 261.) The Niger still retained a mighty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> among the streams of this continent; but no part of it had yet been exposed to European observation. Proceeding on the principles of Leo and Edrisi, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAMBIA\">Gambia</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENEGAL\">Senegal</a> were generally believed to be the two mouths, by which, after traversing nearly the whole breadth of Africa, it fell into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCEAN\">ocean</a>. Some, following Edrisi's idea of its common source with the Nile, fixed upon the lake <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEMBEA\">Dembea</a>; the greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, with Leo, derived it from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> lake to the south of Bornou; while some \"holy men\" are said to have numbered it as one of the branches of the Gion, which took this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> after issuing out of Paradise. (Ludolfi Hist. Ethiop. Cadamosto in Ramusio.)\n\nAbout the commencement of the eighteenth century, the English and French began to form settlements on the Gambia and Senegal, and to ascend these rivers. This afforded to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> a new channel of information relative to the interior of Africa. The most noted English traveller into the interior during that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> was Francis Moore, an intelligent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, who, about 1720, spent several years on the Gambia. Fully impressed with the above-mentioned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> relative to the Niger, he pretends to find even on the Gambia, Edrisi's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> stations. Ulil is Joally, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> at the mouth of the river, which, it seems, really supplies its banks with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SALA\">Sala</a> is Barsally; Gana is Yani; and Wangara alone is higher than Europeans have yet reached. He was much disconcerted, however, by the intelligence brought <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> Stibbs, who had sailed sixty miles above Barraconda. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> reported, that the Senegal above Gallam became very small, while, as to the Gambia, twelve days above Barraconda, the natives assured him that \"fowls walked over it.\" He therefore infers, that the source of these rivers is \"nothing near so far in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> as by the geo-\n\n* See Map in Purchas's Pilgrims, IV. p. 738; also descriptions of Lopez, Merolla, &c. Ibid IV. 773, 774; II. 1021. It is remarkable that Sanson's map, 1696, is constructed nearly on the above principles.\ngraphers has been represented.\" As for the Niger, on being closely pressed, he fairly stated his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, \"that there was no Niger at all.\" This decision, however, is very ill received by Moore, who asks if it is probable that both Leo and Edrisi \"should affirm that there was so great a river as the Niger when there was no such river.\" (Moore's Travels, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, 1738, p. 298\u2014306. App. p. 6.)\n\nThe French meanwhile were more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> both in forming settlements and in making discoveries. Before 1714, they had gained such intelligence, as induced Delisle to construct his map of the world, with the Niger as a separate river from the Senegal, and flowing westwards. But it is to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> of D'Anville, read before the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences, about the year 1754, that we are to look for the first approaches to correct geography, in regard to the rivers of interior Africa. By combining the scanty notices of Ptolemy and Edrisi, with the narratives of modern travellers, he succeeded in forming an almost correct outline of African <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HYDROGRAPHY\">hydrography</a>. He showed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> into which the moderns had fallen, of conceiving the river of Abyssinia to be the Nile, and proved, both from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a> of the stream, and from ancient authority, the superior claims of the Bahr-el-Abiad. With regard to the Niger, instead of one great stream, running across Africa from east to west, and falling into the Atlantic, he recognizes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-THREE_RIVERS\">three rivers</a>, 1. The Senegal, well known, and distinct from the Niger; 2. The Niger itself; of which he says,\u2014\u201cWe are actually informed, that the river of Senegal, considered hitherto as the lower part of the Niger, and its outlet into the ocean, is different from another river that lies deeper in the interior of Africa; and it is even inferred, from the report of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol7.html#article-NEGROES\">negroes</a>, that this river flows in a direction contrary to that of the Senegal, or from west to east.\u201d He finds no ancient authority upon which to rest this opinion, except the single testimony of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERODOTUS\">Herodotus</a>. Upon this principle, however, he constructs his map, fixing the commencement of the Niger at the Nigritis Palus of Ptolemy, and its termination at the lake of Reghebil, in Wanga.\n\n3. Another river, flowing in a contrary direction, on the opposite side of Africa, known now as the river of Bornou,\u2014the Gir of Ptolemy, and, as D'Anville erroneously supposes, the \u201cNile of the Negroes\u201d of Edrisi. He seems strongly impressed with the idea of a communication between this river and the Egyptian Nile, which, however, Browne's route has proved to be a mistake. D'Anville fails chiefly in regard to the geography of the Arabians, none of whose writings, except those of Edrisi, had been at that time translated. He unaccountably supposed that Edrisi describes two rivers under the names of the Niger, and the Nile of the Negroes; whereas, in fact, the latter is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> by which he designates the former; the word Niger nowhere occurring in his work. Hence, while D'Anville has designated one river (that of Bornou) as Edrisi's Nile of the Negroes, he has placed upon another all the countries and cities appropriated to it by that writer. Upon the whole, however, his map of central Africa is an admirable performance, and formed a new era in the geography of this continent.\n\nFrom this time, D'Anville's system, both with regard to the Nile and the Niger, was generally adopted by the higher <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a> of geographers. Differences of opinion, however, still prevailed, and, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> particularly, a stand was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> made for the system, which made the Gambia and Senegal the channels by which the Niger fell into the ocean. Kitchin, nevertheless, composed his map upon D'Anville's basis. In 1788, we find a Mr Barnes reporting to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMITTEE\">Committee</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNCIL\">Council</a> on Africa, that \u201cthe Niger rises on the eastern extremity of the mountains of Govinea, and discharges itself into a large lake, the name of which he does not recollect.\u201d He was then asked as to \u201cthe transport of European goods up the Senegal and down the Niger, or of African goods up the Niger and down the Senegal\u201d (Reports concerning the Trade to Africa, and particularly the Trade in Slaves, 1788. Part I. Slaves); and thus it appears that the real state of this question was perfectly understood by the committee. During this period, however, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APATHY\">apathy</a> prevailed respecting the exploration of interior Africa; nor were any important contributions made to it, except those afforded by the travels of Mr Bruce. In this respect the African <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">Association</a> operated a most auspicious change, not only by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> exertions, which were great, but by the enthusiasm which they kindled, and which led even private individuals to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLECT\">collect</a> and communicate information on the subject. At the time when our former article was written, the result of this new impulse had already appeared in the travels of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-PARK\">Park</a>, Hornemann, and Browne, of which we there gave so copious an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a>, as to render any repetition unnecessary. It only remains to take a view of the discoveries, by no means unimportant, which have been since made; after which we shall be prepared to investigate those points of African geography which still remain unsettled and obscure.\n\nIV. 1. Some interesting information has been recently laid before the public concerning that part of coeries in Africa which lies northwards from the Cape of Good Hope, beyond the country of the Hottentots and Ca\u00efres. It was first visited by two gentlemen of the names of Trutter and Sommerville, the substance of whose observations is given by Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARROW\">Barrow</a> in the Appendix to his Voyage to Cochinchina. The next visitor was Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LICHTENSTEIN\">Lichtenstein</a>, who communicated the result of his observations, first in the Weymar Ephemerides, and since more fully in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of his Travels in Africa. Lastly, Dr Campbell, a missionary traveller, who penetrated to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEETAKOO\">Leetakoo</a>, has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> given to the public a volume of travels in these regions.\n\nThe Boshuanas, Bectjuanas, or Bootchuanas, are a Boshuanas, very numerous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>, stated by Dr Lichtenstein to extend from the 25th to the 20th degree of south <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LATITUDE\">latitude</a>, or, as he elsewhere expresses it, thirty or forty journeys <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> from the river Kuruhman. In fact, however, the northern limit has never been explored. They are evidently of the same stock with the Ca\u00efres, but do not quite equal them in bodily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> and strength. On the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, they are much superior in civilization and the arts of life. They reside in towns of considerable magnitude. Leetakoo, ca-\npital of the Matchappin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a>, has been most particularly described. Mr Barrow's informants reckoned the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> at from 10,000 to 15,000 souls. Lichtenstein mentions, that, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the secession of part of the tribe, it had been reduced to less than half that number, and did not exceed 5000. Mr Campbell, however, counted 1500 houses, which, at five to each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, would give 7500, besides 1000 houses situated in the outposts. This calculation seems to have been very carefully made.\n\nThe Boshuanas are governed by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a>, whose power is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a>, and not subjected to any regular limits, though it is very mildly exercised. Quarrels are commonly decided by single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMBAT\">combat</a>, without his interference; but if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> is referred to him, he not only takes cognizance of it, but inflicts the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> with his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>. He commands in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, and his sons are employed in all the embassies to neighbouring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>.\n\nThe Boshuanas pay considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>; their fields are commonly fenced round; they cultivate the Caffre millet, two sorts of beans, gourds, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> melons. The labour, however, as usual among barbarous tribes, is performed by the women, who dig the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> spades; the men merely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> the flocks, hunt, and go to war. Fish, though abundant, are viewed with abhorrence as an article of food. Their clothing consists entirely of the skins of animals, carefully tanned; and the greatest part of their body is covered. Their houses are circular, formed of the trunks and branches of the Mimosa, cemented within by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> of clay and cow-dung. There is an inner apartment for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, and an outer one for slaves and domestics. Polygamy is generally practised; and it is common for the rich to have four or five wives. Mr Barrow asserts that there are no slaves; but this is expressly contradicted by Lichtenstein, who states that they are in considerable numbers, and assist the women in their labours, but are mildly treated.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> among themselves seem tranquil, mild, and courteous; but they are fond of war, which they carry on with ferocity. Their great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> is to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> the cattle of their neighbours. Mr Campbell having, with a view to religious instruction, asked, \"For what end man had been made?\" the answer was, \"For plundering expeditions.\" After having killed an enemy, they carry off a small part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>, which, at a solemn festival, they afterwards devour.\n\nThe tribe immediately south of Leetakoo, is the Wanketzens, said by Campbell to be more numerous, and to carry agriculture to higher <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a>. Lichtenstein gives rather an opposite statement. The Morolongs, the Chojas, and the Marootzees, are also numbered among the most powerful and numerous of the Boshuan tribes. The Macquanas, however, the most distant, appear to surpass all the rest. They were described to Lichtenstein as like the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> in multitude, and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> is said by Mr Campbell to be three times the size of Leetakoo. They are particularly skilled in works in iron, and in the manufacture of arms. It was through them that the inhabitants of Leetakoo had first heard of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> men;\u2014probably the Portuguese on the east coast.\n\nOn the first news of these interesting discoveries, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Caledon, then governor of the Cape of Good Hope, took <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> to extend them. With laudable zeal, he sent a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PARTY\">party</a>, consisting of Dr Cowan and Mr Denovan, and twenty other persons, to explore Africa as far as Mosambique. The first accounts from them were favourable; but a silence of seven years afforded room for apprehensions, which were confirmed by the information collected by Mr Campbell at Leetakoo. After leaving that place, they had proceeded into the country of the Wanketzens, by whom they were at first well received. That people, however, whose character seems marked by ferocity and treachery, were only watching the opportunity of attack. Dr Cowan and Mr Denovan having imprudently gone to bathe, leaving part of their companions at the waggons, and another to guard the cattle, the natives took advantage of their separation; they attacked, first the party at the waggons, then those who guarded the cattle, and, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> of all, the two chiefs of the expedition. The whole perished on the spot, with the exception of one, who also was afterwards taken and put to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>.\n\nIn returning from Leetakoo, Mr Campbell crossed to the west coast, along the banks of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">Orange</a> river, a tract which had hitherto remained unexplored. He found it another Sahara, a complete desert of sand and rock. The rocks rise often in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> form resembling walls. One wall extended about thirty miles without interruption. A few kraals of Coranas are thinly scattered over this desolate region. The river seems on no occasion to overflow its banks, so as to communicate any fertility to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a> waste. The country, for an unknown extent northwards, exhibits a similar aspect.\n\n2. The recent work of Mr Salt has thrown considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> upon the geography of Eastern Africa, respecting which nothing authentic had been published for several centuries. That traveller visited the Portuguese settlements of Mosambique, Mesuril, and Sofala, which appear to have greatly declined from the importance which they once possessed. Mosambique is situate upon a small island, lying directly across the mouth of a deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BAY\">bay</a>. The situation is advantageous, and the place must have been once very strong; but the eighty pieces of cannon by which it is now defended are marked with the rust of antiquity; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GARRISON\">garrison</a> consists of a few confined felons, and invalids. The population of the town of Mosambique is reckoned by Mr Salt at 2800, of whom 500 are Portuguese, 800 the descendants of Arab settlers, and Banians, and the rest Negroes. So slender and mixed a population is altogether inadequate to preserve the colony in a respectable state. The appointments of the governor and inferior officers are greatly too small, and expose them to the temptation of engaging in traffic, and other transactions ill suited to their station. Upon the whole, the state of affairs is such, that a trader at Mocha declared, that, with a hundred stout Arabian soldiers, he could dispossess the Portuguese of the colony.\n\nThere is also a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>-house at Mesuril, a pleasant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VILLAGE\">village</a>, situated on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENINSULA\">peninsula</a> of Caboceiro, which lies opposite to the island of Mosam-\nbique; and supplies the town with most of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> consumed in it.\n\nSofala is described as a miserable village; but the country round is extremely fertile, and supplies exquisite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> to the inhabitants of Mosambique. Small forts are also kept up at Inhambane and Cape Corrientes, for the purpose of collecting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IVORY\">ivory</a>, which is abundantly supplied in the neighbouring forests.\n\nThe native race in the immediate neighbourhood of Mosambique is that of the Makooa, or Makoonana, already alluded to. It comprises a number of very powerful tribes, extending southwards to Melinda, and north to the mouth of the river Zambezi. They are described as an athletic race of people, very warlike, and extremely hostile to the Portuguese. They sometimes carry their incursions even into the peninsula of Caboceiro. The Portuguese maintain their ground chiefly by alliances with other native tribes who are hostile to the Makoonana.\n\nThe principal settlements of the Portuguese in the interior are on the great river Zambezi, the mouth of which is three or four days' sail from Mosambique. Sena, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of these settlements, lies about two hundred and forty-seven miles up the river, on its southern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a>. It contains about two thousand inhabitants, and is protected by a strong fort. The principal mart for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>, however, is at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANICA\">Manica</a>, about twenty days' journey south-west from Sena. About sixty leagues above Sena is Tete, which contains a depot for merchandise, and is considered the best regulated settlement on the Zambezi. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>'s journey beyond Tete is Zumbo, the remotest settlement of the Portuguese, and where it is only by the permission of the natives that they maintain a small factory.\n\nThe trade of Mosambique has declined. Its exports consist of gold, ivory, and slaves. The annual number of the latter is stated at four thousand. This traffic, however, has diminished, in consequence of the British prohibition, which has shut the markets of the Cape of Good Hope, the Isles of France and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOURBON\">Bourbon</a>, and Batavia. Ivory and gold bear very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> prices. The former is stated at from Ls. 24 to Ls. 21, 15s. per hundred. Gold dust is at Ls. 3, 5s. the ounce avoirdupois. Provisions are in abundance, and at a moderate rate. The imports consist of what is usually required in a tropical colony; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol8.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of dress, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FURNITURE\">furniture</a>, and ornament; arms and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMMUNITION\">ammunition</a>; teas; and cloths. Four or five vessels come annually from the Portuguese settlements in Malabar; and it was thought that a small British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARGO\">cargo</a> might also be disposed of in the months of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a>, May, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a> on imports is twenty per cent. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AD\">ad</a> valorem; with other charges, which amount to about five per cent. more.\n\nWe were informed by Mr Salt, that the present maps and descriptions of the eastern part of the continent in general are almost wholly imaginary. Thus, the great empire of Monomujii, or Nimeamay, which is made to fill nearly the whole breadth of Africa, is derived from a tribe behind Mosambique, called the Monjous. That <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a> of mountains, which makes so conspicuous a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> in our maps, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of the Spine of the World, is not believed by Mr Salt to exist. He <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> persons who came from the lake Maravi, without having encountered any mountains on their route. In general, Mr Salt observed that it was usual in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> to extend every district far beyond its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> limits. The names of small towns and villages are currently transferred to a vast extent of territory behind them. In this manner have been formed the kingdoms of Sofala, Inhambane, Mosambique, and Querimba. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADEL\">Adel</a>, which makes so conspicuous a figure in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> and geography of Africa, does not appear to have any existence. Its alleged site is occupied by the tribes of the Somauli, concerning whom Mr Salt obtained much information, and who appear to have made considerable advances in civilization. The name of Adel seems derived from the tribes of the Adiel, who inhabit, not the place assigned to that kingdom, but a more northern position on the shores of the bay of Zeila. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTIGUOUS\">Contiguous</a> to them, on the west, is the kingdom of Hurur, which seems generally associated with the Somauli in the wars carried on against Abyssinia.\n\n3. Dr Seetzen, a German physician residing at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALEXANDRIA\">Alexandria</a>, had lately an opportunity of receiving some information from two natives of the interior of Africa, who were on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PILGRIMAGE\">pilgrimage</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECCA\">Mecca</a>.* One of them, Abdallah, was a native of Bornou; the other, named Hassan, was from the western part of Darfoo. The former gave a very magnificent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>, probably a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> exaggerated, of his native country. The city of Bornou he represented to be of such magnitude, that \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CAIRO\">Cairo</a> was a trifle compared to it;\" and that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> was insufficient to travel from one end to the other. This great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> is probably produced by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> mode of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>, not in streets, but by single houses, with gardens, and even fields intervening. The mosques are innumerable, built of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, and mounted with towers, seven of which appear on the principal one. The schools are numerous in all the cities, particularly in Bornou. They are held in the mosques, and are supported at the expense of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SULTAN\">Sultan</a>. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> is of immense extent, and he goes every Friday in state to the principal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOSQUE\">mosque</a>, where he distributes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALMS\">alms</a> to the indigent. Within a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> of Bornou there flows a river, which Abdallah described to be as large as the Nile, and, like it, to overflow its banks. It is navigated by vessels of considerable dimensions, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> sails and oars. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> is sandy, and requires <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IRRIGATION\">irrigation</a>; but it produces in abundance <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol19.html#article-RICE\">rice</a>, and a great variety of vegetable productions. The forests are very extensive, and contain lions, orang-outangs, camelopards, and other wild animals. There are numerous negro and Abyssinian slaves, who, whenever they arrive, are converted to the Mahometan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>. This is effected by flagellation, which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> until the person cries out, \"Mahomet is the prophet of God;\" when he is immediately ranked among <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> Musulmen. Abdallah asserted also, that there were a few Christian slaves at Bornou.\n\nAlthough Abdallah shews an evident disposition\n\n* See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MALTE_BRUN\">Malte-Brun</a> Annales des Voyages, XIX. 164\u2014184. XXI. 145\u2014179.\nto exalt his native country, there seems no doubt that Bornou is the most extensive and powerful kingdom of central Africa. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BERGOO\">Bergoo</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BEGHERME\">Begherme</a>, Wangars, and Cashna, are tributaries to its Sultan. He appears however, to boast of sway over regions to which his dominion has never really extended; as Hassan mentions among his subject countries Darfoor, Senaar, and part of Barbary.\n\nFrom the native of Darfoor, some information was received concerning Bergoo, (which he called Mobba,) an extensive country between Bornou and Darfoor. It appears to be considerably inferior, both in populousness and civilization, to Bornou. The capital, Hara, or Wara, is about three times the size of Bulak, a suburb of Cairo. The houses are built of wood and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>; only some of the Darfoor merchants have them of stone. The inhabitants are chiefly Mahometan negroes. Natron and sal gem are produced in considerable quantities, and exported to Cairo. No grain is raised, except durra and millet, with each of which they make an intoxicating liquor. Three days' journey to the west of Wara, there passes a river, (doubtless the Misselad of Browne,) said to be larger than the Nile, and, like it, to overflow its banks.\n\nBegherme is an extensive country, situated to the west of Bergoo, and, till of late, governed by its own Sultan, though dependent upon that of Bornou. According to the statement of Hassan, this monarch had espoused his sister. The Sultan of Bornou, scandalized by this incestuous connexion, sent orders to renounce it, or to await his vengeance. An insulting answer being returned, the offended <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOVEREIGN\">sovereign</a> immediately ordered his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VASSAL\">vassal</a>, the Sultan of Mobba, (Bergoo,) to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-MARCH\">march</a> his troops into Begherme, and annex it to his territories. The enterprize succeeded; the Sultan of Begherme was taken prisoner, and his dominions annexed to those of Bergoo.\n\n4. The account of the Gold coast, published by Mr Meredith in 1812, exhibits a view of some important changes in the aspect of that part of Africa. The Fantees were known to be the principal people upon this coast; but immediately behind are the Ashantees, a more numerous and powerful nation, hitherto known only by report. It appears that they had long entertained a desire to open a communication with the coast, for which an opportunity was at last afforded. In 1806, two chiefs belonging to the kingdom of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ASSIN\">Assin</a>, a dependence upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASHANTEE\">Ashantee</a>, rebelled, and, being defeated, took refuge in the Fantee country. The Ashantee monarch pursued them; at the same time intimating, that he entertained no hostile views against the natives. The Fantees, however, joined their force to that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUGITIVE\">fugitive</a> chiefs; and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> ensued, in which they were completely routed. The Ashantees marched down in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIUMPH\">triumph</a> upon Anamaboe, where the English have one of their principal forts. In their way they destroyed the town of Cormantine, and possessed themselves of the Dutch fort there. The Anamahoes, meanwhile, used no means of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>, and suffered the Ashantee <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> to approach within three miles. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALARM\">alarm</a> being then given, all their forces were hastily collected; and the English, from the fort, witnessed, with no little anxiety, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> which followed. It quickly appeared that the Fantees were inferior, both in numbers and skill; and their army fled into the town in the utmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a>. The Ashantees followed, and pursued them to the beach, where they vainly endeavoured to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> their vessels. A dreadful slaughter ensued, in which upwards of eight thousand are supposed to have perished. The English had imagined, that the mere discharge of a few cannon over their heads would have intimidated and deterred the Ashantees from entering the town; but, after accomplishing its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a>, these barbarians, undismayed, and upwards of twenty thousand strong, turned their arms against the fort. The garrison did not exceed fourteen men, and was soon reduced to eight. Yet such was the good condition of the fort, and the firmness of this small body, that, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of the day, they were still able to oppose a stout resistance; and the enemy, overawed by this vigorous defence, did not renew the attack on the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, nor even oppose the entrance of a small reinforcement from Cape Coast. A negociation having been opened, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a> was soon concluded, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMICABLE\">amicable</a> visits interchanged. The Ashantees were found to be a people greatly superior to the Fantees, both in numbers and in civilization; and they seemed particularly anxious to open a commercial intercourse with the English. Want of provisions, and the inroads of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>, obliged them soon to return to their own country. They have since made several inroads, and particularly one, on a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a>, in 1811; but the Fantees, though always routed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a>, have hitherto succeeded, by their knowledge of the country, and other causes, in preventing them from forming any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> establishment.\n\n5. The fullest description which has yet appeared of the great central city of Tombuctoo and its vicinity, is that appended to Mr Grey Jackson's Account of the Empire of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOROCCO\">Morocco</a>. This narrative, perhaps too highly rated by some eminent critics, is regarded by others as utterly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FABULOUS\">fabulous</a>. The able editor of the lately published account of Park's last unfortunate expedition has wholly rejected Mr Jackson's details, upon the ground that they are solely derived from native travellers and merchants; and he broadly lays down the principle, that African <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> is not to be admitted in geographical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISQUISITION\">disquisition</a>. Were this rule admitted, all modern knowledge of central Africa, and, in particular, all the information collected by the African Association, with the single exception of Mr Park's communications, would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> to be thrown entirely aside; but we confess, that we cannot discover any good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> for such a sweeping proscription. The travelling merchants of Africa, though destitute of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>, yet visiting a variety of countries, and being frequently placed in critical exigencies, acquire a cultivation of mind superior to that possessed by the same class in Europe. The general tests of evidence are, no doubt, to be carefully applied in regard to their communications. Attention must be paid to the qualifications of the narrator, to his means of knowledge, and to his having no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> in disguising the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>. It must be very desirable also to have more than one independent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WITNESS\">witness</a> to the same fact. But, upon the whole, we scarcely recollect an instance in which the testimony\nof respectable Africans has proved materially erroneous.\n\nTombuctoo, according to the information collected by Mr Jackson, is situated on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, surrounded by sandy eminences. The houses are spacious, and built in the quadrangular form. They have no upper apartments, nor even any windows, being lighted by throwing open the doors, which are wide and lofty.\u2020 The inhabitants are said to possess an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEGANCE\">elegance</a> and suavity of manners not known in the north of Africa; and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to their country is such, that they never fail to return to it as soon as circumstances permit. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-POLICE\">police</a> is excellent; it is managed by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVAN\">divan</a> of twelve Alemma, who are elected every three years, and then fall into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of the people. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOLERATION\">Toleration</a> is said to be exercised towards every class except the Jews, who are either excluded from the city, or obliged, while in it, to adopt the outward profession of Mahometanism.\n\nAmong the commodities brought to Tombuctoo, Mr Jackson mentions gold rings of Wangara\u2014the first modern notice that has occurred to us of a trade so celebrated in the time of the Arabians. Mr Jackson mentions the countries of Lamlam and Melli, not in the erroneous position of Leo, but as fixed by the Arabs; and adds, that they are reported to be inhabited by one of the lost tribes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISRAEL\">Israel</a>. This report, which certainly savours of the marvellous, derives, however, some sort of countenance from the statements of Kircher and Edrisi,\u2014purporting that a colony of Jews, which first settled on the shores of the Niger, afterwards removed to this country; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a> probably before the arms of the Saracens. (Hartmann, 37.)\n\nIn regard to the sovereignty of Tombuctoo, Mr Jackson has committed at least an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANACHRONISM\">anachronism</a>. He states, that, in 1800, it was subject to Woolo, king of Bambarra. But from Park it appears, that, in 1796 and 1805, the king of Bambarra was Mansong, and Tombuctoo independent. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a>'s journal, to be afterwards noticed, indeed mentions, that Woolo (or Wolloo) was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREDECESSOR\">predecessor</a> to Mansong, and a distinguished <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WARRIOR\">warrior</a>; so that he may at one time have held Tombuctoo in subjection; but it could not be in 1800.\n\nWe shall conclude this part of our subject with some account of the last expedition of the great explorer of the interior of Africa. After a number of delays, occasioned by ministerial changes and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OFFICIAL\">official</a> difficulties, Mr Park set sail on the 30th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1805. On the 28th March he arrived in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> of Goree, and having made the necessary preparations, and engaged a body of men from the garrison to accompany him, he set out from Kayee on the 27th April following. He was obliged to remain six days at Pisania, in order to procure some articles, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of which had not been foreseen. Proceeding thence on the 11th of May, he reached Madina, capital of the kingdom of Wooli, and on the 15th was on the banks of the Gambia. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> had as yet been favourable; and no obstacle presented itself, unless from the eagerness of the natives to obtain a larger share than he could prudently give, of the valuable articles which he carried along with him. By a happy mixture, however, of firmness and moderation, he always succeeded in extricating himself from these embarrassments without coming to extremities. He left Bammakoo on the 13th of May, and for some time held a prosperous course. The men continued in good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, and two who had been affected with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DYSENTERY\">dysentery</a>, were fast recovering. But the rainy season at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> approached, and those who were on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a> speedily relapsed. In a few days twelve were on the sick <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIST\">list</a>. No sooner was the expedition perceived to be in a sickly state, than the natives conceived hopes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> it to their advantage. Clouds of thieves hovered round, and, at every moment of distress, rushed forward to snatch whatever had been left exposed. By the 6th of July the whole party were in a state of sickness, and several affected with mental derangement. On the 27th July four men lay down, and refused to go farther. Mr Park was himself very sick and faint, and seems to have been on the point of yielding to despair, when he was cheered with the view of some distant mountains to the south-east. \"The certainty that the Niger washed the southern base of these mountains made him forget his fever; and he thought of nothing but how to climb over their blue summits.\" Three weeks more of incessant effort and distress brought him to the wished for object; for coming to the brow of a hill, he once more saw the Niger \"rolling its immense stream along the plain.\"\n\nIn this journey, Mr Park, after leaving the village of Fankia, changed his former route for one more to the north, through Konkodoo and Fooladoo, near the southern frontier of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KAARTA\">Kaarta</a>. He does not state the reason, but his editor conjectures, with great likelihood, that it was to avoid the Jallonka wilderness. This new route gave him an opportunity of observing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of washing for gold. A woman collected in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CALABASH\">calabash</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of sand and water; and having cleared it of the large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEBBLES\">pebbles</a>, agitated the whole with a rotatory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>. The baser particles being thus thrown out, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> substance remained, resembling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a>; this is called gold rust. On its being further agitated, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> specks began to appear, which were the grains of gold. In two pounds of sand, twenty-three of these particles were found. The quantity of gold rust is in general forty times that of the gold. It was stated that pieces were sometimes obtained as large as the fist. Mr Park had afterwards an opportunity of seeing the mode of smelting and forming it into rings. It was performed by the mere action of fire, without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLUX\">flux</a> or mixture whatever.\n\nThis, of course, applies only to facts which have fallen under their sphere of observation; not to opinions, (such as that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IDENTITY\">identity</a> of the Nile and the Niger,) which relate to distant objects, and would require a large mass of evidence to enable them to decide.\n\n\u2020 Captain Blankett states, on the contrary, that they are two or three stories high. Report of Committee of Council on Africa, &c. 1788.\nMr Park was particularly struck with the scenery of Dindikoo. The villages on the mountains, he says, are romantic beyond anything he ever saw. \"They are built in the most delightful glens; and while the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a> rolls in awful grandeur over their heads, they can look from their tremendous precipices over all the wild and woody plain, which extends from the Falme to the Black river.\"\n\nMr Park arrived on the Niger in a situation, and with prospects, far different from those which he had fondly anticipated. Of forty-four persons whom he had brought with him from Pisania, there remained only six soldiers, and one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARPENTER\">carpenter</a>, all in the most infirm state of health, and one of them deranged. Such circumstances might well have deterred the boldest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> from plunging farther into the depths of unknown and hostile regions. But Park never seems to have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> a moment's hesitation. As soon as a canoe could be hired, he set sail for Marraboo, where he arrived on the 23rd. He then sent forward his guide Isaaco to Sego, to request of Mansong, king of Bambarra, permission to pass through his territories. Mansong immediately dispatched his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIME\">prime</a>-minister Modibinne, to ask his motives for coming into Bambarra. Park made a very judicious reply, in which he particularly set forth the advantages which Bambarra would receive from the direct importation of English goods, instead of receiving them by the circuitous route of Morocco and Tombuctoo. Mansong, whose whole conduct seems to have been liberal, soon returned an answer, in which he gave full permission to travel through his dominions in any direction, and to build boats at whatever point might be deemed most advisable.\n\nNo wish, however, being expressed for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> interview, Park immediately proceeded to Sansanding, which he fixed upon for the construction of his vessel. Here he resided for two months, and enjoyed a better opportunity than had ever before occurred, of observing the economy of an African city, and the mode of conducting trade in this part of the continent. The result exhibits a favourable view of its progress in civilization. The arrangements for the convenience of trade, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of employments, appear to be carried to greater perfection, than in any European town of the same magnitude. The market-place is a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>, and the stalls on which the different articles are exposed, are shaded by mats from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of the sun. In general, each stall is appropriated to a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMODITY\">commodity</a>. Some contain beads; others <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIGO\">indigo</a>; others wood-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASHES\">ashes</a>; and one was observed with nothing but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTIMONY\">antimony</a> in small bits. Other articles enumerated are salt, scarlet, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-TOBACCO\">tobacco</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMBER\">amber</a>, silks from Morocco, sulphur, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>, and silver rings, and bracelets.

Jimmie is not situated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGER\">Niger</a>, but at the confluence of the Nimma and Miniana. He learned that the northern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a> of the river was occupied by the Moors at Tombuctoo only, and in other places by native tribes, called the Soorks, Mahinga, and Tuarick.\n\nIn the course of his residence here, five more of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PARTY\">party</a> died, among whom was Mr Alexander Anderson, his near relation and intimate friend, whose fate he deplores in the most pathetic terms. \"No event,\" says he, \"which took <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> during the journey, ever threw the smallest gloom over my mind, till I laid Mr Anderson in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a>. I then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> myself as if left a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> lonely and friendless among the wilds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>.\" He had now with him only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">Lieutenant</a> Martyn, and three soldiers, of whom one was deranged; yet he writes to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Camden: \"Though all the Europeans who are with me should die, and though I were myself half dead, I would still persevere.\"\u2014\"I shall set sail to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EAST\">east</a> with the fixed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> to discover the termination of the Niger, or perish in the attempt.\" One circumstance which tended to confirm him in this enthusiastic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a>, was an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> which he had eagerly imbibed, that the Niger was the same river with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONGO\">Congo</a>, and that a few months <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> its stream would bring him to the Atlantic.\n\nPark sailed from Sansanding; and accounts of his progress were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> anxiously looked for. It was not till 1806, that some unfavourable rumours reached the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> by means of the native traders. As these gradually increased, Governor Maxwell, with a laudable anxiety, began to consider the means of inquiring into their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>; and he was fortunate enough to engage the guide Isaaco, to proceed on an expedition of inquiry. It so happened, that Isaaco, near Sansanding, met with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> named Amadi Fatouma, whom Park had taken with him as a guide down the Niger. From him he received a journal containing the particulars of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Mr Park. The correctness of this narrative, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as the fidelity of the guide, have been called in question on very plausible grounds. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> of time which has now elapsed, renders it vain to doubt that this illustrious traveller must have perished on his voyage down the Niger.\n\nV. We shall now take a view of the questions of the\nwhich yet remain to be solved in regard to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">geography</a> of this continent. These may be chiefly classed under the three following heads: 1. The course of the Niger beyond Tombuctoo, and its termination. 2. The course of the river, called by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMY\">Ptolemy</a>, the Gir. 3. The precise source of the Egyptian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NILE\">Nile</a>, and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a>, if any, with the Niger.\n\n1. The Niger, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> of Mr Park and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJOR\">Major</a> Houghton, rises at Sankari, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONTIER\">frontier</a> of Manding. Thence it is ascertained, by ocular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>, to pursue a course of about three hundred miles to Silla. Then, by undoubted information, it flows four hundred miles farther to Houssa. Positive testimony here deserts us, unless at the single point of the ferry in Cassina; but all accounts, both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a>, seem to agree in stating, that there is a continuous river-course from thence to the eastern extremity of Wangara, being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> hundred and seventy geographical miles; which makes an entire course of sixteen hundred and seventy. (Rennell, Illustrations of Park, chap. vi.) In Wangara it forms several lakes, and that country is entirely surrounded and intersected by its branches. It would appear from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EDRISI\">Edrisi</a>, as if there were a communication between these waters and the lake of Kauga, undoubtedly the same described to Mr Browne under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of Fitr\u00e9.\n\nThere is thus no doubt of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> stream from the source of the Niger in Manding, to the eastern extremity of Wangara. The next question is as to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> in which it flows. This is established to be from west to east, by ocular observation, as far as Silla; by highly probable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> as far as Houssa; and Major Rennell undertakes to prove that it follows the same course as far as Wangara. He quotes the testimony of a Moorish merchant, who had visited Houssa, and told Mr Beaufoy, that persons sailed thence to Ghinny (Gana) still with the stream. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> given by Edrisi, of Wangara, and partly also of Gana, is that of a country environed, intersected, and, during the rainy season, inundated by the waters of the Niger. These waters, therefore, spread over this extensive surface, and partly formed into lakes, may, he conceives, be entirely evaporated. It is possible, however, that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> may flow still farther eastward, and be lost in the lake of Fitr\u00e9. (Illustrations of Hornemann, chap. 3.)\n\nThis opinion, at one time generally received, has of late been strongly controverted, and other conjectures of a very opposite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> brought forward. One, which seems very prevalent in Africa, is, that the Niger flows eastward, till it joins the Egyptian Nile, with which it forms one and the same river. We shall reserve, till we treat of the Nile itself, the reasons which seem to throw <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> discredit upon this opinion. But another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>, which has just attracted great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, is that so zealously adopted by Mr Park,\u2014the hypothesis that it joins the Congo, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-ZAIRE\">Zaire</a>. This opinion certainly deserves consideration, both from the great name by which it is supported, and from the influence it may have upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> enterprizes of discovery. We may premise, that Mr Park's opinion was not derived from any facts observed by himself, but was adopted from a Mr Maxwell, an African trader, who had examined the Congo, and made a chart of its lower extremity.*\n\nThe first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> on which the Congo is identified with the Niger is its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a>, which seems indeed to be stupendous. It is stated to be ten miles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> near its mouth, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLOOD\">flood</a> which it discharges into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> to freshen the waters for upwards of thirty miles. These facts, which had been nearly forgotten in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, were well known and repeated, even with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXAGGERATION\">exaggeration</a>, by the Portuguese, during their era of discovery. Lopez and Merolla describe it as almost thirty miles broad at its entrance, and as freshening the waters to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> sometimes of eighty miles. (Atley's Collection, III. 296.) It is farther stated by Mr Maxwell, that it swells considerably, some time after the Niger is in flood, and before any rains have fallen to the south of the equator. Hence, he infers, that its sources <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> far to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>; and this, combined with its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> magnitude, and the mystery which involves the termination of the Niger, is conceived to establish a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>, that the two rivers are one and the same.\n\nTo this hypothesis it is objected by the able editor Objections of Park's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> Journal, that we should thus assign to this Hypothesis the Niger a course of upwards of 4000 miles; a highly improbable length, and which would make it by much the largest river in the known world. But this argument does not appear to us decisive, since a great river, once formed, must continue to flow till it finds a receptacle. We attach much more importance to the next observation,\u2014that the Niger could not reach the Congo but by crossing that great central <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a> of mountains, which, according to various concurrent testimonies, extends across the whole breadth of Africa.\u2020 It cannot be denied indeed, that so powerful an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a> might effect a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREACH\">breach</a> even in the most formidable mountain wall. Both the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDUS\">Indus</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol7.html#article-GANGES\">Ganges</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> the liminary chains of Indostan in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCEAN\">ocean</a>. But the important consideration appears to us to be, that so great a chain as that which crosses Africa is always found to rest on a very elevated base. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> rivers have their rise and early course along the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>, which leaves only the mountain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARRIER\">barrier</a> to penetrate. It seems inconceivable, how the Niger, after descending for more than a thousand miles along the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NIGRITIA\">Nigritia</a>, should ever reach the elevated\n\n---\n\n* For a full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of this hypothesis, and the observations and reasonings by which it is supported, see Quarterly Review, Vol. XIII. p. 120-51.\n\n\u2020 The observations of Mr Park, corroborated by the succession of rivers from the south falling into the Joliba and Dibbie, extend it from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIERRA_LEONE\">Sierra Leone</a> to nearly opposite Tombuctoo. Thence the evidence collected by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">Association</a>, (1790, ch. 8.) carry it west as far as Cassina. Ptolemy, Leo, and Edrisi, unite in describing Wangara as barred on the south by very lofty mountains. We are thus led to that portion, the most elevated of all, which gives rise to the Nile, and extends through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABYSSINIA\">Abyssinia</a> to the Arabian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GULF\">Gulf</a>.\nplateau on which such a chain must rest. We may likewise observe, that there is a total absence of all testimony, even the faintest rumour, in favour of this hypothesis. Yet both Ptolemy and the Arabians were well acquainted with the rivers of Wangara, and the extensive knowledge possessed by the former renders his silence, of itself, nearly decisive as to this question.\n\nLet us now consider, whether this hypothesis is calculated, or is necessary, to account for the flooding of the Congo. It supposes, that the autumnal swell of this river is produced, like that of the Nile, by the rains of the northern tropic. Congo, too, being about the same distance with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a> from the region of these rains, (which are bounded on one side by the equator, on the other by the tropic) it follows, that the Niger, in Congo, ought to exhibit very nearly the same phenomena as the Nile in Egypt. The magnitude of the rise, and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, ought to be as nearly as possible the same. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> rise of the Nile is stated at thirty feet, which is also that of the Ganges, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENEGAL\">Senegal</a>, and, we believe, of all the great rivers fed by the rains of the northern tropic. The Niger-Congo, which has three-fourths of its immense course through the region of these rains, ought unquestionably to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> an equal rise. We learn, on the contrary, from Mr Maxwell himself, that it never exceeds nine feet, not a third of that which takes place in the other streams. It thus produces no remarkable effect on the aspect of the river, which in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEPTEMBER\">September</a>, when at the lowest, exhibits all the appearances of full flood. There seems no conceivable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a>, why the same cause, acting in circumstances so nearly similar, should produce an effect so greatly different.\n\nLet us now consider the period. The tropical rains commence early in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a>. On the 17th the Nile begins to rise, and by the beginning of August all Egypt is laid under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>. The Niger-Congo, indeed, would double the length of the Nile, and, though both its portions are much more rapid, we are willing to allow it double the period. The current of the Congo exceeds six miles an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>,\u2014the usual rate, we believe, of flood current. This would carry the rise, from its source to its embouchure, in somewhat less than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>. The fact, however, is, according to Mr Maxwell's statement, that not the slightest rise takes place till the end of September, nearly four months after the northern rains have set in, at a period when these rains have entirely ceased, and when the Nile, after three months of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INUNDATION\">inundation</a>, has begun to retire. The discrepancy, therefore, is as complete with regard to the period as to the magnitude; and the Congo, instead of exhibiting, as has been imagined, phenomena which imply a connection with the Niger, presents none that do not run directly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTER\">counter</a> to such a supposition.\n\nHaving thus proved that the floods of the Congo bear no correspondence to those of any river passing through the northern tropic, it can scarcely be required, that, with such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> means, we should attempt to investigate their real causes. Were we called upon to form a conjecture, we should, with great diffidence, state the following: The perennial fulness of the Congo may easily be accounted for by supposing it to be fed from the region of perpetual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> immediately under the line. In fact, its direction from the E. N. E. would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> our views to this very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>, and particularly to the southern side of that mighty chain, which pours down the Abiad, the Misselad, and other great streams of northern Africa. This would give also a very long course to account for its magnitude. The floods and tornadoes, which, in the region above mentioned, are never wholly intermittent, experience an increase of violence, as the sun passes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EQUINOX\">equinox</a>, which seems sufficient to account for the slight swells which, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> and September, take place upon the Congo. Their period and magnitude do not seem to indicate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> even of the south tropical rains. The Portuguese, indeed, describe the main branch of the Congo as flowing from the south; but probably upon very imperfect information; perhaps solely from their erroneous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> relative to the position of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEMBEA\">Dembea</a>, its imagined source. D'Anville, in his map prefixed to Labat's Ethiopic Occidentale, observes, that the course of all the rivers which combine in forming the Congo or Zaire, is extremely uncertain.\n\nUpon the whole, then, when we consider that this hypothesis rests upon no evidence whatever, but is contradicted by the statements of well-informed writers; that it is inconsistent with the probable structure of the African continent, and completely so with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> phenomena of the Congo, as reported by the author of the hypothesis himself; we cannot see any ground on which it can be retained, even as a plausible conjecture, in geographical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>.\n\nAnother hypothesis, nearly similar, is advanced by M. Reichard, an eminent German geographer, who makes the Niger to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> into the sea, through a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of estuaries, not yet explored, in the Gulf of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENIN\">Benin</a>. But this, though a more plausible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a>, is wholly destitute of any positive evidence in its favour; it is equally liable with the former hypothesis to the objections arising from the direction of the great central chain of mountains; and besides, the supposition that the estuaries in question form branches of one great river, is purely conjectural.\n\nReverting then to Major Rennell's hypothesis: He supposes, that the Niger, after a long easterly course from Tombuctoo, loses itself among the lakes of Wangara. To this account of its termination it has been strongly objected, that there is no receptacle or lake in Wangara, sufficient for the vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of waters which must thus be supposed to flow into it. But that lakes do exist in that country, is made certain by the accounts of the Arabian writers; and as none of these writers, whatever M. Reichard may imagine, give any precise statements as to their magnitude, there is thus room to suppose, that some of them may be large enough to receive the waters of this mighty river. Were we therefore obliged to make a choice among these hypotheses, we should undoubtedly prefer Major Rennell's, as on the whole, the most probable. Our researches, however, have led us to form a hypothesis of our own; and we shall now proceed to explain it, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">hope</a> of at least being able to bring into view some curious facts which seem to have been overlooked in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a> of this interesting question.\nBriefly, then, our idea is this\u2014That the great river-course which stretches across Africa consists in fact of two rivers, to both of which the name of Niger has been given; that one of these flows eastward by Sego and Tombuctoo, the other westward through Wangara and Cassina; and that these two rivers, at some intermediate point, not far from the modern position of Houssa, unite in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> receptacle.\n\nThe first question, then, relates to the course of that portion of the Niger which passes through Cassina, a country whose limits include the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> so celebrated by the Arabians, under the appellation of Gana. The flourishing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> which the Arabs had founded in these regions, and the extensive trade which they carried on, gave them copious means of information. Now, these writers decidedly and repeatedly state, conformably to our hypothesis, that the great river flowing through this part of Africa, and which they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CALL\">call</a> \"the Nile of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol7.html#article-NEGROES\">Negroes</a>,\" runs westward. Major Rennell indeed supposes, that this idea may have been formed by unduly extending some rivers to the west of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUBIA\">Nubia</a>. But we have already shewn, that Nubia was very imperfectly, and the countries to the west of it scarcely at all, known to the Arabians. Gana, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a> of their empire, the emporium of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>, itself situated on the Niger, was doubtless the central point whence their information respecting that river would be derived. Abulfeda uniformly calls it the Nile of Gana. It appears, therefore, very improbable that they should not have been aware how the fact stood at Gana; and we cannot see that it ought to discredit their authority, though they should make it flow in the same direction, through countries not Mahometan, and thus lying beyond their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPHERE\">sphere</a> of observation.\n\nThe only modern testimony of an eye-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WITNESS\">witness</a>, to the course of the Niger through Cassina, is that of the Shereef Imhammed, from whose information chiefly Mr Beaufoy compiled his account of Bornou and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUDAN\">Soudan</a>, published in the Proceedings of the African Association, 1790. From the circumstances there mentioned, as well as from the coincidence of his statements with the most authentic of those received from other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>, there seems every reason to consider his authority as respectable. As this person travelled in the countries south of the Niger, he must have passed it at least twice, in going and returning; and the prodigious rapidity which he ascribes to the current, would render a mistake as to its direction <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a>. His report is decided, that its course is from east to west.\n\nNiebhur, while in Egypt, collected some valuable information from the mouth of a native African, which he published in the German <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSEUM\">Museum</a>; but as that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> does not seem to have reached this country, we know it only by the extracts of Hartmann. It appears, however, that he is referred to only for the eastern part of the Niger, and that he states, as beyond all doubt, the western course of that river.\n\nTo this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of ocular and historical testimony, nothing stands opposed, except the hearsay, somewhat vague, of a Moorish merchant, who had not travelled beyond Houssa. The Niger probably flows east for some distance after passing that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a>; a circumstance which might easily give rise to the report which the merchant received.\n\nIn support, however, of his opinion, that the Niger flows eastward through Cassina to the lakes of Wau-gara, Major Rennell urges an argument which certainly calls for consideration. If this river of Cassina flows westward, there must be a common receptacle between that place and Tombuctoo; and \"we have not,\" says he, \"heard of any such.\" (Illustrations of Park, chap. 2.) It may first be observed, that the tract is so completely unknown, that a receptacle might very well be supposed to exist there without any report of it being received. But we are moreover convinced, that, by diligently comparing ancient and modern accounts, we shall arrive at almost complete evidence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a>, in this quarter, of a great lake, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INLAND\">inland</a> sea, sufficient to form such a receptacle. The subject being curious, both in itself, and as connected with the question of the Niger, our readers may not be displeased to see these testimonies collected.\n\nIt seems to be now a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> opinion among the best informed geographers of the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, that the sea of the Arabians, into which they describe the Nile of the Negroes to fall, must have been a great lake, (Hartmann, 30. Pinkerton, II. 773.) In fact, the Arabic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> rendered sea, signifies merely great water. It may therefore have been used in the latter signification, and was certainly so understood by one Arabian writer, (Scheabeddin, Notices, II.\n\n---\n\n\u2022 Edrisi, and Abulfeda, passim. Scheabeddin in Notices, Vol. II. 156.\n\n\u2020 A very recent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> has been afforded in the concurrence of his description of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASHANTEE\">Ashantee</a>, or Asente, with that contained in the valuable work of Mr Meredith.\n\n\u2021 This person's testimony would fall entirely, if it should prove true, that there is no such city as Houssa. (See Rennell on Hornemann, 185.) We must confess, however, our own opinion to be in favour of its existence, which seems supported by ocular testimony, while it is denied only by persons at a distance. But whenever Houssa is mentioned in this discussion, the site fixed by Major Rennell is meant, whether there be a city upon it or not.\n\n\u00a7 To conceal nothing, we incline to suspect that this was not the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> with Edrisi, but that, finding a great expanse of water at the extremity of African knowledge, he concluded it to be the ocean. He says, the Niger flows to the extremity of the west, p. 12. See also Dr Vincent's map. Ulil, a point situated on the opposite coast, might then be mistaken for an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> agree with Ibn-al-Vardi, a subsequent writer, who makes it a great city on the shore of the sea (or lake). It is certain that Edrisi gives land and caravan routes from Ulil to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> cities of Africa. But, as he was not a person of very great\nThere has not hitherto, however, been any attempt made to fix the position of this lake, according to the materials furnished by the Arabians, although their information seems sufficiently clear and precise. As Edrisi has given the routes from Ulil to several of the great cities of Africa, this will furnish the means of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROXIMATION\">approximation</a> to its site. The route from Gana, westward, is given as follows:\u2014To Berissa, twelve days' journey; to Tocurur and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SALA\">Sala</a>, twelve; to Ulil, sixteen; in all, forty. Ulil is also said to be at the distance of a day's sail (or 100 miles) * from the mouth of the Nile. (Edrissi, 29-35.) The forty days from Gana, extended in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> line, would reach to the vicinity of Tombuctoo, but would fall short of the eastern point of the lake Dibbie, much more of a day's sail beyond it. But a variety of details given by the Arabian writers fix the position much farther to the east, and even somewhat short of the reported site of Houssa. Ulil is said to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of Maghara, or Mekzara, an extensive tract of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a>, south of the Niger, immediately bordering on Lamlam, and even on Gana.\u2020 Schebebeddin states the Niger to flow not to the ocean, but to the extremity of the inhabited part of Djennawa (Gana.) At this point, accordingly, Major Rennell, in his map 1790, has laid down a desert of ten journeys or more, on the authority of Imhammed. Ulil, however, is still more precisely fixed by the assigned distance (Edrissi, 40) from Audagost (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGADES\">Agades</a>) of one month, which, in the most direct line, would not reach beyond Houssa, and supposing a probable deflexion to the south, would fall several days short of it. There remains, indeed, the difficulty of the forty days from Gana, which, as already observed, would, in a direct line, reach considerably farther west. But routes along rivers are naturally winding; and the present being apparently a land route, must, in that case, have made a considerable circuit round the shores of the lake. Agades being an ascertained position,\u2021 the distance from it appears to be decisive.\n\nFrom these collected statements, we may consider it as the clear and united testimony of the Arabian writers, that, in an extensive tract of desert, immediately to the east of the modern position of Houssa, there exists a great lake, or inland sea, which receives the eastern branch of the Niger.\u00a7 We shall now advert to the modern authorities. Down to the period of the African Association, report is silent, which cannot at all be wondered at, as no traveller ever approached that part of Africa; and it was only learned by imperfect rumour that Tombuctoo was still in existence. It is remarkable, however, that, in the old maps by Purchas and Dapper, (followed in this respect by Sanson, and by Delisle in his earlier maps) there is uniformly laid down, at the very point we have traced, an immense lake, under the appellation of the Lake of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUARDA\">Guarda</a>. Upon what authority this lake is so placed, has completely eluded our research. It certainly was not that of the Arabians, whose sea was then universally understood to be the ocean. It therefore must have been originally laid down by the Portuguese, and it seems improbable that they should have done so without some kind of authority.\n\nIn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of discovery which has been roused by the Association, more distinct notices have begun to be received. Ben <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALI\">Ali</a>, from whose information partly, the report 1790 was drawn up, heard it stated at Tombuctoo, that the Niger terminated in \"a lake in the desert;\" which is elsewhere expressed by saying that it was \"lost in the sands to the south of Tombuctoo.\" (Report 1790, p. 222, and 1798, p. 143.) Major Rennell endeavours, consistently with his hypothesis as to the termination of the Niger, to apply this to Wangara; but no country on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> bears so little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> or desert; and it is far too distant to make the term \"south of Tombuctoo\" at all applicable. The report, on the contrary, agrees exactly with the Arabian notices.\n\nMr Jackson expressly states, that \"fifteen journeys to the east of Tombuctoo, (that is, three or four beyond Houssa) there is an immense lake called the '<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAHAR\">Bahar</a> Soudan, or Sea of Soudan.'\" In describing the boundaries of Tombuctoo, he again mentions it as \"a lake formed by the waters of the Nile Abeede, of which the opposite shore is not visible.\" He mentions a number of particulars respecting it; describes it as inhabited by a particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of people, to be presently noticed, who navigate it with large decked vessels, containing from 100 to 150 men, which have sometimes made their appearance at Tombuctoo.\n\n---\n\n* So understood by D'Herbelot, Biblioth\u00e8que Orientale, art. Ulil. See also Hartmann, Introd. 119.\n\u2020 Edrissi, 28, 36, 41. Ibn-al-Vardi, Notices, II. 351.\n\u2021 See the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATA\">data</a> on which Major Rennell fixes it, Afric. Assoc. 1790, p. 119, 120.\n\u00a7 The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>-pits of Ulil have been a subject of perplexity to modern geographers, as Nigritia has always been dependent for that article upon the interior of the desert. Considering that the knowledge of the Arabians expired here, it appears to us a very easy supposition, that Ulil, a great commercial city, (as it is described by Ibn-al-Vardi) might, in consequence of becoming a mart for the salt of the desert, be supposed to produce it. Cadamosto, in fact, describes a great salt trade upon this very line, from Tegazza, by Tombuctoo, towards Melli. Ramusio, I. 100. He adds, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a> was conducted on the bank of a great water, which might have been supposed the sea, had it been salt; that large boats came from certain islands, &c. The period of thirty days' travelling from Tombuctoo is too great; but when we consider that the salt was carried on men's shoulders under a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> sun, they may well be supposed not to exceed half the rate of camel travelling. There seems, therefore, on the whole, a great coincidence with Edrisi.\n\n|| The barche grandi of Cadamosto? We find no mention of any other kind of vessels than canoes on any other part of the Niger.\nMr Park, during his first journey, received no accounts of any lake beyond the Dibbie. But during his last residence of two months at Sansanding, he obtained the following information: \"One month's travel south of Baedoo, through the kingdom of Gotto, will bring the traveller to the country of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>, who have their houses on the banks of the Ba Sea Feena; this water they describe as incomparably larger than the Dibbie, and that it flows sometimes one way, and sometimes another.\" (p.168).\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> \"south of Baedoo\" must either be a mistake, or understood in a very qualified <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, as the kingdom of Gotto extends eastward along the course of the Niger. Now, from Sansanding to Silla, two days; to Tombuctoo, fourteen; to the sea of Soudan, according to Jackson, fifteen; in all thirty-one: thus, we have Park's month; and the two statements coincide surprisingly.\n\nOur readers are probably startled by the expression \"country of the Christians.\" Jackson, however, makes a similar report. He says, \"On its eastern bank (of the sea of Soudan) begins the territory of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> people, denominated by the Arabs, (N'sirrath) Christians, or followers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAZARETH\">Nazareth</a>.\" He adds some peculiarities of their dress and customs, and observes, that they are neither Arabs, Moors, Negroes, Sheliuhs, nor Berebbers. Considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> is thrown upon this subject by Hornemann, who, it appears, had heard much of a white and Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> as being in the vicinity of Soudan and Tombuctoo. He ridicules the idea of their being actually Christian; and states, that though the word Nazari has properly that signification, yet the Arabs familiarly give it to all who are not Mahometans. The nation in question he describes to be a branch of the Tuarick, called Tagama, who are white, (this term is probably comparative), and Pagans. (p. 110\u201419.) Upon Hornemann's data, Major Rennell has placed the Tagama Tuarick near the very point where Jackson places his Sea of Soudan. It is thus clear that there is, in this very quarter, a nation known in Africa by the term usually appropriated to Christians, which removes every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FABULOUS\">fabulous</a> appearance from the statements of Jackson and Park, and establishes a striking coincidence between them.*\n\nNeither of these travellers mention any particular eye-witnesses; but their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> implies, that they had met with such, and both allude to the existence of this inland sea, as a fact of complete certainty and notoriety. So <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> and obvious a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> feature, which required only eyes to see it, seems to leave no room for mistake. Neither Park nor Jackson had the least idea of any coincidence between their respective statements, and still less with the Arabian writers; so that we have thus three independent testimonies from opposite quarters, meeting exactly in the same point. Nor does there, so far as we know, exist any evidence at all respectable to the contrary.\n\nApplying then the existence of this lake to the question of the course of the Niger, we may observe, that every one who describes it, seems to labour for words to express its magnitude; which is farther manifested by its having been repeatedly mistaken for the ocean. If the sail of a hundred miles to Ulil, be supposed to give the breadth, this will equal it to the Caspian; even half that space will place it on a level with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARAL\">Aral</a>. These seas, though placed in a comparatively <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a> must be less active, receive, however, some of the greatest rivers of Europe and Asia. In the present instance, the power of evaporation must be extraordinary, as every account represents the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> to be intolerable, even to those who are accustomed to the burning sands of the Sahara. (Afric. Assoc. 1790, p. 124. Cadamosto, as above.) There seems, therefore, sufficient provision made for disposing, by evaporation, of the two great rivers, which, under the common name of Niger, seem to discharge themselves into this receptacle.\u2020\n\n2. The river, to which Ptolemy has given the name of Gir, has not attracted the same attention among modern geographers, as among the ancient. Mr Pinkerton supposes it to be the Bahr Kulla of Browne, or the river, which, flowing from the westward, meets the Niger, and is lost in the same receptacle. On examining, however, the map, and descriptions of Ptolemy, we do not find that he considers these rivers as forming one line of stream, or even as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> together; but as quite distinct, both in their source and termination. This circumstance, joined to their relative position, appears to leave no room for hesitation in adopting the opinion of D'Anville and Rennell, who identify the Gir with the river of Bornou. To this, we apprehend, must now be added the Misselad, which, from its relative course, must certainly communicate with the other. Mr Beaufoy's informants, indeed, clearly identify them, by stating the river of Bornou to rise from the same source i.e. vicinity with the Egyptian Nile. Major Rennell seems to sup-\n\n* Mr Barnes, formerly quoted, states, that the Niger discharges itself into a large lake; that he has heard from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> traders, that there are white inhabitants upon the borders of this lake; and has been told by people who have seen them, that they dress in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a> of Barbary Moors, and wear turbans (which agrees with Jackson, p. 262.) but do not speak Arabic. Report of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMITTEE\">Committee</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNCIL\">Council</a>, 1788.\n\n\u2020 We have not included Ptolemy among our authorities, for reasons already stated; but it may be expected that we should prove that he advances nothing inconsistent with the above hypothesis. We observe, that the Lake of Lybia, which D'Anville and Rennell make the termination of the Niger, is not placed by Ptolemy upon the Niger at all, but upon one of its derivations or adjuncts, IV. 6. He gives nothing, therefore, which can be a termination, except the lake of Nigritia, to reach which it must flow westward. If this lake be supposed to be the Sea of Soudan, then the northern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DERIVATION\">derivation</a>, on which is placed Tuccaba (Tombuctoo?) will be the Niger known to Europeans. We repeat, that we lay very little stress upon this interpretation; but if anything can be made of Ptolemy, it seems to be this.\n\n\u2021 Generally speaking, all rivers which arise in the same chain of mountains, are considered, in Africa, as having one source.\npose that they run in different directions, and meet in the lake of Fittr\u00e9. But the informants, both of Mr Beaufoy and Dr Seetzen, state distinctly that the river of Bornou flowed from south to north; to which the former added, that it was lost in the sands of the desert of Bilma. We have here the testimony of three respectable eye-witnesses, to which nothing stands opposed. The lake Fittr\u00e9, besides, being in its permanent state only sixty or seventy miles in circumference (Hornemann), is ill fitted to be the receptacle of two such rivers. Considering then the whole as one, it will form a course from S. E. to N. W. of not much less than a thousand miles in direct distance. No portion of this mighty stream has ever been explored by any European; yet its course, and above all its termination, must be an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of great geographical curiosity. All that seems now ascertained, is, that, after traversing the empire of Bornou, it enters the vast desert of Bilma, out of which it never issues.\n\n3. With regard to the question whether the Niger and the Nile form a junction, Mr Hornemann mentions, that all the persons with whom he conversed, informed him, that the Niger flowed by Darfoo into the Nile, or Bahr-el-Abid, and was, in fact, the same river: \"he could not find a single person who said to the contrary.\" (p. 115\u201417.) Mr Jackson says still more pointedly: \"In the interior of Africa, there is but one opinion as to the Nile of Egypt and the Nile of Tombuctoo, and that opinion is, that they are one and the same river.\" He adds: \"The Africans express their astonishment whenever the Europeans dispute the connection of these two rivers.\" (p. 264.) Notwithstanding such positive assurances, it seems incontrovertibly proved by Major Rennell, that the opinion in question is totally erroneous. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERODOTUS\">Herodotus</a>, indeed, mentions it, but Ptolemy, whose information was greatly superior, clearly fixes the source of the Nile among the mountains of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">Moon</a>, in a direction nearly south from Egypt. The same information was received by Mr Browne, during his residence in Darfoo, at a few hundred miles from these sources. He learned also, that all the rivers, for a great distance southwards, flowed, not east towards the Nile, but quite in the opposite direction. What is still more important,\u2014his route intersected the only line by which there was any likelihood of the Niger joining its waters to those of the Nile. A very little way south, the country begins to rise into the great chain of the Jibbel-el-Kumri, forming a complete barrier to the passage of a river which must previously have descended to the lowest level of the plain of Soudan.\n\nBut, although this point may be considered as settled, it remains still an interesting question, whether the two rivers may not communicate, by some intermediate channel, so as to form a continued navigation from Tombuctoo to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CAIRO\">Cairo</a>. Mr Jackson positively asserts, that he knew a credible witness, who boasted of having actually performed this voyage. It is probable, that both the Misselad and the Kulla rise very near to the Nile, and afterwards communicate with the Niger; and it is possible, that at some point, particularly during the wet season, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNION\">union</a> may take place. It is possible also, and perhaps more probable, that the two streams, like the Senegal and the Niger, may be considered as one, merely from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a> very near to each other. More precise testimony is necessary, in order to determine the question.\n\nIn taking leave of these disputed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of African geography, we may observe, that the tract which extends southwards from the Mountains of the Moon, to the vicinity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol4.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> of Good Hope, forms the greatest mass of terra incognita which now exists on the surface of the globe. Reckoning from the southern frontier of Darfoo and Abyssinia, we find an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of nearly forty degrees, or two thousand four hundred miles in length, and nearly half that average breadth, which not only has not been visited by any European, but concerning which no detailed or authentic particulars have ever been received. Yet there is no reason to suppose, that it is either very thinly inhabited, or by people in the lowest stage of civilization. On the contrary, most of the limiter districts <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> with the most civilized and populous portions of this continent. On the west are the kingdoms of Loango, Congo, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGOLA\">Angola</a>; on the east are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONOMOTAPA\">Monomotapa</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-ZANGUEBAR\">Zanguebar</a>, and the Somalics. Even the heights of the Jibbel-el-Kumri are found, when crossed by the Ashantee Caravan, to abound in cattle, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>, and people. The immediate vicinity of the Cape is barren and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a>; but, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> as we advance northward, an improvement takes place. The tribes of Boshuanas recently visited, and still more those lying more remote, hold a high rank among the nations of Africa. Doubtless, there are deserts here also, and particularly a very extensive one, reaching north from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">Orange</a> river. But there appears no probability that they should bear any proportion to those which exist on the northern side of the continent.\n\nVI. We shall conclude this article, with some miscellaneous details, regarding the present state and future prospects of this quarter of the globe. There is scarcely any question involved in greater uncertainty than the extent of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">Population</a>. The few estimates which have been attempted are founded chiefly on random conjecture, and exhibit an extraordinary discrepancy of results. M. Golberry, who seems to have particularly attended to this subject, hesitates not to carry the amount to one hundred and sixty millions. (Voyage en Afrique.) Mr Beaufoy seems to have entertained nearly the same idea, as he estimates the interior at a hundred millions. (African Assoc. 1790.) Mr Pinkerton, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, does not conceive that it can exceed thirty, perhaps not twenty millions. M. Malte Brun names seventy millions as the utmost conceivable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIMIT\">limit</a>. (Precis de la Geographie. II. 560).\n\nThe only principle on which any thing like an approximation can be founded seems to be this,\u2014that the state of industry and civilization throughout cultivated Africa is so nearly the same, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a> of the ascertained <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol7.html#article-DENSITY\">density</a> of any one portion may be extended to the whole. Golberry has\nformed a calculation, apparently pretty correct, by which he makes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> surface of Africa to amount to one million six hundred thousand square leagues, of twenty-five to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, which is equal to upwards of nine millions of square geographical miles. These, at a moderate European rate, would give a population of four or five hundred millions. There are many circumstances, however, which must materially reduce the African standard. The most prominent is the immense extent of its deserts. The Sahara, with all its adjuncts, equals perhaps the whole of Europe. Its Oases, even the larger ones of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEZZAN\">Fezzan</a> and Darfour, though they relieve the aspect of sterility, do not materially change its general character. The former is calculated to contain only seventy-five thousand souls, the latter two hundred thousand; which will not exceed four or five to the square <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILE\">mile</a>. Even the most fertile regions of Barbary and Nigritia are deeply indented with desert. We cannot, therefore, consider as exaggerated the estimate of Mr Pinkerton, that a full third of its extent is of this description. Of the remaining six millions, we think we may allow a third for those savage tracks, which, being devoid of cultivation, do not materially affect the general populousness of the continent. There will then remain four millions of square miles for cultivated Africa.\n\nMr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PENNY\">Penny</a>, a trader, who was intimately acquainted with every part of the African coast, being asked, in the Committee of Council (Report on Africa and the Slave Trade, 1788,) his ideas upon its populousness, answered as follows: He thought every one who had visited Africa and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a> must have been struck with the appearance of nearly an equal population on the coast of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUINEA\">Guinea</a>, and in the State of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGINIA\">Virginia</a>. Virginia contained then eight hundred thousand inhabitants, upon thirty thousand square miles, which is $26\\frac{3}{4}$ to the square mile.\n\nM. Golberry is the only African traveller who has furnished any precise data upon this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>. In the course of his work, he gives the population of a number of states upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAMBIA\">Gambia</a> and Senegal, as ascertained by the French colonial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMINISTRATION\">administration</a>; and we shall throw the results into the following table:\n\n| Districts | Vol. p. | Sq. Leagues | Inhabitants |\n|-----------|---------|-------------|------------|\n| Cayor     | II. 102 | 2000        | 180,000    |\n| Sin       | II. 109 | 140         | 60,000     |\n| Salum     | II. 112 | 1500        | 300,000    |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BARRA\">Barra</a>     | II. 158 | 252         | 200,000    |\n| Bambouk   | I. 432  | 1000        | 60,000     |\n\nThis gives 163 to the square <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a>, or $26\\frac{3}{4}$ to the square mile;\u2014a result, the coincidence of which with the estimate of Mr Penny, is somewhat remarkable. Probably, therefore, we may not err very widely in fixing this as the average amount of population along the coast of Guinea, nor even in extending it to the whole of cultivated Africa. If some districts fall short of this standard, there are others of considerable extent,\u2014as Egypt, Houssa, Tombuctoo, Whydah,\u2014which must greatly exceed it. Four millions, then, of square miles, at the above rate, would give a population of a hundred and six millions; to which some addition must be made, though it would be difficult even to form a guess as to its amount, for the more desert and savage districts.\n\nThe Commerce of Africa has always presented Commerce some peculiar features. The first and most prominent is the immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a> of land conveyance. Africa is perforated by no arms of the sea; and her rivers, though large, are imperfectly navigable, and do not flow in a convenient direction. It is by land chiefly that the merchant must find his means of exchange; and his route must lie, not on smooth roads through smiling countries, but over an immeasurable expanse of trackless desert, where whirlwinds of sand threaten to overwhelm him at every step. To <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> against these dangers, as well as to enliven the dreary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a>, merchants were naturally led to form themselves into companies, which are known under the appellation of Caravans. The camel, an animal which nature seems to have formed expressly for travelling through the desert, is universally employed. The rate of progress is three miles an hour, and seldom more than seven or eight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a> in the day. At each of the oases, a stay of at least two days is made, for the purpose of obtaining fresh supplies of water and provisions. The following are some of the principal routes pursued by these caravans: 1. From Mourzouk, the capital of Fezzan, to Cairo; a route of about forty days. The halting places are Siwah, Augila, and Temissa. 2. From Mourzouk to Boronou; a journey of fifty days. The track is through the deserts of Bilma and Tibesti; and the principal halts are at Temissa, Domboo, and Kanem. 3. From Mourzouk to Cashna. This occupies sixty days, through Hiatts, Ganatt, and Agades. 4. From <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEZ\">Fez</a> to Tombuctoo, a journey of fifty-four days; but as sixty-five besides are spent in rest, the whole number of days required is one hundred and twenty-nine. The stations are Akka or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TATTA\">Tatta</a>, the general rendezvous; Tegazza, and Arawan, or Arean. Another route, along the sea-coast, leads to the same point by Wedinoum, Cape <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOJADOR\">Bojador</a>, and Guatala. 5. and 6. The caravans from Sennaar and Darfour to Egypt. These do not travel so regularly as the others; and an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> of two or three years often elapses. The caravan with which Mr Browne travelled consisted of five hundred camels; but the number often reaches two thousand.\n\nWith regard to the objects of trade, and particularly of export, these have presented a remarkable similarity, in all ages, and over every part of this continent. The first, and by far the most considerable, has always unhappily been the trade in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>. Africa has in all ages been ransacked for those unfortunate beings, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEGRADATION\">degradation</a> was to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> or avarice to the lords of the other portions of the globe. Besides the European part of this atrocious traffic, (ere long, it is to be hoped, to be fully, and for ever relinquished,) there has long been a similar trade for the supply of Barbary and some countries of the East.*\n\n* The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> and actual state of the trade in slaves, for European purposes, will be given under the head Slave Trade in this Supplement.\nAfrica. times are drawn chiefly from the barbarous tribes inhabiting the central <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANGE\">range</a> of mountains. The whole number for this supply is estimated at twenty thousand. Part of these captives undergo a shameful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTILATION\">mutilation</a>, with the view of being placed in the seraglios of the East. In other respects, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOT\">lot</a> is much milder than that of their West Indian brethren. They are used as domestics, are well treated, and often raised to posts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a>.\n\nNext to the human species, the article of exchange which Africa produces most abundantly, is gold. It seems probable that its mountains contain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> of this coveted metal, more ample even than those of the new world. All the rivers which descend from the Jibbel-el-Kumri, on both sides, and throughout its whole extent, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROLL\">roll</a> down sands of gold. The great repositories are Wangara, the country near the sources of the Senegal and Niger, and that immediately behind the Gold Coast. Its abundance in the districts along the Niger is said almost to surpass <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a>. Mr Jackson states, we suspect with exaggeration, that at Tombuctoo, it is often exchanged for its weight in salt, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-TOBACCO\">tobacco</a>, or other valuable commodities, (p. 260.) About the beginning of the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, the value of that exported from the gold coast, is said to have amounted to between two and three hundred thousand pounds. (Wadstrom on Colonization.) We have not been able to obtain precise information respecting the present state of this trade; for the prejudices of the mercantile <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> prevent gold from being classed with other commodities in the amount of exports and imports. The slave captains in their examinations before the Committee of Council, (1788) generally state, that it was too costly to be an object of trade; that it sold at L.4. an ounce, and that they did not find it their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> to procure it, unless as a medium for the purchase of slaves. They admit, however, that the Dutch exported it; and the truth seems merely to be, that they found the other trade more profitable.\n\nIvory. Next to gold, ivory has always been the great subject of African export. Like gold, it is produced almost solely in the interior, and thence brought down to the coast. Where those vast meadows lie which feed such herds of elephants, has never been ascertained; but Europe derives from Africa its whole supply of this valuable article.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUM\">Gum</a>. Gum, particularly Gum Senegal, forms an important branch of trade. The southern parts of the desert of Sahara contain vast forests of that species of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACACIA\">acacia</a>, from which this substance exudes. In the month of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a>, a dry and piercing wind bursts the bark, and the juice flows out. The neighbouring Moorish tribes then leave their habitations, and employ themselves for six weeks in collecting it; after which they repair to the banks of the Senegal, to exchange it for European commodities. The price is first fixed by a meeting of the merchants with their kings and chiefs. This point being settled, in a few days the Moors appear in vast bands, with their wives, children, and cattle; and for some days, a tumultuous market is held. M. Golberry calculates, that two millions of pounds of gum may be drawn from this part of Africa. (Travels, chap. vi.)\n\nAmong the valuable productions of this country, we may also mention <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HIDES\">hides</a> and skins, particularly goatskins dyed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a>. These are brought by the caravans from central Africa to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOROCCO\">Morocco</a>, whence they are exported to Europe, chiefly from the port of Mogador. Africa exports likewise ornamental and dye woods, particularly red or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CAM\">cam</a> wood, to a very considerable extent. Raw hides and bees wax have, within the last few years, become considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol8.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a>.\n\nThere are doubtless many other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINOR\">minor</a> and local objects; but those now enumerated may be considered as forming the basis of African export. It is remarkable that, with the exception of a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a>, the whole consists, not merely of the unmanufactured, but of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPONTANEOUS\">spontaneous</a> produce of the land. So small is the progress yet made by cultivation throughout this great continent. The imports are limited, by the limited wants of the climate and state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>. The manufactures most in demand are checked cottons, light coarse cloths, red woollen caps, a few linens and silks, and a large proportion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> piece-goods. Spirits, chiefly rum, are too much in demand; guns and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a>, hardware, chiefly in the form of knives, sabres, blades; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a>, which is manufactured into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-EAR\">ear</a>-rings; coral, beads, looking-glasses, and other articles of ornament. The scarcity of salt causes a certain import from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, even of that bulky article.\n\nThe following tables are made up from information laid before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUSE\">House</a> of Commons, 13th June 1812:\n\n| ARTICLES          | 1805   | 1806   | 1807   | 1808   | 1809   | 1810   |\n|-------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Elephants' Teeth  | 10,285 | 11,331 | 10,693 | 14,314 | 16,270 | 16,488 |\n| Gum Arabic        | 3,947  | 4,190  | 4,333  | 6,203  | 3,536  | 8,420  |\n| \u2014\u2014 Senegal        | 16,223 | 17,797 | 14,455 | 12,270 | 21,550 | 46,384 |\n| Hides, raw and tanned | 1,257 | 990    | 2,472  | 2,308  | 4,143  | 12,714 |\n| Skins and Furs    | 10,838 | 8,318  | 34,124 | 36,401 | 23,800 | 76,437 |\n| Wax, Bees         | 2,009  | 3,436  | 8,297  | 13,817 | 20,436 | 12,996 |\n| Red Wood          | 51,311 | 52,160 | 27,753 | 15,908 | 47,791 | 26,058 |\n| All other articles| 10,960 | 17,926 | 19,921 | 42,055 | 47,125 | 57,790 |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OFFICIAL\">Official</a> value     | 106,845| 115,948| 122,948| 143,276| 184,651| 257,387|\n| Real Value        | 193,034| 226,396| 242,747| 374,306| 383,926| 535,577|\n\n11\n### EXPORTS\n\n| ARTICLES          | 1805   | 1806   | 1807   | 1808   | 1809   | 1810   |\n|-------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Brass and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-COPPER\">Copper</a>  | 12,085 | 10,315 | 6,496  | 6,979  | 3,755  | 3,231  |\n| Cotton Manufactures| 285,408| 456,661| 303,106| 168,910| 305,652| 196,214|\n| Gunpowder         | 27,154 | 38,179 | 21,092 | 6,567  | 8,453  | 7,887  |\n| Guns              | 48,500 | 57,685 | 35,698 | 7,452  | 14,251 | 6,393  |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">Iron</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-STEEL\">Steel</a>    | 17,703 | 44,464 | 26,870 | 28,721 | 30,302 | 19,139 |\n| Woollens          | 78,394 | 124,510| 58,788 | 51,955 | 76,430 | 68,402 |\n| India Piece Goods | 324,087| 390,605| 175,963| 72,444 | 84,472 | 59,967 |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRANDY\">Brandy</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GENEVA\">Geneva</a> | 8,490  | 38,109 | 15,853 | 5,453  | 7,499  | 1,722  |\n| Rum               | 56,181 | 43,855 | 10,636 | 12,066 | 11,663 | 7,551  |\n| All other articles| 182,573| 298,769| 143,308| 172,894| 163,522| 113,579|\n| Official value    | 990,575| 1,433,152| 797,740| 532,841| 705,979| 484,082|\n| Real value        | 1,156,985| 1,655,042| 1,022,745| 820,194| 976,872| 693,911|\n\nOn adverting to the future prospects of Africa, it is proper to say something, in the first place, as to the means of its more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> exploration. It seems, then, to be now universally admitted, that no reliance can be placed on the common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of solitary enterprise, or where the traveller has only one or two attendants. Nor is the device of assuming the character of a Mahometan likely to be repeated. Mahometanism is not a mere creed; it is a system, which regulates the whole train of thoughts and habits, and which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOULDS\">moulds</a> from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANCY\">infancy</a> even the outward aspect and deportment. It is vain to expect, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of Arabic at an European seminary, or even a few months residence in the East, could mould all the habits of an European into a shape, which would enable him to deceive the watchful eyes of Musulmen. It appears also, that, while the character of a professed Christian is sufficiently detested, that of one who assumes a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSE\">false</a> semblance of Mahometanism is viewed with a much higher degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REPROBATION\">reprobation</a>. To the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISGUISE\">disguise</a>, therefore, which Hornemann assumed, it is probable that this unfortunate traveller was partly indebted for his melancholy fate. The only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a>, then, it would appear, of penetrating into Africa, with any prospect of success, is to carry an armed force, which shall not be so large as to excite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALARM\">alarm</a>, and yet sufficient to guard against desultory or sudden attack. Such an expedition would the less tend to excite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JEALOUSY\">jealousy</a>, that Africa is habitually traversed by parties of this description for commercial purposes. Yet it is remarkable, that the two attempts which have been made upon this plan have terminated still more fatally than those in which no such precautions had been taken,\u2014we allude to the last expedition of Park, and that sent by Lord Caledon from the Cape of Good Hope. These failures, however, we regret to say, seem to have been the result of such obvious imprudence, as not to authorize any inference against the general superiority of this plan. Park, by unluckily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> his party to be destroyed by the rainy season, reduced himself to the same unprotected state with former travellers. The expedition from the Cape was too small; and yet, till they gave way to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUPINE\">supine</a> security, and sacrificed all the advantages of their strength by dividing it, no hostile attempt appears to have been made.\n\nThe editor of Park's last journal recommends an expedition on a large scale, to be composed chiefly of African soldiers enlisted at Sierra Leone; but we cannot help feeling some doubts as to the safety of an expedition, in which the majority should be Africans. And as this writer suggests the propriety of employing a traveller from the East, we would add, that his attendants should rather be Scapoys than Africans.\n\nThe plan upon which the main reliance for the civilization of this region seems at present to be placed is, that of an extensive system of colonization. It is observed by Mr Macaulay, Ex-secretary of the African <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">Institution</a>, that it is \"necessary to the rapid growth of improvement, that men should be brought together in considerable bodies; that they should be protected by just laws; and that they should enjoy the means of instruction.\" This, he conceives, can only be effected in Africa by means of a colony, of some extent, composed of natives. The difficulty of collecting a large native population is admitted, indeed, to be very great. The Africans, from many causes, and particularly from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a>, will not voluntarily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a> to such a colony. A plan had, therefore, been suggested, in reference to the co-\n\n---\n\n*These tables exhibit a curious view of the effects of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABOLITION\">abolition</a>. Almost all the articles of import have remarkably increased, and their general amount has more than doubled. The exports have necessarily suffered a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a>, which, however, has taken place almost wholly in the articles of guns, spirits, and (we know not exactly why,) of India piece-goods; while British manufactures maintain nearly their former amount.*\nAFRICAN ASSOCIATION. See Association, African, in the Encyclopedia.\n\nAFRICAN <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">COMPANY</a>. The reader will find, under the head Company, in the body of the Work, an account of the formation of this establishment, and the footing on which it at present stands. Though instituted for commercial purposes, it is now prohibited from trading in its corporate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a>; and its functions are limited to maintaining the forts on the Gold Coast; a sum for that purpose being annually allowed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">Government</a>. In the Report of the Commissioners appointed to inquire into the state of the African Settlements, in 1812, the following is stated to be the annual expense of each of these forts:\n\n| Fort          | Expense (\u00a3) |\n|---------------|-------------|\n| Appolonia     | 879         |\n| Dixcove       | 926         |\n| Succondee     | 429         |\n| Commenda      | 842         |\n| Cape Coast Castle | 4,768    |\n| Annamaboe     | 1,885       |\n| Tantumquery   | 771         |\n| Winnebah      | 776         |\n| Accra         | 1,328       |\n| Whydah        | 587         |\n\nTotal: \u00a313,195\n\nThe whole annual expenses of the Company in Africa, for forts, salaries of officers, &c. is stated to be \u00a325,327, 18. 5\u00bdd.\n\nIt further appears from this Report, that the trade of the coast is chiefly in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of the Governors of the forts, to each of whom it affords a perquisite of from \u00a3800 to \u00a31,000 a year. Their local knowledge and influence give them an advantage, with which ships coming from a distance cannot compete. Cape Coast forms the only exception, as there are several European agents residing there. The number of forts appeared to the Committee to be much greater than is necessary for maintaining the British influence upon this coast; and in consequence, Winnebah and Whydah were abandoned, which has so far reduced the annual expense.\n\nThe Company were recently called upon to explain the reason of their sending out goods, which did not appear necessary for the use of their settlements. To this they answered, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> 23 Geo. II. ch. 31, by which they were constituted, expressly authorizes them to make their African payments in goods; that the remittance of the salaries of their servants in any other form would be attended with great inconvenience, both to the Company and to individuals; and that the profit made upon these goods enables the Company, with an annual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> of \u00a323,000, to support an expenditure in Africa of \u00a325,000, and to defray the expenses of management at home.\n\nThe Company's charges at home, consist of \u00a3100 to each of the nine members of the committee; and \u00a3300 to the secretary; in all \u00a31,200. The number of persons in their employ, at Christmas 1813, consisted of 47 Governors and subordinate officers; 450 soldiers and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MENIALS\">menials</a>; and they had thirty seven Negro chiefs in their pay. (n.)\n\nAFRICAN INSTITUTION. This Institution was formed in 1807, for purposes which, to use the words of a celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LITERARY\">Literary</a> Journal, \"certainly render it one of the most interesting, and most creditable to the feelings and character of our country, that ever found support within its bounds.\" (Edinb. Review, Vol. XV. p. 485.) Its general objects, and the views which influenced its formation, are clearly stated in the following resolutions adopted, at the constituent meeting, held on the 14th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a> 1807.\n\n\"1. That this meeting is deeply impressed with a sense of the enormous wrongs which the natives of\nAfrican Institutions in promoting any of the purposes of the institution.\" (First Report, p. 4.)\n\nThe management of the affairs of this institution is vested in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-PRESIDENT\">president</a>, twenty vice-presidents, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURER\">treasurer</a>, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOARD\">board</a> of thirty-six directors. These officers are chosen annually from among that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a> of the subscribers who are called governors of the institution. Those who subscribe sixty guineas at one time become <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> governors; but thirty guineas subscribed at one time, make the subscriber a governor for life; or three guineas annually, a governor during the continuance of this annual subscription. Every subscriber of one guinea becomes an ordinary member, and continues so during the continuance of his subscription.\n\nIt is much to be regretted, that the funds of this noble institution are far too limited to enable it to pursue with vigour those great objects which it was intended to promote. Its annual income does not exceed \u00a3400; and, including donations, its whole receipts, of every kind, from its first formation to the commencement of the present year (1815), have amounted to only \u00a39350. With such scanty means, it is impossible to do much in a direct way towards the advancement of civilization. A single fact will suffice to show this. To a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> teacher lately sent to Sierra Leone, the society allows a salary of \u00a3300 a-year, and this sum, moderate as it is, exhausts three-fourths of its annual income. But though the Institution has not hitherto been enabled to commence any extended plans of civilization in Africa, it has happily been able to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-AID\">aid</a> materially in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PAVING\">paving</a> the way for such plans, by exerting its influence to effect a thorough abolition of the slave trade. This is the first great and indispensable step towards the improvement of Africa; and the vigilant attention of the society to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIMARY\">primary</a> object has been of the greatest importance, both by enforcing a rigorous execution of the abolition laws enacted in this country, and by animating and directing the public call upon other nations to follow our example.\n\nThe proceedings of the society are fully detailed in its annual Reports, which are regularly published. These Reports are written with great ability, and contain much valuable and interesting information in regard to Africa, and the means of civilizing it. It may be proper to add, that the conduct of the directors has been severely attacked, and their Reports criticised, in a pamphlet lately published by Dr Thorpe, who, for sometime, held the office of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">Chief</a> Judge in the colony of Sierra Leone.

Not having been\nable to procure her Eloge by Frisi; we have been obliged to content ourselves with some shorter notices; the most detailed of which is that contained in Mazzucchelli's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> of the Writers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> published during the earlier, but more brilliant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of her life. The accounts which this writer and some others have given of the intellectual capacities and endowments which she <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> in early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YOUTH\">youth</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CALL\">call</a> to mind the wonders which have been related of Picus of Mirandula, and the Admirable Crichton. Nor does there seem any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> to doubt their authenticity. At <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, she not only spoke the Latin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> with precision, but even composed and delivered an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORATION\">oration</a> in that language, intended to prove that the cultivation of letters is not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a> with the female character. This singular piece was published at Milan the same year in which it was spoken, with the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a>: Oratio qua ostenditur artium liberium studia a feminino sexu nequitiam abhorrere, habita a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARIA\">Maria</a> de Agnesii rhetoricae operam dante anno octatis sue nono nondum exacto, die 18 Augusti 1727.\n\nAt eleven years of age, she spoke Greek with all the fluency of her native tongue. When yet very young, she had also acquired some of the languages of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EAST\">East</a>; and, in a word, her acquisitions as a linguist were such, as to procure for her the appellation of a Walking Polyglott. But her aptitude for acquiring languages, however <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a>, was by no means the only, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> the most striking feature of her intellectual character. We have seen how early she essayed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> question affecting the mental capacities of her sex, and the vigour and acuteness displayed in this aspiring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSAY\">essay</a> were, ere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, exerted with ardour and success in scientific inquiries. Having gone through the elementary branches of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol1.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a>, she proceeded with alacrity to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\"><a class=\"xref\" hr</a>ef=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>; and she seems also to have carried her researches into the obscurer regions of metaphysical speculation.\n\nAbout the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> when she reached her fifteenth year, her father formed a select <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a> of the learned of Milan, and at these meetings, which were held in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, at stated times, for several years, Agnesi maintained a succession of Theorems on various <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of speculation and philosophy. The ability which she displayed on these occasions seems to have been altogether surprising; and the effect was not the less, that her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> was agreeable, and her whole deportment gentle and prepossessing. We are indebted to the learned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-PRESIDENT\">President</a> De Brosse for the following account of one of these conferences, at which he assisted during his travels in Italy, through the introduction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> Belloni. \"I had conceived,\" says he, \"when I went to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVERSATION\">conversation</a>, that it was only to talk with this young lady in the usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>, though on learned subjects; but to my surprise, Belloni addressed her in a fine Latin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARANGUE\">harangue</a>, with all the formality of an academic oration. She replied in the same language, with prompt-\n\nness and ability; and they proceeded, still in Latin, to discuss the origin of fountains, and the causes of the ebbs and flows observed in some of them. She spoke like an angel on this subject, and I never heard it treated so much to my satisfaction. We then discoursed with her concerning the manner in which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> receives impressions from outward objects, and their conveyance to the general sensorium, the brain; and afterwards upon the propagation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, and the prismatic colours. The conversation afterwards became general, every one speaking to her in the language of his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, and she answering in the same.\" (Lettres sur l'Italie, Tom. I. p. 243.) But Agnesi seems to have taken but little delight in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> which she acquired as a philosophical disputant. Her temper was retired and devout, and she appears to have acted this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> more to gratify her father than herself. About her twentieth year, she accordingly withdrew from these assemblies, and for a long period devoted the greater part of her time to mathematical studies. The Theses which she had maintained with so much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLAUSE\">applause</a> were published in a quarto <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a>, under the following title: Propositiones Philosophice quas crebris disputationibus domi habitis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CORAM\">coram</a> clarissimis viris explicabit extempore et ab objectis vindicabat Maria Gaetana de Agnesii Mediolanensis, Med. 1738.\n\nThe first fruit of her mathematical studies was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMENTARY\">Commentary</a> on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONIC_SECTIONS\">Conic Sections</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARQUIS\">Marquis</a> de l'<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">Hospital</a>; but this piece she would never consent to publish, though Mazzucchelli says that it was greatly praised by many who had perused the manuscript. In the course of a few years, however, she gave to the world a mathematical work, which must ever secure her a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> among the most distinguished cultivators of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>. This work, entitled Instituzioni Analitiche <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AD\">ad</a> uso della Giovent\u00f9 Italiana, was published at Milan in 1748, in two volumes quarto. The first volume treats of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a> of finite quantities; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, of the analysis of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFINITESIMALS\">infinitesimals</a>. These two volumes contain a full and satisfactory view of this branch of mathematical science in the state at which it had then arrived; and though improvements have since that time been introduced, the treatise of Agnesi, according to a very competent authority, may still be regarded as perhaps the best introduction that is to be found to the works of Euler, and the other mathematicians of the Continent. (Edinb. Review, Vol. III. p. 408.)\u2014An English translation of this work was long ago executed by the late Professor Golson of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>, but the manuscript lay buried in obscurity for many years, and was only published in 1801, through the care and at the expense of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARON\">Baron</a> Maseres.\n\nBesides other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LITERARY\">literary</a> honours which followed the publication of the Analytical Institutions, Agnesi was, in 1750, appointed Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy in the university of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOLOGNA\">Bologna</a>.

Wheel-ploughs, says Dr Dickson (Practical Agriculture, Vol. I, p. 7.), should be seldom had recourse to by the experienced ploughman; though they may be more convenient and more manageable for those who are not perfectly informed in that important and useful art.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HERTFORDSHIRE\">Hertfordshire</a> and Kentish turn-west wheel-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLOUGH\">plough</a>, as well as the swing-plough, are described by Blythe; and they do not seem to have received much improvement since his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>. The former is thought most suitable for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> purposes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> stiff tenacious soils; and the latter where very deep ploughing is required.\n\nOn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> loamy and friable soils, where deep ploughing is not necessary, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORFOLK\">Norfolk</a> wheel-plough <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be found convenient and useful; it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a> and light in its form, doing its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> with neatness, and requiring only a small power of draught.\n\nTo the improved <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> wheel-plough an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOARD\">board</a>, firmly screwed to the coulter, has been lately added. It is made use of when ploughing turf, which it takes off by itself, and turns into the furrow, immediately covering it with earth. It is observed, that, by this management, turf at one ploughing has the appearance of a fallow, and harrows nearly as well; but more strength is required in the team. A similar sort of skim coulter may be added to any other plough, and may be useful in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> green crops and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> dung, as well as in trench ploughing. But in most instances it is thought a preferable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>, where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> is to be stirred to an unusual depth, to make two common swing-ploughs follow each other in the same track; the one before taking a shallow furrow, and the other going deeper, and throwing up a new furrow upon the former.\n\nTwo furrow ploughs are used in a few places; but are not likely ever to become general. They are constructed either with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHEELS\">wheels</a>. A plough of this kind was strongly recommended by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Somerville, and is used by His Lordship and others, apparently with some advantages. In Blythe's Improver Improved, there is an engraving of this plough also. But, with all the improvements made by Lord Somerville, it can never come into competition for general purposes with the present single furrow ploughs; and he admits, that it would be no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> to invade the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> already established in well cultivated counties; though, where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> teams are employed, with a driver besides the ploughman, it would certainly be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of importance to use this plough, at least on light friable soils. \"Their horses,\" he says, \"will not feel the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between their own single furrow working one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACRE\">acre</a>, or the well constructed two furrow plough with two acres per <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>; there is no system deranged, and double work done.\" (Communications to the Board of Agriculture, Vol. II, p. 418.)\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMOS\">Amos</a>, already mentioned, has gone much beyond this. In his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> in the Board's Communications formerly referred to, he gives a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> with an engraving of a machine, which combines, \"two, three, or four ploughs together, for ploughing furrows <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> by five inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>.\" On soils of a tenacity next to clay, \"six horses will draw four ploughs; four horses three ploughs, and three horses two ploughs, and every plough to plough an acre a day.\" It is scarcely necessary to add, that such machines are altogether unfit for agricultural operations; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> and condition of the soil and surface, varied in ways innumerable, will never permit the general use of them; and even in the few situations where they may be employed, there is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> to believe that ploughing cannot be done cheaper, and certainly not so well as by the two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> single furrow plough.\n\nVarious other implements under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of Miner, &c., ploughs have been constructed for stirring the soil\u2014such as the Miner for following in the furrow of a common plough, and loosening the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> to a greater depth, without bringing up the subsoil\u2014the Paring Plough, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol7.html#article-MOLE\">Mole</a> and other sorts of ploughs for draining; some of which shall be afterwards noticed under their proper heads. See Plate II.\n\n2. Cultivator and Grubber.\n\nA <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> variety of implements have been contrived for stirring and pulverizing the soil, without turning up a new surface as the plough does. Some of them are used in preparing it for the seed, and others, as horse-hoes, between drilled crops. It were to no purpose to enumerate and describe all these implements; we shall here notice only one machine of very recent introduction which promises to be of much utility. It is said to be an improvement on the Cultivator, and has been called a grubber, from its efficiency in bringing weed roots to the surface. It consists of two strong rectangular frames, the one including the other, and nine bars mortised into the inner one, with eleven coulters or tines with triangular sharp-edged <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIPPING\">dipping</a> feet, four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a>-iron wheels, two handles, &c. (See Plate I.) All the coulters are fixed in these bars, except two which are placed in the side beams of the outer frame, and may be set to go more or less deep by means of pins and wedges. It is useful in stirring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> on which potatoes or turnips have grown, or that has been ploughed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUTUMN\">autumn</a>, or during winter; so that a crop may be sown in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> without further use of the plough. It works as deep as the plough has gone, and, by the reclined position of the coulters, brings to the surface all the weed roots that lurk in the soil. Beans and peas have been sown in spring on the winter furrow, after being stirred by the grubber; and barley also, after turnip, without any ploughing at all. In working fallow it is used with good effect in saving one, two, or more ploughings. This implement is made of different sizes, and may be worked either by four or by two horses.\n\n3. Harrows.\n\nThe harrows most generally used are of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a> shape, each containing twenty tines, five or six inches long beneath the bulls or bars in which they are inserted. It is still common for every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARROW\">harrow</a> to work separately; and though always two, and sometimes three harrows are placed together, each of them is drawn by its own horse. The great objection to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> is, that it is scarcely possible, especially upon rough ground, to prevent the harrows from starting out of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, and riding on one another. To ob-\n\nImplement viate this inconvenience, the exterior bulls of each are usually surmounted by a frame of wood, raised so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> as to protect it from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> motions of its neighbour; but in many instances they are connected by chains or hinges or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> bars, which is a preferable plan. Another objection which has been made to the common harrows is, that the ruts made by the tines are sometimes too near and sometimes too distant from one another; but this is probably not a great fault when the soil requires to be pulverized as well as the seed covered, especially when they are permitted to move irregularly in a lateral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>. Where the soil is already fine, as it ought always to be before grass seeds are sown, lighter harrows are used, which are so constructed, that all the ruts are equidistant. See Plate I.\n\nThe brake, as commonly constructed, is nothing more than a heavier harrow, sometimes in one, and sometimes in two pieces joined together; the tines being in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>, and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> from one another at which they are placed, suited to the nature of the soil on which it is employed.\n\n4. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRILL\">Drill</a>-Machines.\n\nThe purpose of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a>, but often too complicated machines is, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEPOSIT\">deposit</a> the seed in equidistant rows on a flat surface; on the top of a narrow ridge; in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> between two ridges; or in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> of a common furrow. Corn when drilled is usually sown in the first of these ways; turnips in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>; and peas and beans in the third or fourth. As there is a description and engraving of a patent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> sowing machine, in the body of the work, (Agriculture, No. 165,) it is unnecessary to say anything of later inventions, none of which are in general use. One of the best, for sowing all kinds of corn, was invented by Mr Bailey of Chillingham, who has paid great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of agricultural implements, and applied to their improvement his knowledge, both as a mathematician and agriculturist. The practice of drilling corn does not however seem to be gaining ground, and even where it is found of advantage to have the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> rise in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> rows, this is sometimes done by means of what is called ribbing, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> which will be afterwards described, as more convenient in many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> than sowing with a drilling machine.\n\nIn Scotland, turnips are universally sown with a drill machine, on ridges twenty-seven or thirty inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, usually formed by one bout of a common plough. When turnips are extensively grown, the machine is made to sow two of these ridges at once, and two rollers are attached to it, one for smoothing the tops of the ridges before the seed is deposited, and the other for compressing the soil and covering the seed. It is drawn by one horse walking between the ridges, and requiring no other driver than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> who guides the machine, which is simple in its construction, and most expeditious in its operation. See Plate III.\n\nBeans and peas, when sown in rows, are either deposited in the space between two ridgelets, which implements are afterwards reversed to cover them, or in the bottom of a furrow made by a common plough\u2014in Scotland, usually in that of every third furrow. This implement in most common use for this purpose is extremely simple, and is either wheeled forward by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, or attached to the common plough itself.\n\n5. Horse-Hoes.\n\nThe interval between the rows of drilled turnips, Horse-hoes, potatoes, and beans and peas, being commonly from 2 to 2\u00bd feet, admits the employment of a horse-hoe, or hoeing-plough. Of this kind of machine there are a great many varieties. A very good one is described in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-NORTHUMBERLAND\">Northumberland</a> Report, (p. 43;) the body is of a triangular form, and contains three coulters and three hoes, or six hoes, according to the state of the soil. A hoe of the same kind is sometimes attached to a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROLLER\">roller</a>, and employed between rows of wheat and barley, from nine to twelve inches distant; it is also used in place of a cultivator, in preparing bean stubbles for wheat in autumn, and in pulverizing lands for barley in spring.\n\nAnother implement which answers both as a double mould-board plough, and a horse-hoe, is much approved in the culture of drilled crops; and with some slight alterations it may be also employed as a small plough for taking the earth from the sides of the ridgelets. When it is used as a horse-hoe, the mould-boards are taken off, and two curved cutters or coulters expand from the beam on each side, to a less or greater distance according to the width of the interval between the plants, and approach each other in the bottom of the furrow where the share supplies their place. This machine is well adapted for light soils, and can be set to work very near the rows of plants; it is particularly useful in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> up annual weeds preparatory to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>-hoeing, which it greatly facilitates. When it is to be employed as a single or double mould-board plough, the cutters are withdrawn. See Plate III.\n\n6. Rollers.\n\nThese are constructed of wood, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, or cast-iron, and of different dimensions, according to the purposes for which they are used. The spike-roller is employed in some places when the soil rises in large masses, difficult to be reduced. The Norfolk drill-roller, on which rings of iron are fixed at small distances, is considered an useful implement, as, by forming parallel ruts into which the seed falls, with small ridges between, the seed is better covered than by harrowing alone. For a further <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of the roller, and other useful implements, see the article in the body of the work.\n\n7. Horse-Rakes.\n\nIn those districts where corn is cut with the scythe, the horse-rake is found to be an useful implement for saving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANUAL\">manual</a> labour; it is also used for hay. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a> are of iron, fourteen or fifteen inches in length,\n\n* See Essay on the Construction of a Plough deduced from Mathematical Principles; and Northumberland Report, p. 48. Edit. 1800.\n8. Thrashing-Machine.\n\nThrashing-machines (already described in the Encyclopaedia under the word Thrashing), are now common in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of Scotland, on farms where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of tillage land requires two or more ploughs; and they are every year spreading more and more in England and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>. They are worked by horses, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, wind, and, of late, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEAM\">steam</a>; and their powers and dimensions are adapted to the various sizes of farms. Water is by far the best power, but, as a supply cannot be obtained in many situations, and as wind and steam require too much expense for most farms, horses are employed more generally than any other power. Where windmills are erected, it is found necessary to add such machinery as may allow them to be worked by horses occasionally, in very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CALM\">calm</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>; and the use of steam must be confined for the most part to the coal districts.\n\nAll the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> parts of this machine have been distinctly pointed out in the article referred to, and in the engraving which accompanies it; though several additions and slight alterations have been since introduced. One of the most useful of these, perhaps, is the method of delivering the straw, after it has been separated from the corn by the circular rake, to what is called a travelling-shaker, which carries it to the straw-barn. This shaker, which revolves like the endless web said to have been formerly used for conveying the corn to the beaters, is composed of small rods, placed so near as to prevent the straw from falling through, while any thrashed corn that may not have been formerly separated, drops from it in its progress, instead of falling along with it, where it would be trodden down and lost.\n\nIt is well known that the work of horses in thrashing-mills is unusually severe, if <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> for any length of time; that they sometimes draw unequally; that they, as well as the machine itself, are much injured by sudden jerks and strains, which are almost unavoidable; and that, from this irregularity in the impelling power, it requires much care in the man who presents the corn to the rollers, to prevent bad thrashing. It is therefore highly desirable that the labour should be equalized among the horses, and the movements of the machine rendered as steady as possible. A method of yoking the horses in such a manner as compels each of them to take his proper share of the labour, has accordingly been lately introduced, and the necessary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a>, which is neither complicated nor expensive, can be added to any machine worked by animal power. (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">Farmer</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGAZINE\">Magazine</a>, Vol. XIII. p. 279). See Plate IV.\n\nAll well-constructed thrashing-mills have one winnowing-machine, which separates the chaff from the corn before it reaches the ground; and a second sometimes receives it from the first, and gives it out ready for market, or nearly so. If the height of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> does not admit of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> addition, a separate winnowing-machine, when the mill is of great power, is driven by a belt from it. In either of these ways there is a considerable saving of manual labour. And with a powerful water-mill, it cannot be doubted, that corn is thrashed and dressed at no more expense than must be incurred for dressing alone, when thrashed with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAIL\">flail</a>. Besides, the corn is more completely detached from the straw; and, by being thrashed expeditiously, a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of it may be preserved in a bad season which would have spoiled in a stack. The great advantage of transferring forty or fifty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of grain in a few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a>, and under the eye of the owner, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-YARD\">yard</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANARY\">granary</a> or market, is of itself sufficient to recommend this invaluable machine, even though there were no saving of expense.\n\nA machine of this kind, to be worked by one or two men, has been lately brought forward, and may probably be found very useful on small farms. It is made for L. 8 or L. 10, and is said to thrash ten or twelve bushels in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>. (Id. p. 409.) See Plate IV.\n\n9. Winnowing-Machine.\n\nThis is said to be of Chinese <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>, and to have been brought to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> by the Dutch, from whom it reached Scotland in the early part of the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>. They were first made by a person of the name of Rodgers, near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAWICK\">Hawick</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-ROXBURGHSHIRE\">Roxburghshire</a>, who happened to see one in a granary at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEITH\">Leith</a>, in the year 1733, though it would appear that one had been brought from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EAST\">East</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOTHIAN\">Lothian</a>, along with a barley-mill, twenty-two years before. Yet it does not seem to have been then known to farmers, nor did it come into general use till long after 1783; and, in some parts of England and of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> of Scotland, it is not employed even at this day. Two men and three women will dress and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> up into sacks, in about ten hours, from twenty to twenty-five quarters of corn, by means of this machine.\n\n10. Chaff-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUTTER\">Cutter</a>, and similar Implements.\n\nChaff-cutters may be either wrought separately by manual labour, or by being attached to some other machine. This implement, like the operation it performs, is sufficiently simple, though its construction is various. Macdougal's patent chaff-cutter is understood to be one of the most useful of the kind, and may be easily repaired, when necessary, by any common mechanic. Another tool of a similar description, is partially used for cutting turnips, which is often an advantageous practice, especially in feeding sheep of a year old in spring, after they have cast their first teeth. Various contrivances are also adopted by some farmers for cutting or bruising corn for horses, which ought to become a more general practice, particularly for old horses, and such as swallow their corn without mastication. Akin to these inventions is the steaming apparatus, which should be considered a necessary appendage to every arable and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAIRY\">dairy</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARM\">farm</a> of a moderate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIZE\">size</a>. The advantages of preparing food for live-stock by means of steam, begin now to be generally and justly appreciated.\n11. Wheel-Carriages.\n\nWaggons, though they may possess some advantages over carts, in long journeys, and when fully loaded, are now admitted to be much less convenient for the general purposes of a farm, and particularly on occasions which require great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISPATCH\">dispatch</a>, as in harvesting the crop. According to Marshall, the waggons used in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GLOUCESTERSHIRE\">Gloucestershire</a> are the best in England. (Rural Economy of Gloucestershire). In some places, the improved Irish car is employed for light loads, while the waggon continues to be used for other purposes.\n\nCarts, drawn by one or two horses, are, however, the only farm carriages of some of the best cultivated counties, and no other are ever used in Scotland. Their load depends upon the strength of the horses, and nature of the roads; but in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, it is asserted that a given number of horses will draw a great deal more, according to some one-third more, in single-horse carts than in waggons. Two-horse carts are still the most common among farmers in Scotland; but those drawn by one horse, two of which are always driven by one man, are unquestionably preferable for most purposes. The carriers of the west of Scotland usually load from a ton to a ton and a half on a single-horse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol4.html#article-CART\">cart</a>, and nowhere does it carry less than 12 cwt. if the roads are tolerable.\n\nFor corn in the straw, and hay, the farmers of the south of Scotland and north of England, use a sparred frame, which is made to fit the same wheels from which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> body of the cart is removed. In other places the close body is retained, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOVEABLE\">moveable</a> rails attached to it for these loads. See Plate IV.\n\nCarts are varied in their construction to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> different purposes. A very convenient carriage for homework, called a coup-cart, discharges its load with great ease and expedition; the fore part of the close body being made to rise up from the shafts on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> out an iron <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PIN\">pin</a>, while the other end sinks, and allows the load to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> to the ground.\n\nBrood wheels, with conical, or convex rims, are common in England; in Scotland the wheels are generally narrow, though broader ones are beginning to be introduced. Those used for the common, or two-horse carts, are usually about 4\u00bd feet high, and mounted on iron axles. The advantages of broad cylindrical wheels have been illustrated with much force and ingenuity in several late publications. (Communications to the Board of Agriculture, Vol. II. and Vol. VII. Part i.)\n\n12. Reaping-Machines.\n\nAn implement capable of performing the process of reaping corn, is yet a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIDERATUM\">desideratum</a> in agricultural machinery, but which will probably be supplied, at least for favourable situations, at no distant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>. In all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a> operations, dispatch, in such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> as this, is a matter of great importance; but in reaping corn at the precise period of its maturity, the advantages of dispatch are incalculable, especially in those districts where the difficulty of procuring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, even at enormous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol21.html#article-WAGES\">wages</a>, aggravates the danger from the instability of the season. It cannot, therefore, fail to be interesting, and we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">hope</a> it may be also useful, to record some of the more remarkable attempts that have been made towards an invention so eminently calculated to forward this most important operation.\n\nThe first attempt of this kind, so far as we have learned, was made by Mr Boyce, who obtained a patent for a reaping-machine fifteen or twenty years ago. This machine was placed in a two-wheeled carriage, somewhat resembling a common cart, but the wheels were fixed upon the axle, so that it revolved along with them. A cog-wheel, within the carriage, turned a smaller one at the upper end of an inclined <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol3.html#article-AXIS\">axis</a>, and at the lower end of this was a larger wheel, which gave a rapid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PINION\">pinion</a> fixed upon a vertical axis, in the fore part of the carriage, and rather on one side, so that it went before one of the wheels of the carriage. The vertical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPINDLE\">spindle</a> descended to within a few inches of the surface of the ground, and had there a number of scythes fixed upon it horizontally.\n\nThis machine, when wheeled along, would, by the rapid revolution of its scythes, cut down a portion of the corn growing upon the ground over which it passed, but having no provision for gathering up the corn in parcels and laying it in proper heaps, it was wholly unsuited to the purpose.\n\nAn agricultural implement maker of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, Mr Plucknet, attempted some years afterwards to improve this machine. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> he made, was in substituting for the scythes a circular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a> plate, made very sharp at the edge, and notched on the upper side like a sickle. This plate acted in the same manner as a very fine toothed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a>, and was found to cut the corn much better than the scythes of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> machine. See Plate V.\n\nA description and drawing of a machine, invented Mr Gladstone of Castle Douglas, in the Stewart's Magazine, Vol. VII. p. 273. It operated upon nearly the same principles with Mr Plucknet's; but Mr Gladstones made it work much better by introducing a circular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>, with strong wooden teeth notched below all around, which was fixed immediately over the cutter, and parallel to it. The use of these teeth was to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLECT\">collect</a> the corn and retain it till it was operated on by the circular cutter. The corn when cut was received upon this table, and, when a sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> was collected, taken away by a rake or sweeper, and laid upon the ground beneath the machine, in separate parcels. To this machine was added a small circular wheel of wood covered with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMERY\">emery</a>, which, being always in contact with the great cutter at the back part, or opposite side to that where the cutting was performed, kept it constantly ground to a sharp edge.\n\nThe next attempt was made by Mr Robert Salmon of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WOBURN\">Woburn</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEDFORDSHIRE\">Bedfordshire</a>, whose invention, it is said, promised better than those we have mentioned. It was constructed upon a totally different principle, as it cut the corn by means of shears; and it was provided with a very complete apparatus for laying it down in parcels as it was cut. See Plate V.\n\nThe latest, and by much the most ingenious, as well as promising machine of this kind, of which we have received any account, is that constructed by Mr Smith, of the Deanston Cotton Works, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-PERTHSHIRE\">Perthshire</a>. Mr Smith's perseverance, his successive im-\n\nThe form most generally approved for a set of offices, is that of a square, or rather a rectangular parallelogram, the houses being arranged on the north, east, and west sides, and the south side fenced by a stone wall, to which low buildings for calves, pigs, &c., are sometimes attached. The space thus inclosed is usually allotted to young cattle; these have access to the sheds on one or two sides, and are kept separate according to their size or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, by one or more partition-walls. The farmer's dwelling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> stands at a short distance from the offices, and frequently commands a view of the inside of the square; and cottages for servants and labourers are placed on some convenient spot, not far from the other buildings.\n\nThe number and arrangement, as well as the size of the different houses, must depend, in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, on the extent of the farm, and the general management. It is, therefore, only necessary to notice particularly those which are indispensable in every case on an arable farm, and the degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a> they should afford.\n\nThe Barn is always set down so as to be as convenient as possible for the stack-yard, wherever corn is put up in stacks instead of being immediately carried from the field to the barn itself. Relatively to the other buildings, its situation may be varied according to circumstances; but two things should be attended to; first, its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTIGUITY\">contiguity</a> to the granary; and second, its facility of access for furnishing straw to the cattle-houses. In the plan delineated in Plate VII., it is placed in the middle of the north <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANGE\">range</a>, with one end projecting into the stack-yard, and the other, where the straw is lodged, on a line with stables on one side, and cattle-houses on the other, and having a door opening towards the straw-yards. As it is to be understood throughout this description, that a thrashing-mill is employed, from 20 to 30 feet within walls, on the length of this side of the square, will generally be sufficient for the straw-house. The height of the barn must be such as to allow at least one winnowing machine to be attached to the mill, and its length is determined by the size of the farm.\n\nA Granary is an indispensable accommodation on all tolerably large farms, and is commonly, though in many cases improperly, placed above the cart-sheds, to be afterwards noticed. From <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> we would recommend that the granary should be under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a> of the barn, immediately above the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a> on which the machine works; and that the corn should be raised to it from the ground-floor, either by the thrashing-mill itself, or a common windlass, easily worked by one man. When it is to be taken out and carried to market, it may be lowered down upon carts, with the utmost facility and dispatch. There is evidently no greater expense incurred by this arrangement; for the same floor and height of side-walls that must be added to the barn, are required in whatever situation the granary may be; and it possesses several advantages. Owing to its being higher than the adjacent buildings, there is a freer circulation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, and less danger of pilfering, or of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a> by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VERMIN\">vermin</a>; the corn can be deposited in it as it is dressed, without being exposed to the weather, while the saving of la-\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SECT\">Sect</a>. II. Farm-Houses.\n\nSuitable farm buildings are scarcely less necessary to the husbandman than implements and machinery, and might, without much impropriety, be classed along with them, and considered as one great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a> machine, operating more or less on every branch of labour and produce. There is nothing which marks more decidedly the state of agriculture in any district than the plan and execution of these buildings.\n\nIn erecting farm-houses, the first thing that deserves notice is their situation, both in regard to the other parts of the farm, and the convenience which they ought themselves to possess. In general, it must be of importance on arable farms, that the buildings should be set down at nearly an equal distance from the extremities; or so situate that the access from all the different fields should be easy, and the distance from those most remote no greater than the size of the farm renders unavoidable. The advantages of such a position in saving labour, are too obvious to require illustration; and yet this matter is not nearly so much attended to as its importance deserves. In some cases, however, it is advisable to depart from this general rule, of which one of the most obvious is, when a command of water for a thrashing-mill, and other purposes, can be better secured in another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of the farm.\nStables are now constructed in such a manner that all the horses stand in a line with their heads towards the same side-wall, instead of standing in two lines, fronting opposite walls, as formerly. Those lately erected are at least sixteen feet wide within walls, and sometimes eighteen, and the width of each stall upon the length of the stable is commonly five feet. To <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol16.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> a little room stalls of nine feet are sometimes made to hold two horses, and, in that case, the manger and the width of the stall are divided into equal parts by what is called a half trevice, or a partition about half the depth of that which separates one stall from another. By this contrivance, each horse indeed eats his food by himself; but the expense of single stalls, is more than compensated by the greater ease, security, and comfort of the horses. The trevices or partitions which divide the stalls, are of deals two inches thick, and about five feet high; but, at the heads of the horses, the partition rises to the height of seven feet, and the length of the stall is usually from seven to eight feet.\n\nThe manger is generally continued the whole length of the stable. It is about nine inches deep, twelve inches wide at the top, and nine at the bottom, all inside measure, and is placed about two feet four inches from the ground. Staples or rings are fixed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a> of the manger, to which the horses are tied.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACK\">rack</a> for holding their hay or straw is also commonly continued the whole length of the stable. It is formed of upright spars, connected by cross rails at each end, and from two, to two and a half feet in height. The rack is placed on the wall, about one foot and a half above the manger, the bottom almost close to the wall, and the top projecting outwards so as to form an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> with it of twenty or twenty-five degrees. The spars are sometimes made round, and sunk into the cross rails, and sometimes square. In a few stables lately built, the round spars turn on a pivot, which facilitates the horse's access to the hay, without requiring the interstices to be so wide as to permit him to draw it out in too large quantities.\n\nImmediately above the racks is an opening in the hay-loft, through which the racks are filled. When it is thought necessary, this may be closed by boards moving on hinges.\n\nBehind the horses, and about nine feet from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> wall, is a gutter, having a gentle declivity to the straw-yard or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-URINE\">urine</a>-pit. Allowing about a foot for this, there will remain a width of eight feet to the back wall, if the stable be eighteen feet wide; a part of which, close to the wall, is occupied with corn-chests and places for harness.\n\nIn some of the best stables, the racks occupy one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> between the wall and trevices, and form the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRANT\">quadrant</a> of a circle. The spars are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a>, and wider placed than in the hanging racks. The hay-seed falls into a box below, instead of being dropped on the ground, or incommoding the eyes and ears of the horses.\n\nWith a view to save both the hay and the seed, it is an advantage to have the hay-stack so near the stable as to admit of the hay being thrown at once upon the loft. In some stables there is no loft, and the hay is stored in a separate apartment. The floor is, for the most part, paved with undressed stones; but, in some instances, the space from the gutter to the back wall is laid with flags of freestone.\n\nAccording to the plan we are describing, Cattle-houses are placed on the other side of the straw-house, and, with a root-house, complete the north side of the square. The extent of these, it is evident, depends not only on the size of the farm, but on the general management, and must vary according as rearing, fattening, or dairy cattle, form the principal object. To avoid prolixity, let it be understood that this part of the range is allotted to fattening cattle. There are three ways in which the cattle are placed; first, in a row towards one of the side walls; second, in two rows, either fronting each other, with a passage between, or with their heads towards both side walls; and, third, across, or upon the width of the house, in successive rows, with intervening <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> for feeding and removing the dung. In the first plan, it is usual to have openings in the walls, through which they are supplied with turnips, otherwise they must necessarily be served from behind, with much inconvenience, both to the cattle-feeder and the cattle themselves. The plan that is most approved, and now becoming general when new buildings are erected, is to fix the stakes to which the cattle are tied about two and a half or three feet from the wall, which allows the cattle-man, without going among them, to fill their troughs successively from his wheelbarrow or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BASKET\">basket</a>, with much ease and expedition. It is also a considerable improvement to keep the cattle separate, by partitions between every two. This will in a great measure prevent accidents, and secure the quiet animals from being injured by the vicious; for, in these double stalls, each may be tied up to a stake placed near the partition, so as to be at some distance from his neighbour; and it is easy to lodge together such as are alike in size and in temper. The width of such stalls should not be less than 7\u00bd feet, and the depth must be regulated by the size of the cattle.\n\nWherever a number of cattle are fed, an apartment is required for containing turnips, potatoes, &c., when brought from the field, until they are dealt out into the troughs. This apartment is placed either on the line of the cattle-houses, or begins another side of the square, at the angle of the junction of the two sides. The outer-door ought to be so large as to admit a loaded cart; and there is an inner-door that opens into the feeder's walk along the heads of the cattle. At the other end of this, a door opens into the straw-house; so that their food and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LITTER\">litter</a> are not exposed to the weather, and the labour of the feeder is greatly diminished.\n\nThe east and west sides of the square consist chiefly of sheds for the straw-yard cattle, and cart-sheds.\nBut stables for young horses, riding-horses, and for separating the sick from the others, may be placed upon that side which connects with the common stable already described; and, in like manner, a part of the opposite side, connecting with the cattle-houses, may be allotted to cows; or, if necessary, the feeding-houses may be continued. The cattle-sheds are open towards the straw-yards, and the cart-sheds outwards to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-ROAD\">road</a>. On one of these sides there should be a close apartment for small tools, and another for preparing corn and roots by steam, which may also serve for other purposes. In some convenient place near the stables and cattle-houses, or immediately over them, there should be sleeping-rooms for the servants who have the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of them, that they may be at hand in case of accidents during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>.\n\nAlong the wall which completes the inclosure, such low buildings may be set down, particularly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HOG\">hog</a>-styes and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POULTRY\">poultry</a>-houses, as may be thought desirable. These styes should open behind into the straw-yards, to which the hogs should have access for picking up corn left on the straw, and what turnips, clover, &c. are refused by the cattle. When they are kept in great numbers, it may be necessary to allot them a range of styes, with yards in front, in another place, as is commonly done by gentlemen farmers; but it is absurd fastidiousness, in a rent-paying farmer, to exclude these profitable animals from a place where a few of them will make themselves fat without a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHILLING\">shilling</a> of expense, and without any real injury to the cattle among which they feed.\n\nIt will be seen from the engraving, (Plate VII.) that a road, which should always be kept in good order, goes along three sides of this square, from which there is access to the houses, instead of entering through the straw-yards from the inclosed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol2.html#article-AREA\">area</a>. All the houses in which live stock are kept have an opening behind towards the straw-yards, for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> out their dung.\n\nThis plan, which, with slight variations, required by circumstances, is common in the north of England and south of Scotland; is meant to combine convenience with economy, and is well adapted to most arable farms in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCCUPANCY\">occupancy</a> of tenants. Proprietors who farm, sometimes choose to add several other buildings, and, at the same time, to vary a little their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a>. Thus, it is common to separate the straw-yards from the sides of the square, by a cart-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>, towards which all the doors open, and the hog-styes with yards are usually placed behind one of the sides where they are least exposed to observation.\n\nIn every case, it is absolutely necessary that there should be water in or near the area. In the plan delineated in Plate VII., a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PUMP\">pump</a> is placed at the end of the wall which divides the area, and along this wall are fixed troughs, to which the cattle on each side have access at all times.\n\nWhen a great number of cattle are fed at the stake, it is necessary to have a reservoir near the square to receive their urine. The urine is either applied to the land in its liquid state, or earth, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEAT\">peat</a>-moss, &c. are thrown into the pit in such quantities as may be necessary to absorb it. Sometimes the reservoir is sunk below the area, and the urine raised by a pump, and spread over the straw-yard. But, on those arable farms where no more cattle are reared or fattened, and no more turnips consumed at the homestead, than what are needed for converting the straw into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANURE\">manure</a>, a reservoir for urine is not required; the whole of it being absorbed by the straw as it is dropped.\n\nThe practice of feeding cattle in small sheds and straw-yards, or what are called hammels in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol4.html#article-BERWICKSHIRE\">Berwickshire</a>, deserves to be noticed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROBATION\">approbation</a>, when saving of expense is not a paramount object. Two cattle are usually kept together, and go loose, in which way they are thought by some to thrive better than when tied to a stake, and, at the same time, feed more at their ease than when a number are kept together, as in the common straw-yards. All that is necessary is, to run partition-walls across the sheds and yards already described, or, if these are allotted to rearing stock, one side of the square, separated by a cart-way from the straw-yards, is appropriated to these hammels.\n\nOn large farms, a smith's and a wright's shop are found exceedingly convenient, even though used only one or two days a-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>. Much time is lost in going to a distance to the residence of these necessary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a>; and it is now not uncommon to have houses furnished with the necessary accommodations on farms of this description, where the smith attends at stated intervals, and the wright when wanted. It is better to set down these houses at a little distance, than to place them on the square, whence, among other inconveniences, the danger from fire is a sufficient reason for excluding them.\n\nThe cottages for farm-servants, which are usually set down in a line, at not an inconvenient distance from the offices, ought to contain each of them at least two apartments with fire-places, though, in some of the best cultivated counties, there is only one chimney, and no other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> than what is made by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FURNITURE\">furniture</a>. But better accommodation for this useful and meritorious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a> is now generally allowed in erecting new buildings. Every cottage has a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KITCHEN\">kitchen</a>-garden adjoining; and as farm-servants in the southern counties of Scotland have each of them a cow, kept all the year on the farm as part of their wages, it is common to attach a byre for them to the range of cottages, and sometimes also hog-styes, and apartments for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol10.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a>.\n\nIt is unnecessary to say anything of a farmer's dwelling-house, as the size and accommodations are very little different from those of other dwelling-houses possessed by people of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> or income. It is only on dairy farms that particular apartments are necessarily appropriated to the business of a farm; and these shall be described under a separate article. See Dairy.\n\nMost of the farm-buildings recently erected in the best cultivated counties are covered with slate. A thatched roof is still common for cottages, though for these also slate is beginning to be preferred. One cause of the comparative sterility of land in former times, was the great quantity of straw that was withdrawn from the food or litter of cattle, and used as thatch, instead of being converted into manure.\n\nTenants holding on leases for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> of years are Repairs.\nusually taken bound to keep all the houses on a farm in sufficient repair during their occupancy, and to leave them so at their removal, having received them in such a state at their entry. It is common to have them inspected by tradesmen, both at the beginning and expiration of a lease, for the purpose of determining their condition, and awarding such repairs as may be necessary. In some districts, it is the practice to ascertain their value at the commencement of a lease, the tenant being bound at his removal, when a second valuation takes place, to pay or to accept the difference. But the objections to this method are obvious. If no change has taken place, during the currency of the lease, in the price of materials and wages of labour, the tenant suffers by being called upon to make good the decay occasioned by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAPSE\">lapse</a> of time, which ought to be considered as covered by his rent. If, on the other hand, both materials and labour have advanced in price, as has been the case of late years, the proprietor may be obliged to make a large payment to the removing tenant, even though the houses are rendered of less real value, not only by time, but by carelessness or dilapidations.\n\nSect. III. Fences.\n\nNext to implements and machinery, and suitable buildings, fences are in most situations indispensable to the profitable management of arable land. They are not only necessary to protect the crops from the live stock of the farm, but often contribute, in no small degree, by the shelter they afford, to augment and improve the produce itself. On all arable farms, on which cattle and sheep are pastured, the ease, security, and comfort, which good fences give, both to the owner and the animals themselves, are too evident to require particular notice. And as there are few tracts so rich as to admit of crops being carried off the land for a succession of years, without the intervention of green crops consumed where they grow, fences, of some description or other, can very rarely be dispensed with, even in the most fertile and highly improved districts.\n\nThere is no branch of husbandry so generally mismanaged as this. No district, of any considerable extent, perhaps, can be named, in which one does not see the greater part of what are called fences, not only comparatively useless, but wasteful to the possessor of the lands which they occupy, and injurious both to himself and his neighbours, by the weeds which they shelter. This is particularly the case with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THORN\">thorn</a> hedges, which are too often planted in soils where they can never, by any management, be expected to become a sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FENCE\">fence</a>; and which, even when planted on suitable soils, are in many cases so much neglected when young, as ever afterwards to be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol7.html#article-NUISANCE\">nuisance</a>, instead of an ornamental, permanent, and impenetrable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARRIER\">barrier</a>, as, with proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TRAINING\">training</a>, they might have formed in a few years.\n\nUntil of late inclosures have too often been made without much regard to the size of the farm, the exposure, the form of the fields, and the equability of the soil. This is the more to be regretted in the case of live fences, which ought to endure for a long course of years, and which cannot be eradicated without considerable expense. It is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a>, indeed, to lay down any rules on this subject that would be generally applicable; but upon a little reflection it must be evident, that the size of the field should be suited not only to the extent of the farm, but also to the nature of the soil, which ought to prescribe the course of management, whether in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> or green crops, or with the intervention of several years pasturage\u2014that the exposure of the land should be considered, in order that the fences may give the shelter that is most required\u2014that the form of the field should be such, as to render it most accessible from the farm buildings, and that it may be cultivated at the least expense, the lands or ridges not being too short, nor running out into angles at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> where the fence takes a different direction\u2014and that the soil of the inclosure should be as nearly alike throughout as possible, that the whole field may be always under the same kind of crop. It must, in general, be a matter of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> to have water in every inclosure; but this is too obvious to escape attention.\n\nNotwithstanding the garden-like appearance which hedge-row trees growing in hedges give to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANDSCAPE\">landscape</a>, it seems to be agreed by the most intelligent agriculturists, that they are extremely hurtful to the fence, and for some distance to the crops on each side; and it is evident, that, in many instances, the highways, on the sides of which they often stand, suffer greatly from their shade. It has therefore been doubted, whether such trees be profitable to the proprietor, or beneficial to the public\u2014to the farmer they are almost in every case injurious, to a degree beyond what is commonly imagined.\n\nIn the subdivisions of an arable farm, whatever number may be the kind of fence which it is thought advisable to adopt, we would recommend that particular attention be paid to the course of crops which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of the soil points out as the most advantageous; and that upon all farms, not below a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDIUM\">medium</a> size, there should be twice the number of inclosures that there are divisions or breaks in the course. Thus, if a six year's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROTATION\">rotation</a> be thought the most profitable, there should be twelve inclosures, two of which are always under the same crop. One very obvious advantage in this arrangement is, that it tends greatly to equalize labour, and, with a little attention, may contribute much to equalize the produce also. On large farms, where all the land under turnips and clover, for instance, is near the extremity of the grounds, or at a considerable distance from the buildings, supposed to be set down near the centre, it is clear, that the labour of supplying the house and straw-yard stock with these crops, as well as the carriage of the manure to the field, is much greater than if the fields were so arranged, as that the half of each of these crops had been near the offices. But by means of two fields for each crop in the rotation, it is quite easy to connect together one field near the houses with another at a distance, and thus to have a supply at hand for the home stock, while the distant crops may be consumed on the ground. The same equalization of labour must be perceived in the cultivation of the corn fields, and in harvesting the crops. The time lost in travelling to some of the\nfields, when working by the plough, is of itself a matter of some consequence on large farms. But the advantages of this arrangement are not confined to the equalization and economy of labour; it may also, in a great measure, render the annual produce uniform and equable, notwithstanding a considerable diversity in the quality of the soil. A field of an inferior soil may be connected with one that is naturally rich, and in the consumption of the green crops, as well as in the allowance of manure, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> land may be gradually brought nearer, in the quantity and quality of its produce, to the rich, without any injury to the latter. Thus a field under turnips may be so fertile, that it would be destructive to the succeeding corn crop to consume the whole or the greater part on the ground; while another may be naturally so poor, or so deficient in tenacity, as to make it inexpedient to spare any part for consumption elsewhere. By connecting these two under the same crop,\u2014by carrying from the one what turnips are wanted for the feeding-houses and straw-yards, and eating the whole crop of the other on the ground with sheep, the ensuing crop of corn will not be so luxuriant on the former as to be unproductive, while the latter will seldom fail to yield abundantly. The same plan will also be advantageous in the case of other crops. Hay or green clover may be taken from the richer field, and the poorer one depastured; and on the one wheat may succeed both turnips and clover, while the more gentle crops of barley and oats are appropriated to the less fertile field.\n\nThese observations are particularly applicable to turnip soils, of such a quality as not to require more than one year's pasturage, and which are therefore cultivated with corn and green crops alternately; but the same principle may be extended to clay lands, and such as require to be depastured two or more years in succession.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to add, that upon wet soils, where hedges are employed as fences, it is of importance that the ditches be drawn in such a direction as to serve the purposes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DRAINS\">drains</a>, and also that they may receive the water from the covered drains that may be required in the fields <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTIGUOUS\">contiguous</a>. According as the line of the fence is more or less convenient in this respect, the expence of draining may be considerably diminished or increased.\n\nThe most common fences, of a permanent character, are stone walls and white thorn hedges. Stone walls have the recommendation of being an immediate fence; but the disadvantage of going gradually to decay, and of requiring to be entirely rebuilt, in some cases every twenty years, unless they are constructed with lime <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTAR\">mortar</a>, which is in many districts much too expensive to be employed in erecting common fences. White thorn hedges, on the contrary, though they require several years to become a fence of themselves, may be preserved at very little expense afterwards in full vigour for several generations.\n\nHaving thus thrown out a few hints of a general nature, we beg to refer the reader, for an account of the different sorts of fences commonly employed, to the body of the work (AGRICULTURE, P. III. \u00a7 10), and shall only observe here, that, in many instances, there seems to be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RADICAL\">radical</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> in the first construction and subsequent management of hedge-fences in particular, which might be easily removed under appropriate covenants of lease. The expence of inclosing, and, of course, the direction and construction of the fences, ought to be undertaken in almost every case by the proprietor, not merely for the sake of relieving the tenant from a burden which may be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a> with his circumstances and professional duties, but also from a principle of economy on the part of the landlord. Whatever may be the tenant's knowledge and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a>, it is not to be expected that his views should extend much beyond his own accommodation during his temporary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCCUPATION\">occupation</a>; whereas the permanent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> of the landlord requires, not so much a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> attention to economy in the first instance, as that the amelioration shall be as complete and as durable as possible. The tenant's outlay on fences must inevitably be returned by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIMINUTION\">diminution</a> of the yearly rent, and probably with a large profit for the first advance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>; while, at the same time, that money may be expended in an improvement which is neither so complete nor so lasting as it might have been rendered, had it been done at the expence, and under the direction of the proprietor.\n\nBut another error of the same kind is probably kept in still more common, and by far more pernicious to landholders. The fences are to be kept in repair by the tenant; which, in so far as regards stone walls, is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STIPULATION\">stipulation</a> no way objectionable. But it often happens that a landlord, even though he runs a hedge-fence at his own expence, leaves it to be trained up by the tenant without his interference; and the consequence is, that, in perhaps nine cases out of ten, it never becomes a sufficient fence at all;\u2014that the original cost is lost for ever; and that the land which it occupies is not only unproductive, but actually a nuisance. Besides, it is evidently improper to require of a tenant to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REAR\">rear</a> up a good fence, commonly by a greater outlay than was required for forming it, when the half of his lease perhaps must elapse before he can derive much benefit from it. This mistake on the part of proprietors is probably the principal cause of the badness of hedge-fences; for if they are neglected when the plants are young,\u2014if cattle are allowed to make gaps,\u2014water permitted to stagnate in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DITCH\">ditch</a>,\u2014or weeds to grow unmolested on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a>, no labour or attention afterwards will ever make an equal and strong fence. As it is well known how difficult, or rather impossible, it is to enforce this care by any compulsory covenants, the best plan for both parties is that which is adopted in some districts, where hedges are reared at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> expence of landlord and tenant,\u2014the thorns, while they require it, being protected by rails, or otherwise, so as to give the tenant all the advantages of a complete fence in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time. In this case he cannot justly complain that he pays a share of the expence, and this payment furnishes the strongest motive for preserving the young thorns from damage, and for training them with such care, as to become a complete fence in the shortest possible period.\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of Scotland, in regard to inclosing, have promoted this invaluable improvement in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. It holds out the greatest facilities, both for straightening the boundaries of conterminous properties, and for erecting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-MARCH\">march</a>-fences, by obliging every proprietor, upon due notice from his neighbour, to defray half the charges of such a fence as the nature of the soil and surface may render most eligible. By an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> in 1686, cattle must be constantly herded during the day, if the pastures be not inclosed, and are ordered to be kept during the night in houses, folds, or inclosures; a fine is exigible from the owner, if his cattle trespass on his neighbour's lands,\u2014so much for every animal,\u2014over and above the damage done, even where there are no fences; and, by the statute 1695, heavy penalties are denounced against such as destroy fences.\n\n**Sect. IV. Tillage.**\n\nAs the operations connected with tillage must necessarily be regulated by the condition of the soil and surface, and the crops to be cultivated, as to which we shall have occasion to treat in a subsequent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">section</a>, all that is at present necessary is, to offer a few general observations, premising, that we here take it for granted, that all those obstructions which fall to be considered under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">Natural</a> Pastures and Wastes, have either never existed, or been already removed.\n\nIt is well known to every husbandman, that clayey or tenacious soils should never be ploughed when wet; and that it is almost equally improper to allow them to become too dry; especially if a crop is to be sown without a second ploughing. The state in which such lands should be ploughed is that which is commonly indicated by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHRASE\">phrase</a>, \"between the wet and the dry,\"\u2014while the ground is slightly moist, mellow, and the least cohesive.\n\nIn ploughing the first time for fallow or green crops, all good farmers begin immediately after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARVEST\">harvest</a>, or after wheat sowing is finished; and when this land has been gone over, the old tough swards, if there be any, are next turned up. The reasons for ploughing so early are sufficiently obvious; as the frosts of winter render the soil more friable for the spring operations, and assist in destroying the weed roots. In some places, however, the first ploughing for fallow is still delayed till after the spring seed-time.\n\nIn the following remarks, the swing-plough, drawn by two horses, is to be understood as the one employed, if no other be mentioned; and the practices of some of the English counties having been described in the body of the work, we shall here confine ourselves, for the most part, to those of the north of England and the south-east of Scotland.\n\nThree different points require particular attention in ploughing; 1. the breadth of the slice to be cut; 2. its depth; and 3. the degree in which it is to be turned over\u2014which last circumstance depends both upon the construction of the plough, particularly the mould-board, and the care of the ploughman.\n\nThe breadth and depth of the furrow-slice are regulated by judiciously placing the draught on the nozzle or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIDLE\">bridle</a> of the plough; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SETTING\">setting</a> it so as to go more or less deep, and to take more or less land or breadth of slice, according as may be desired. In general, the plough is so regulated that, if left to itself, and merely kept from falling over, it would cut a little broader and a little deeper than is required. The coulter is also placed with some inclination towards the left or land side, and the point of the sock or share has a slight tendency downwards.\n\nThe degree to which the furrow-slice turns over, is different in a great measure determined by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> between its breadth and depth, which for general purposes is usually as three is to two; or when the furrow is nine inches broad it ought to be six inches in depth. When the slice is cut in this proportion, it will be nearly half turned over, or recline at an angle of 40 or 45 degrees; and a field so ploughed will have its ridges longitudinally ribbed into angular drills or ridges. But if the slice is much broader in proportion to its depth, it will be almost completely overturned, or left nearly flat with its original surface downwards; and each successive slice will be somewhat overlapped by that which was turned over immediately before it. And finally, when the depth materially exceeds the width, each furrow-slice will fall over on its side, leaving all the original surface bare, and only laid somewhat obliquely to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZON\">horizon</a>.\n\nThe first of these modes of ploughing, where the breadth and depth are nearly in the proportion already mentioned, is the best adapted for laying up stubble land after harvest, when it is to remain during winter exposed to the mellowing influence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FROST\">frost</a>, preparatory to fallow or turnips. The second or shallow furrow, of considerable width, as five inches in depth by eight or nine wide, is understood to answer best for breaking up old leys; because it covers up the grass turf and does not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURY\">bury</a> the manured soil. The third is a most unprofitable and useless slow operation, which ought seldom or never to be adopted. The most generally useful breadth of a furrow-slice is from eight to ten inches, and the depth, which ought to be seldom less than four inches, cannot often exceed six or eight inches, except in soils uncommonly thick and fertile. When it is necessary to go deeper, as for carrots and some other deep rooted plants, a trench ploughing may be given by means of second plough following in the same furrow. Shallow ploughing ought always to be adopted after turnips are eaten on the ground, that the manure may not be buried too deep; and also in covering lime,\u2014especially if the ground has been pulverized by fallowing, because it naturally tends to sink in the soil. In ploughing down farm yard dung, it is commonly necessary to go rather deep, that no part of the manure may be left exposed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>. In the first ploughing for fallow or green crops, it is advisable to work as deep as possible, and no great danger is to be apprehended, though a small portion of the subsoil be at that time brought to the surface.\n\nThe furrow-slices are generally distributed into beds, varying in breadth according to circumstances; these are called ridges or lands, and are divided from one another by gutters or open furrows. These last serve as guides to the hand and eye of the sower, to the reapers, and also for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> of manures.\nin a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> manner. In soils of a strong or retentive nature, or which have wet close subsoils, these furrows serve likewise as drains for carrying off the surface water, and being cleared out, after the land is sown and harrowed, have the name of water-furrows.\n\nRidges are not only different in breadth, but are raised more or less in the middle on different soils. On clayey retentive soils, the great point to be attended to is the discharge of superfluous water. But narrow stitches of from three to five feet, are not approved of in some of the best cultivated counties. In these a breadth of fifteen or eighteen feet, the land raised by two gatherings of the plough, is most commonly adopted for such soils; such ridges being thought more convenient for manuring, sowing, harrowing, and reaping, than a narrower one; and the water is drained off quite as effectually.\n\nOn dry porous turnip soils, ridges may be formed much broader; and were it not for their use in directing the labourers, may be, and sometimes are, dispensed with altogether. They are often thirty or thirty-six feet broad, which in Scotland are called band-swirridges, because reaped by a band of shearers, commonly six, served by one binder. If it be wished to obliterate the intermediate furrows, this may be done by casting up a narrow ridgelet or single bout drill between the broad ridges, which is afterwards levelled by the harrows.\n\nWith regard to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of forming these ridges, straight and of uniform breadth,\u2014let us suppose a field perfectly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> that is intended to be laid off into ridges of any determinate breadth. The best ploughman belonging to the farm conducts the operation, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-AID\">aid</a> of three or more poles shod with iron, in the following manner: The first thing is to mark off the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> ridges, on which the horses turn in ploughing, which should in general be of an equal breadth from the bounding lines of the field, if these lines are not very crooked or irregular. The next operation, assuming one straight side of the field, or a line that has been made straight, as the proper direction of the ridges, is to measure off from it with one of the poles (all of them of a certain length or expressing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIFIC\">specific</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a>), half the intended breadth of the ridge, if it is to be gathered, or one breadth and a half if to be ploughed flat; and there the ploughman sets up a pole as a direction for the plough to enter. On a line with this, and at some distance, he plants a second pole, and then in the same manner a third, fourth, &c. as the irregularity of the surface may render necessary, though three must always be employed,\u2014the last of them at the end of the intended ridge, and the whole in one straight line. He then enters the plough at the first pole, keeping the line of poles exactly between his horses, and ploughs down all the poles successively; halting his horses at each, and replacing it at so many feet distant as the ridges are to be broad; so that when he reaches the end of the ridge, all his poles are again set up in a new line parallel to the first. He returns however along his former track, correcting any deviations, and throwing a shallow furrow on the side opposite to his former one. These furrows, when reversed, form the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> of the ridge, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> the ploughmen who are to follow. The same operations are carried on until the whole field is marked out. This is called feiring in Scotland, and striking the furrows in England. It is surprising with what accuracy these lines are drawn by skilful ploughmen.\n\nAnother method has been adopted for the same purpose, which promises to be useful with less experienced workmen. A stout lath or pole, exactly equal in length to the breadth of the intended ridge, is fixed to the plough, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> angles to the line of the draught, one end of which is placed across the handles exactly opposite the coulter, while the other end projects towards the left hand of the ploughman, and is preserved in its place by a rope passing from it to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLAR\">collar</a> of the near side horse. At the outer end of the lath, a coulter or harrow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TINE\">tine</a> is fixed perpendicularly, which makes a trace or mark on the ground as the plough moves onwards, exactly parallel to the line of draught. By this device, when the plough is feiring the crown of one ridge, the marker traces the line on which the next ridge is to be feired. (General Report of Scotland, Vol. I p. 954.)\n\nWith regard to the direction and the length of ridges, these points must evidently be regulated by the nature of the surface, and the size of the field. Short angular ridges, called butts, which are often necessary in a field with irregular boundaries, are always attended with a considerable loss of time, and ought to be avoided as much as possible.\n\nIn ploughing steep land it is advisable to give the ridges an inclination towards the right hand at the top, by which, in going up the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCLIVITY\">acclivity</a>, the furrow falls more readily from the plough, and with less fatigue to the horses. Another advantage of forming ridges in a slanting direction on such land is, that the soil is not so apt to be washed down from the higher ground, as if the ridges were laid at right angles. Wherever circumstances will permit, the best direction however is due north and south, by which the grain on both sides of the ridge enjoys nearly equal advantages from the influence of the sun.\n\nThe land being thus formed into ridges, is afterwards cultivated without marking out the ridges anew, until the inter-furrows have been obliterated by a fallow or fallow crop. This is done by one or other of the following modes of ploughing: 1. If the soil is dry and the land has been ploughed flat, the ridges are split out in such a way, that the space ploughing, which the crown of the old ridge occupied is now allotted to the open furrow between the new ones. This is technically called crown-and-furrow ploughing. 2. When the soil is naturally rather wet, or, if Casting, the ridges have been raised a little by former ploughings, the form of the old ridges, and the situation of the inter-furrows, are preserved by what is called casting, that is, the furrows of each ridge are all laid in one direction, while those of the next adjoining ridge are turned the contrary way; two ridges being always ploughed together. 3. It is commonly necessary to raise the ridges on soils very tenacious of moisture, by what is called gathering, which is done by the plough going round the ridge, beginning at the crown and raising all the furrow slices inwards. 4. This last operation, when it is wished to give the land a level surface, as in fallowing, is reversed by...\nTillage turning all the furrow-slices outwards; beginning at the inter-furrows, and leaving an open furrow on the crown of each ridge. In order to bring the land into as level a state as possible, the same mode of ploughing or cleaving as it is called, may be repeated as often as necessary.\n\nHigh crooked ridges, which are described at some length in the body of the work, are universally disapproved of, and now very rare in the best cultivated districts. A machine employed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LEVELLING\">levelling</a> such land is exhibited on Plate VIII. and a reward was given by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> of Arts in London, for the improvements made on it by Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAVID\">David</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol6.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> in 1809.\n\nIn the strongest lands, a pair of good horses ought to plough three quarters of an acre in nine hours, but upon the same land, after the first ploughing, or on friable soils, one acre, or an acre and a quarter is a common day's work. Throughout the year, an acre a day may be considered as a full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a>, on soils of a medium consistency. The whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of furrows on an English statute acre, supposing each to be nine inches broad, would extend to 19,360 yards; and adding twelve yards to every 220 for the ground travelled over in turning, the whole work of one acre may be estimated as extending to 20,416 yards, or eleven miles and nearly five furlongs.\n\nA kind of ploughing known by the name of ribbing, was formerly common on land intended for barley, and was executed soon after harvest, as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> for the spring ploughings. A similar operation is still in use in some places, after land has been pulverized by clean ploughings, and is ready for receiving the seed. By this method only half the land is stirred, the furrow being laid over quite flat, and covering an equal space of the level surface. But, except in the latter instance, where corn is meant to grow in parallel lines, and where it is used as a substitute for a drill-machine, ribbing is highly objectionable, and has become almost obsolete.\n\nVarious inventions, under the names of Cultivator, Scarificator, Scuffler, &c. have been employed in England to supply the place of the plough, or rather to diminish the number of ploughings. Their use is to loosen the soil without bringing up a new surface. One of them under the name of a Grabber, has been already described in the section on Implements, and an engraving of it is annexed. (See Plate I.) An implement of this kind, worked by two horses, may cover a space of three feet, and the breadth of its work is consequently equal to that of four ordinary furrows, or to four acres a day; and upon lands that are considerably pulverized, it may go over six acres. If three operations of such a machine be equal in point of efficacy to two ploughings, the saving of expense must in all cases be considerable; particularly in those districts where the plough is still worked by a team of four or six horses. But one, and, on strong land, two ploughings must be given, before it can be employed with much advantage.\n\nSect. V. Fallowing.\n\nThere is no branch of agricultural practice that has engaged more attention of late than this; and after many years controversy, in which some of the ablest cultivators of the present day have entered the lists, and exhausted perhaps all the legitimate arguments on both sides, the practice does not appear to give way, but rather to extend, on wet tenacious clays; and it is only on such that any one contends for the advantages of fallowing. The expediency or inexpediency of pulverizing and cleaning the soil by a bare fallow, is a question that can be determined only by experience, and not by argument. No reasons, however ingenious, for the omission of this practice, can bring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVICTION\">conviction</a> to the mind of a farmer, who, in spite of all his exertions, finds, at the end of six or eight years, that his land is full of weeds, sour and comparatively unproductive. Drilled and horse-hoed green crops, though cultivated with advantage on almost every soil, are probably in general unprofitable as a substitute for fallow, and after a time altogether inefficient. It is not because turnips, cabbages, &c. will not grow in such soils, that a fallow is resorted to, but because, taking a course of years, the value of the successive crops is found to be so much greater, even though an unproductive year is interposed, as to induce a preference to fallowing. Horse-hoed crops, of beans in particular, postpone the recurrence of fallow, but in few situations can ever exclude it altogether.\n\nOn the other hand, the instances that have been adduced, of a profitable succession of crops on soils of this description, without the intervention of a fallow, are so well authenticated, that it would be extremely rash to assert that it can in no case be dispensed with on clay soils. Instances of this kind are to be found in different parts of Mr Young's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANNALS\">Annals</a> of Agriculture; and a very notable one, on Mr Greg's farm of Coles, in Hertfordshire, is accurately detailed in the sixth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the Communications to the Board of Agriculture.\n\nThe principal causes of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> difference among men of great experience, may probably be found in the quality of the soil, or in the nature of the climate, or in both. Nothing is more vague than the names by which soils are known in different districts. Mr Greg's farm in particular, though the soil is denominated \"heavy arable land,\" and \"very heavy land,\" is found so suitable to turnips, that a sixth part of it is always under that crop, and these are consumed on the ground by sheep\u2014a system of management which every farmer must know to be altogether impracticable on the wet tenacious clays of other districts. It may indeed be laid down as a criterion for determining the question, that wherever this management can be profitably adopted, fallow, as a regular branch of the course, must be not less absurd than it is injurious, both to the cultivator and to the public. It is probable, therefore, that, in debating this point, the opposite parties are not agreed about the quality of the soil; and in particular, about its property of absorbing and retaining moisture, so different in soils that in common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> have the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DENOMINATION\">denomination</a>.\n\nAnother cause of difference must be found in the climate. It is well known, that a great deal more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> falls on the west than on the east <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>;\nand that between the southern and northern counties there is at least a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> or six weeks' difference, in the maturation of the crops. Though the soil therefore be as nearly as possible similar in quality and surface, the period in which it is accessible to agricultural operations, must vary accordingly. Thus, in the south-eastern counties of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>, where the crops may be all cut down, and almost all carried home by the end of August, much may be done in cleansing and pulverizing the soil, during the months of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEPTEMBER\">September</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OCTOBER\">October</a>, while the farmers of the north are exclusively employed in harvest work, which is frequently not finished by the beginning of November. In some districts in the south of England, wheat is rarely sown before <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a>; whereas in the north, and still more in Scotland, if it cannot be got completed by the end of October, it must commonly be delayed till spring, or oats or barley be taken in place of wheat.\n\nIt does not then seem of any utility to enter farther into this controversy, which every skilful cultivator must determine for himself. All the crops, and all the modes of management which have been proposed as a substitute for fallow, are well known to such men, and would unquestionably have been generally adopted long ago, if, upon a careful consideration of the advantages and disadvantages on both sides, a bare fallow was found to be unprofitable in a course of years. The reader who wishes to examine the question fully, may consult, among many others, the works noted below.*\n\nHowever necessary the periodical recurrence of fallow may be on retentive clays, its warmest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol1.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a> do not recommend it on turnip soils, or on any friable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOAMS\">loams</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCUMBENT\">incumbent</a> on a porous subsoil; nor is it in any case necessary every third year, according to the practice of some districts. On the best cultivated lands it seldom returns oftener than once in six or eight years, and in favourable situations for obtaining an extra supply of manure, it may be advantageously dispensed with for a still longer period.\n\nFallows are in many instances so grossly mismanaged, particularly where they recur so often as to make it an object to derive some profit from them by means of sheep, that it may be of use to describe the several operations, according to the justly esteemed practice of East Lothian and Berwickshire.\n\n\"Invariably after harvest, the land intended for being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> fallowed in the ensuing year, gets an end-long ploughing, which ought to be as deep as the soil will admit, even though a little of the till or subsoil is brought up. This both tends to deepen the cultivated or manured soil, as the fresh accession of hitherto uncultivated earth becomes afterward incorporated with the former manured soil, and greatly facilitates the separation of the roots of weeds during the ensuing fallow process, by detaching them completely from any connection with the fast subsoil. This autumnal ploughing, usually called the winter furrow, promotes the rotting of stubble and weeds; and if not accomplished towards the end of harvest, must be given in the winter months, or as early in the spring as possible. In giving this first ploughing, the old ridges should be gathered up, if practicable, as in that state they are kept dry during the winter months; but it is not uncommon to split them out or divide them, especially if the land had been previously highly gathered, so that each original ridge of land is divided into two half ridges. Sometimes, when the land is easily laid dry, the furrows of the old ridges are made the crowns of the new ones, or the land is ploughed in the way technically called crown-and-fur. In other instances, two ridges are ploughed together, by what is called casting, which has been already described. After the field is ploughed, all the inter-furrows, and those of the headlands, are carefully opened up by the plough, and are afterwards gone over effectually by a labourer with a spade, to remove all obstructions, and to open up the water furrows into the fence ditches, wherever that seems necessary, that all moisture may have a ready exit. In every place where water is expected to lodge, such as dishes or hollow places in the field, cross or oblique furrows are drawn by the plough, and their intersections carefully opened into each other by the spade. Wherever it appears necessary, cross cuts are also made through the head ridges into the ditches with a spade, and every possible attention is exerted, that no water may stagnate in any part of the field.\n\n\"As soon as the spring seed-time is over, the fallow land is again ploughed end-long. If formerly split, it is now ridged up; if formerly laid up in gathered ridges, it is split or cloven down. It is then cross-ploughed; and after lying till sufficiently dry to admit the harrows, it is harrowed and rolled repeatedly, and every particle of the vivacious roots of weeds brought up to view, carefully gathered by hand into heaps, and either burnt on the field or carted off to the compost midden. The fallow is then ridged up, which places it in a safe condition in the event of bad weather, and exposes a new surface to the harrows and roller; after which the weeds are again gathered by hand, but a previous harrowing is necessary. It is afterwards ploughed, harrowed, rolled, and gathered as often as may be necessary to reduce it into fine tilth, and completely to eradicate all root weeds. Between these successive operations, repeated crops of seedling weeds are brought into vegetation and destroyed. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol11.html#article-LARVAE\">larvae</a> likewise of various insects, together with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFINITE\">infinite</a> variety of the seeds of weeds, are exposed to be devoured by birds, which are then the farmer's best friends, though often proscribed as his bitterest enemies.\n\n\"Some writers on husbandry have condemned the use of the harrow and roller in the fallow process, alleging, that frequent ploughing is all that is necessary to destroy root-weeds, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAKING\">baking</a> or drying of the clods in the sun and wind; but experience has ascertained, that frequently turning over the ground,\n\n* Young's Annals of Agriculture, and his writings generally; Hunter's Geographical Essays; Dickson's Practical Agriculture; Sir H. Davy's Agricultural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">Chemistry</a>; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">Brown</a>'s Treatise on Rural Affairs; The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTY\">County</a> Reports; And The General Report of Scotland.\nFollowing though absolutely necessary while the fallow process is going on, can never eradicate couch-grass or other root-weeds. In all clay soils, the ground turns up in lumps or clods, which the severest drought will not penetrate so sufficiently as to kill the included roots. When the land is again ploughed, these lumps are simply turned over and no more, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the plough serves in no degree to reduce them, or at least very imperceptibly. It may be added, that these lumps likewise inclose innumerable seeds of weeds, which cannot vegetate unless brought under the influence of the sun and air near the surface. The diligent use, therefore, of the harrow and roller, followed by careful hand-picking, is indispensably necessary to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a> of the fallow process.\n\n(General Report of Scotland, Vol. I. p. 419.)\n\nWhen effectually reduced to fine tilth, and thoroughly cleansed from roots and weeds, the fallow is ploughed end-long into gathered ridges or lands, usually fifteen or eighteen feet broad; which are set out in the manner already described, in treating of the striking of furrows or searing. If the seed is to be drilled, the lands or ridges are made of such widths as may suit the construction of the particular drill-machine that is to be employed. After the land has been once gathered by a deep furrow, proportioned to the depth of the cultivated soil, the manure is laid on, and evenly spread over the surface, whether muck, lime, marl, or compost. A second gathering is now given by the plough; and this being generally the furrow upon which the seed is sown, great care is used to plough as equal as possible. After the seed is sown and the land thoroughly harrowed, all the inter-furrows, furrows of the headlands, and oblique or gaw furrows are carefully opened up by the plough, and cleared out by the spade, as already mentioned, respecting the first or winter ploughing.\n\nThe expense of fallowing must appear, from what has been said, to be very considerable, when land has been allowed to become stocked with weeds; but if it be kept under regular management, corn alternating with drilled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULSE\">pulse</a> or green crops, the subsequent returns of fallow will not require nearly so much labour. In common cases, from four to six ploughings are generally given, with harrowing and rolling between, as may be found necessary; and, as we have already noticed, the cultivator may be employed to diminish this heavy expense. But it must be considered, that upon the manner in which the fallow operations are conducted, depend not only the ensuing wheat crop, but in a great measure all the crops of the rotation.\n\nSect. VI. Of the different kinds of Crops.\n\nAs this most important branch of agriculture, has been very fully treated in the body of the work, (Agriculture, Part I. Section III.) we shall here confine ourselves to a few leading observations; noticing, as we proceed, any changes that may have been recently introduced, either in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of crops, or in the culture and general management. And for the convenience of referring to the former article, we shall adopt nearly the same arrangement.\n\n1. Wheat.\n\nClays and strong loams, though certainly best adapted for wheat, are not by any means the only description of soils on which it is cultivated. Before the introduction of turnips and clover, all soils but little cohesive were thought quite unfit for wheat; but, even on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a> soils, it is now grown extensively, and with much advantage after either of these crops. The greater part of the wheat crop throughout Britain, however, is probably still sown upon fallowed land. When it succeeds turnips consumed on the ground, or clover cut for hay or siloing, it is commonly sown after one ploughing; but, upon heavier soils, or after grass of two or more years, the land is ploughed twice or three times, or receives what is called a rag-fallow.\n\nIn general, the fine white wheats are considered more delicate than the brown and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>, and the latter sort in particular, though seldom sown on rich warm soils, is found most profitable, from its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a> and early ripening, on inferior soils, in an unfavourable climate. A great many different sorts of summer wheat, transmitted a few years ago to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-PRESIDENT\">president</a> of the Board of Agriculture from the Agricultural Society of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, were divided for the purpose of experiment, among several distinguished agriculturists; but there has not yet been time for establishing their comparative merits, or their adaptation to the climate of Britain. Summer, or, as it is often called, spring wheat, has however been long and extensively cultivated in some parts of England, particularly in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-LINCOLNSHIRE\">Lincolnshire</a>; and, it is probable, may be found a valuable crop in the southern counties; but the trials that have been made in the north, do not seem to entitle it to a preference over winter wheat sown in spring, or even oats or barley, in that climate.\n\nWinter wheat is sown on early turnip soils, after Time of clover or turnips, at almost every period from the sowing beginning of September till the middle of March; but the far greater part is sown in September and October. For summer wheat, in the southern districts, May is sufficiently early, but in the north, the last fortnight of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a> is thought a more eligible seed-time. In the cultivation of spring sown winter wheat, it is of importance to use the produce of spring sown grain as seed, as the crop of such grain ripens about a fortnight earlier than when the produce of the same wheat winter sown is employed as spring seed.\n\nWheat before being sown is usually prepared with Preparis pickles or steeps and quicklime, as a preventative of seed against sour. (See Agriculture, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">Theory</a>, Section VII.) This important subject having been treated in the place referred to at some length, we shall only add a short account of a method of preparation, which has been followed with success in the south of Scotland,\u2014and of the efficacy of which we can speak from our own experience. Take four vessels, two of them smaller than the other two, the former with wire bottoms, and of a size to contain about a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BUSHEL\">bushel</a> of wheat,\n\n* Communications to the Board of Agriculture, Vol. VII. p. 11.\nthe latter large enough to hold the smaller within them. Fill one of the large tubs with water, and, putting the wheat in a small one, immerse it in the water, and stir and skim off the grains that float above; and renew the water as often as is necessary, till it comes off almost quite clean. Then raise the small vessel in which the wheat is contained, and repeat the process with it in the other large tub, which is to be filled with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STALE\">stale</a> urine; and in the mean time <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol21.html#article-WASH\">wash</a> more wheat in the water tub. When abundance of water is at hand, this operation is by no means tedious; and the wheat is much more effectually cleansed from all impurities, and freed more completely from weak and unhealthy grains and the seeds of weeds, than can be done by the winnowing-machine. When thoroughly washed and skimmed, let it drain a little, then empty it on a clean floor, or in the cart that is to take it to the field, and riddle quickly upon it, turning it over, and mixing it with a shovel, till it be sufficiently dry for sowing.\n\nWheat is most commonly sown broad-cast, in a manner too well known to need any description. Drilling is however extensively practised in some districts, and is becoming more general on lands infested with the seeds of annual weeds, especially when sown in spring. A machine which sows at three different intervals, according to the judgment of the farmer, of 12, 10\u00bd or 9 inches, is much approved of in Scotland. It deposits six, seven, or eight rows at once, according as it is adjusted to one or other of these intervals, and the work is done with ease and accuracy when the ridges are previously laid out of such a breadth, 12\u00bd feet, as to be sown by one bout; the machine going along one side of such a ridge, and returning on the other, and its direction being guided by one of its wheels, which thus always runs in the open furrow between the ridges. If the 10\u00bd <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a> interval be adopted, and it is the most common one in that country, the machine sows seven rows at once, or fourteen rows on a ridge of twelve feet and a half. But the space between the rows varies in some parts still more than this machine admits of; it ought not, however, to be so narrow as to prevent hand-hoeing, even after the crop has made considerable progress in growth; and it cannot advantageously be so wide as to admit the use of any effective horse-hoe. For a fuller <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a> of this subject, see the principal article, Part I. section viii.\n\nA third mode of sowing is common in some places, by which a drill machine is dispensed with, though the same purpose is nearly answered. This is by what is called ribbing, which we have already adverted to in the section on tillage. The seed is scattered with the hand in the usual broad-cast manner, but as it necessarily falls for the most part in the furrows between the ribs, the crop rises in straight parallel rows, as if it had been sown by a drill-machine; and the ribs are afterwards levelled by harrowing across them. This plan has nearly all the advantages of drilling, in so far as regards exposure to the rays of the sun, and the circulation of air among the plants; but, as some plants must always rise between the rows, it is not quite so proper when hand-hoeing is required.\n\nThe quantity of seed necessary, depends both on the time of sowing and the state of the land; land seed sown early, requiring less than the same land when sown in winter or spring, and poor land being at all times allowed more seed than the rich. The quantity accordingly varies from two bushels per English statute acre. Winter wheat, when sown in spring, ought always to have a liberal allowance, as the plants have not time to tiller much without unduly retarding their maturation.\n\nWhen wheat is sown broad-cast, the subsequent After Culture must generally be confined to harrowing, ture, rolling, and hand-hoeing. As grass-seeds are frequently sown in spring on winter-sown wheat, the harrows and roller are employed to loosen the soil, and cover the seeds. But these operations, to a certain extent, and at the proper season, are found beneficial to the wheat crop itself, and are sometimes performed even when grass-seeds are not to be sown. One or two courses of harrowing penetrate the crust which is formed on tenacious soils, and operate like hand-hoeing in raising a fresh mould to the stems of the young plants. Rolling in spring ought never to be omitted on dry porous soils, which are frequently left in so loose a state by the winter frosts, that the roots quit the soil and perish; and if the land be rough and cloddy, the roller has a still more beneficial effect than the harrows in pulverizing the inert masses, and extending the pasture of the plants. Hand-weeding, so far as to cut down thistles and other long weeds, is never neglected by careful farmers; but the previous culture ought to leave as little as possible of this work to be done when the crop is growing. Annual weeds, which are the most troublesome, can only be effectually destroyed by hand-hoeing; and to admit of this, the crop should be made to rise in rows, by being sown either by a drill-machine, or on ribs. Where grass-seeds are to be sown on drilled wheat, the hand-hoeing assists in covering them.\n\nWheat, which is almost universally reaped with the Reaping sickle,* ought not to stand till it be what is called dead ripe, when the loss is considerable, both upon the field and in the stack-yard. When cut, it is usually tied up in sheaves, which it is better to make so small as to be done by bands the length of the straw, than so thick as to require two lengths to be joined for bands. The sheaves are set up in shocks or stocks, each containing in all twelve, or, if the straw be long, fourteen sheaves. In the latter case, two rows of six sheaves are made to stand in such a manner as to be in contact at the top, though, in order to admit the circulation of air, at some distance below, and along this line, two sheaves more are placed as a covering, the corn end of both being towards the extremities of the line. In a few days of good weather the crop\n\n* In Hainault, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLANDERS\">Flanders</a>, a short scythe is commonly employed instead of a sickle; and this implement has been successfully tried in some places in England. See Plate IV. fig. 6, 7, 8., and the Description of that Plate.\n\nKinds of Crops.\n\nis ready for the barn or stack-yard. In the stack-yard, which is commonly contiguous to the farm-offices, having the barn on one of its sides, it is built either in oblong or circular stacks, sometimes on frames supported with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PILLARS\">pillars</a>, to prevent the access of vermin, and to secure the bottom from dampness; and as soon afterwards as possible the stacks are neatly thatched. When the harvest weather is so wet as to render it difficult to prevent the stacks from heating, it has been the practice to make funnels through them, a large one in a central and perpendicular direction, and small lateral ones to communicate with it. A particular method of constructing pillars, frames, and bosses, as the funnels are called, is described in a recent publication. (Husbandry of Scotland, Vol. I. p. 373.) In the best cultivated counties, the use of large barns for holding the crop is disapproved of, not only on account of the expense, but because corn keeps better, or is less exposed to damage of any kind, in a well-built stack.\n\nThrashing.\n\nBy means of the thrashing-mill, all sorts of corn are expeditiously separated from the straw, and dressed for market. One man feeds the grain in the straw into the machine, and is assisted by two half-grown lads, or young women, one of whom pitches or carries the sheaves from the hay close to the thrashing-stage, while the other opens the bands of every sheaf, and lays the sheaves successively on a small table close by the feeder, who spreads them evenly on the feeding-stage, that they may be drawn in successively by the fluted rollers, to undergo the operation of thrashing. In the opposite end of the barn, or straw-house, into which the rakes or shakers deliver the clean thrashed straw, one man forks up the straw from the floor to the straw-mow, and two lads, or young women, build it and tread it down. In a thrashing-machine, worked by water or wind, this is the whole expense of hand labour in the thrashing part of the operation; and, as a powerful machine can easily thrash from two to three hundred bushels of grain in a working day of nine hours, the expense is exceedingly small indeed. Assuming two hundred and fifty bushels as an average for the work of these people for one day, and their wages to be nine shillings, the expense does not amount to one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HALFPENNY\">halfpenny</a> for each bushel of grain. Even reducing the quantity of grain thrashed to one hundred and fifty bushels, the easy work of a good machine of inferior size and power, the expense does not exceed three farthings the bushel. But the whole of this must not be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> against the thrashing only, the grain being half dressed at the same time, by passing through one winnowing-machine, which is always attached to a complete thrashing-mill; and where a second can be conveniently connected with it, as is commonly the case if the mill be of considerable power, the corn comes down nearly ready for market. So that the thrashing, dressing, and building of the straw, with the use of a powerful water-mill, will scarcely cost more than dressing alone when the flail is employed; after every reasonable allowance for the interest of money, and the tear and wear of the machine.\n\nWhen grain is thrashed with a machine worked by horses, the expense is necessarily and considerably enhanced. One capable of effecting the larger quantity of work already calculated on, will require eight good horses, and a man to drive them, who may perhaps require the aid of a boy. The value of the work of eight horses for a day cannot be less than forty shillings, and the wages of the driver may be called two shillings and sixpence. Hence the total expense of thrashing two hundred and fifty bushels will amount to L. 2, 2s. 6d.; or about twopence per bushel, when the wages of the attendants are added; still leaving a considerable difference in favour of thrashing by the machine in preference to the flail. Were it even ascertained, that the expense of thrashing by horses and by the flail is nearly the same, horse-mills are to be recommended on other accounts\u2014such as better thrashing, expedition, little risk of pilfering, &c.\n\nThe diseases of plants being treated in the principal article (Theory, Sect. vii.), we shall do little more here than notice smut and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILDEW\">mildew</a>, the principal diseases of wheat. Respecting the cause of smut, different theories have been offered, which, however ingenious and plausible, do not seem sufficiently precise to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> to any practical result. In whatever manner this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> may be transmitted from the seed pickle in the ground to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-EAR\">ear</a>, it seems certain that, in general, the proximate cause of smut is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INFECTION\">infection</a> of the seed by the dust of the smut-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a>, (Lycoperdon globosum;) and that, though the most careful washing, even with the application of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CAUSTICS\">caustics</a>, may not in every case insure against smut, yet, if the seed be prepared in the way already mentioned, the disease will never prevail to such a degree as to affect materially the value of the crop. This is all that cultivators need to know, and all, perhaps, in the present state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>, that can be known, of the cause and prevention of smut.\n\nMildew is a much more destructive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTEMPER\">distemper</a> than mildew, smut, and, as it is probably occasioned by a peculiar state of the atmosphere between the periods of flowering and ripening, it is likely to baffle all attempts at prevention. The prevalence of heavy fogs or mist, drizzling rains, and sudden changes in the temperature, have been assigned as the causes of mildew; and as it has been found, that open airy exposures are much less affected than low sheltered lands, in years when mildew prevails most generally, the disorder may perhaps be somewhat diminished by drilling, which admits a freer circulation of air. Spring or summer wheat is less liable to mildew than the winter species, though it does not always escape. Minute parasitical fungi are commonly detected on the straw of mildewed wheat; and there cannot be the least doubt that the barberry bush, and probably several other shrubs, on which these fungi abound, have a powerful influence in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> the disease to a certain distance. (Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a> Banks on Mildew, and Communications to the Board of Agriculture, Vol. VII.)\n\n2. Rye.\n\nThe cultivation of this species of grain is more limited than it was in former times, when rye, either by itself or mixed with wheat, furnished the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a> of the labouring classes; and in most parts of Britain, there is no steady demand for it. It is, nevertheless,\na profitable crop in particular districts, and especially on sandy soils, that will scarcely carry any other kind of grain. There are two general varieties\u2014the one sown before winter, and the other in spring; and it is further distinguished by its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> or white <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>. The winter sort, which is the most plump and hardy grain, is sometimes cultivated as a green crop, to be eaten in spring, where turnips are not raised, or after they are consumed. There is nothing in its habits or mode of culture that requires particular notice. It is sometimes sown on the margins of fields, near farm-houses, as a protection to other crops against the depredations of poultry, which do not feed on it, and seldom penetrate through it; and its straw is more valuable for thatch, though useless as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FODDER\">fodder</a>, than that of any other species of corn.\n\n3. Barley.\n\nThis is a much less hardy grain than either of the former, and succeeds best on a finely pulverized soil, not so little cohesive as that which will carry rye, but much farther removed, on the other hand, from the clays best adapted to the growth of wheat. It is cultivated largely as a rotation crop in several counties of England; but of late rather sparingly in Scotland, owing, it is alleged, to the present duties on malt. It is most generally sown after turnips, though sometimes after beans or peas; and even after a bare fallow, if the land be not thought fit for wheat, or if the weather has prevented it from being sown at the proper season. Spring-sown wheat, either of the winter or summer species, and early oats, particularly the potatoe variety, now occupy a large portion of the land that was formerly allotted to barley.\n\nThe most intelligible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> among the different kinds of barley is founded on the number of the rows on the ear. Thus, we have Hordeum distichon, two-rowed barley, which is the kind most extensively cultivated, and comprises several varieties; Hordeum tetrasitchon, four-rowed barley, often called bear or bigg, the culture of which is, for the most part, confined to inferior soils, or to situations where the climate is unfavourable to the former species; and Hordeum hexastichon, or six-rowed barley, which is but little known in Britain, though it is the prevailing kind in the north of Europe, and said to be the hardest of all. (See principal article, No. 261.)\n\nTo whatever crop barley succeeds, the harrow and roller, when the plough alone is insufficient, should be employed in reducing the soil to a considerable degree of fineness. In most cases more than one earth is given; though, after a winter furrow, the cultivator may be used in spring instead of the plough. After turnips, eaten on the ground by sheep, the land, being consolidated by their treading, sometimes receives two ploughings; but if only one, it should be well harrowed and rolled; and it is often finished by harrowing after the roller, especially if grass-seeds be sown, which are covered by this last harrowing. Barley is sometimes sown on the first ploughing, and covered by a second shallow ploughing. (See principal article.) As it is found of great importance, with a view to speedy and equal vegetation, that the ground should be fresh and moist, barley is generally sown upon what is termed hot-fur, that is, as soon as possible after it is turned up by the plough.\n\nFrom the beginning of April to the middle of May is considered the best season for sowing barley; though in early situations it may be sown a fortnight later. Bear, or bigg, is an earlier, as well as a harder kind, than the two-rowed barley, and may be sown later. Winter sown barley, which may be eaten in spring and afterwards stand for a crop, is found to answer well in particular districts. On land infested with annual weeds, the drilling of this grain is an advantageous practice; but throughout the country at large, this, and all other culmiferous crops, are more generally sown broadcast. If the land be rich, a small quantity of seed is sufficient; often so little as two bushels per acre, and seldom more than three, or three and a half.\n\nBarley is cut down in some places with the sickle, reaping, and in others with the scythe; in England, very commonly with the latter, and in Scotland almost always with the former. It is the most difficult of all the species of corn to save in a precarious harvest, and usually requires more labour in thrashing and dressing, particularly in separating the awns from the grain, for which an apparatus, called a hummelling-machine, is frequently added to the thrashing-mill.\n\n4. Oats.\n\nThis hardy grain is sown, with little preparation, oats, on almost every kind of soil, and too often follows culmiferous crops, as well as pulse, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERBAGE\">herbage</a>, and bulbous-rooted plants. Where a correct course of alternate white and green crops prevails, oats usually succeed clover; and it is almost always the first crop on land that has been several years in grass. As it prospers best on a soil not too finely pulverized, it is commonly sown on one earth.\n\nThere are numerous varieties of this species, which are distinguished by colour, form, and the period of ripening; and by the names of the countries, such as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLAND\">Poland</a> and the Dutch, from whence they are understood to have been brought, or of the places where they were originally cultivated. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> of these are the common white variety, so well known as to need no description; the red; and what is called the potatoe-oat. For land in good cultivation, the two latter are probably the best,\u2014the red for uplands exposed to high winds,\u2014and the potatoe variety in lower situations. Both of these are early, and yield more abundantly, in grain as well as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAL\">meal</a>, than most others. The potatoe-oat has been but recently introduced into cultivation, having been discovered by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCIDENT\">accident</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUMBERLAND\">Cumberland</a> in 1788. (Farmer's Magazine, Vol. XIV. p. 167.) But it is now almost the only kind raised, on suitable soils, in the north of England, and throughout the lowlands of Scotland. It usually brings a higher price at Marklane than any other variety. The red oat is so called from the colour of its husk; it has a thinner and more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEXIBLE\">flexible</a> stem, and the grain is more firmly attached to it, than in any of the early varieties; so that upon good soils, in high situations, as it is in less danger of suffering from wind, and is, at the same time, so much earlier than the common kinds, it is entitled to a decided preference, particularly in a\nKinds of late climate. It is understood to have originated in the county of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEEBLES\">Peebles</a>, and is sometimes called the Magbiehill-oat, from the name of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESTATE\">estate</a> where it was first cultivated.\n\nOats are sown, usually broad-cast, in the months of March and April; seldom earlier or later, and from four to six bushels are allowed for an acre. They are often carried to the barn like hay, without being tied up in sheaves; but in the North, they are either managed in the way already described for wheat, or set up in single sheaves, or goits, as they are cut, and tied more tightly when ready to be carried; and then built in the stack-yard. Wherever a thrashing-mill is employed, as it is necessary, in order to have the work done well, that corn should be presented to the rollers in a regular, uniform manner, the practice of mowing, and carrying it in a loose state, is highly improper; and, independent of this objection, the season often occasions much damage to corn managed in this slovenly manner, which it would have escaped in sheaves and covered shocks.\n\nThe straw of oats is of more value as fodder than that of any other corn crop, and it is advantageously used as a substitute for hay during the winter months in some of the best cultivated districts, both for farm-horses and cattle.\n\n5. Peas and Beans.\n\nRespecting the first of these crops, little needs be added to what has been stated in the body of the work. Since the introduction of clover and turnips, the culture of peas, which are almost everywhere a most precarious crop, has been greatly diminished. Their straw, or haulm, is sometimes more valuable than the grain produce, which, in a wet or late season, is frequently little more than the seed; and when the straw is not luxuriant, so much of the land is left to the growth of weeds, that it is rendered unfit for carrying corn crops till cleansed by a fallow or fallow crop. Drilling is but an ineffectual remedy for these inconveniences, the stems falling over and covering the ground in so irregular a manner, as, in a great measure, to prevent either horse or hand hoeing, at the time when it would be most beneficial. Yet a luxuriant crop of peas, by completely covering the surface, keeping the soil in a moist and mellow state, and preventing the growth of weeds, is a good preparation for both wheat and barley.\n\nThe cultivation of beans is almost confined to clays and strong loams, in the best managed districts; turnip soils being by no means suited to this crop. Beans usually succeed wheat or oats, but sometimes also clover or pasture grass. The common horse-bean is the kind most generally cultivated; but large and small ticks are preferred in some of the English counties.\n\nBeans, though still sown broad-cast in several places, and sometimes dibbled, are, for the most part, drilled by judicious cultivators, or deposited after the plough in every furrow, or only in every second or third furrow. In the latter method, the crop rises in rows, at regular intervals of 9, 18, or 27 inches, and the hand-hoe ought invariably to be employed; but it is only where the widest interval is adopted, that the horse-hoe can be used with much effect in their subsequent culture.\n\nIn the preparation of the land, much depends on the nature of the soil and the state of the weather; for as beans must be sown early in the spring, it is sometimes impossible to give it all the labour which a careful farmer would wish to bestow. It must also be regulated, in some measure, by the manner of sowing. But as we are decidedly of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that beans ought, in general, to be planted with such a distance between the rows, as to admit of horsehoeing, we shall confine ourselves to this mode of culture, which we think should be generally known; making use of the latest publication on the subject, which contains an accurate account of the different operations. (General Report of Scotland, Vol. I. p. 515.)\n\nIn preparing ground for beans, it ought to be ploughed with a deep furrow after harvest, or early in winter; and as two ploughings in spring are highly advantageous, the winter-furrow may be given in the direction of the former ridges, in which way the land is sooner dry in spring than if it had been ploughed across. The second ploughing is to be given across the ridges, as early in spring as the ground is sufficiently dry; and the third furrow either forms the drills, or receives the seed, as shall be mentioned immediately.\n\nDung is often applied to the bean crop, especially if it succeeds wheat. By some, dung is spread on the stubble previous to the winter ploughing; but this cannot always be done in a satisfactory manner, at least in the northern parts of the island, unless during frost, when it may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> long exposed to the weather before it can be turned down by the plough. The most desirable mode therefore is, to lay the manure into drills immediately before the beans are sown.\n\nThere are, as already hinted, two several modes of sowing in drilling beans. In one of these, the lands, or ridges, Rows, are divided by the plough into ridgelets, or one bout stitches, at intervals of about 27 inches. If dung is to be applied, the seed ought to be first deposited, as it is found inconvenient to run the drill-machine afterwards. The dung may then be drawn out from the carts in small heaps, one row of heaps serving for three or five ridgelets; and it is evenly spread, and equally divided among them, in a way that will be more minutely described when treating of the culture of turnips. The ridgelets are next split out or reversed, either by means of the common plough, or one with two mould-boards, which covers both the seed and the manure in the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> manner.\n\nWhen beans are sown by the other method, in the bottom of a common furrow, the dung must be previously spread over the surface of the winter or spring ploughing. Three ploughs then start in succession one immediately behind another, and a drill <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARROW\">barrow</a> either follows the third plough, or is attached to it, by which the beans are sown in every third furrow, or at from 24 to 27 inches asunder, according to the breadth of the furrow-slice.\n\nAnother approved way of sowing beans, when dung is applied at seed-time, is to spread the dung,\nand to plough it down with a strong furrow; after which shallow furrows are drawn, into which the seed is deposited by the drill-machine. Whichever of these modes of sowing is followed, the whole field must be carefully laid dry by means of channels formed by the plough, and when necessary by the shovel; for neither then nor at any former period should water be allowed to stagnate on the land.\n\nThe time of sowing beans is as early as possible after the severity of winter is over; in the south sometimes in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a>, but never later than the end of March; as the ripening of the crop and its safe harvesting would otherwise be very precarious in this climate.\n\nThe quantity of seed allowed is very different in the southern and northern parts of Britain; in the former, even when the rows are narrow, only two bushels or two bushels and a half; but in Scotland seldom less than four bushels to the English statute acre; even when sown in ridges 27 inches distant, and a bushel more when sown broad-cast.\n\nBoth in the broad-cast and drill husbandry, it is common to mix a small quantity of peas along with beans. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> improves both the quantity and quality of the straw for fodder, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol17.html#article-PEA\">pea</a>-straw is useful for binding up the sheaves in harvest.\n\nThe bean crop is generally harrowed to destroy annual weeds, sometimes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> before the plants make their appearance, and sometimes after the beans have got their first green leaves, and are fairly above ground. When sown in rows, in either of the modes already mentioned, the harrows are employed about ten or twelve days after; and, being driven across the ridgelets, the land is laid completely level for the subsequent operations.\n\nAfter the beans have made some growth, sooner or later according as the soil may happen to be encumbered with or free from weeds, the horse-hoe is employed in the interval between the rows; and followed by the hand-hoe for the purpose of cutting down such weeds as the horse-hoe cannot reach; all the weeds, that grow among the beans beyond the reach of either hoe, should be pulled up with the hand. The same operations are repeated as often as the condition of the land in regard to cleanness may require.\n\nBefore the introduction of the horse-hoe, which merely stirs the soil, and cuts up the weeds, a common small plough, drawn by one horse, was used in working between the rows, and is still necessary where root weeds abound. This plough goes one bout, or up and down in each interval, turning the earth from the beans, and forming a ridgelet in the middle; then hand-hoes are immediately employed; and after some time, a second hand-hoeing succeeds to destroy any fresh growth of weeds. The same plough, with an additional mould-board, finally splits open the intermediate ridgelet, and lays up the earth to the roots of the beans on each side. The benefit of laying up the earth in this manner, however, is alleged to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTER\">counter</a>-balanced by the trouble which it occasions in harvest, when it is difficult to get the reapers to cut low enough, and may be properly dispensed with, unless the soil be very wet and level.\n\nIn an early harvest, and when the straw is not moderately <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>, the bean crop becomes ripe in good time, and is easily prepared for the stack-yard. But in moist warm seasons, the grain hardly ever ripens effectually; and it is exceeding difficult to get the straw into a proper condition for the stack. In such cases, it has been found of advantage to switch off the succulent tops with an old scythe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLADE\">blade</a> set in a wooden handle, with which one man can easily top-dress two acres a-day. This operation, it is said, will occasion the crop to be ready for reaping a fortnight earlier, and also perhaps a week sooner ready for the stack-yard after being reaped. In order to have the land prepared for a wheat crop, beans are sometimes removed from the ground, and set up to dry in another field.\n\nThe most approved mode of reaping beans is with the sickle, but they are sometimes mown, and in a few instances even pulled up by the roots. They should be cut as near the ground as possible, for the sake of the straw, which is of considerable value as fodder, and because the best pods are often placed on the stems near the roots. They are then left for a few days to wither, and afterwards bound and set up in shocks to dry, but without any head-sheaves.\n\nBeans are built in circular or oblong stacks, often in the latter form; and it is always proper, if the stack be large, to construct one or more funnels to allow a free circulation of air. They may be thrashed by the mill, and dressed by the winnowing machine like any other grain.\n\n6. Tares.\n\nThe tare, though cultivated for its stems and leaves, Tares, Va-rather than for its fruit or seeds, is so similar to the rietes, pea in its habits and mode of culture, that it seems proper to mention it in this place.\n\nThe common tare is distinguished into two sorts, the winter and spring tare. It is the opinion of an eminent botanist, that they are the same plant; (Walker's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEBRIDES\">Hebrides</a>, Vol. I. p. 228.) but though this may have been true of the tare in its natural state, there is reason to believe that a material difference now exists, superinduced perhaps by cultivation. (Annals of Agriculture, Vol. II.) The winter tare, by the experiments detailed in the work just referred to, escaped injury from frosts which destroyed the spring variety. The difference in the colour and size of the seeds is, however, so inconsiderable, as to be scarcely distinguished; but \"the winter tare vegetates with a seed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a> of a fresh green colour, whereas the spring tare comes up with a grassy spear of a brown dusky hue.\" (Dickson's Practical Agriculture, Vol. II. p. 889.)\n\nThe winter variety is sown in September and October, and the first sowing in spring ought to be as early as the season will permit. If they are to be cut green for salling throughout the summer and autumn, which is the most advantageous method of consuming them, successive sowings should follow till the end of May. The quantity of seed to an acre is from 2\u00bd to 3\u00bd bushels, according to the time of sowing, and as they are to be consumed green or left to stand for a crop.\n\nTares are in some places eaten on the ground by cattle.\ndifferent kinds of live stock, particularly by sheep; and as the winter sown variety comes very early in spring, the value of this rich food is then very considerable. The waste, however, in this way, even though the sheep be confined in hutches, must be great; and still greater when consumed by horses or cattle. But if the plants be cut green, and given to live stock either on the field, or in the fold-yards, there is, perhaps, no green crop of greater value, nor any better calculated to give a succession of herbage from May to November. The winter sown tares, in a favourable climate, is ready for cutting before clover; the first spring crop comes in after the clover must be all consumed or made into hay; and the successive spring sowings give a produce more nourishing for the larger animals than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFTERMATH\">aftermath</a> of clover, and may afford green food at least a month longer.\n\nA little rye sown with winter tares, and a few oats with the spring sort, not only serve to support the weak creeping stems of the tares, but add to the bulk of the crop by growing up through the interstices.\n\nThere is little difference in the culture of tares and of peas; they are often sown broad-cast, but sometimes in rows, with intervals to admit of hand-hoeing. The land ought to be rolled as a preparation for mowing; and they should always be cut with the scythe, rather than with a sickle, which, by tearing up a number of the plants by the roots, renders the second growth of little or no value. When cut with the scythe, even an early spring sown crop sometimes yields a weighty after-crop.\n\nIn those districts where winter sown tares are found to succeed, which is not the case in the north, the ground may be cleared in time for being sown with turnips, or dressed like a fallow for wheat to be sown in autumn.\n\n7. Potatoes.\n\nTo the observations that have been submitted on the varieties and different modes of cultivating this invaluable root, in the principal article, (No. 284), we shall only add a short account of the present most approved method.\n\nIn preparing land for potatoes, it is of much importance to free it as completely as possible from weed roots, which cannot be so well extirpated afterwards, as in the culture of turnips, and some other drilled crops, both because the horse hoe must be excluded altogether at a time when vegetation is still vigorous, and because at no period of their growth is it safe to work so near the plants, especially after they have made some progress in growth. It is the earlier time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTING\">planting</a>, and of finishing the after culture, that renders potatoes a very indifferent substitute for fallow, and in this respect, in no degree comparable to turnips. For this reason, as well as on account of the great quantity of manure required, their small value at a distance from large towns, and the great expense of transporting so bulky a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMODITY\">commodity</a>, the culture of potatoes is by no means extensive in the best managed districts. Unless in the immediate vicinity of such towns, or in very populous manufacturing counties, potatoes do not constitute a regular rotation crop, though they are raised almost everywhere to the extent required for the consumption of the farmer and his servants, and, in some cases, for occasionally feeding horses and cattle, particularly late in spring.\n\nThe first ploughing is given soon after harvest, and a second, and commonly a third, early in spring; the land is then laid up into ridgelets, from 27 to 30 inches broad, as for turnips, and manured in the same manner; and the sets are planted at from four to eight inches distant, in April, or till the middle of May, planting and the ridgelets reversed to cover them. In this state the land remains till the plants begin to rise above the surface, when it is harrowed across; and afterwards the horse-hoe, or small hoeing-plough, and the hand-hoe, are repeatedly employed in the intervals, and between the plants, as long as the progress of the crop will permit, or the state of the soil may require. The earth is then gathered once, or oftener, from the middle of the intervals towards the roots of the plants, after which any weeds that may be left must be drawn out by hand; for when the radicles have extended far in search of food, and the young roots begin to form, neither the horse nor hand hoe can be admitted without injury.\n\nPotatoes are usually taken up by the common gathering plough, but sometimes with three pronged forks; the plough goes twice along each ridgelet, in such a manner as not materially to injure any of the roots with its share or coulter, and the potatoes are gathered by women and children placed along the line, at proper distances. When the land is somewhat moist, or of a tenacious quality, the furrow-slice does not give out the roots freely, and a harrow which follows the plough is commonly employed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> it and separate them from the mould. Various contrivances have been resorted to for this purpose; a circular harrow or brake to be attached to the plough, of very recent invention, (See Plate III. Fig. 6.) has been found to answer the purpose well, and to effect a considerable saving of labour.\n\nVarious suggestions have been offered for the purpose of improving the cultivation of this root. Instead of cutting the roots to be planted into sets, some have recommended the planting of them whole, and others have thought that a great saving of the root might be made by scooping out the sets. (See Plate VIII.) Several experiments have been made to augment the produce and accelerate the ripening of potatoes, by plucking off the blossoms from the shoots or haulm. But none of these innovations have yet entered into general practice, and the trials have not been so numerous nor so satisfactory as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARRANT\">warrant</a> any conclusions of real utility.\n\nThe potatoe crop is preserved through winter, sometimes in houses, but more generally perhaps in some convenient place near the farm buildings, in winter, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CAMPS\">camps</a>, pies, or pits, covered first with straw, and then with earth dug up around the heaps, in the form of a trench, which discharges any water that might otherwise lodge about the bottoms.\n\nCurled tops are the most destructive disease to which this crop is liable; for a particular account of which, and the various modes of prevention that have been tried, see the principal Article, No. 113.\n8 Turnips.\n\nTurnips and clover are the two main pillars of the best courses of British husbandry; they have contributed more to preserve and augment the fertility of the soil for producing grain\u2014to enlarge and improve our breeds of cattle and sheep\u2014and to afford a regular supply of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUTCHER\">butcher</a>'s meat all the year, than any other crops; and they will probably be long found vastly superior, for extensive cultivation, to any of the rivals which have often been opposed to them in particular situations.\n\nTurnips cannot be advantageously cultivated on wet tenacious clays, but are grown on all comparatively dry soils, under all the variations of our climate. On dry loams, and all soils of a looser <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEXTURE\">texture</a>, managed according to the best courses of cropping, they enter into the rotation to the extent of a fourth, a sixth, or an eighth part of the land in tillage; and even on clayey soils, they are frequently cultivated, though on a smaller <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a>, to be eaten by cattle, for the purpose of augmenting and enriching the manure, into which the straw of corn is converted.\n\nAfter what has been said in the principal Article, it will be sufficient in this place to describe the practices of the best managed counties of Scotland, in regard to the culture of turnips. In this country broad-cast sowing is almost unknown, turnips being universally raised in rows at such a distance as to admit of horse-hoeing, and every step of the process is conducted with much accuracy and success.\n\nThe varieties commonly cultivated by the best farmers are the white globe, which comes early and gives a very weighty crop, but often suffers much from the frosts of winter; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a>, which is more hardy and answers well for succeeding the globe in spring; and the ruta baga or Swedish, which may be preserved for consumption till the end of May.\n\nThe drill culture of turnips was first firmly established in Scotland, by the practice of Mr William Dawson, a farmer at Frogden, in the county of Roxburgh, soon after his entry to that farm in 1759. Turnips had been sown indeed on narrow ridges, according to the practice of Tull, many years before that period; but chiefly by proprietors, upon a very small scale; and the several operations were neither so correct, so uniform, nor so much simplified as to induce general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a>. The first person who ever formed turnip ridges in Scotland with a two-horse plough without a driver, was instructed by Mr Dawson, and is yet alive.\n\nIn the drill culture of turnips, the land is ploughed with a deep furrow soon after harvest, usually in the direction of the former ridges, though, if the soil be dry, it is of little consequence in what direction. As soon as the spring seed-time is over, a second ploughing is given across the former, and the harrows and, if necessary, the rollers, are then set to work to clean and pulverize the soil. All the weed-roots that are brought to the surface are carefully gathered into heaps, and either burnt on the ground, or carried off to form a compost, usually with lime. The land is then generally ploughed a third time, again harrowed well, sometimes also rolled, and the weed-roots picked out as before. Unless land is in a much worse state, in regard to cleanness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PULVERIZATION\">pulverization</a>, than it usually is after turnips have been sometime a rotation crop, no more ploughings are necessary. It is next laid up in ridgelets from 27 to 30 inches wide, either with the common swing-plough, or one with two mould-boards, which forms two sides of a ridgelet at once. Well rotted dung, at the rate of Manuring, 12 or 15 tons per acre, is then carried to the field, and dropt from the cart in the middle one of three intervals, in such a quantity as may serve for that and the interval on each side of it. The dung is then divided equally among the three, by a person who goes before the spreaders, one of whom for each interval spreads it with a small three-pronged fork along the bottom. The plough immediately follows, and reversing the ridgelets, forms new ones over the dung; and the drill-barrow, commonly one that sows two drills at once, drawn by one horse, deposits the Sowing seed as fast as the new drills are formed. This drill machine is usually furnished with two small rollers; one that goes before the sowing apparatus, and levels the pointed tops of the ridgelets, and another that follows for the purpose of compressing the soil and covering the seed. From the time the dung is carted to the ground, until the seed is deposited, the several operations should go on simultaneously; the dung is never allowed to lie uncovered to be dried by the sun and the wind; and the new ridgelets are sown as soon as formed, that the seed may find moisture to accelerate its vegetation.\n\nThe time of sowing the several varieties is somewhat different; the Swedish should be put in the Sowing earliest, and then the yellow,\u2014both of them in the month of May. But as these kinds are much less extensively cultivated than the globe, the month of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> is the principal seed-time; and after the first week of July a full crop is not to be expected in the northern parts of the island. The quantity of seed most commonly allowed is two pounds to the acre, which though much more than sufficient to stock the ground with plants, is thought to be necessary for ensuring a regular crop on most soils. The supernumerary plants are easily taken out by the hoe, but if any parts are missed, they can be filled up only by inserting a few Swedish plants; the other varieties seldom succeed after transplantation.\n\nAs soon as the plants have put forth the rough Culture leaf, or sooner if annual weeds have got the start of while grow, them, a horse-hoe is run between the ridgelets and ing cuts up the weeds on each side, almost close to the rows of the turnip plants, clearing out the bottom of the interval at the same time. The hand-hoers are always set to work as soon as possible after, and the plants are left about nine inches distant\u2014the Swedish kind somewhat closer. If the ground has been well prepared, and the plants not allowed to get too large, three experienced hoers go over an acre a day. A few days after this, a small swing-plough, drawn by one horse, enters the interval between the rows, and, taking a furrowslice off each side, forms a smaller ridgelet in the middle. If the annuals still rise in great abundance, the horse-hoe may be employed again; otherwise the next operation is to go over\nthem a second time with the hand-hoe, when the intermediate ridgelet is levelled. Sometimes a third hoeing must be given, but that is done very expeditiously. When no more manual labour is required, a small plough with two mould-boards is employed to lay up the earth to the sides of the plants, leaving the ridgelets of the same form as when sown, which finishes the process. Large fields throughout their whole extent, dressed in this manner, are left as clean and as pleasant to the eye as the best cultivated garden. The horse and hand-hoeing in ordinary cases may cost about fifteen shillings per acre.\n\nWhere the soil is perfectly dry, and has been well prepared, the small plough has of late been laid aside by many farmers, and the space between the rows is kept clean by the horse and hand-hoe alone; but if the soil be either wet from springs, or so flat as not easily to part with surface water, it is still considered proper to earth up the roots as the concluding part of the process; and it is always useful to plough between the ridges when couch-grass and other weeds have not been completely picked out before the land was sown.\n\nThe gathering of the weeds, the spreading of the dung, and the hand-hoeing, are almost always performed by women and boys and girls.\n\nA good crop of white globe turnips usually weighs from 25 to 30 tons per acre, the yellow and Swedish commonly a few tons less. Of late there have been instances of much heavier crops, and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AYRSHIRE\">Ayrshire</a>, it would appear, that above sixty tons have been raised on an English acre, the leaves not included. (Former's Magazine, Vol. XV. and XVI.) But such an extraordinary produce must have been obtained by the application of more manure than can be provided, without injustice to other crops, from the home resources of a farm; and where turnips form a regular crop in the rotation, no such produce is to be expected under any mode of culture.\n\nTurnips are consumed either on the spot where they grow, on grass fields, in fold-yards, or in feeding-houses; the far greater part, wherever they are extensively cultivated, by sheep. The price per acre when sold depends not only upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of the crop, but also on the mode of its consumption.\n\nWhen eaten by sheep in the place of their growth, turnips are lotted off, by means of hurdles or nets, that they may be regularly consumed. When the first allowance is nearly eaten up, the bottoms or shells are picked out of the ground, by means of a two-pronged blunt hook adapted to the purpose; and then another portion of the field is taken in, by shifting the hurdles or nets, and so on regularly until the whole are finished; the cleared part of the field being usually left accessible as a drier <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a> for the sheep, and that they may pick up what shells remained when a new portion of the field was taken in.\n\nThe turnips required for other modes of consumption are usually drawn out, at regular intervals, before the sheep are put upon the field; unless the soil be so poor as to need all the benefit of their dung and treading, in which case, the whole are consumed where they grow; or so rich as to endanger the succeeding crops, by eating any part of the turnips on the ground. In the latter very rare instance, the whole crop is carried to be consumed elsewhere, as must always be done, if the soil be naturally too wet for sheep feeding.\n\nIn wet weather, when sheep ought not to be allowed to lie on the turnip field, it becomes necessary to carry the turnips to a grass field; and store sheep, not requiring to be so highly fed, frequently eat their turnips on such fields, as well as rearing cattle, and sometimes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILK\">milk</a> cows. A grass field contiguous to the turnip one is always very desirable, that the sheep, confined on other sides by hurdles or nets, may always find a dry place to lie on.\n\nIn the expenditure of turnips to young cattle, and to sheep in their first year towards spring, when the loosening and shedding of their teeth render them unable to break the hard roots, it is usual to cut or slice the turnip, either by means of a spade or chopping-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a>, or by an implement constructed for the purpose, called a turnip-slicer, formerly mentioned; or they are crushed by means of a heavy wooden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALLET\">mallet</a>.\n\nDuring severe frosts, turnips become so hard that no animal is able to bite them. The best remedy in this case is, to lay them for some time in running water, which effectually thaws them; or, in close feeding-houses, the turnips intended for next day's use may be stored up overnight, in one end of the building, and the warmth of the animals will thaw them sufficiently before <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>. But in those months when frosts are usually most severe, it is advisable to have always a few days' consumption in the turnip-barn formerly mentioned. When a severe frost continues long, or if the ground be covered deep with snow, potatoes ought to be employed as a substitute.\n\nThe advantages of eating turnips on the place of their growth by sheep, both in manuring and consolidating the ground, are sufficiently well known to every farmer. One great defect of the inferior sort of turnip soils is the want of tenacity; and it is found, that valuable crops of wheat may be obtained upon very light porous soils, after turnips so consumed.\n\nThe value or price by the acre is so various, from differences in soil and seasons, and fluctuates so much according to the degree of abundance and demand, that nothing can be decisively stated on this subject. It likewise varies according to the modes of application, as above noticed. A farmer who has turnips to sell will demand more money per acre, if they are to be drawn and consumed by the purchaser in the fold-yard, or on the pastures of the farm, than if eaten by sheep where they grow; and will require a much higher price if they are to be led away from the farm. Indeed, hardly any price will compensate for such abstraction of manure, and consequent loss of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> fertility, unless where manure can be readily purchased to supply the defalcation; and that can only be done by those who are situated near towns and large villages, where a few turnips may be sold in that way for the cows of the inhabitants. Eight guineas an acre is considered a good price, in seasons of uncommon demand, for a full crop; five guineas in ordinary years; and down to thirty and forty shil-\nlings for inferior crops. Upon an average of years, five guineas may be reckoned a fair price for a good crop, eaten by sheep where they grow. Near large towns, where turnips are in demand by cowfeeders, they will sell in ordinary years for double, and when in extraordinary demand, for three, or even four times these prices; but in these cases they are always removed from the farm, and consequently, the manure which they produce is lost to the soil.\n\nIt is not uncommon to let turnips at an agreed price, or board, for each sheep or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BEAST\">beast</a> weekly. This varies according to age and size, and the state of the demand, from fourpence or less to eightpence or more for each sheep weekly, and from two shillings to five for each beast. An acre of good turnips, say thirty tons, with straw, will fatten an ox of sixty stone, or ten <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEICESTER\">Leicester</a> sheep. Supposing the turnips worth six guineas, this may bring the weekly keep of the ox to six shillings and threepence halfpenny, and of the sheep to about sevenpence halfpenny, a-week. In this way of letting, however, disputes may arise, as the taker may not be careful to have them eaten up clean.\n\nThe person who lets the turnips has to maintain a herd for the taker; and when let for cattle, and consequently to be carried off, the taker finds a man and horse, and the latter maintains both. The taker has to provide hurdles or nets for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FENCING\">fencing</a> the allotments to sheep; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> must fence his own hedges if necessary. The period at which the taker is to consume the whole is usually fixed in the agreement, that the letter may be enabled to plough and sow his land in proper season.\n\nCommon turnips are seldom stored in any great quantity, though sometimes a portion is drawn and formed into heaps, like potatoe camps, and lightly covered with straw, or preserved for some time under a shed. On these occasions, the shaws or leaves, and the tap-roots, must be cut off and removed before storing up, to prevent heating and rotting. The heaps must not be covered with earth like potatoes, for, in this case, their complete destruction is inevitable. This root contains too much water to be preserved for any length of time in a fresh and palatable state, after being removed from the ground; and though the loss in seasons unusually severe, particularly in the white globe variety, is commonly very great, it is probable that a regular system of storing the whole, or the greater part of the crop every season, would, upon an average of years, be attended with still greater loss; besides, the labour and expense, where turnips are cultivated extensively, would be intolerable.\n\nBesides the damage sustained by a turnip crop from beetles and other insects, (see principal article), a very destructive disease, formerly confined to particular districts, has lately begun to extend itself in an alarming manner; and there is reason to fear, if some means of prevention be not soon discovered, that it may almost put an end to the cultivation of this root, in some situations where it is of essential importance, both with a view to the produce of grain, and to the rearing and fattening of live stock. In Holderness it is known by the quaint name of fingers and toes, from the shapes into which the disease distorts either the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BULB\">bulb</a> or tap-root, or frequently both. An ingenious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> on this subject was read to the Holderness Agricultural Society, in 1811, by Mr William Spence, their present President, from which we shall <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> some account of this hitherto local disease.\n\nIn some plants, the bulb itself is split into several finger-diverging lobes. More frequently the bulb is externally tolerably perfect, and the tap-root is the part principally diseased; being either wholly metamorphosed into a sort of misshapen secondary bulb, often larger than the real bulb, and closely attached to it, or having excrescences of various shapes, frequently not unlike <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> toes, (whence the name of the disease,) either springing immediately from its sides, or from the fibrous roots that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> from it. In this last case, each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIBRE\">fibre</a> often swells into several knobs, so as distantly to resemble the wire and accompanying tubers of a potatoe; and not seldom one turnip will exhibit a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of all these different forms of the disease. These distortions manifest themselves at a very early stage of the turnip's growth; and plants, scarcely in the rough leaf, will exhibit excrescences, which differ in nothing else than size from those of the full-grown root.\n\nThe leaves discover no unusual appearance, except that, in hot weather, they become flaccid and droop; from which symptom, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a> of the disease may be surmised without examining the roots. These continue to grow for some months, but without attaining any considerable size, the excrescences enlarging at the same time. If divided at this period with a knife, both the bulb and the excrescences are found to be perfectly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a>, and internally to differ little in appearance from a healthy root, except that they are of a more mealy and less compact consistence, and are interspersed with more numerous and larger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAP\">sap</a>-vessels. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, too, is more acid; and, on this account, sheep neglect the diseased plants. Towards the approach of autumn, the roots, in proportion as they are more or less diseased, become gangrenous and rot, and are either broken (as frequently happens) by high winds, or gradually dissolved by the rain. Some, which have been partially diseased, survive the winter; but of the rest, at this period, no other vestige remains than the vacant patches which they occupied at their first appearance.\n\nThis disease, according to Mr Spence, is not owing to the seed, nor to the time of sowing, nor to any quality of the soil, either original, or induced by any particular mode of cropping or of tillage; and he adds, \"That the most attentive and unbiased consideration of the facts has led him to infer that the disease, though not produced by any insect that has yet been discovered, is yet caused by some unobserved species, which, either biting the turnip in the earliest stage of its growth, or insinuating its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGG\">egg</a> into it, infuses, at the same time, into the wound a liquid, which communicates to the sap-vessels a morbid action, causing them to form the excrescences in question.\"\n\nWith regard to the prevention of this disease, marl has been recommended by Sir Joseph Banks and others; and where marl cannot be procured, it has been thought that an addition of mould of any kind,\n\nKinds of Crops.\n\nthat has not borne turnips, will be advantageous; such as a dressing taken from banks, headlands, ditches, &c. and mixed up with a good dose of lime. But lime alone has been tried in vain; and no great dependence can be placed upon fresh mould, as this disease has been known to prevail upon lands that had scarcely ever before borne a crop of turnips.\n\n(Farmer's Magazine, Vol. XIII.)\n\n9. Carrots.\n\nThis crop, it is well known, requires a deep soil, inclining to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>; and cannot, therefore, be so generally cultivated as turnips. But it has been too much neglected on lands where it would have yielded a more valuable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRODUCT\">product</a>, perhaps, than any bulbous or tap-rooted plant whatever. Several contradictory experiments in its culture have been detailed in a number of publications, from which the practical husbandman will be at a loss to draw any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEFINITE\">definite</a> conclusion. But, in a recent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> to the Board of Agriculture, from Mr Robert Burrows, an intelligent Norfolk farmer, who has cultivated carrots on a large scale, and with great success, for several years, so accurate an account is presented of the culture, application, and extraordinary value of this root, that carrots will probably soon enter more largely into the rotation of crops on suitable soils. We shall give the substance of this communication in his own words.\n\n\"As I think it the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a> of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a> to give publicity to any invention, discovery, or practice, that carries with it the appearance of being useful to society, I shall, before I proceed to a statement of each year's culture and consumption of my carrot crops, submit to the Board, for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a>, a few observations upon the general method I pursue in the cultivation of them, together with such other matter as will necessarily mingle therewith; beginning first with the quantity sown per acre, and the method of preparing the same.\n\n\"I usually sow seed of my own growth, from eight to ten pounds per acre; if purchased, the price is in general from one shilling to one shilling and sixpence per <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POUND\">pound</a>. By sowing seed of my own growing, I am enabled to speak both to the nature of its stock, and likewise its quality in regard to newness. The latter circumstance is of particular consequence in obtaining a full and healthy plant, and not always to be guarded against, if the seed is purchased of the seedsman. Having weighed the quantity of seed to be sown, and collected sand or fine mould, in the proportion of about two bushels to an acre, I mix the mixed with seed with the sand or mould, eight or ten pounds to Sand before every two bushels, and this is done about a fortnight or three weeks before the time I intend sowing; taking care to have the heaps turned over every day, sprinkling the outside of them with water each time of turning over, that every part of the sand heaps may be equally moist, and that vegetation may take place alike throughout. During this time, the land is preparing with a good dressing of manure, of about sixteen cart-loads per acre of rotten farm-yard manure, or cottagers' <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASHES\">ashes</a>; the load about as much as three able horses can draw, and, if bought, costs about four shillings and sixpence per load, besides the carting on the land. I usually sow my wheat stubbles after clover; plough the first time in autumn, and once more in the early part of the month of February, if the weather permits; setting on the manure at the time of sowing, which is about the last week in March, or sometimes as late as the second week in April; but have generally found early-sown Sowing crops the most productive. I have great advantage in preparing the seed so long before-hand; it is by this means in a state of forward vegetation, therefore lies but a short time in the ground, and, by quickly appearing above ground, is more able to contend with those numerous tribes of weeds in the soil, whose seeds are of quicker vegetation.\n\n\"Within about five or six weeks, the carrots are Hoeing ready to hoe; and, upon an average of six years, on a light sandy loam, they have cost me L1, 10s. 8d. per acre hoeing; usually performed three, and sometimes four times, or until the crop is perfectly clean; the first hoeing is with hoes four inches long, and two and a quarter inches wide. The second hoeing invariably takes place as soon as the first is completed, and is performed with six-inch hoes, by two and a quarter inches wide. By this time the plants are set; the first time of hoeing nothing was cut but the weeds. I endeavour to leave the carrots nine inches apart from each other; sometimes they will be a foot, or even farther asunder.\n\n\"No other expense now attends the crop until the time of taking them up, which is usually about the last week in October, as at that time I generally finish soil ing my horses with lucern, and now solely depend upon my carrots, with a proper allowance of hay, as winter food for my horses, until about the first week of June following, when the lucern is again ready for soil ing. By reducing this practice to a system, I have been enabled to feed ten cart horses throughout the winter months, for these last six years, without giving them any corn whatever, and have at the same time effected a considerable saving of hay, from what I found necessary to give to the same number of horses, when, according to the usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> of the country, I fed my horses with corn and hay. I give them to my cart-horses, in the proportion of 70lb. weight of carrots a horse per day, eaten by upon an average, not allowing them quite so many Horses in the very short days; and something more than that quantity in the spring months, or to the amount of what I withheld in the short winter days. The men who tend the horses, slice some of the carrots in the cut chaff or hay, and barn door refuse; the rest of the carrots they give whole to the horses at night, with a small quantity of hay in their racks; and with this food my horses generally enjoy uninterrupted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>. I mention this, as I believe some persons think that carrots only, given as food to horses, are injurious to their constitutions; but most of the prejudices of mankind have no better foundation, and are taken up at random, or inherited from their grandfathers.\n\n\"So successful have I been with carrots as a winter food for horses, that, with the assistance of lucern for soil ing in summer, I have been enabled to prove, by experiments conducted under my own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> inspection, that an able Norfolk team-horse,\nfully worked two journeys a day, winter and summer, may be kept, the entire year round; upon the produce of only one statute acre of land. I have likewise applied carrots with great profit to the feeding of hogs in winter, and by that means have made my straw into a most excellent manure, without the aid of neat cattle; the hogs so fed are sold on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORWICH\">Norwich</a> hill to the London dealers, as porkers. The profit of carrots so applied, I shall likewise shew in my subsequent statement; together with an experiment of feeding four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GALLOWAY\">Galloway</a> bullocks with carrots, against four others fed in the common way with turnips and hay.\n\n\"The taking up of the crop is put out to a man who engages women and children to assist him; the work is performed with three-pronged forks; the children cut off the tops, laying them and the roots in separate heaps, ready for the teams to take away. The expence altogether, L. 1, 1s. per acre, of not less than seven or eight hundred <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WINCHESTER\">Winchester</a> bushels. The carting away depends upon the distance of the place where carried to; if not far, the expence will be 15s. to 18s. per acre. The value of carrot tops, given to bullocks and sheep in the first winter quarter, more than repays the two last mentioned expences. I take up in autumn a sufficient quantity to have a store to last me out any considerable frost or snow that may happen in the winter months; the rest of the crop I leave in the ground, preferring them fresh out of the earth for both horses and bullocks; for the former, perhaps it would be as well to wash the roots when they are very wet and dirty, though I by no means think washing generally necessary. The carrots keep best in the ground, nor can the severest frosts do them any material injury; the first week in March, it is necessary to have the remaining part of the crop taken up, and the land cleared for barley: the carrots can either be laid in an heap with a small quantity of straw covered over them, or they may be laid into some empty outhouse or barn, in heaps of many hundred bushels, provided they are put together dry. This latter circumstance, it is indispensably necessary to attend to, for, if laid together in large heaps when wet, they will certainly sustain much injury. Such as I want to keep for the use of my horses until the Months of May and June, in drawing over the heaps, (which is necessary to be done the latter end of April, when the carrots begin to sprout at the crown very fast,) I throw aside the healthy and most perfect roots, and have their crowns cut completely off and laid by themselves; by this means, carrots may be kept the month of June out in an high state of perfection.\" (Communications to the Board of Agriculture, Vol. VII. p. 72.)\n\nMr Burrows next proceeds to state the expence of his crops for four years successively, in which he cultivated forty-nine acres in all; the average of the first three years being L. 10, 13s. 2\u00bdd. and the expence of the last year, when he had twenty-five acres, L. 8, 8s. 4d. per acre. In these sums, rent, interest of capital, and all other charges are included. He then details at some length the application of the crops, averaging upwards of 800 bushels per acre, to the feeding of cart horses, hogs, and cattle\u2014both milk cows and fattening bullocks,\u2014from which there appears to result a clear profit on the first three crops, of no less than L. 27, 18s. 3\u00bdd. per acre. The fourth crop of twenty-five acres was sold to the tenant who succeeded him in his farm, at twenty guineas per acre, the price fixed by neutral men, leaving him a profit of L. 12, 11s. 8d. per acre. Mr Burrows was so well convinced of the great advantages of this management, that he began with sixteen acres of carrots on his new farm; and we are told, that the cultivation of this root is becoming more extensive, in consequence of his successful practice.\n\nCarrots, in many instances, are sown by hand, in Cultivated rows, at narrow intervals for hand-hoeing, the seeds not in rows, being easily deposited in a regular manner by the use of the drill-machine. The hand-hoeing is certainly performed more correctly, and with much less labour, when the plants are cultivated in rows.\n\n10. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RAPE\">Rape</a>.\n\nRape is now cultivated to a considerable extent in Rape-some districts, not only for the sake of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> expressed from its seeds, but also for feeding sheep, on land not well adapted to turnips. To the account already given of the culture and uses of this plant in the body of the work, we shall add some remarks by the late Mr Culley of Northumberland, founded on his own excellent practice, in which rape was substituted for fallow on a poor clayey soil.\n\n\"Rape may be sown from the 24th of May to the Time of 8th of June; but comes to the greatest growth if sowing, &c., sown in May. If sown earlier, it is apt to run to seed. From two to three pounds of seed is required per acre, sown by a common turnip-seed drill. But as rape-seed is so much larger than turnip-seed, the drill should be wider. When hoed, the rape should be set out at the same distance as turnip plants. The drills should be from 26 to 28 or 30 inches, according to the quantity of dung given. As many ploughings, harrowings, and rollings, &c. should be given, as may be necessary to make that kind of poor soil as fine as possible, and cleared of twitch, &c.: the produce will be from twenty-five to even fifty ton per acre, or upwards. But it is not so much the value of the green crop, (although the better the green crop, the better will the wheat be,) as the great certainty of a valuable crop of wheat, that merits attention. The sheep are put on from the beginning to the middle of August; they must have the rape consumed by the middle, or at latest by the end of September, so that the wheat may be got sown, on such poor damp soils, before the autumnal rains take place. The number of sheep must depend upon the goodness or badness of the crop. But as many sheep must be employed as to eat the rape by the middle of September, or end of that month at the latest, for the reasons formerly given. The Burwell red wheat, (so called, from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VILLAGE\">village</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CAMBRIDGESHIRE\">Cambridgeshire</a>,) is always preferred. Poor clays will not allow deep ploughing, consequently, that operation must be governed by the depth of the soil. The land must be made as clean as any naked fallow. There is scarcely an instance known of a crop of wheat sown after rape, and cut off with sheep, being mildewed, and the grain is generally well perfected. Mr Culley has known a crop of wheat after rape, upon a poor moorish thin clay soil, worth much more than the fee simple of the land...\"\nClovers enter largely into the succession of crops, on all soils, and in every productive course of management. Before they were introduced into cultivation, when land was exhausted by grain crops, it was necessary to leave it in a state of comparative sterility for several years, before it was either valuable as pasture, or again fit for carrying corn. But at present, clovers are not only indispensable in the cultivation of white and green crops alternately, upon very rich soils, but are the foundation of convertible husbandry on land that is not so rich as to permit of constant aration, and which therefore requires two or more years pasturage at certain intervals. As the succession of crops forms the subject of the following section, in which we shall have occasion to notice the great value of clover, as a crop in the alternate and convertible systems of husbandry, we shall here consider it without any particular reference to its general utility in that view.\n\nRed clover. Red clover, or, as it is sometimes called, broad clover, is the kind most generally cultivated on land that carries white and green crops alternately, as it yields the largest produce for one crop of all the other sorts. White and yellow clover are seldom sown with it, unless when several years pasturage is intended. As rye-grass is almost invariably sown with clover, it will be necessary to notice it also in this place.\n\nClover and rye-grass are sown broadcast, along with, or upon growing culmiferous corn crops of every kind, and are found to prosper almost equally well with spring sown wheat, barley, and the early varieties of oats. As these seeds are most generally sown in spring, they are usually put in immediately after the land has been pulverized by harrowing in the corn seed, and are themselves covered by one course more of the harrows; or, if the corn is drilled, grass seeds are sown immediately before or after hand hoeing; and the land is then finished by a course of the harrows. A lighter harrow is generally employed in covering grass seeds, than that used for corn. When the land is under an autumn sown crop of wheat or other grain, though the clovers and rye-grass are still sown in spring, the proper period must depend both upon the state of the land, and the progress of the crops; and it may be often advisable to break the crust formed on the surface of tenacious soils, by using the harrow before the clovers are sown, as well as afterwards to cover them. Sometimes the roller only is employed at this time, and there are instances of clover and rye-grass succeeding when sown, without either harrowing or rolling. But it is commonly of advantage to the wheat crop itself, to use the harrows in spring; and the roller alone cannot be depended on, unless the season be very favourable. In some cases grass-seeds are sown by themselves, either in autumn or spring, but rarely on tillage land, the subject of the present chapter.\n\nThe quantity of red clover and rye-grass sown on an acre is exceedingly various; not only according as more or less white or yellow clover is sown along with them, as when pasturage is intended, but, even when they are the only kinds sown, the quantity is varied by the quality of the soils, and the different purposes of hay, soilings, or one year's pasture, to which the crop is to be applied. When pasture is the object, more seed ought to be allowed, than is necessary when the crop is to be cut green for soilings; and for hay, less may suffice than for either of the former. Finely pulverized soils do not require so much seed as clays, on which clover and rye-grass are very frequently sown among autumn or winter sown wheat, when there is more danger of a part of it perishing from being imperfectly covered. In general, eight or ten pounds may be taken as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINIMUM\">minimum</a> quantity, though there have been instances of good crops from less; and from that to 14 lbs or more per English statute acre. Rye-grass, commonly at the rate of a bushel per acre, but in many cases only half or two thirds of a bushel, is mixed with this weight of clover, and both are sown at the same time. The rye-grass, may be either of the perennial or annual variety, as it is understood that the herbage is to be continued for only one year; and the annual is sometimes sown in preference, as producing a bulkier crop than the perennial.\n\nIn the selection of clover and rye-grass seeds, particular attention should be paid to their quality and cleanness; the purple colour of the clover seed denotes that it has been ripe and well saved; and the seeds of weeds may be detected in it by narrow inspection, if there be any; but various noxious weeds are frequently mixed up with the seeds of the rye-grass, which it is difficult either to discover or to separate from them. Between the seeds of the annual and perennial rye-grass, the difference is hardly discernible; and therefore, unless it is of his own growth, the cultivator must depend in a great measure on the character of the person from whom he purchases it. Red clover from Holland or France, has been found to die out in the season immediately after it has been cut or pastured; while the English seed produces plants, which stand over the second, many of them the third year (General Report of Scotland, Vol. I. p. 537); thus remaining in the latter case four summers in the ground from the time of sowing.\n\nClover and rye-grass, as has been already hinted, are made into hay, cut green for being used in soilings, or depastured. As we shall have occasion to speak again of hay-making, we shall here only notice the principal operations.\n\nThis sort of herbage ought always to be cut as Hay close to the ground as possible; and the soil, having been previously cleared of any stones that might impede the scythe, and also levelled with a heavy roller, admits of mowing being performed in a very uniform and perfect manner, unless the crop be lodged or broken down by wind. What part of the stems is left by the scythe, is not only lost, but the after growth is neither so vigorous nor so weighty, as when the first cutting is taken as low as possible.\n\nClover and rye-grass are commonly all mown in Time of June; though in the North, sometimes not till near Cutting.\n\nKinds of Crops.\n\nThe end of July. The time of mowing must, indeed, be determined by the growth of the plants; but it is a common error to allow them to stand too long. They should in every case be cut down before the seeds are formed, that their juices may be as much as possible retained in the hay. When the stems become hard and sapless, by being allowed to bring their seeds towards maturity, they are of little more value, as provender, than an equal quantity of the finer sort of straw of corn.\n\nOne of the best among the various modes of hay-making, at least for clover and rye-grass, may be described in a few words. As soon as the swath is thoroughly dry above, it is gently turned over (not tedded or scattered), without breaking it. Sometimes this is done by the hand, or by a small fork; and some farmers are so anxious to prevent the swath from being broken, that they will not permit the use of the rake-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHAFT\">shaft</a>. The grass, when turned over in the morning of a dry day, is put into cocks in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFTERNOON\">afternoon</a>. The mode of performing this is very simple and expeditious; and none but women, boys, and girls, under the eye of a confidential <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a>, are usually employed. If the crop is heavy, a row of cocks is placed in the middle ridge of three, and if light, of five ridges. A distinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> of carriers and rakers is allotted to every such number of ridges; and the separate companies proceed each on its own ground, in the same manner as in reaping grain, which occasions a degree of competition among them for dispatch, clean raking, and neat well-built cocks. The carriers gather the hay, and carry it to the ridge where the cock is to be built, by one of the most experienced hands. A raker follows the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARRIER\">carrier</a>, taking up and bringing to the cocks the remains of the swath. There may be in general about five people employed about each row of cocks; a carrier and raker on each side of the ridge on which the cocks are placed, and a person on the ridge, who builds them. But when the crop is not weighty, more rakers are required, as a greater space must be gone over.\n\nAs the cocks are thus placed in a line, it is easy to put two or more into one afterwards; and the larger cocks may be speedily drawn together, to be put into tramp-ricks, by means of ropes thrown round their bottoms, and dragged along by a horse. It is impossible to lay down any rules for the management of hay after it is put into cocks; one thing is, however, always attended to, not to shake out, scatter, or expose the hay oftener than is really necessary for its preservation. Sometimes the cocks have been put up so large, that they never required to go to a tramp-rick, but were carted to the stack-yard, without ever being broken, and put up in alternate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAYERS\">layers</a> with old hay. But where this is attempted, there must not be much clover. The practice of mixing the new with the old hay, is, however, a good one, and saves a great deal of time and labour, at the same time that the old hay is much improved by the mixture.\n\nThe best managers disapprove of spreading out the swaths of clover and rye-grass, though this is often necessary with natural grasses, which are cut and harvested later in the season. The more the swath is kept unbroken, the hay is the greener, and the more fragrant.\n\nAnother mode of hay-making, said to have been originally practised in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-LANCASHIRE\">Lancashire</a>, has been found to answer well in the moist atmosphere of the west of Scotland. This is called tipping or rippling; and if the grass be dry, the operation begins as soon as it is mown. \"In making a tipple, a person, with his right hand, rolls the swath inwards, until he has a little bundle; then the same is done by the left, until both meet, and form eight to twelve pounds, or nearly so. This bundle is then set up against the legs, or between the feet; a rope is twisted off the grass, while the bundle is supported in this manner, and tied round it, near its top; and from the top are drawn up a few straggling stems which are twisted, to make the tipple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TAPER\">taper</a> to a point, and give it as much a conical shape as possible. If the crop is strong, there is a row of tipples placed on each swath; if light, two of these are put into one row. After standing a few hours, they become so smooth on the outside, that the heaviest rains seldom wet them through; and when wet, they are soon dried again in good weather. As soon as ready, they are put into the summer-rick, or, if very dry, even the winter-stack, but are never opened out, or tedded, to make them dry, as they never require it. By this method not a blade is lost, and the hay is nearly as green as a leaf dried in a book. In a moderate crop, one woman will tipple to one mower, and a woman will rake to two tipplers, or two swathers. But where the crop is strong, it may require three women to keep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PACE\">pace</a> with two mowers. After the hay is put up in this manner, the crop may be considered as secure, though it may continue wet weather for a considerable length of time.\" (General Report of Scotland, Vol. II. p. 11.)\n\nHay is commonly carried to the stack-yard, and built either in circular or oblong stacks, the latter form being most generally approved of, and carefully thatched, as has been already observed in regard to corn. It is never advisable to allow this kind of hay to become heated, in any considerable degree, in the stack, though a slight exudation, with a very gentle warmth, is usually perceptible, both in the field ricks and in the stacks, for a few days after they are built, but this is a quite different thing from that intentional heating, carried so far, in many instances, as to terminate in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONFLAGRATION\">conflagration</a>.\n\nThe weight of hay from clover and rye-grass varies, according to the soil and the season, from one per acre to three tons per English acre, as it is taken from the tramp-ricks; but after being stacked, and kept till spring, the weight is found to be diminished 25 or 30 per cent. Its price per ton depends entirely on situation; at a distance from towns or large villages, in ordinary seasons, the price is usually very low, and the whole of it is generally consumed on the farm that produced it. Its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTRINSIC\">intrinsic</a> value as fodder, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> with the straw of beans or peas, may be in the proportion of three to two; and with the finest straw of corn crops, in the proportion of two to one.\n\nMany intelligent cultivators consider rye-grass as to Kye grass.\nKinds of Crops.\n\nA very severe crop for the soil; and it is alleged, that wheat does not succeed well after the herbage with which it is intermixed in any considerable quantity. Other plants have accordingly been recommended as a substitute for rye-grass, and cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata), has been tried, apparently with great success, by Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COKE\">Coke</a>, of Holkham in Norfolk, and others. But this is a very coarse grass when allowed to rise to any height, and the use of it for hay has not yet been ascertained.\n\nWhen the hay crop is cut and removed, there is commonly a vigorous aftergrowth, which may be either cut or pastured. As this consists almost exclusively of red clover, and is extremely succulent, it is seldom made into hay, owing to the difficulty of getting it thoroughly dried at a late period of summer, when other more urgent operations usually employ all the labourers of a farm. If it be cut for this purpose, the best method of saving it is, to mix it up with straw, which will absorb a part of its juices. It is often cut green, as a part of the soiling system; or, where a sheep stock is kept, pastured by the old ewes, or other sorts, that are to be fattened the ensuing winter on turnips.\n\nOn all farms, under correct management, a part of this crop is cut green, for the working horses, often for milk cows, and, in some instances, both for growing and fattening cattle. This mode of consuming it is known by the name of soiling. There can be no doubt of the advantages of this practice, in regard to horses and cows; but for young, and for fattening beasts, a sufficient number of experiments are not known to have been yet made with any great degree of accuracy. Young animals require <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> in the open air, and, probably, will not be found to thrive so well in houses or fold-yards, during summer, as on pastures; and though in every case there is a great saving of food, the long, woody, and comparatively naked stems of the plants, with leaves always more or less withered, are perhaps not so valuable in the production of beef on fattening stock, as a much smaller weight of herbage taken in by pasturage. Milk-cows, however, are so impatient of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> and insects, that this way of feeding them, at least for a part of the day, in warm weather, ought to be more generally adopted; and the convenience of having working horses always at hand, besides that they fill their stomachs speedily, is of not less importance than economy.*\n\nIn feeding cattle with green clover, attention must be paid to prevent swelling, or haying, which is very apt to take place when they are first put on this food, especially if it be wet with rain or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DEW\">dew</a>; and cattle are exposed to this danger, whether they are sent to depasture the clover, or have it cut and brought home to them; though, if the plants be somewhat luxuriant, the danger is greater in the former case. After being accustomed to this rich food for a few days, during which it should be given rather sparingly, the danger is much diminished; but it is never safe to allow milk-cows, in particular, to eat large quantities of wet clover.\n\nWe have hitherto spoken of red clover and rye-grass, as cultivated for the sake of the stems and leaves, and shall now add a few words about the management required when the object is to save their seeds. Rye-grass seed is gathered in almost every part of Britain, but clover seed can seldom be saved in any profitable quantity in the northern parts. In Scotland, red clover is never cultivated for seed.\n\nThe common practice in regard to rye-grass is, to let the mixed crop of that and clover stand till the seeds of the former have attained a considerable degree of ripeness, when it is cut down and made into hay in the usual manner; and the seeds of the rye-grass are separated by the use of the flail, commonly before the hay is put into the field-ricks. Sometimes, when but a small quantity is wanted, the hay is merely shaken well upon a cloth, when it is building in the stack-yard; or afterwards, in the stable-loft, before it is put into the horses' racks. But in all of these methods, in order to obtain good seed, the clover must remain uncut beyond the proper season; and it is thus materially injured in quality, while the value of the rye-grass seed, in such a crop, is merely a secondary consideration.\n\nWhen seed is the principal object of the culture of rye-grass, it ought not to be mixed with clover at all, though it may be sown along with any of the kinds of corn already mentioned, and it is treated the year after in every respect as a crop of corn; bound up in sheaves, built in stacks, thrashed with the flail, and dressed by the winnowing machine, in the same manner.\n\nThe difficulty of distinguishing between the annual and perennial varieties of rye-grass has led to the practice, in some places, of cutting or pasturing the first year's crop, and taking a crop for seed in the second year. If the growth of the rye-grass plants be close and vigorous the second year, there is reason to be satisfied that the seed is of the perennial variety; and though red clover has been sown with the rye-grass, a great part of it disappears by that time, and forms but a small portion of the second year's cutting.\n\nThe seed of red clover is saved with more labour and difficulty. As the plant does not perfect its seed early in summer, it is necessary to take off the first growth, either by feeding or cutting. In the first case, it is eaten till about the end of May, frequently by ewes and lambs; and this is understood to be an advantageous practice, because the land is less exhausted, and the green food is of great value for stock in the spring months. It is not uncommon, however, to cut the first growth for a hay crop, and this should be done earlier than usual.\n\nThe growth thus reserved for seed must be suffered to remain till the husks become perfectly brown, when it is cut and harvested in the usual manner, leaving it on the field till it is very dry and crisp,\n\n* See Communications to the Board of Agriculture, Vol. VII. Brown's Treatise on Rural Affairs, Vol. II. General Report of Scotland, Vol. II. and III.\nKinds of crops may become more fully hardened; it may then be laid up dry, to be thrashed out at the farmer's convenience.\n\nMuch labour and expense are necessary in separating the seed from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPSULE\">capsule</a>, or seed-coat, especially when it is effected by thrashing, which seldom costs less than from five to six or seven shillings per bushel. By the use of mills the work may be done much cheaper.\n\nThe produce in seed may generally be from three to four or five bushels per acre, when perfectly clean, weighing from two to three hundred weight. But there is great uncertainty in the produce of clover seed, from the lateness of the season at which it becomes ripe; and the fertility of the soil is considerably impaired by such a crop. Yet the high value of the seed is a great inducement to the saving of it, in favourable situations. (Dickson's Practical Agriculture, Vol. II. p. 863.)\n\nWhen it is intended to retain the land in pasture for several years, the quantity of red clover is diminished, and several kinds of more permanent herbage are added, the most common of which are, white and yellow clover, and ribwort. No general rule can be laid down as to the proper quantity of each of these kinds; in some cases red and white clover are sown in equal proportions, and in others the latter is made greatly to predominate. The yellow clover and ribwort are not often sown at the rate of more than two or three pounds per acre. It is scarcely necessary to add, that, in this case, the rye-grass should always be of the perennial sort.\n\nWhen permanent pasture is the object, a still greater variety of seeds has been recommended. But as cultivators are by no means agreed on this point, and as the different kinds and proportions, which are thought best adapted to different soils, have none of them the sanction of extensive experience, we shall refer the reader to the third volume of Communications to the Board of Agriculture, which is wholly occupied with essays on the best means of breaking up old grass-lands, and restoring them after a few years to permanent pasture.\n\nSect. VII. Succession of Crops.\n\nThere is no branch of husbandry that requires more judgment, nor any on which the profits of the farmer more depend, than the order in which the several crops cultivated are made to succeed one another. This is a point which has been discussed at some length in the principal article (See Index, Rotation); and the most material change that has taken place since is, a more general observance of the rule, that culmiferous crops, ripening their seeds, should not be repeated, without the intervention of pulse, roots, herbage, or fallow. This rule is recognized in the practice and writings of all judicious cultivators, more generally, perhaps, than any other in the whole compass of the art of agriculture.\n\nWith regard to the particular plants that enter into the course of cropping, these, it is evident, must be such as are suited to the soil and climate, though they will be somewhat varied by local circumstances; such as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROXIMITY\">proximity</a> of towns and villages, where there is a greater demand for turnips, potatoes, hay, &c., than in thinly peopled districts. In general, beans, and clover with rye-grass, are interposed between corn crops on clayey soils, and turnips, potatoes, and clover and rye-grass, on dry loams and sands, or what are technically known by the name of turnip soils. A variety of other plants, such as peas, tares, cabbages, and carrots, occupy a part, though commonly but a small part, of that division of a farm which is allotted to green crops. This order of succession is called the system of alternate husbandry; and on rich soils, or such as have access to System abundance of putrescent manure, it is certainly the most productive of all others, both in food for man and for the inferior animals. One half of a farm is, in this course, always under some of the different species of Cereal graminea, and the other half under pulse, roots, cultivated herbage, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> fallow.\n\nBut the greater part of the arable land of Britain cannot be maintained in a fertile state under this management; and sandy soils, even though highly manured, soon become too incohesive under a course of constant tillage. It therefore becomes necessary to leave that division, or break, that carries cultivated herbage, to be pastured for two years or more, according to the degree of its consistency and fertility; and all the fields of a farm are treated thus in their turn, if they require it. This is called the system of convertible husbandry; a regular change being constantly going on from aration to pasturage, and vice versa.\n\nAnother rule with regard to the succession of crops, is not to repeat the same kind of crop at too short intervals. Whatever may be the cause\u2014whether it is to be sought for in the nature of the soil, or of the plants themselves, experience clearly proves the advantages of introducing a diversity of species into every course of cropping. When land is pastured several years before it is brought again under the plough, there may be less need for adhering steadily to this rule; but the degeneracy of wheat and other corn crops, recurring upon the same land every second year for a long period, has been very generally acknowledged. It is the same with what are called green crops; beans and peas, potatoes, turnips, and in an especial manner, red clover, become all of them much less productive, and much more liable to disease, when they come into the course, upon the same land, every second, third, or fourth year. But what the interval ought to be has not yet been determined, and probably cannot (from the great number of years that experiments must be continued to give any certain result) be determined, until the component parts of soils, and particularly the sort of vegetable nourishment which each species of plants extracts from the soil, have been more fully investigated.\n\nA change of the variety, as well as of the species, and even of the plants of the same variety, is found to be attended with advantage; and in the latter case, or a change of seed, the species and variety being the same, the practice is almost universal. It is well known, that, of two parcels of wheat, for instance, as much alike in quality as possible, the one, which had grown on a soil differing much from that on which it is to be sown, will yield a better produce than the other that grew in the same, or a similar\nSect. VIII. Manures.\n\nManures having been treated of under two different divisions of the principal article, we shall now very briefly notice the several substances most extensively employed; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTING\">pointing</a> out any change that may have occurred in their management and application; and conclude with merely mentioning the various <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol8.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of this kind that are to be procured only in small quantities, or in particular situations, and which are therefore used on a very limited scale.\n\n1. Farm-yard Dung.\n\nThis manure, composed chiefly of the straw of grain, and the excrementitious substances of live stock, is the principal, and, in most instances, the only fertilizer of the soil to which farmers have access. Its use is so universal and so well known, that a very few observations will suffice.\n\nAs straw is the basis of this compost, every judicious farmer takes care to have his crops cut as low as possible, as it is evident to every one that a few inches of straw towards the root-end adds much to the weight of the crop. From every ton of dry straw, about three tons of farm yard dung may be obtained, if the after-management be properly conducted; and, as the weight of straw per acre runs from 1 ton to 1\u00bd, about 4 tons of dung, on an average of the different crops, may be produced from the straw of every acre under corn. (Husbandry of Scotland, Vol. II.)\n\nThe straw is served out to cattle and horses in the houses and fold-yards, either as provender or litter, commonly for both purposes; and turnips in winter, and green clover in summer, on which food the animals pass a great deal of urine, afford the means of converting the straw into a richer manure than if it were eaten alone.\n\nAll the dung from the houses, as they are cleaned out, ought to be regularly spread over the yards, in which young cattle are left loose, where litter is usually allowed in great abundance; or over the dunghill itself, if there be one at hand. This renders the quality of the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> more uniform; and the horse-dung, which is of a hot nature, promotes the decomposition of the woody fibres of the straw.\n\nAt a convenient season, usually during the frosts of winter, this mass of materials is carted out to the field in which it is to be employed, and neatly built in dunghills of a square form, three or four feet high, and of such a length and breadth as circumstances may require. What is laid up in this manner early in winter, is commonly sufficiently prepared for turnips in June; but if it be not carried from the straw-yards till spring, it is necessary to turn it once or oftener, for the purpose of accelerating the decomposition of the strawy part of the mass. When dung is applied to fallows in July or August, preparatory to autumn sown wheat, a much less degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUTREFACTION\">putrefaction</a> will suffice than for turnips\u2014a clay soil, on which alone fallows should ever be resorted to, not requiring dung so much rotted as a finely pulverized turnip soil; and besides, as the wheat does not need all the benefit of the dung for some time, the woody fibre is gradually broken down in the course of the winter, and the nourishment of the plants continued till spring, or later, when its effects are most beneficial.\n\nIn the application of dung to land under tillage, particular attention should be paid to the cleanliness of the soil; and to use it at the time when, from the pulverization of the ground, it may be most intimately mixed with it. The most common time of manuring with farm-yard dung is, therefore, either towards the conclusion of the following operations, or immediately before the sowing of fallow crops. If no dung can be procured but what is made from the produce of the farm, it will seldom be possible to allow more than ten or twelve tons to every acre, when the land is managed under a regular course of white and green crops; and it is thought more advantageous to repeat this dose at short intervals, than to give a larger quantity at once, and at a more distant period in proportion. (General Report of Scotland, Vol. II. p. 517.)\n\nFarm-yard dung, it is well known, is greatly reduced in value by being exposed to the atmosphere in small heaps, previous to being spread, and still more after being spread. Its rich juices are exhaled by the sun, or washed away by the rains, and the residuum is comparatively worthless. This is in an especial manner the case with long fresh dung, the far greater part of which consists of wet straw in an entire state. All careful farmers, accordingly, spread, and cover in their dung with the plough, as soon as possible after it is brought on the land.\n\nIt has been urged by a celebrated chemist, that farm-yard dung ought not to be allowed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERMENT\">ferment</a> in any considerable degree, as during a violent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERMENTATION\">fermentation</a>, a large quantity not only of fluid, but likewise of gaseous matter is lost, which, if retained by the moisture in the soil, would be capable of becoming an useful nourishment to plants. He therefore recommends that it should be applied after a slight incipient fermentation, which he admits to be useful in bringing on a disposition in the woody fibre to decay and dissolve; and this is always, he adds, in great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a> in the refuse of a farm. (Davy's Agricultural Chemistry, p. 302. 8vo.)\n\nFrom a recent publication (Husbandry of Scotland, Vol. I. p. 174.), the practice of the best farmers to its users of turnip soils in Scotland appears to be decidedly adverse to the use of fresh dung; and its utility, or rather injurious effects, from its opening the soil too much, is a matter of experience with every one who cultivates drilled turnips on a large scale. As the whole farm-yard dung, on such land, is applied to the turnip crop, it must necessarily happen that it should be laid on in different stages of putrefaction; and what is made very late in spring,\noften after a very slight fermentation, or none at all.\n\nThe experience of the effects of recent dung is accordingly very general, and the result, in almost every case is, that the growth of the young plants is slow,\u2014that they remain long in a feeble and doubtful state,\u2014and that they seldom, in ordinary seasons, become a full crop, even though twice the quantity that is given of short muck has been allowed.\n\nOn the other hand, when the manure is considerably decomposed, the effects are immediate, the plants rise vigorously, and soon put forth their rough leaf; after which, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BEETLE\">beetle</a> or fly does not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> on them; and, in a few weeks, the leaves become so large, that the plants probably draw the greatest part of their nourishment from the atmosphere.\n\nThough it were true, therefore, that more nutritive matter were given out by a certain quantity of dung, applied in a recent state, and allowed to decompose gradually in the soil, than if applied after undergoing fermentation and putrefaction, the objection, arising from the slowness of its operation, would, in many instances, be an insuperable one with farmers.\n\nBut there seems reason to doubt whether fresh strawy manure would ferment much in the soil, after being spread out in so small a quantity as has been already mentioned; and also, whether, in the warm dry weather of summer, the shallow covering of earth given by the plough, would not permit the gaseous matters to escape, to a much greater amount than if fermentation had been completed in a well built covered dunghill.\n\nAnother great objection to the use of fresh farm yard dung is, that the seeds and roots of those plants with which it commonly abounds, spring up luxuriantly on the land; and this evil, nothing but a considerable degree of fermentation can obviate. The mass of materials consists of the straw of various crops, some of the grains of which, after all the care that can be taken, will adhere to the straw,\u2014of the dung of different animals voided, as is often the case with horses fed on oats, with the grain in an entire state,\u2014and of the roots, stems and seeds of the weeds that had grown among the straw, clover and hay, and such as had been brought to the houses and fold-yards with the turnips and other roots given to live stock.\n\nNo rule of universal application can be laid down on this subject; the degree of decomposition to which farm-yard dung should arrive, before it can be deemed a profitable manure, must depend on the texture of the soil, the nature of the plants, and the time of its application. In general, clayey soils, more tenacious of moisture, and more benefited by being rendered incohesive and porous, may receive manure less decomposed than well pulverized turnip soils require. Some plants, too, seem to thrive better with fresh dung than others,\u2014potatoes in particular; but all the small-seeded plants, such as turnips, clover, carrots, &c. which are extremely tender in the early stage of their growth, require to be pushed forward into luxuriant vegetation with the least possible delay, by means of short dung. The season when manure is applied, is also a material circumstance. In spring and summer, whether it be used for corn or green corps, the object is to produce an immediate effect, and it should therefore be more completely decomposed than may be necessary, when it is laid on in autumn for a crop whose condition will be almost stationary for several months.\n\n2. Lime.\n\nNext to farm-yard dung, lime is in most general use as a manure, though it is one of a quite different character; and when judiciously applied, and the land laid to pasture, or cultivated for white and green crops alternately, with an adequate allowance of putrescent manure, its effects are much more lasting, and, in many instances, still more beneficial than those of farm-yard dung. Fossil manures \"must produce their effect, either by becoming a constituent part of the plant, or by acting upon its more essential food, so as to render it more fitted for the purposes of vegetable life.\" (Davy's Agricultural Chemistry, p. 314.) It is, perhaps, in the former of these ways, that wheat and some other plants are brought to perfection after lime has been applied, upon land that would not bring them to maturity by the most liberal use of dung alone.\n\n\"The most common form in which lime is found on the surface of the earth, is in a state of combination with carbonic acid or fixed air. If a piece of limestone or chalk be thrown into a fluid acid, there will be an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EFFERVESCENCE\">effervescence</a>. This is owing to the escape of the carbonic acid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAS\">gas</a>. The lime becomes dissolved in the liquor. When limestone is strongly heated, the carbonic acid gas is expelled, and then nothing remains but the pure alkaline earth; in this case, there is a loss of weight; and if the fire has been very high, it approaches to one-half the weight of the stone, but, in common cases, limestones, if well dried before <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a>, do not lose much more Loss of than from 35 to 40 per cent., or from seven to eight weight by parts out of twenty. When burned lime becomes burning mild, it regains its power of effervescing, and is the same chemical substance as chalk or limestone.\n\n\"When newly burnt lime is exposed to air, it soon falls into powder; in this case it is called slackened lime, and the same effect is immediately produced by throwing water upon it, when it heats Lime violently, and the water disappears. Slackened lime is merely a combination of lime with about one-third of its weight of water, that is, 55 parts of lime absorb 17 parts of water.\n\n\"When lime, whether freshly burned or slackened, is mixed with any moist fibrous vegetable matter, there is a strong action between the lime and the Operation vegetable matter, and they form a kind of compost of Lime. together, of which a part is usually soluble in water. By this kind of operation, lime renders matter which was before comparatively inert nutritive; and as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CHARCOAL\">charcoal</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OXYGEN\">oxygen</a> abound in all vegetable matters, it becomes at the same time converted into carbonate of lime.\n\n\"Mild lime, powdered limestone, marls, or chalks, have no action of this kind upon vegetable matter; by their action they prevent the too rapid decomposition of substances already dissolved, but they have no tendency to form soluble matters.\n\n\"It is obvious, from these circumstances, that the\noperation of quicklime; and marl or chalk, depends upon principles altogether different. Quicklime, in being applied to land, tends to bring any hard vegetable matter that it contains, into a state of more rapid decomposition and solution, so as to render it a proper food for plants. Chalk and marl, or carbonate of lime, will only improve the texture of the soil, or its relation to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSORPTION\">absorption</a>; it acts merely as one of its earthy ingredients. Quicklime, when it becomes mild, operates in the same manner as chalk; but, in the act of becoming mild, it prepares soluble out of insoluble matter.\n\n\"The solution of the question, whether quicklime ought to be applied to a soil, depends upon the quantity of inert vegetable matters that it contains. The solution of the question, whether marl, mild lime, or powdered limestone, ought to be applied, depends upon the quantity of calcareous matter already in the soil. All soils are improved by mild lime, and ultimately by quicklime, which do not effervesce with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a>, and sands more than clays.\" (Davy's Agricultural Chemistry, p. 315, et seq.)\n\nFrom the mode in which lime operates, it necessarily follows that quicklime should not be applied to lands that contain much soluble matter, nor be mixed up in composts with animal manures.\n\n\"It had been long known to farmers in the neighbourhood of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DONCASTER\">Doncaster</a>, that lime made from a certain limestone, applied to the land, often injured the crops considerably. Mr Tennant, in making a series of experiments upon this peculiar calcareous substance, found that it contained <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNESIA\">magnesia</a>; and on mixing some calcined magnesia with soil, in which he sowed different seeds, he found that they either died or vegetated in a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> manner, and the plants were never healthy. And with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> and ingenuity, he referred the bad effects of the peculiar limestone to the magnesian earth it contains.\" (Id. p. 322.) Yet it is advantageously employed in small quantities, seldom more than 25 or 30 bushels to the acre. A simple test of magnesia in the limestone, is the circumstance of its effervescing little when plunged into an acid, and its rendering diluted nitric acid or aquafortis milky. Stones of this kind are usually coloured brown or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> yellow, and are found in several counties of England, and in many parts of Ireland, particularly near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELFAST\">Belfast</a>.\n\nWith regard to the quantity of lime that ought to be applied to different soils, it is much to be regretted that Sir Humphry Davy has not thought proper to enter fully into the subject. Clays, it is well known, require a larger quantity than sands or dry loams. It has been applied, accordingly, in almost every quantity from 100 to 500 bushels or upwards, per acre. About 160 bushels are generally considered a full dressing for lighter soils, and 80 or 100 bushels more for heavy cohesive soils.\n\nIn the application of lime to arable land, there are some general rules commonly attended to by diligent farmers, which we shall give nearly in the words of a recent publication.\n\n1. As the effects of lime greatly depend on its intimate admixture with the surface soil, it is essential to have it in a powdery state at the time it is applied.\n\n2. Lime having a tendency to sink in the soil, it should be ploughed in with a shallow furrow.\n\n3. Lime may either be applied to grass land, or to land in preparation for green crops or summer fallow, with almost equal advantage; but, in general, the latter mode of application is to be preferred.\n\n4. Lime ought not to be applied a second time to moorish soils, unless mixed up as a compost, after which the land should be immediately laid down to grass.\n\n5. Upon fresh land, the effect of lime is much superior to that of dung. The ground, likewise, more especially where it is of a strong nature, is more easily wrought; in some instances, it is said, \"the saving of labour would be sufficient to induce a farmer to lime his land, were no greater benefit derived from the application than the opportunity thereby gained of working it in a more perfect manner.\" (General Report of Scotland, Vol. II. p. 596.)\n\nIn improving hilly land, with a view to pasture, a much smaller quantity of lime has been found to produce permanent and highly beneficial effects, proving when kept as much as possible near the surface, by being merely harrowed in with the seeds, after a fallow or green crop, instead of being buried by the plough. As this is a matter of much importance to farmers of such land, especially when lime must be brought from a great distance, as was the case in the instance to which we are about to allude, the successful practice of one of the most eminent farmers in Britain cannot be too generally known.\n\n\"A few years after 1754,\" says Mr Dawson, \"having a considerable extent of outfield land in fallow, which I wished to lime previous to its being laid down to pasture, and finding that I could not obtain a sufficient quantity of lime for the whole in proper time, I was induced, from observing the effects of fine loam upon the surface of similar soil, even when covered with bent, to try a small quantity of lime on the surface of this fallow, instead of a larger quantity ploughed down in the usual manner. Accordingly, in the autumn, about twenty acres of it were well harrowed, and then about fifty-six Winchester bushels only, of unsacked lime, were, after being slacked, carefully spread upon each English acre, and immediately well harrowed in. As many pieces of the lime, which had not been fully slacked at first, were gradually reduced to powder by the dews and moisture of the earth,\u2014to mix these with the soil, the land was again well harrowed in three or four day thereafter. This land was sown in the spring with oats, with white and red clover and ryegrass seeds, and well harrowed, without being ploughed again. The crop of oats was good; the plants of grass sufficiently numerous and healthy; and they formed a very fine pasture, which continued good until ploughed some years after, for corn.\n\n\"About twelve years afterwards, I took a lease of the hilly farm of Grubbet; many parts of which, though of an earthy mould tolerably deep, were too steep and elevated to be kept in tillage. As these lands had been much exhausted by cropping, and were\nfull of couch-grass, to destroy that, and procure a cover of fine grass; I followed them, and laid on the same quantity of lime per acre,\u2014then harrowed, and sowed oats and grass-seeds in the spring; exactly as in the last mentioned experiment. The oats were a full crop, and the plants of grass abundant. Several of these fields have been now above thirty years in pasture, and are still producing white-clover and other fine grasses; no bent or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FOG\">fog</a> has yet appeared upon them. It deserves particular notice, that more than treble the quantity of lime was laid upon fields adjoining, of a similar soil, but which being fitter for occasional tillage, upon them the lime was ploughed in. These fields were also sown with oats and grass-seeds. The latter threw well, and gave a fine pasture the first year; but afterwards the bent spread so fast, that, in three years, there was more of it than of the finer grasses.\"\n\nThe conclusions which Mr Dawson draws from his extensive practice in the use of lime and dung, deserve the attention of all cultivators of similar land.\n\n1. That animal dung dropt upon coarse, benty pastures, produces little or no improvement upon them; and that, even when sheep or cattle are confined to a small space, as in the case of folding, their dung ceases to produce any beneficial effect, after a few years, whether the land is continued in pasture, or brought under the plough.\n\n2. That even when land of this description is well fallowed and dunged, but not limed, though the dung augments the produce of the subsequent crop of grain, and of grass also for two or three years, that thereafter its effects are no longer discernible either upon the one or the other.\n\n3. That when this land is limed, if the lime is kept upon the surface of the soil, or well mixed with it, and then laid down to pasture, the finer grasses continue in possession of the soil, even in elevated and exposed situations, for a great many years, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCLUSION\">exclusion</a> of bent and fog. In the case of Grub-bet-hills, it was observed, that more than thirty years have now elapsed. Besides this, the dung of the animals pastured upon such land adds every year to the luxuriance, and improves the quality of the pasture; and augments the productive powers of the soil when afterwards ploughed for grain; thus producing, upon a benty outfield soil, effects similar to what are experienced when rich infield lands have been long in pasture, and which are thereby more and more enriched.\n\n4. That when a large quantity of lime is laid on such land, and ploughed down deep, the same effects will not be produced, whether in respect to the permanent fineness of the pasture, its gradual amelioration by the dung of the animals depastured on it, or its fertility when afterwards in tillage. On the contrary, unless the surface is fully mixed with lime, the coarse grasses will in a few years regain possession of the soil, and the dung thereafter deposited by cattle will not enrich the land for subsequent tillage.\n\nLastly, It also appears from what has been stated, that the four-shift husbandry is only proper for very rich land, or in situations where there is a full command of dung: That by far the greatest part of the land of this country, requires to be continued in grass two, three, four, or more years, according to its natural poverty: That the objection made to this, viz., that the coarse grasses in a few years usurp possession of the soil, must be owing to the surface soil not being sufficiently mixed with lime, the lime having been covered too deep by the plough.\" (Farmer's Magazine, Vol. XIII. p. 69.)\n\nLimestones differ much in purity, or in the quantity of calcareous matter which they contain. According to Mr Headrick (Farmer's Magazine, Vol. V. matter in p. 451.), it is usually from 60 to 85 per cent.; but he afterwards analyzed some limestones from the county of Fife, which contained 99\u00bd per cent. of carbonate of lime, the residuum being fine clay. Farmers generally estimate the purity of limestones, by the quantity of slackened lime produced from a given quantity of burnt limestone, or shells as it is usually called, the pulverized lime of the best shells being three times the measure of the shells. But it is easy to ascertain the quantity of calcareous matter in the stone itself, by the use of muriatic acid; that stone being the best which leaves the least sediment, the lime itself dissolving in the acid.\n\n3. Marls.\n\nMarl, which was more extensively employed as a manure in former times than it has been of late, since the properties of lime have been better understood, is usually divided into stone, clay, and shell marl, of which the last is the most valuable. All marls contain a portion of calcareous matter, and their operation is not materially different from that of mild lime, as has been formerly noticed; but the greater quantity required, owing to the smaller proportion of calcareous matter which they contain, confines the use of them to a few miles around the places where they are found. The effects of marl are slower than those of quicklime, but, from the earthy substances combined with the calcareous matter, and the larger quantity usually applied, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAPLE\">staple</a> of the soil is deepened, and the benefit is considered more durable.\n\n4. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">Sea</a>-Weed.\n\nThis is an excellent manure though not lasting in its effects, suited to all soils and crops, with the exception perhaps of clovers of the first year's growth. It should be applied fresh as it is gathered, if the land be ready to receive it, otherwise it may be mixed up with fresh dung, or used as a top-dressing to grass lands.\n\n5. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BONES\">Bones</a> and Horns.\n\nBones are a source of manure too little attended to in most places, though their value is well ascertained by a pretty extensive experience of their effects in several districts. The following particulars were transmitted from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-YORKSHIRE\">Yorkshire</a>, in answer to some queries proposed by the writer of this article.\n\n1. It is thought that all the bones of every animal are not equally valuable; but all the bones of an animal suitable for manure are equally good; and are much better when fresh.\n\n2. The bones which are best filled with oil and marrow are certainly the best manure; and the\nparts generally used for buttons and knife-hafts are the thigh and shank-bones.\n\n3. The powdered bones are dearer, and generally used for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOT_BEDS\">hot-beds</a> in gardens, being too expensive for the field, and not so durable a manure as bruised bones, though for a short time more productive.\n\n4. A dry, light or gentle soil, is best adapted for the use of bone manure, as it is supposed that, in land which retains wet, the nutritive part of the bone washes to the surface of it, and does not incorporate sufficiently with the soil.\n\n5. The autumn is the most proper time for the use of this manure, which should then be laid on fallows for a turnip crop. The powder only should be used on a green crop, as the bruised bones would interrupt the progress of the scythe.\n\n6. The effects produced on different crops are generally good on such soil as named in No. 4.\n\n7. Bruised bones are better when mixed with ashes or any other manure, as the juice of the bones is then more equally spread over the field.\n\n8. Bone manure ought to be ploughed into the land in tillage. On grass, the powder should be sown in by the hand.\n\n9. This manure is used on land before described, to the extent of several thousand acres, in the higher parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-NOTTINGHAMSHIRE\">Nottinghamshire</a>, and the wolds (or high land) in Lincolnshire, and the East and West Riding of Yorkshire.\n\n10. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIMARY\">primary</a> object of keeping a bone-mill is the bruising of bones, which pays better than selecting and selling such as are suitable for buttons, &c.\n\n11. In an agricultural district, where the generality of the land is of the nature before mentioned as best suited for bone manure, a mill for the purpose of bruising bones would certainly indemnify the proprietors. The cost of a mill is from L.100 to L.200.\n\nAs to the number of miles the manure may be carried, the proprietors of the mill will be best able to judge of that.\" See Plate VIII.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HORN\">Horn</a>, says Sir H. Davy, is a still more powerful manure than bone, as it contains a larger quantity of decomposable animal matter. The shavings or turnings of bone, though they cannot be procured in great abundance, are much esteemed as a manure, and have been long known to the farmers in the west of Scotland, who sometimes bring them from Ireland. They are sown by the hand as a top-dressing for wheat and other crops.\n\n6. Burnt Clay.\n\nThis is a mode of preparation which has been recently introduced into the west of Scotland from Ireland, by Mr Craig at Cally, in the Stewartry of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-KIRKCUDBRIGHT\">Kirkcudbright</a>. It has been tried with great success; and if it should succeed generally, it will form a new era in the practice of agriculture, and contribute essentially, to the general improvement of the country. The want of manure has been always <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> as a great obstruction to the cultivation of waste lands, and it has been thought that the limited quantity to be had is more profitably applied to the land at present under or tilly sub-tillage than to new land. But if burnt clay, or tilly subsoil, have the effect of producing full crops of turnips, from the consumption of which enriching manures may be always procured, there are few situations in which an almost unlimited supply of it may not be got, at a very small expense. We cannot do better than give the substance of Mr Craig's letter to Mr Boyd of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MERTON\">Merton</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HALL\">Hall</a>, in the contiguous county of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WIGTON\">Wigton</a>, on this highly interesting subject. It is dated 23rd January 1815.\n\nBeing perfectly convinced, both from ocular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a>, and personal experience, of the infinite utility of clay ashes, as a manure for every kind of crop, as well as a top-dressing for grass lands, I am extremely anxious that the use of them should become universal. I shall, therefore, have much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> in communicating to you every information on the subject, and I have now sat down to accomplish that object, as far as lies in my power.\n\nHaving had occasion, for some years past, to go repeatedly to Ireland, on the business of Mr Murray's estate there, I was struck with the mode adopted, in some parts of that country, of burning clay, and making use of the ashes, in preference to lime, of which there is such abundance. The method also adopted of causing the clay, just as it is dug out of the ground, without the assistance of any combustible, except merely to set it on fire, and without preparation of any sort, to burn of itself, arrested my attention; and having witnessed the crops of wheat and corn of every description, as well as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAX\">flax</a> and potatoes, luxuriant almost beyond <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIBILITY\">credibility</a>, produced from stiff clay soils, without the aid of any other manure than ashes so obtained, I determined to make the experiment at home. On my return, I accordingly commenced operations, and have practised the burning of subsoil for three years with the greatest success. I felt considerable difficulty at first for want of clay; but I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol11.html#article-HIT\">hit</a> upon a vein or bed of tenacious subsoil, partly tily, and partly clay, which answers the purpose quite well, though I do not apprehend it is so good as clay. The ashes I have hitherto used to applied solely to the production of turnips; but within the last ten days, I have laid nearly five hundred cart-loads on grass lands as a top-dressing. My turnip crops from ashes have exceeded anything of the kind in this neighbourhood. I was twice in London in the course of last summer and harvest, and in my way to and from town, I saw no turnips equal to my crop, though I passed through Berwickshire and Northumberland.\n\nLast season, by way of experiment, I manured part of my turnip field with the best stable dung, which was ploughed in the same day it was led out of the yard; the remainder with ashes. The seed, which was of the yellow field sort, was sown on the same day. That sown on the ashes sprung much earlier than that on the dung, continued more vigorous during the season; and when I pulled them lately, the turnips produced from the ashes were more than double the size of those from the dung. I regret that I did not weigh the produce of each; but I have marked off a square <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a> of Swedish, which I mean to weigh, to ascertain the produce per acre. Excepting myself, no person has hitherto practised the burning of subsoil in this country, till last season, when I prevailed on Mr John Wallace, tenant of Mr Murray's farm of Clauchan, in Tongland <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a>, to\ntry the experiment. In consequence of some misunderstanding that had arisen between Mr Wallace and the former tenant, the latter, contrary to the usual practice, declined to sell to Mr Wallace the outgoing crop, and carried the whole off to the immediate adjoining farm, which he rented. Mr Wallace was thereby put to considerable inconvenience, having scarcely any fodder for his stock, and being thus deprived of the means of raising dung for his green crop. In his distress he applied to me, and I engaged for him a person to burn clay. Though it was the beginning of May before the burning commenced, yet Mr Wallace obtained as many ashes as manured twenty acres. Notwithstanding the turnips were later of being sown than usual, and were too long in being hoed, Mr Wallace obtained for them the second <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREMIUM\">premium</a> for green crop from the Agricultural Society in the stewartry; and since that time the Highland Society have awarded to him their first premium. He laid on, at first, about forty-five single cart-loads to the acre; and diminished the quantity to thirty. I laid on, however, a much larger quantity; but I should imagine, that from forty to fifty cart-loads per acre would be a fair dose for our light soils. You, who have experienced the beneficial effects of ashes obtained by paring and burning the surface, can easily appreciate the value of ashes obtained from burning subsoil, and conceive the facility which they afford to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of the green crop system, to a breadth not hitherto contemplated. I may, however, mention, that this year, by means of ashes, I was enabled to raise three times the quantity of green crop that I had of white crop, and shall thus have it in my power to feed my cattle on turnip for more than six months, affording them, night and morning, as much as they are able to eat. Though my farm is, no doubt, of small extent, still this shows what may be done on a larger scale, where greater facilities can be obtained.\n\nThough I do not apprehend that any written account I can give you will afford half so satisfactory an idea of the method of burning clay, as ocular inspection of the work, yet I shall give you the best description I can.\n\nThe general method of proceeding to work, is to make an oblong inclosure, of the dimensions of a small house, (say 15 feet by 10,) of green turf sods, raised to the height of 3\u00bd or 4 feet. In the inside of this inclosure, air-pipes are drawn diagonally, which communicate with holes left at each corner of the exterior wall. These pipes are formed of sods put on edge, and are so wide only as another sod can easily cover. In each of the four spaces left between the air-pipes and the outer wall, a fire is kindled with wood and dry turf, and then the whole of the inside of the inclosure, or kiln, is filled with dry turf, which is very soon on fire; and on the top of that, when well kindled, is thrown the clay, in small quantities at a time, and repeated as often as necessary, which must be regulated by the intensity of the burning. The air-pipes are of use only at first, because, if the fire burns with tolerable keenness, the sods forming the pipes will soon be reduced to ashes. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIPE\">pipe</a> on the weather-side of the kiln only is left open, the mouths of the other three being stopped up, and not opened unless the wind should veer about. As the inside of the inclosure, or kiln, begins to be filled up with clay, the outer wall must be raised in height, always taking care to have it at least eighteen inches higher than the top of the clay, for the purpose of keeping the wind from acting on the fire. When the fire burns through the outer wall, which it often does, particularly when the top is overloaded with clay, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREACH\">breach</a> must be stopped up immediately, which can only be effectually done by building another sod-wall from the foundation, opposite to it, the sods that formed that part of the wall being soon reduced to ashes. The wall may be raised as high as is convenient for throwing on the clay, and the kiln may be increased to any size, by forming a new wall when the previous one is burnt through. I have had kilns so wide, that a horse and cart might have turned in them; but, when they are so broad, it requires the workmen to walk on the top of them while laying on the clay, which I would not recommend, because, the more loosely the clay can be laid on, the more rapidly will it burn. I did not take all the trouble above stated with my kilns; having the advantage of a quantity of old moss-sticks, and tree-roots, which I split, I kindled a large parcel of them, and surrounded the fire with a quantity of dry turf, and, as soon as it was well kindled, I built round it a strong wall of sods, and went on adding to the fire, and sods to the outer walls, when necessary, till the kilns were so large as to contain upwards of one hundred loads of ashes.\n\nThe principal secret in burning consists in having the outer walls made quite close and impervious to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> air, and taking care to have the top always lightly, but completely, covered with clay; because, if the external air should come in contact with the fire, either on the top of the kiln or through its sides, the fire will be very soon extinguished, or at least much weakened. In short, the kilns require to be attended nearly as closely as charcoal pits. Clay is much easier burnt than either moss or loam, as the latter, by crumbling down, are very apt to smother the fire, unless carefully attended to. No rule can well be laid down for regulating the size of the lumps thrown on the kiln, as that must depend on the state of the fire; but, on opening the heaps, I have always found all the lumps completely reduced to ashes, and some of them were thrown on larger than my head. Clay, no doubt, burns more readily if it be dug up and dried for a day or two before it be thrown on the kiln; but this operation is not necessary, as it will burn though thrown on quite wet. When put on too wet, however, the fire, if burning very intensely, is apt to reduce it to a cake-like substance, and thus to render it unfit for manure. After a kiln is fairly set a-going, no coal or wood, or any sort of combustible, is necessary, the wet clay burning of itself; and it can only be extinguished by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTENTION\">intention</a>, or the carelessness of the operator; the vicissitudes of the weather having hardly any effect on the fire, if properly attended to. It may, perhaps, be necessary to mention, that, when the kiln is burning with great keenness, a stranger to the operation may be apt to think that the fire is extinguished; if, however, any person, either through impatience, or\n\nManures too great a curiosity, should insist on examining the interior of the kiln, he will certainly retard, and may possibly extinguish, the fire; for, as I mentioned before, the chief secret consists in keeping out the external air from acting immediately on the fire. (Farmer's Magazine, Vol. XVI.)\n\n7. Miscellaneous Articles.\n\nMoss and dung.\n\nIn the article Agriculture, in the body of the work, there is an account of the compost of moss and farm-yard dung, introduced into notice by Lord Meadowbank; and we have only farther to add in regard to it, that we have found it, in the course of our own experience, to be a most valuable manure. We shall now mention some of those numerous vegetable, animal and other substances, which, though not in general use as manures, are sometimes employed for that purpose, in particular situations.\n\nOf the substances of vegetable or animal origin occasionally or locally applied in this way, the number is very great. All green succulent plants add to the fertility of soils, when ploughed in; and it is by no means uncommon to cultivate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUCK\">buck</a>-wheat and other plants expressly for this purpose. Thistles, docks, and other noxious weeds, which at any rate should be always cut down before forming their seeds, may be advantageously used as manure, and are sometimes mixed with farm-yard dung when laid out to ferment, in the manner already described. Rape cake is an excellent dressing for turnips, and is most economically applied when thrown into the soil at the same time with the seed. By covering dead animals with five or six times their bulk of soil, mixed with one part of lime, and suffering them to remain for a few months, their decomposition impregnates the soil with soluble matters, so as to render the mass an excellent manure; and by mixing a little fresh quicklime with it, at the time of its removal, the disagreeable effluvia may be in a great measure destroyed. Fish are well known to be a powerful manure, though the quantity should be limited. A full crop of turnips has been got from spoilt herrings, laid on before the winter ploughing, at the rate of twenty-five barrels to an acre. Blubber has been used with great success by Lord Somerville, mixed with clay, sand, or any common soil, so as to expose a large surface to the air, but it has been found injurious in some instances, probably owing to its being applied too largely, as has happened in the case of fish, or from not having been combined with a sufficient quantity of soil. The refuse of the different manufactures of skin and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a> affords very useful manures,\u2014such as the shavings of the currier, furriers' clippings, and the offals of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TAN\">tan</a>-yard and of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLUE\">glue</a> maker. The value of urine is well known. According to Sir H. Davy, it should be used as fresh as possible, but not without being diluted with water.\n\nNight soil is a most powerful manure. The disagreeable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a> may be destroyed by mixing it with quicklime. The Chinese mix it with one third of its weight of fat marl, make it into cakes, which are said to be a common article of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>, and dry it by exposure to the sun. Next to this, in its fertilizing powers, is pigeons' dung, commonly used in a dry Pigee's state as a top-dressing, at the rate of about twenty bushels to an acre.\n\nManures of a mineral or fossil origin are also numerous. Limestone gravel, which abounds in Ireland, gravel, &c., chalk, pounded limestone, sea-shells, and shelly sand, are all employed, some of them to a considerable extent, in much the same manner as lime; but their effect, though durable, is not so immediate. Gypsum, Gypsum or sulphate of lime, is found in several parts of England, but its value as a manure does not appear to be yet clearly determined. It does not seem to operate by accelerating putrefaction; but it is supposed that lands which have ceased to bear good crops of clover or cultivated grasses, may be restored by being manured with gypsum, as it is found in considerable quantities in their ashes. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SOOT\">Soot</a> is known to be an useful top-dressing, either by itself, or when mixed with earth and lime, in the proportion of one part soot, five parts earth, and one part lime, but its effects are not lasting. Common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> is sometimes an useful manure. Sleech or sea ooze, containing animal and vegetable substances, with a large proportion of calcareous matter, affords a valuable dressing, increasing the staple of the soil to which it is applied, as well as its fertility. Pond and river mud, mixed with lime, has been often applied with good effect. Even coal-sill or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCHISTUS\">schistus</a>, has been used with much advantage by Mr Curwen and others, after being decomposed with lime, in the proportion of one part of the latter to six of the former.\n\nThe great quantity of valuable manure obtained from large towns, is a mixture of almost all these ingredients; and what was formerly a nuisance is now a source of revenue to the inhabitants, and of fertility to the country around them.\n\nIn several districts, land is manured on the surface, by cattle and sheep confined in temporary folds. See the Chapter on Live Stock, where the benefits of this practice will be inquired into. Its expediency is a question that cannot be determined without a reference to its effects on the animals themselves, as well as to the value of the manure.\n\nCHAP. II.","sp":338,"ep":374},{"h":"AGRICULTURE","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">General</a> Observations.\n\nBut this resource of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> proprietors was effectual only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> soils of an inferior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>; on good arable land, the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> by which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the produce could reach them in the shape of rent was, to enlarge their farms. The old occupiers were too numerous to spare any considerable part of the produce, and generally too indolent and unskilful to make any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> exertions to augment it. In these circumstances, the landholder must either have virtually abandoned his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> reduced the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of its inhabitants, who were no longer permitted by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a> to make him that return which had been the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> condition of their tenures. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> of the towns was now gradually increasing, and it was necessary, for the supply of their wants, as much as for the benefit of the landholders, that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> disposable produce should be obtained from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of enlarging farms was, therefore, in every view, indispensable. Even such of the tenants themselves, as it was necessary to displace, might have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> but a slight and temporary inconvenience, had the change been gradual. Some of them would have found employment in towns, and others as hired labourers and artisans in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. The dismission of the small tenants seems, however, to have been the occasion of much misery; for, in the sixteenth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, manufactures and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> had made comparatively little progress in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>. In the present times, any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> to which the private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> of landholders could operate in this manner, would, in a national point of view, be too inconsiderable to deserve notice.\n\nIt is in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> that farms have been enlarged. The most skilful and industrious of these small tenants were naturally preferred, and their possessions afterwards enlarged as their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> increased. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> everywhere has been, a better <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of cultivation, affording a higher rent to the land proprietor, and a greater supply of land produce for the general consumption.\n\nBut it is only for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, and to a very limited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, that the enlargement of farms can proceed. The interest of the landlord, which gave the first impulse, is ever vigilant to check its progress, when it is attempted to carry the measure beyond due bounds. It is in this that the security of the public consists, if it were ever possible that the public interest should be endangered by the enlargement of farms. Accordingly, in most of our counties, a few tenants, of superior knowledge and capital, have been seen to hold considerable tracts of land, which, after a few years, were divided into a number of separate farms. The practice of these men is a lesson to their neighbours; and their success never fails to bring forward, at the expiration of their leases, a number of competitors. Whenever skill and capital come to be generally diffused, there can be few instances of very large farms, if a fair competition be permitted. No <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a>, whatever may be his fortune and abilities, can then pay so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> a rent for several farms, each of them of such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> as to give full room for the use of machinery, and other economical arrangements, as can be got from separate tenants. The impossibility of exercising that vigilant superintendence, which is so indispensable in agricultural concerns, cannot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> be compensated by any advantages which a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">farmer</a> may possess. His operations cannot be brought together to one spot, like those of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANUFACTURER\">manufacturer</a>; the materials on which he works are seldom in the same state for a few days,\u2014and his instruments, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANIMATED\">animated</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a>, are exposed to a great many accidents, which his judgment and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> must be called forth instantly to repair.\n\nIt has been said, indeed, that a great farmer may pay a higher rent, because he saves the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> expenses of a number of small tenants. But from what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUND\">fund</a> do these tenants maintain their families? It ought to be either from the profits of their capital, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol21.html#article-WAGES\">wages</a> of their labour, or from both combined, and certainly not from the landlord's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> share, in the shape of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABATEMENT\">abatement</a> of rent. If they cannot pay so high a rent, it must be because their capital and labour are less productive to the public than those of the large farmer. Such men might, in most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, be employed with more advantage, even to themselves, in some other profession.\n\nThe various other reasons assigned for the great enlargement of farms, are equally nugatory. There is generally no saving to the landlord in buildings and fences; and a very small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of rent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> pay for the trouble of keeping accounts, and settling with twenty tenants instead of one. The fact certainly is, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a>, if not the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a>, why farms have been enlarged, is, the higher rent paid by their occupiers. To pay this rent, they must bring to market more produce; and this they are enabled to do, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a> of their crops and tied live stock to suitable soils and pastures; by an economical arrangement and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> succession of labour throughout the year; by the use of machinery; and, still more than all, perhaps, by the investment of capital in those permanent improvements, which augment both the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> and value of their products. Rent, in fact, is an almost unerring measure of the amount of the free produce; and there is no better criterion for determining whether a tract of country be laid out in farms of a proper size, than the amount of the rent paid to its proprietors. Their interest is, in this instance, completely identified with that of the great body of the people.\n\nIf we examine the various sizes of farms, in those districts where the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> freedom exists, and the best management prevails, we shall find them determined, with few exceptions, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">Nature</a> superintendence which they require. Hence pastoral farms are the largest; next, such as are composed both of grazing and tillage lands; then, such rich soils as carry cultivated crops every year; and, finally, the farms near large towns, where the grower of corn gradually gives way to the market-gardener, cultivating his little spot by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANUAL\">manual</a> labour. The hills of the south of Scotland are distributed into farms of the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a>; the counties of Berwick and Roxburgh into those of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>; and the smaller farms of the Lothians and of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARSE\">Carse</a> of Gowrie,\nwhere there seems to be no want of capital for the management of large farms, are a sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the general principle which determines the size of farms.\n\nIt must readily appear from these remarks, in what manner the enlargement of farms, or rather the absence of all restraint upon the transactions of the landholder and farmer, has promoted the improvement of our agriculture. To confine the practice of this important art to the manual labour of men in a state of poverty and dependence, would be no less injudicious, and much more ruinous in a national point of view, than to destroy all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> inventions for saving labour in our manufactures. The effects of capital and machinery are the same in both departments. But no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>, and in circumstances much above the condition of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> labourer, would ever engage in farming, if his concerns could be no farther extended than to fifty or one hundred acres held at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACK\">rack</a>-rent; and on such farms, there is no room for the most economical machinery,\u2014for convertible husbandry, by which land is preserved in its highest fertility,\u2014or, indeed, for any of those arrangements, which approach in their effects to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of labour in other arts.\n\nBesides those general causes of the improvement of the agriculture of Britain, arising from the division of landed property\u2014the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> of a distinct class of professional farmers, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> are secured by leases, and whose exertions are stimulated by a rent settled by competition\u2014and the opportunities held out for the investment of capital as far as it promises to be profitable,\u2014there are several others of a more limited or temporary nature, but which it is only necessarily barely to mention. The most important of these is the extent of the British market, which, for many years, has required more corn than was grown in the country. The gradual rise of price, which was the necessary consequence of this, and still more the enormous prices of several late years, in which foreign supplies were obtained with difficulty or altogether withheld, have contributed in no small degree to the improvement of our own ample resources. This has been further promoted by the facility and expedition with which commodities of every kind are transported by means of canals, roads, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RAILWAYS\">railways</a>. And the liberal accommodations afforded by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BANKING\">banking</a> establishments, have enabled British farmers to operate upon extensive wastes, of which the improvement must be advantageous to the public, even though, should these temporary aids be withdrawn, it may not be profitable to themselves.\n\nThe progress of a correct system of agriculture, has been far more rapid in Scotland than in England; the effects, at least, have been more conspicuous. Not only the rents paid in Scotland, but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> produce per <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACRE\">acre</a>, and still more the disposable produce, seem to be greater than in England, wherever the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> is made with land of a similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, and with an allowance for the difference in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> and markets. This remark naturally leads us to advert to some circumstances, which seem materially to impede the agricultural improvement of the country, particularly the southern half of it; and with one or two observations on this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> we shall conclude this article.\n\nThe low state of agriculture in many parts of Britain, with the great advance in the price of corn within the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> twenty years, on the one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, and the abundance of capital, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> in the manufactures and commerce of the country, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as in the immense sums <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENT\">lent</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, on the other, are circumstances sufficient to convince every reflecting mind, that there is no want either of means or of inducements to the improvement of our territory. It is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a>, indeed, to travel through the country in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>, without feeling a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVICTION\">conviction</a> that there must be some serious obstacles to the investment of capital in agriculture. The circumstances which seem to have the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> in determining men of capital to engage in any particular profession, are the security and productiveness of that capital, the power of transferring it, and the degree of estimation in which the profession is held by the public. To the absence of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> requisites we must ascribe the backward state of this art, notwithstanding all the other motives, both of a public and private nature, which have long existed for its advancement.\n\nTo the class of drawbacks upon agriculture, and impediments to its improvement, belong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITHES\">tithes</a>,\u2014<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATES\">rates</a>,\u2014payments in the shape of fines, and services exacted by the lords of manors,\u2014enfeoffments,\u2014tenancy at will, or on very short leases,\u2014unfair restrictions on the tenant as to the disposal of his lease, and as to the management of the lands during its currency,\u2014the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAME\">game</a> laws,\u2014and the complicated regulations under which commons and common fields are cultivated, and the great expense required to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> them in a state of severity.\n\nIt appears, that nearly three fourths of the lands of Tithes, England and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a>, are exposed to claims which wrest from the husbandman one-tenth of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> produce of his labour and capital, and this, whether the remainder of the produce be or be not sufficient for his remuneration. Though no rent were paid for poor soils, this burden alone would effectually prohibit their correct cultivation; and even in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of rich soils, tithes diminish the rent so considerably, as to make it the interest of landlords, in many parts of England, to restrain their tenants from converting grass lands into tillage; that is, from placing them under the most productive management for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a>, both in regard to the supply of food and of employment.\n\nTo the enlightened inquirer it must appear abundantly clear, that all plans for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> and improvement of British agriculture must prove ineffectual, so long as these capital obstacles are left untouched; and that their removal is all that need be done, and all that ought to be done by a wise government, for securing an abundant supply of the first necessaries of life.

He seems to have taken the sole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of his son's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>; and having destined him for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">Bar</a>, he took uncommon pains to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> him in every branch of knowledge which could contribute to his success in that profession. His care was rewarded with the happiest success. Young D'Aguesseau gave early indications of uncommon abilities; and such was his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THIRST\">thirst</a> for knowledge, and his habits of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a>, that he soon acquired the reputation of an almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> scholar. He had a particular relish for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a>, which he used to say, \"was the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YOUTH\">youth</a>;\" but this passion was so far from withdrawing him from severer studies, that it was allied in his mind with a nearly equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol1.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a>. He studied <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a> with the zeal of an antiquary, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>; and, in order to form his taste as a pleader, he employed a whole year in repeated perusals of the most esteemed productions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> eloquence. After this thorough course of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a>, he became an advocate in 1690; and, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> of his father, who now resided in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, he was soon furnished with opportunities of distinguishing himself, and of rising to the highest honours of the profession. When little more than twenty-one years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, he was appointed one of the three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol1.html#article-ADVOCATES\">Advocates</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a>\u2014an office which imposed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a> of assisting in those causes where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> the public were concerned. The king, (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> XIV.) in appointing him, yet untried, to this D'Aguesseau situation, acted solely upon the recommendation of the elder D'Aguesseau, \"who was incapable,\" said Louis, \"of deceiving him, even to advance his own son.\" D'Aguesseau's first appearances as an advocate-general were such as amply to fulfil the expectations of his father, and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARRANT\">warrant</a> the appointment which he had obtained from the king. Denis Talon, an old lawyer, who had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> officiated, with great reputation, in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a>, was heard to say, \"that he should have been glad to have finished his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CAREER\">career</a> as that young man had begun.\"\n\nD'Aguesseau held this office for ten years; during which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> he greatly distinguished himself, both for learning in his profession, and for a superior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a> of forensic eloquence. He was, indeed, one of the first reformers of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of the French bar, which had not yet taken much polish from the national improvements in taste and literature. His diction, both in his pleadings and in his juridical compositions, was that of a mind expanded by a liberal course of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a>, and refined by a familiar acquaintance with classical models. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> which he chiefly frequented was also <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> adapted to improve his taste; for the chosen companions of his leisure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a> were Racine and Boileau; the latter of whom has frequently mentioned him with praise in his writings.\n\nIt was D'Aguesseau's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that no one could rise to distinguished <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMINENCE\">eminence</a> as an orator, who did not labour to enlarge and polish his mind by the study of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, and by exercises of literature; and he accordingly employed several of those stated discourses, which the usages of France required from the advocates-general at the opening of the sessions,\nto impress this doctrine upon the minds of the younger members of the bar. Such, in particular, was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of his discourse, pronounced in 1695, *Sur l'<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNION\">Union</a> de la Philosophie et de l'Eloquence*. The same subject is treated at greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>, and in a more systematic and preceptive manner, in a treatise, written at a later period, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of *Instructions sur l'Etude et les Exercices qui peuvent preparer aux Fonctions d'Avocat du Roi*. These pieces (*\u0152uvres*, Tom. I.) are written in a clear, manly, and harmonious style, and are well worthy the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of the general scholar, for their critical strictures on those authors whom he recommends to the students of law.\n\nIn the year 1700 he was appointed *Procureur-general*\u2014an office of higher <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>, and imposing more various and extensive duties, than that of advocate-general. He filled this office for seventeen years with the most splendid reputation; adding, by his lenity in criminal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, and by his care of the public hospitals, the praise of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a> to his other claims to the admiration of his countrymen. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> philosopher of the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> probably, however, be inclined to question the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTNESS\">justness</a> of the encomiums bestowed upon his exertions during the severe scarcity of 1709; on which occasion, he appears to have instituted the most rigorous proceedings against those who were held up as enemies of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> and of mankind, under the names of forestallers and monopolists. But, in alluding to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his conduct, it may be proper to mention, that his opposition, at an after period, to the delusive projects of the famous John Law, and his elaborate treatise upon the subject of *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">Money</a>*, (*\u0152uvres*, Tom. X.) afford undeniable proofs of the soundness of his views, in regard to some of the most important principles of political economy.\n\nIt had been early predicted of D'Aguiseau, that he would one day fill the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of Chancellor; and this prediction was at length realized in 1717, upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Voisin, who then held the seals. Though he was yet little more than forty-eight years of age, his nomination to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> dignity gave general satisfaction; and was, indeed, intended as a popular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">Duke</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORLEANS\">Orleans</a>, who had lately assumed the regency. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> Valjouan, a man of abilities, but slothful and a humorist, was the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> who spoke with indifference on the occasion. \"Rather you than I, brother,\" was his only remark when the new Chancellor hastened to him to announce his appointment. In fact, D'Aguiseau was soon made to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> the storms attendant upon this lofty station; for he had not been installed above a year, when he was deprived of the seals, and exiled to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESTATE\">estate</a>. His steady opposition to the extravagant projects of Law, with which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGENT\">regent</a> and his ministers were wholly intoxicated, was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> cause of this first reverse of his fortune. In 1720, when the ruinous consequences of these schemes had filled the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> with distress and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALARM\">alarm</a>, the chancellor was recalled from banishment; and he contributed not a little, by the firmness and sagacity of his counsels, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CALM\">calm</a> the public murmurs, and repair the mischief which had been committed.\n\nLaw himself had acted as the messenger of his recall; and it is said, that D'Aguiseau's consent to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RE\">re</a>-accept the seals from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> of this adventurer, was much blamed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LITERARY\">literary</a> corps, with which he had hitherto stood in high favour, as well as by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a>. But his reputation appears to have sustained a much severer shock, when he endeavoured to prevail with the latter body, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGISTER\">register</a> the declaration of the late king in favour of the famous bull *Unigenitus*\u2014a measure which they held in great abhorrence, and which he had himself firmly opposed during the life of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEWIS\">Lewis</a>. The regent's favourite Dubois, then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">Archbishop</a> of Cambrai, had moved his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> to insist upon this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of registration, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">hope</a> that he might thereby obtain for himself a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARDINAL\">Cardinal</a>'s hat; and it seems to have been thought, that the Chancellor had yielded his better opinion in compliance with the wishes of this worthless minion. Be this as it may, it is certain that he opposed the favourite with firmness, when he attempted, after being made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIME\">prime</a> minister, to take <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRECEDENCE\">precedence</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a>; and he was in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, in 1722, sent a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> time into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol8.html#article-EXILE\">exile</a>.\n\nHe now passed five years on his estate at Fresnes; and he always spoke with delight of this tranquil period, when he was left free from the cares of professional duty, and the distractions of public life, to cultivate his mind. The Scriptures, which he read and compared in various languages, and the laws of his own and other countries, formed the subjects of his more serious studies; the rest of his time was devoted to philosophy and literature, and the improvement of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-PARK\">park</a>, where he was sometimes to be seen employed with a spade.\n\nFrom these noble and congenial occupations he was again recalled, by the advice of Cardinal Fleury, in 1727; but the seals were not restored to him till ten years thereafter. During the intervening period, he had endeavoured to mediate in the new disputes which had arisen between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">court</a> and the parliament; but his interference seems to have given satisfaction to neither <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PARTY\">party</a>; the one reproaching him with desertion from their cause, and the other with too great a leaning towards it. When the seals were at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> restored to him, he completely withdrew from all affairs of state, and devoted himself entirely to his duties as Chancellor, and to the introduction of those reforms which had long occupied his inquiries and meditations.\n\nBesides some important enactments regarding Testaments, Successions, and Donations, he introduced various regulations for improving the forms of procedure,\u2014for ascertaining the limits of Jurisdictions,\u2014and for effecting a greater uniformity in the execution of the laws throughout the several provinces. These reforms constitute a sort of epoch in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-JURISPRUDENCE\">jurisprudence</a> of France, and have associated his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> with those illustrious benefactors of her Civil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CODE\">Code</a>,\u2014L'Hopital and Lamoignon. The Duke de Saint-Simon however, alleges, that the Chancellor's reforms did not go so far as they would have gone, had he had less affection for his own order. He once, says this writer, confessed to a nobleman who spoke to him upon the propriety of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> off certain lucrative abuses, that he could not bring his mind to a step which would so grievously diminish the profits of the law.\nIn 1750, when upwards of eighty-two years of age, he besought the king to accept his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol16.html#article-RESIGNATION\">resignation</a>; and he was accordingly permitted to retire, the king continuing to him the honours of his office as a special mark of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROBATION\">approbation</a>. He died in the following year; and was interred, according to his own request, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BURIAL\">burial</a>-place of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VILLAGE\">village</a> of Auteuil, where the remains of his wife, who died there in 1735, had been deposited. The name of this lady, whom he married in 1694, and by whom he had several children, was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANNE\">Anne</a> Le Fevre d'Ormesson.\n\nThis great man has not, in all respects, been equally praised by those, who have, in their writings, transmitted his character to posterity. Saint-Simon and others reproach him with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of tardiness and indecision in his judgments, which sometimes greatly obstructed the course of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>. His own answer to this charge has been recorded by Duclos, and is worthy of notice: \"When I recollect,\" said he, \"that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECREE\">decree</a> of a Chancellor is a law, I think myself warranted in taking a long time for consideration.\" Saint-Simon and D'Argenson also impute to him some defects as a statesman; but his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELEVATION\">elevation</a> of mind and extensive knowledge, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a>, probity, and disinterestedness, have been universally admitted and extolled. In his magisterial capacity, he was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a> and dignified, without any approach to haughtiness; in private society, his manners were mild, equal, and even playful. He was particularly remarkable for the tenaciousness of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>, and for the facility with which he could <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> his attention to the most diversified exercises of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTELLECT\">intellect</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>. At eighty years of age, he has been heard to repeat whole poems, which he had never perused since the days of his early youth; and when fatigued with professional duties, he could turn with equal alacrity to Euclid or to Racine. In summing up his character, all must agree with La Harpe, that he was \"a man who did <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> to France, to the magistracy, and to letters, by his virtues, his talents, his profound and various learning, and his enlightened views in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> of jurisprudence.\" (Cours de Litterature, Tom. XIV. c. 1.)\n\nHis published writings form a collection of thirteen volumes quarto; of which the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> was published at Paris in 1759, and the last in 1789. The far greater part of these volumes relate to matters connected with his professional character and studies; but they also contain a variety of pieces upon miscellaneous subjects. We have already mentioned his discourses on the studies befitting the students of law, and his treatise on Money; and besides these, and some theological pieces, there is a Life of his Father, interesting from the view which it affords of his own early education under that excellent person; together with \"Metaphysical Meditations,\" written in vindication of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, that, independently of all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVELATION\">revelation</a>, and all positive law, there is that in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> mind which renders man a law to himself.\n\nSee Histoire des Hommes Illustres de Regnes de Louis XIV. et de Louis XV. par le Duc de Saint-Simon. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> Secreces, par Duclos.

The divisions chiefly recognized are those formed by the varieties of the native tribes. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJOR\">Major</a> Leake, who is allowed to be the best informed traveller <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, divides them into the Ngeze, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Ghegides, whose principal towns are Dulcigno, Scutari, and Durazzo; the Toske, or Toskides, who occupy Berat and Elbasan; the Liapce, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> and predatory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>, who inhabit the mountains between the Toske and Delvino; and the Tsami, who inhabit the most southerly district, and whose principal towns are Suli and Paramithia. There are, besides, a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of smaller divisions, too tedious to enumerate. (Leake's Researches in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>.)\n\nAlbania nearly coincides with the country known to the ancients, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of Epirus. This country was then, as now, distinguished by the rude valour of its inhabitants. Its remote situation, and the want of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNION\">union</a> among its tribes, generally prevented it from acting any conspicuous part in Grecian politics. The only remarkable exception occurs in the reign of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYRRHUS\">Pyrrhus</a> II., who was justly ranked with the greatest captains of antiquity. After his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, the country was again split into a number of petty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, which were unable to resist the united strength of Macedon; and to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>, Epirus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> subject, till both were alike subdued by the Roman arms.\n\nIt was during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of the Greek empire, that the name of Albania was first given to this district. During the decline of the empire, the Albanians gradually rose to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a>, and at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> to independence. Their valour enabled them to maintain their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> against the Bulgarians, who had occupied all the neighbouring districts of Greece. Nor were they less successful against the Turks, a more formidable enemy. Under the command of the celebrated George Castriot, commonly called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCANDERBEG\">Scanderbeg</a>, they baffled all the efforts of Mahomet II., the conqueror of Constantinople. That powerful monarch entered Albania only to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> a succession of defeats, and was at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> compelled to acknowledge its independence by a formal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a>. On the death\nof Scanderbeg, the Turks redoubled their efforts against Albania, which was at length reduced to a state of nominal subjection. The siege of Scutari, in 1478, formed the termination of this memorable struggle. The subjection, however, was always <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a>; revolts were frequent, and the inhabitants of the mountainous districts still preserved their independence. It was by the motives of pay and plunder, rather than by compulsion, that these hardy soldiers were allured into the Turkish ranks. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> as the Ottoman empire declined in vigour, its hold of Albania became less and less firm; and the vigorous and enterprising <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALI\">Ali</a> Pasha, has now again converted this dependency into what may almost be called a separate kingdom.\n\nAli was born at Tepellene, a small town in the interior of Albania. His father held the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of a Pasha of two tails, but was not possessed of any extensive power; and he died when Ali was only fifteen. In a district so turbulent, and filled with warlike and hostile leaders, the young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> was necessarily placed in a very critical situation. He is himself accustomed to boast, that he began his fortune with sixty paras and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSKET\">musket</a>; and an Albanian who attended a late traveller (Mr Hobhouse) declared, that he remembered to have seen Ali with his jacket out at elbows. Ali was ere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> driven from Tepellene, his native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, and was abandoned by almost every follower. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> was next formed for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a>, by the inhabitants of Gardiki, a neighbouring town; and for this purpose, they surrounded, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a> time, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VILLAGE\">village</a> where he had taken refuge. Ali escaped through a garden, but his mother and sister fell into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of the Gardikiotes, and were treated with every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of indignity; wrongs for which he afterwards took a dreadful vengeance. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> enabled him gradually to repair his fortunes. He insinuated himself into the favour of Coul Pasha, then the principal chief of Albania, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> he at length married. Having thus been enabled to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLECT\">collect</a> some followers, he succeeded in surprising his present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a>, Joannina, and in prevailing upon the Porte to recognize him as Pacha of that important district. From this time, he took the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> among the Albanian chiefs; employing sometimes force, sometimes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, and sometimes treachery, to increase his authority, and add to the extent of his dominions.\n\nThe most formidable adversaries with whom Ali had to contend, were the Suliotes, a people placed in the southern extremity of Albania. They inhabit an almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INACCESSIBLE\">inaccessible</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANGE\">range</a> of mountains, beneath whose gloomy shade winds a river, which Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a> conjectures, on very plausible grounds, to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACHERON\">Acheron</a> of the ancients. (Travels in the Ionian Isles and Albania.) The strength of their native bulwarks, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, and contempt of death, made them the terror of Albania, which they frequently invaded; while no foreign power had ever ventured to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a> the tremendous barriers by which they were guarded. Ali at length succeeded, partly by force, and partly by bribery, in gaining the passes which led into their country; and the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, after a furious resistance, was reduced to subjection, and partly extirpated.\n\nIn 1811 and 1812, Ali attacked and defeated the Pashas of Berat and Delvino; by which means he gained possession of some of the finest parts of Albania, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> of between 200,000 and 300,000 souls. Tepellene, his native place, now fell into his power; and now also it was, that he obtained the means of inflicting signal vengeance on Gardiki. With his accustomed duplicity, he pretended a complete oblivion of all grounds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESENTMENT\">resentment</a>, until he had surrounded and enclosed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> with his troops; when upwards of 700 of those of the inhabitants who were supposed to have been most deeply involved in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> guilt, were dragged into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> khan near the city, and bound together with cords. On a signal given by Ali, the Albanian soldiery, who were stationed on the walls of the khan, began a discharge of musketry, which continued until the destruction of the whole 700 was completed.\n\nIt seems <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to define with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> precision, either the extent of Ali's dominions, or the degree of authority which he possesses. Even within Albania, the Pachalic of Scutari remains still independent. The tract over which he bears sway, is bounded on the north by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> line, extending from Durazzo to the Gulf of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SALONICA\">Salonica</a>. It comprehends the mountainous district of Macedonia, nearly the whole of Thessaly, and great part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIVADIA\">Livadia</a>. On the eastern side, he is kept in check by Ismael <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEY\">Bey</a>, who possesses an authority nearly as independent over the plains of Macedonia. In Albania, his power is almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a>; and while little regard is paid to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERIAL\">imperial</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIRMAN\">firman</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIGNATURE\">signature</a> of Ali commands implicit obedience. The Albanians are enthusiastically attached to him; they view him as a native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOVEREIGN\">sovereign</a>; they admire the energy of his character, and when they hear of any other chief, commonly remark, that \"he has not a head like Ali.\"\n\nIn the relations between Ali and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of Constantinople, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> fear has hitherto preserved an outward good understanding. The progress of this enterprising chief has been long viewed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JEALOUSY\">jealousy</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALARM\">alarm</a>; but the Porte was never in a condition to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAZARD\">hazard</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRIVING\">driving</a> him into open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REBELLION\">rebellion</a>. It has been found prudent, therefore, to invest him, by its firman, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of those provinces which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a> had already placed in his possession. Ali, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, pays an outward deference to the Porte; and remits to it some portion of the revenue which he collects. He has also uniformly supported that power with nearly his whole force, against the foreign enemies with which it has had to contend. He even marched against Paswan Oglou, and was present at the siege of Widdin; and his son Mouctar Pasha, distinguished himself greatly in the late war against the Russians. In all other respects, whether as to the internal government of Albania, or its foreign relations, he acts completely as an independent monarch. The Porte has omitted no means of inducing him to repair to Constantinople, and has even proffered to him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> Vizier; but Ali has uniformly resisted every such invitation, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> knowing that his arrival at that capital would be the immediate signal for striking off his head. Buonaparte is also\nbelieved to have courted his favour, and to have offered him the dignity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">King</a> of Albania; but the Pasha always viewed the ambitious designs of that conqueror with alarm, and attached himself to England; with the politics and interests of which country, it appears from his conversations with Dr Holland, he was tolerably well acquainted.\n\nThe natives estimate Ali's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> force so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> as fifty, sixty, or even 100,000 men. This could only apply to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> levy en masse, in the event of invasion. It does not appear that Ali has ever brought into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a> a greater disposable force than 15,000. His standing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> is supposed to be about 10,000, of whom 4,000 or 5,000 are stationed round his capital Joannina. The amount of his revenues is still more uncertain. They arise from the following sources: 1. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> tax, amounting generally to about 10 per cent of the produce. 2. A tax on cities and towns, levied in the form of requisition. 3. The customs, which he has raised to six per cent. 4. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INHERITANCE\">inheritance</a> of all who die without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> heirs. There are several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINOR\">minor</a> sources; and besides his public revenue, Ali is supposed to possess private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> to the amount of 4,000,000 piastres, or L. 200,000 per annum. It seems impossible to conjecture, either what may be the amount of his entire revenue, or what proportion he remits to Constantinople; but it is generally believed, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURE\">treasure</a> which he has accumulated is very considerable.\n\nAli is now (1815) sixty or sixty-one years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>; his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> is corpulent and unwieldy, his neck short, his stature about five feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> inches. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> of his countenance is striking and majestic; and his features give no indications of those terrible qualities by which he is characterized. His abilities are certainly of no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> order. He displays that union of deep thought and contrivance, with prompt and decisive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, which indicates a mind equally formed for politics and for war. He is remarkable for his address, both in gaining friends, and in lulling asleep the suspicions of his bitterest enemies. But, if his abilities are of a superior order, his dispositions are of a kind which render him an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of fear and detestation. His cruelty rather resembles that of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a>, than of even the least civilized European. Impaling, and roasting alive, are among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> punishments reserved for those who have unhappily offended him. The fierceness of his cruelty is only exceeded by the depth of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISSIMULATION\">dissimulation</a>. It is impossible for the most skilful observer to conjecture, from his outward deportment, the real sentiments with which he regards any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a>. The only observable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a>, consists in a peculiar kindness of manner, towards those unfortunates, whose cruel doom he has silently and unrelentingly sealed.\n\nAli's ordinary residence is near Joannina, in an immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>, which combines the characters of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> and a fortress. The outer courts are irregularly crowded with Albanian soldiers, and with persons of all descriptions, who attend upon, or have petitions to present to him. Each petitioner, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a>, kneels and kisses his garment. He exercises in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> the whole judicial authority; and his decisions, though necessarily given too promptly, are however said to be guided by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> wish of arriving at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, and of doing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>. It may be supposed that this employment, joined to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to every other part of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMINISTRATION\">administration</a>, must fully occupy his time. Accordingly, he rises at six in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, and with the exception of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DINNER\">dinner</a>, and an hour at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUPPER\">supper</a>, spends the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> in business. His habits at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> are extremely temperate, though he is not so strict a Musulman as to decline the use of wine. His haram contains three hundred females of various descriptions. It forms an edifice entirely distinct from the rest of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERAGLIO\">seraglio</a>, and is said to be furnished in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a> of the most gorgeous magnificence; but no European has hitherto found admission into it.\n\nAlthough the government of Ali is completely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESPOTICAL\">despotical</a>, yet, viewed comparatively, it appears to be better for Albania, than the terrible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANARCHY\">anarchy</a> to which it was formerly exposed. He has freed that country from a race of petty tyrants, and from perpetual scenes of internal warfare. His vigorous administration has nearly extirpated those numerous predatory hordes, who found shelter in the mountainous districts, and spread terror and desolation over the plains.\n\nThe inhabitants of Albania are estimated at twelve hundred thousand; those of Ali's whole dominions at two millions. Albania contains a considerable proportion of Turks and Greeks; but the basis of the population, and that in which Ali places his chief confidence, consists of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> race. This remarkable people differ completely from every other included within the limits of the Turkish empire. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVERSION\">conversion</a> to Mahometan tenets has been very imperfect, and chiefly induced by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> motives. In every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> the males usually go to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOSQUE\">mosque</a>, the females to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>; and some members of a family are seen in the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMICABLE\">amicable</a> manner eating from the same table, and even from the same plate, meats forbidden to the others. With the Turks, accordingly, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFIDEL\">infidel</a> and Albanian are terms nearly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYNONYMOUS\">synonymous</a>. Ali himself, does not appear to make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> a ground of any the slightest distinction between the different classes of his subjects.\n\nThe native Albanian is of a middle stature; his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a> is oval, with high cheek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BONES\">bones</a>; his neck long, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEST\">chest</a> full and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a> is erect and majestic, to a degree which never fails to surprise the traveller. He holds in utter contempt that dissimulation which is characteristic of the Greek, and piques himself upon giving utterance to every sentiment without the smallest reserve. Equally remote from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a> and sluggish deportment of the Turk, he is gay, lively, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a>. Averse, however, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> industry, his whole delight is in arms and plunder. He goes constantly armed; and there are few Albanians who, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIME\">prime</a> of their life, have not belonged to some of the numerous bands of robbers, who infest the mountains of their native country, of Thessaly, and of Macedonia. This profession carries with it no disgrace; it is common for the Albanian to mention circumstances which occurred, \"when he was a robber.\" In proportion as the trade of robbing becomes overstocked, part of those engaged in it seek employment in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SULTAN\">Sultan</a>, and of the different Pashas throughout the Turkish empire; by\nall of whom the Albanians are regarded as the most valuable of their troops.\n\nAn Albanian military force, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of Dr Holland, cannot so properly be called an army, as a tumultuous assemblage of armed men. There is no regular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a> into corps; nor is much regard paid to the authority of any officer, with the single exception of the Pasha himself. Yet, such is their activity and intrepidity, that they have sometimes proved formidable to the best disciplined European armies. Whatever was done in the last Turkish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAMPAIGN\">campaign</a> against the Russians, is said to have been achieved by Albanian troops.\n\nThis fierce and haughty race display a greater degree of contempt for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEX\">sex</a>, than is usual even among the most barbarous nations. The females are literally regarded as inferior animals, and treated as such; but, in the country districts, they are not confined, or veiled, as is customary in Mahometan countries.\n\nThe dress of the Albanian consists of a cotton shirt, a jacket, a mantle, sandals, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>; to which is added, a large capote, or great coat, as a shelter from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>. Every part, except the shirt, consists of woollen. As they have usually only one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a>, which they wear day and night, it soon becomes a dreadful assemblage of dirt and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VERMIN\">vermin</a>; and at length literally falls to pieces. The dress of the females is more various, and often fantastical. A singular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> prevails among the girls, of stringing together the pieces of money which they have collected for their portion, and wearing them upon their heads. Some of them have their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> hanging <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> in braids to a great length, loaded with this species of ornament.\n\nJoannina, the present capital, is beautifully situated on the banks of a small lake, enclosed within a circuit of lofty mountains. The houses, in general, are not externally either splendid or elegant; and they are built in the most irregular manner, with scarcely any approach to the form of streets. The intermixture however of gardens and trees, gives to the city a fine appearance from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a>; particularly when combined with the magnificent back-ground, which everywhere crowns the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANDSCAPE\">landscape</a>. There is a considerable number of Greeks at Joannina, who display an active and intelligent character, and cultivate with ardour the different branches of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> and literature. The total number of inhabitants is estimated at upwards of thirty-five thousand.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> of Albania is chiefly carried on through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTA\">Arta</a>, a small city situated on a gulf of the same name, in the most southern district of the country. The principal merchants however, are Greeks residing at Joannina, among whom a very active commercial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> appears to prevail. Ali, who anxiously endeavours to promote the trade of his dominions, without however knowing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>, imposes great restraints on the removal of the merchants. He generally insists, that at least one member of a family should continue to reside at Joannina. The mercantile houses of this city have often branches in other countries, particularly Germany and Russia, and several of them suffered considerably by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONFLAGRATION\">conflagration</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOSCOW\">Moscow</a>. Under the continental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of the late French ruler, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALTA\">Malta</a> became the great channel for the trade of Albania, and, notwithstanding the recent political changes, may probably retain it to a certain extent. The exports consist almost entirely of unmanufactured produce. Notwithstanding its mountainous character, the fertility of its plains affords a surplus of grain, of which, upwards of fifty cargoes are sent to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, the Ionian isles, Malta, and other places. The Pasha, however has checked this commerce by the impolitic system of assuming the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONOPOLY\">monopoly</a> of it into his own hands. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">Wool</a> is exported, chiefly unmanufactured; but partly also wrought into coarse cloth. Other important <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol8.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of export are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-TOBACCO\">tobacco</a> of good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, cotton and cotton <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol20.html#article-YARN\">yarn</a>, chiefly from Thessaly. Some cargoes of wood for building and fire, are annually sent to Malta. The chief imports consist of woollen cloths, used for winter coverings. For this purpose, the preference is given to a coarser and cheaper species than any that is usually manufactured in Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>. This is supplied from Germany. Albania imports also guns, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a>, hardware, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COFFEE\">coffee</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>. On the 8th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OCTOBER\">October</a>, an annual fair is opened in the neighbourhood of Joannina, and continues for fourteen days, when the imported articles are exchanged for native commodities, which then pour in from every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>.\n\nThe reader <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> find much interesting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> in regard to this country, and its present ruler, in the lately published Travels of Mr Hobhouse, and of Dr Holland.

According to the practice of the most recent Russian geographers, we have comprehended the whole of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARCHIPELAGO\">archipelago</a> under one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> name, although it has been sometimes divided into three several groups: those nearest to the eastern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of Kamtschatka being properly called Aleutian; the central <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUP\">group</a> the Andreanofskie, or Andreonovian; and those nearest to the American promontory, the Fox Islands. The Russian geographers usually separate Behring's and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-COPPER\">Copper</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">Island</a>, which are at the western extremity of this chain, from the other parts of it, included by them under the general name of\nAleutian Islands; but as there seems no good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> for this exception, it certainly would be better to comprehend the whole under one general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DENOMINATION\">denomination</a>.\n\nThe first voyage of discovery in this remote and dangerous archipelago was projected by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">Great</a>, whose enterprising mind appears to have been strongly excited by the question, then much agitated, relative to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> between the Asiatic and American Continents; the solution of which seemed to be facilitated by the recent conquest of Kamtschatka. A short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> previous to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of that monarch, which took <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in 1725, he drew up instructions, with his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, for the conduct of an expedition, which was to be entrusted to the command of an officer named Behring, who had already made several voyages in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> of Kamtschatka, by order of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CROWN\">Crown</a>. In 1728, Behring set sail from the mouth of the Kamtschatka river, and coasted the eastern shores of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIBERIA\">Siberia</a>, as far to the northward as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LATITUDE\">latitude</a> 67\u00b0 18', but made no discovery of the opposite Continent. In 1729, he again set sail, for the purpose of prosecuting the same enterprise, but with no better success. A third voyage was undertaken, by order of the Empress <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANNA\">Anna</a>, in 1741; and Behring was again selected as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> of the expedition; another vessel being entrusted to the command of Tschirikoff. This enterprise proved more fortunate, and led the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> to all the subsequent important discoveries of the Russians in those seas; although the immediate results of the voyage, upon the whole, were not deemed commensurate with the time and expense employed in fitting out the expedition. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of the undertaking, however, appears to have been accomplished. Tschirikoff discovered the coast of America in the 56th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of latitude; and Behring, who was separated from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a> in a storm, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> it in latitude 58\u00b0 28'. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">On</a> his voyage back to Kamtschatka, Behring's ship was driven on the island which now bears his name, where he soon afterwards died.\n\nThe two uninhabited islands, Behring's and Copper Island, now became known to the natives of Kamtschatka, who frequently resorted thither, for the purpose of hunting sea-otters, and other animals, affording valuable furs, with which they carried on a lucrative traffic. Some of the vessels which sailed upon these expeditions were driven, by stormy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, to the south-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EAST\">east</a>, by which means the group of Aleutian Islands came to be discovered. These islands seem to have been first visited in the year 1745, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to be resorted to, for some time, by private individuals, without attracting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of the Russian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">Government</a>. In the above-mentioned year a vessel, called the Eudokia, was fitted out at the expence of some private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ADVENTURERS\">adventurers</a>, and the command given to Michael Nevodtsikof, a native of Tobolsk. Having discovered three unknown islands, they ventured upon one of them, in order to kill sea-otters, of which they found a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a>. These islands were undoubtedly the nearest Aleutian Islands, and were found <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> inhabited. The Russians continued upon this island until the 14th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEPTEMBER\">September</a> 1746, when, having incurred the enmity of the natives by their arbitrary and hostile proceedings, they put to sea, with the view of looking out for some uninhabited islands. Being overtaken, however, by a violent storm, they were driven about until the 30th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OCTOBER\">October</a>, when their vessel was wrecked upon the rocky shore of the island of Karaga, the inhabitants of which were of the Koriae <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBUTARY\">tributary</a> to the Russian empire.\n\nFrom this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, the zeal or avarice of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a> adventurers prompted them to undertake repeated voyages to the new-discovered islands, in some of which they penetrated as far eastward as the Fox Islands, where they collected a quantity of valuable skins; but, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of their own rapacity and misconduct, they were frequently embroiled in fatal quarrels with the natives. One of the most remarkable of these voyages was that of the St Andrean and the St Natalia, fitted out by the merchant Andrean Tolstyk, which sailed from the mouth of the Kamtschatka river on the 27th September 1760, and on the 29th reached <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol4.html#article-BEHRING_S_ISLAND\">Behring's Island</a>. Having been driven on shore by a violent autumnal storm, they were here obliged to pass the winter; and, after refitting, they put to sea again on the 24th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 1761. They passed by Copper Island, which lies about 150 versts from the former, and steered S.E. towards the Aleutian isles, which they did not reach before the 6th August. From thence they proceeded, on the Discovery 19th, in quest of some more distant islands, for the purpose of exacting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBUTE\">tribute</a>, steering their course N.E. and N.E. by E., and were driven, by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GALE\">gale</a> of wind, towards an island, where, on the 30th August, they anchored in a safe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BAY\">bay</a>. This island, they called Ayagh or Kayaka, and another, which lay at the distance of about 20 versts, Kanagra. The Russians persuaded the inhabitants of these islands to become tributary to the empress, to which they made no great objection. Four other islands were discovered in the neighbourhood; and the crew remained here, in great tranquillity, until the year 1764, but met with no great success in their hunting excursions. This group of islands, which lies somewhat to the north-west of the Fox Islands, was denominated, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of the vessel which made the discovery, the Andreanofskie, or Andrenovian Isles.\n\nFrom the year 1758 to 1760, several vessels visited the Fox Islands, and obtained considerable cargoes of sea-otter and fox skins. But the crews appear to have behaved with the most shameful inhumanity towards the natives; and little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> was derived from these voyages, except a few particulars which\n\n---\n\n* Mr Pinkerton appears to be mistaken when he says, that, \"the nearest Aleutian Isles of the Russians, are those which we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> Behring's and Copper.\" (Geog. 3d. Edit. Vol. II. p. 428.) We do not find that the term Aleutian, has ever been applied to the two islands above mentioned. That name was first given, by the early Russian discoverers, to the small group of islands, situated to the S.E. of Behring's island; and the islands composing this group, were sometimes called the nearest Aleutian isles, to distinguish them from the more easterly and remote parts of the chain. See Coxe's Russian Discoveries, chap. ii.\ntranspired during the course of a judicial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> into their conduct. In 1762, four vessels sailed for the Fox Islands, of which only one returned safe to Kamtschatka. The first was the Zacharias and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a>, fitted out by Kulkof and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">Company</a> of Vologda, under the command of Drusinin, with a crew of thirty-four Russians and three Kamtschadals. This vessel touched at the Aleutian Islands, and, in the beginning of September 1763, arrived at Unmak, one of the most considerable of the Fox Islands. On the 22d September they proceeded to Unalashka, where the vessel was brought into a safe harbour. Here the crew formed themselves into hunting parties, but were soon afterwards attacked separately by the natives, and cut off, with the exception of four individuals, who, after defending themselves with astonishing courage and intrepidity, and suffering incredible hardships, succeeded in making their escape from the island in a baidar, their own vessel having been destroyed by the savages. One of these four died during the home voyage; but the other three returned safe to Kamtschatka, and gave an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of their adventures.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> vessel which sailed from Kamtschatka in 1762 was the Trinity, fitted out by the trading company of Nikiphor Trapesnikof, a merchant of Irkutsk, under the command of Ivan Korovin, and manned with thirty-eight Russians and six Kamtschadals. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of October they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANCHOR\">anchor</a> before the south side of Behring's Island, where they resolved to winter, on account of the late season of the year. On the 1st of August 1763, Korovin sailed from Behring's Island, in company with Dennis Medvedef, who commanded a vessel fitted out by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JACOB\">Jacob</a> Protassof, merchant of Tiumen. On the 15th the former vessel made Unalashka, and Medvedef reached Unmak. After having reconnoitred the coast, and received hostages from the Toigons, or Chiefs, Korovin sent out several hunting parties; but the natives soon began to exhibit hostile intentions, and three Kamtschadals, belonging to Kulkof's ship, arrived with accounts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a> of that vessel, and the massacre of the crew. On the 10th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a>, the savages assembled in large bodies, and invested the hut which the Russians had constructed, and continually annoyed them with their darts. Korovin, finding himself thus harassed by the natives, ordered the hut to be destroyed, and retired to his vessel, which was removed to the distance of an hundred yards from the beach, where they lay at anchor from the 5th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> to the 26th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a> 1764. Here the natives attempted to surprise the vessel; but Korovin, having been warned of their approach, compelled them to retreat. On the 26th April, Korovin sailed from Unalashka, and, after being driven about by contrary winds, the vessel was at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> stranded, on the 28th, in a bay of the Island of Unmak. Having got on shore, the crew attempted to secure themselves between their baidar and some empty barrels, with the sails spread over them in the form of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TENT\">tent</a>. Next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, they were surprised by a large body of the natives, who attacked them with their darts, and wounded every one of the crew. Korovin, however, sailed out, in company with four Russians, and put the savages to flight; although he and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PARTY\">party</a> were so severely wounded, that they had scarcely sufficient strength to return to the tent. During the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>, the vessel was dashed to pieces by the storm. On the 30th of April, they were again attacked by the natives, who, however, were soon put to flight by the fire of the Russians. On the 21st of July, Korovin, with the remainder of his crew, which was now reduced to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of twelve persons, including six Kamtschadals, put to sea in a baidar; and, having landed upon another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the same island, they discovered the remains of a vessel which had been burnt, and, at a small distance, a deserted Russian dwelling, containing twenty dead bodies in their clothes; among which they recognized several of those individuals who had sailed in Protassof's vessel, and distinguished, among the rest, the commander Medvedef. Korovin afterwards joined Glottof's vessel, (of whose proceedings we shall immediately give some account), which he quitted in the month of April 1765, and went over, with five other Russians, to Soloviof, with whom he returned, the following year, to Kamtschatka.\n\nThe third voyage from Kamtschatka in 1762, and Voyage of the most fortunate and most remarkable of the whole, Stephen Glottof, in was that of the Andrean and Natalia, which was fitted out by Terenty Tsebneffskoi and Company, under the command of Stephen Glottof, an experienced and skillful seaman of Yarensk. This vessel sailed on the 1st October, with a crew of thirty-eight Russians and eight Kamtschadals. Having wintered at Copper Island, they set sail from thence on the 26th July 1763, and steered for the Fox Islands. In consequence of storms and contrary winds, they were thirty days on the voyage to Unmak, where they arrived on the 24th August, and, without dropping anchor, sailed farther in quest of new islands, of which they passed eight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTIGUOUS\">contiguous</a> to each other, and separated by straits from 20 to 100 versts <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>. Glottof, however, did not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> until he reached the most eastward of these islands, called by the inhabitants Kadyak. Here, and in the neighbouring islands, they passed the winter, and collected a considerable quantity of furs; but as the conduct of the natives, at first decidedly hostile, was always suspicious, Glottof did not think it prudent to prolong his stay; and accordingly, having taken on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOARD\">board</a> all the peltry and stores, he left Kadyak on the 24th May 1764, and sailed for Unmak, where he arrived on the 3d July. He remained here two years, sending out hunting parties through the islands of Unmak and Unalashka, and commenced his voyage homewards in the month of July 1766. In the month of August he arrived safe in Kamtschatka river with a rich <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARGO\">cargo</a>.\n\nSoloviof, to whose voyage we have already alluded, sailed from Kamtschatka on the 25th of Au-\n\n* This was the fourth vessel which sailed in 1762; but, as the whole crew were massacred by the natives, we have no distinct account of the voyage.\ngust 1764, in a ship called the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul, fitted out by Jacob Ulednikof and Company, merchants of Irkutsk. This vessel reached Unalashka on the 17th September, where Soloviof passed two winters; and having succeeded, notwithstanding the continual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSTILITY\">hostility</a> of the natives, in collecting a considerable cargo of peltry, he returned to Kamtschatka in the month of July 1766.\n\nHaving thus traced an outline of the gradual progress of early discovery in this archipelago, it seems unnecessary to proceed with an enumeration of the subsequent voyages performed by private individuals. These were undertaken merely for commercial purposes; the accounts brought home by the adventurers were generally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> and incorrect; and rather tended to excite than to gratify the curiosity of those who might be desirous of obtaining more accurate and more ample information. We shall, therefore, now turn to the conduct of those expeditions, which were fitted out by the State for the express purpose of discovery.\n\nIn the year 1768, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> Krenitzin and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">Lieutenant</a> Levashof sailed from the mouth of the Kamtschatka river, by order of the Empress Catharine, to examine the chain of Aleutian Islands. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> they accordingly executed very carefully, having surveyed the whole of this archipelago, from Behring's Island to the promontory of Alaska; and, after spending the winter among the Fox Islands, they returned to Kamtschatka in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUTUMN\">autumn</a> of 1769.\n\nBut our great navigator, Captain Cook, communicated more accurate scientific information respecting these islands, as well as the coasts of the two continents, than all the previous voyages of the Russian discoverers had afforded. During his third and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> voyage, in the year 1778, he surveyed the eastern portion of this archipelago, accurately determined the positions of some of the most remarkable islands, and corrected many errors of former navigators.\n\nIn the year 1785, a fresh expedition was set on foot by the Russian government, the command of which was entrusted to Captain Billings, an English naval officer in the Russian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>, who had accompanied Captain Cook in his last celebrated voyage to the Pacific Ocean. This expedition appears to have been suggested by Mr Coxe, who was at that time at St Petersburg, and whose Account of the Russian Discoveries between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a> and America, had already attracted the attention of the Russian government. During this voyage, which was not completed until the year 1796, Captains Billings and Sarytschef explored the whole chain of the Aleutian islands, particularly that part of it which had been visited by Captain Cook, and some parts of the adjacent western coast of America. Ample details of the conduct of this expedition have been published in the narratives of Martin Sauer, who officiated as secretary to Captain Billings, and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ADMIRAL\">Admiral</a> Sarytschef.\n\nSome years after the termination of the expedition under Captain Billings, the attention of the Russian American Company was turned towards the best means of supplying their settlements on the north-west coast of America with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> and stores of all kinds; and it was resolved to try whether the Aleutian conveyance by sea would not answer the purpose better, than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> and tedious journey by land to Ochotsk. With the view of ascertaining the practicability of the project, Captain Krusenstern, an experienced Russian naval officer, who had served for a long period in the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-NAVY\">Navy</a>, suggested the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of an expedition from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CRONSTADT\">Cronstadt</a>, round <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol4.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HORN\">Horn</a>, to the Aleutian Islands and the north-west coast of America. This plan was approved of by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> Romanzof, the Minister of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMERCE\">Commerce</a>, and Admiral Mordwinof, Minister of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">Marine</a>, and obtained the sanction of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERIAL\">Imperial</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJESTY\">Majesty</a>. Two vessels, called by the Russians the Nadeshda and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEVA\">Neva</a>, were accordingly purchased in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> for the voyage. The command of the expedition was intrusted to Captain Krusenstern, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> author of the plan; and Captain Lisiansky was appointed to the Neva. These two vessels accordingly sailed in company from Cronstadt, in the month of August 1803, and, after a short stay at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALMOUTH\">Falmouth</a>, proceeded to the Brazils; from whence they sailed round Cape Horn to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SANDWICH\">Sandwich</a> Islands. Here they separated; the Nadeshda being ordered on a distinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MISSION\">mission</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JAPAN\">Japan</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHINA\">China</a>; while Captain Lisiansky, in the Neva, proceeded to Kadyak and the American settlements. Of this voyage, very full and interesting accounts have been lately published by Captains Krusenstern and Lisiansky, and by Dr Langsdorff, who accompanied the expedition in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of physician.\n\nFrom the ample sources of information, to which we have alluded in the foregoing narrative, we shall now proceed to exhibit an enumeration and general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of the islands composing this singular chain, which appears to be a prolongation of either continent. We shall begin with the more westerly part of the chain, consisting of those islands which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> nearest to Kamtschatka, and proceed eastwards to the American promontory. The first is Commodore's or Behring's Island, situate (according to Cook's reckoning), in 55\u00b0 of latitude, and 6\u00b0 of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a> from the harbour of Petropaulowska in the bay of Awatska. It is from 70 to 80 versts long, and stretches from north-west to south-east. Ten leagues from the south-east point of this island, in the direction of east by south, or east-south-east, lies Mednoi Ostroff, or Copper Island, so called from large masses of native copper being found upon the beach. To the south-east of Copper Island lie three small islands, Attak, or Attoo, Semitshi, and Agattoo, called by the Russians Plishnic Ostrova, or the nearest Aleutian Islands. Of these Attak is the largest; it is nearly of the same shape as Behring's Island, but rather more extensive, stretching from west to east to the length of 18 leagues. These islands are situate between 54\u00b0 and 55\u00b0 of north latitude. Attak has two harbours, one of which lies on the southern coast. From the eastern extremity of the Aleutian Islands, properly so called, another group runs, south-eastward, continuing the chain as far as the western extremity of the Fox Islands. These are called the Andreanofskie Islands; but we have less accurate information respecting this central part of\nthe chain, than regarding the eastern and western groups. They are said to lie within the 52d and 54th degree of north latitude, to be of inconsiderable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> or importance, and, therefore, seldom visited by recent navigators. The most remarkable are, Takavangha, which has in its centre, near the northern coast, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> mountain; Kanaghi, or Kanaga, likewise with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> smoking mountain; Ayag, which has a number of good bays and anchoring-places; and Tshetchina, on which a high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> mountain overtops the rest, which apparently is an extinct volcano, as there are still hot springs on this island. Atshak, or Atchka, and Amlac, are also usually reckoned among the number of the Andreonovian isles. The former greatly resembles Copper Island, and is provided with a commodious harbour.\n\nBy far the most important and best explored portion of this archipelago is the most easterly group, called by the Russians Lysic Ostrovo, or the Fox Islands. Of these islands the most considerable are, Umnak, Unalashka, or Oonalashka; and Unimak; the last of which is separated by a narrow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRAIT\">strait</a> from the promontory of Alaska. Beyond these, to the north-east, lies the large island of Kadyak, or Kodiak, which is generally included among the group called Schumagin's Islands.\n\nThe whole of the islands composing this chain are bare and mountainous; their coasts are rocky and surrounded by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAKERS\">breakers</a>, which renders the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a> of those seas exceedingly dangerous. The land rises immediately from the coasts to steep bald mountains, gradually ascending higher behind each other, and assuming the appearance of chains of mountains, with a direction lengthwise of the island. Springs take their rise at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> of the mountains, and either flow in broad and rapid streams into the neighbouring sea, or, collecting in the rocky vales and glens, form ample lakes, which send off their superfluous waters, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> canals, into the adjacent bays. These islands bear evident marks of volcanic formation; and several of them have still <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> volcanoes, which continually emit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a>, and sometimes flames. No traces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-METALS\">metals</a> have been discovered on these islands; but carnoles and sardonyxes are brought from thence. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> is said to be similar to that of Kamtschatka; and affords the same kinds of edible wild berries and roots; excepting some few vegetables which seem to be of foreign origin. No wood of any considerable growth has been perceived upon any of these islands, except a very small quantity, on Unalashka. The land animals are bears, wolves, river-otters, river-beavers, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERMINES\">ermines</a>. The sea-otter, so valuable on account of its skin, is frequently caught; but the number of these animals, it is believed, is much diminished of late. On the Fox Islands they have a great variety of foxes, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>, grey, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a>. The sea abounds with all sorts of seals, dolphins, and whales; sea-lions and porpoises are rare, and sea-cows not at all to be seen. Salmon are caught in great abundance and variety; and halibut of an immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> are frequently taken. The winter upon these islands is tolerably mild, but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> is equally short and unpleasant. The inhabitants are pretty numerous, and tributary to Russia, from whence vessels are sent out, and establishments formed upon these islands, on account of the very profitable chace of sea-otters and foxes.\n\nUnalashka, one of the largest of the Fox Islands, Island of was visited by Captain Cook during his last voyage, and seems to merit particular notice. This island stretches from north-east to south-west, and is from 70 to 80 versts in length, but of very unequal breadth. On the north and north-east side there are many bays and creeks, in some of which are very secure harbours for vessels. A part of the southwest shore consists of very high, steep, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INACCESSIBLE\">inaccessible</a> cliffs; and another part has remained hitherto wholly unexplored. The whole island consists of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of rocks, covered only with a very thin coat of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>; the hills are of very unequal height, and are intersected by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> valleys, the soil of which is commonly argillaceous, or an earth which appears washed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> from the hills. In the lower valleys there is great abundance of grass, which would furnish very good food for cattle; indeed Captain Cook was of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> that cattle might subsist at Unalashka all the year round, without being housed; and the soil, in many places, appeared capable of producing grain, roots, and vegetables. But the Russian traders, and the natives, seem satisfied with what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> brings forth. No wood grows on this and the neighbouring islands; only low bushes and shrubs of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DWARF\">dwarf</a>-birch, willow, and alder. For all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a> used for the purposes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>, &c., they are indebted to the sea, which wafts it to their shores from the adjacent continent of America. The inhabitants are rather low of stature, but plump and well shaped; with the Natives, short necks, swarthy chubby faces, black eyes, small beards, and long, straight, black <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>, which the men wear loose behind, and cut before, but the women tie up in a bunch. With regard to their character, Captain Cook describes them as, to all appearance, the most inoffensive people he ever met with, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> patterns of honesty. But, according to the accounts of the first discoverers, this does not seem to have been their original disposition; and recent travellers have observed, that although generally kind-hearted and peaceable, yet, when roused to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a>, they become exceedingly malevolent, and indifferent to all danger, even to death itself. The clothing of the men and women Dress, is nearly the same, and consists of a sort of frock or shirt, called parka, fastened round the neck with a broad stiff <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLAR\">collar</a>, and descending below the knee. These garments are made of the skins of seals, prepared in a manner peculiar to themselves, and sewed together very ingeniously. Though simple in their form, they are ornamented in a variety of ways; with glass beads; beaks of sea parrots; long white goat's hair, brought from Siberia, or small red feathers. Over the frock, the men sometimes bear a kamleika, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a>-garment. This is made of gut, which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a>; and has a hood to it, which draws over the head, and is tied under the chin. When on shore, the men wear boots, made of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEAL\">seal</a>'s skin; and they all have a kind of oval snouted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>, made of wood, with a rim to admit the head. These caps are dyed with green and other\nAleutian Islands.\n\ncolours, and are very fancifully ornamented with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IVORY\">ivory</a> figures, carved from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a> of the sea-cow, with glass or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMBER\">amber</a> beads, and with the bristles from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEARD\">beard</a> of the sea-lion. They make use of no paint; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TATTOOING\">tattooing</a> was formerly very much in use among them, particularly among the women; but their intercourse with the Russians has rather brought this practice into disrepute. Both men and women, particularly the latter, bore the under lip, and insert pieces of bone or other ornaments; but this practice has also decreased of late. The women, for the most part, go barefooted; they wear bracelets of glass beads <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> above the wrist and ankle-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a>, and are very fond of rings upon their fingers. The principal food of these islanders consists of fish, sea-animals, birds, roots and berries. They dry large quantities of fish in summer, which they lay up in small huts for winter use; and roots and berries are also preserved for the same time of scarcity. Among the fish, the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> and most abundant are several sorts of salmon, cod, herrings, and halibut. The last is the most esteemed, and is sometimes caught of an enormous size. The fat of the whale is also a favourite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of food; when it grows old and rancid, it serves to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> and warm their houses. They eat almost everything raw; but of late, they have learnt some simple modes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COOKERY\">cookery</a> from the Russians. Vegetable food does not appear to be held in much esteem by the Unalashkans. That sweet plant, the Siberian parsnip, (*Heracleum Sibiricum*), is but little eaten, any more than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BULB\">bulb</a> of the *Saranna*, or Kamtschadale lily. Berries of an eatable quality abound; such as brambleberries, cranberries, huckleberries, heath-berries, and several others. Of late, the Russians have begun to plant potatoes, which succeed extremely well, and are much liked by the people. The habitations of the Unalashkans are holes dug in the earth, covered with a wooden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a>, over which they throw grass and earth; so that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VILLAGE\">village</a> has the appearance of an European <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-YARD\">yard</a> full of graves. The entrance into these huts is from the roof; some of the largest, however, which are inhabited by the Russians, have a low door in the side. The light is also admitted by the roof, through an opening or window covered over with seal's entrails, or dried fish-skin. Several divisions are made within, by means of seal-skins or straw-mats, which separate the apartments of the different families that occupy the habitation. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSEHOLD\">household</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FURNITURE\">furniture</a> consists of bowls, spoons, buckets, piggins or cans, matted baskets, and perhaps a Russian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KETTLE\">kettle</a> or pot. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HATCHET\">hatchet</a>, or rather a small flat piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, made like an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADZE\">adze</a>, by fitting it into a crooked wooden handle, are the only iron tools found amongst them. Yet all their instruments and utensils are made with the greatest neatness, and the most exact symmetry. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol16.html#article-NEEDLES\">needles</a>, with which they sew their clothes and embroider, are made of the wing-bone of the gull, with a very nice cut round the thicker end, instead of an eye, to which they tie the thread so skilfully, that it follows the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NEEDLE\">needle</a> without any obstruction. Their thread is made of the sinews of the seal, the fibres of which they split to the thickness which each sort of work requires. All sewing is performed by the women; they are the tailors, shoemakers, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a>-builders, or boat-coverers. At their leisure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a>, particularly in long winter evenings, they make fine mats, little baskets, and pocket-books of straw, that are both beautiful and strong. Indeed, Captain Cook observes, there is a neatness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a> in most of their work, that shows they neither want ingenuity nor perseverance. Their houses have no fire-place, but are heated, as Use of Fire well as lighted, by lamps. These are made of a flat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, hollowed on one side like a plate; in the hollow part they put the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>, mixed with a little dry grass, which serves the purpose of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WICK\">wick</a>. They produce fire both by collision and by attrition; the former by striking two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> one against another, of producing one of them being previously rubbed with brimstone. The latter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> is with two pieces of wood; one of which is a pointed stick, and the other a flat piece. The pointed end of the stick they press upon the other, whirling it nimbly round as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRILL\">drill</a>; thus producing fire in a few minutes.\n\nThe principal occupations of the Aleutians, are Occupations <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISHING\">fishing</a> and hunting, and preparing the implements necessary for both. Their *baidars*, *baidarkas*, or boats, resemble the canoes of other savages. They consist of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SKELETON\">skeleton</a> of wood, over which is stretched a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a> covering made of seals' skins. The boats of the Unalashkans are much superior in point of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> to those of any of the other islands; some of them appear so transparent that one might trace the formation of the inside, and the manner in which the rower sits. In their form, they are long and narrow, and commonly hold only one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a>; sometimes they are made to hold two, and very rarely three; each person sitting in a round hole just fitted to the size of the body. The whole canoe is so extremely light, even when sodden with water, that it may be carried with ease in one hand. They are impelled by means of double paddles, seven or eight feet long, which are managed with great dexterity. Experienced navigators <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> sometimes venture out a considerable way to sea in these boats, even in very stormy weather. The Darts used darts, or javelins, with which they kill their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAME\">game</a>, in Hunting, are formed with the same neatness as their other instruments, and adapted with the greatest judgment to the different objects of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHASE\">chase</a>. For land animals, a single barbed point; for birds, three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of light bone, spread, and barbed; for seals, &c., they use a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSE\">false</a> point, inserted in a socket at the end of the dart, which parts on the least effort of the animal to dive, remaining in its body. A string of considerable length is fastened to this barbed point, and twisted round the wooden part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JAVELIN\">javelin</a>. This serves as a float to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> them to the seal, which, having the stick to drag after it, soon tires, and becomes an easy prey. These darts are not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a> from Curies no bow, but slung from a small plank, about 18 inches long and two inches broad. In order that the weapon may be held the faster, they have a sort of handle at the lower end, and an opening through which the fore-finger is thrust. At the other end is a small channel, into which the javelin fits with a little knob, which serves to retain it. When the javelin is to be thrown, the plank is held horizontally, and the aim being taken, the weapon is directed by the middle finger and thumb. This is done\nwith so much dexterity, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> given to it is so powerful and so rapid, that the object aimed at is rarely missed; even whales are killed without any other weapon.\n\nTheir favourite amusement appears to be dancing; in which, however, they do not seem to exhibit any particular exertion of strength, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEGANCE\">elegance</a>; the only motion being a sort of hop, the performer scarcely moving from the place he first takes up. Their music is exceedingly rude, consisting of a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRUM\">drum</a> or tambour, and a rattle made of the bladder of a sea-dog, filled with peas or small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEBBLES\">pebbles</a>. In their leisure hours, they amuse themselves with making these little drums and rattles, which are frequently ornamented with a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of ingenuity and elegance; and with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> out from the teeth of the sea-cow, small figures of men, fish, sea-otters, and other objects, in a manner that appears very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a>, considering that the sea-cow's teeth are much harder than ivory, and that they have no proper tools to work with.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> of these Islanders, like that of most uncivilized nations, consists in superstitious observances, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> in charms. Many of them have been baptized, and are nominally professors of the Greek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>; of which, however, they understand nothing more than making the sign of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a>. They have no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a>; every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> may have as many wives as he can conveniently maintain; if his means decrease, he sends first one, then another back to their parents; and these women become perfectly at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> to look out for other husbands. Sometimes the same woman lives with two husbands; and it is not uncommon for men to sell or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a> wives. Boys, if they happen to be very handsome, are often brought up entirely in the manner of girls; instructed in the arts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> blandishment; and used as concubines. This shocking, unnatural, and immoral practice, has prevailed here even from the remotest times. Such men are known under the name of schopans.\n\nThe bodies of the dead, especially of the men, were formerly interred in places set apart for the purpose, and with particular ceremonies. Their best javelins and clothes, with a portion of train-oil and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol8.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of food, were laid with them in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a>; and sometimes even slaves of both sexes were slaughtered upon the occasion. These customs are now, however, entirely laid aside.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> of Unalashka, and the neighbouring islands, appears to have been formerly considerable, amounting to several thousands. In 1790, Sarytcheff reckoned it at 1300. According to the most recent accounts, it does not appear to amount to more than 300. This rapid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEPOPULATION\">depopulation</a> is ascribed partly to the practice of sending the best hunters from hence to a distance, to chase the large sea-otters, few of whom ever return again to their families; and partly to the state of oppression under which the natives live, and the change which has taken place in their modes of living. Captain Cook seems to consider the natives of these Islands as originally of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTRACTION\">extraction</a> with the Greenlanders and Esquimaux. When first discovered by the Russians, they were under the government of Toigons, or chiefs, who, however, possessed little superior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>, and had no revenue. At present they are all subject to the government of the Russian settlers.\n\nThroughout the whole of the Aleutian Islands, on the Russian settlement of Kadyak, and the western coast of America, the Russians have formed settlements for the purpose of hunting, and collecting furs; with which they carry on a lucrative commerce, particularly with the Chinese. The most valuable fur is that of the sea-otter; an animal which has now become rare on these islands, in consequence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> eagerness with which they have been hunted and killed. Besides the sea-otter, there are numbers of foxes, especially on the Fox Islands. The black foxes found on these islands are not so valuable as those of Siberia. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCTIC\">Arctic</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ICE\">ice</a> fox, called also the rock fox, and the blue fox, from the natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> of the fur, which is of a bluish grey, is very common. From the discovery of these islands by Behring and Tschelikoff, in 1741, the fur-trade was carried on for a long period entirely by private adventurers; and appears to have been productive of great abuses. The natives were frequently treated in the most cruel and barbarous manner; and the keenness <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> by these rapacious hunters, threatened to extirpate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of animals upon which the trade depended. Convinced of the extreme <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of putting a stop to this destructive plan of proceeding, Schelikoff, an intelligent Russian merchant, took considerable pains to unite the different partakers of this trade into a company, in order that it might be conducted with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a> and precaution, upon some plan that might prove advantageous to all parties. In 1785, he succeeded in joining company with the Golikoffs. They increased their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a>, and fitted out several ships, which the enterprising Schelikoff commanded in person. Factories, protected by forts, were established in almost all the Aleutian islands, as far eastward as Kadyak; and, during several years, they continued this lucrative trade in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONJUNCTION\">conjunction</a>, by which they acquired considerable wealth. The success of this connection induced several merchants to unite like Schelikoff and the Golikoffs; and, in this manner, was laid the foundation of the present Russian American Company. The irregular manner, however, in which the trade was still carried on, and the cruelty which was frequently exercised by the Russian merchants towards the natives of the islands, drew upon them great and well-founded censure; insomuch, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">Emperor</a> Paul determined to put an end to the company and the trade at the same time. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a> would have infallibly been carried into effect, but for the interference of M.

The miserable situation of the Provi\u0161\u010deniks, or fur-collectors, themselves the slaves of the company's agents, and exercising, in their turn, the most oppressive tyranny over the wretched Aleutians, has been represented by several eye-witnesses in the most deplorable colours.

The Commanders of the Faithful had become the patrons and cultivators, instead of the scourgings and contemners, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> and literature. Knowledge found her only sanctuary under the successors of those rulers who had sought to extinguish every ray of intellectual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, by means of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol13.html#article-LIBRARIES\">libraries</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALEXANDRIA\">Alexandria</a>. Instead of proscribing every book as useless but the Koran, some of these rulers carried their zeal in the cause of learning so far, as to make the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACQUISITION\">acquisition</a> of Greek manuscripts an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of negotiation, in their treaties with the Emperors of Constantinople. Under the Caliphs of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABBAS\">Abbas</a>, men of learning were raised to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of favour and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, which has never been enjoyed by that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a>, under the sovereigns of any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of the world. The munificence which shone forth with so much lustre in the supreme depositaries of power, was widely emulated among the inferior rulers and governors; and \"this emulation,\" to use the words of Gibbon, \"diffused the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> and the rewards of science, from Samarcan and Bochara, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEZ\">Fez</a> and Cordova.\" Every little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">court</a> had its circle of men of letters, who were always admitted to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">Prince</a>, and for the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> liberally supported by his bounty. Thus, when Alfarabius, after he had finished his travels, came to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> at Damas, he was received with Alfarabian open arms by its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOVEREIGN\">sovereign</a>, who bestowed upon him a pension, which he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to enjoy till his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, in the year 950.\n\nBut to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> the notice of princes, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> to acquire wealth, formed none of the aims of this philosopher. He is said to have led a very retired and ascetic life, rather contemning than seeking after the good things of the world. \"He constantly slept, even during winter, upon straw; his countenance was always sorrowful, and he found no consolation in anything but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>.\" (Enfield's Hist. of Philosophy, B.v.c.l.) His works were numerous, and very various in their subjects; his speculations seem, indeed, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of his writings, to have embraced the whole circle of the sciences. He is particularly deserving of notice, as having been perhaps the first compiler of an Encyclopedia.

He lost his father in early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANCY\">infancy</a>; but he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to reside with his mother, who married a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, till his tenth year, when he was placed at the academy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURIN\">Turin</a>. After he had passed a twelvemonth at the academy, he went on a short visit to a relation who dwelt at Comi, and during his stay there, he made his first poetical attempt in a sonnet chiefly borrowed from lines in Ariosto and Metastasio, the only poets he had at that time read. When thirteen years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> he was induced to commence the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of civil and canonical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a>; but the attempt only served to disgust him with every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a>, and to increase his relish for the perusal of French romances.\n\nBy the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of his uncle, who had hitherto taken some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> and conduct, he was left, at the age of fourteen, to enjoy without control his vast paternal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INHERITANCE\">inheritance</a>, augmented by the recent accession of his uncle's fortune. He now began to attend the riding-school, where he acquired that rage for horses, and equestrian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a>, which continued to be one of his strongest passions till the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a>.\n\nAfter some time spent in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> fits of extravagant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISSIPATION\">dissipation</a>, and ill-directed study, he was seized with a desire of travelling; and having obtained permission from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a>, he departed, in 1766, under the care of an English preceptor. Restless and unquiet, he posted with the utmost rapidity through the towns of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>; and his improvement was such as was to be expected from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of travelling and his previous habits. Dissatisfied with himself, he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> as little relish for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECTACLES\">spectacles</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> entertainments as for literature; and was as little amused by the gaiety of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARNIVAL\">carnival</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPLES\">Naples</a>, as he was impressed by the remains of antiquity at Rome, or the exhibitions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> art at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLORENCE\">Florence</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOLOGNA\">Bologna</a>. This indifference and insensibility did not, however, arise from defect of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a> or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> powers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, but from the want of some serious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>, or some enabling or praiseworthy pursuit. Hoping to find in foreign countries some relief from the tedium and ennui with which he was oppressed, and being anxious to become acquainted with the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEATRE\">Theatre</a>, he proceeded to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>; but his feelings were only those of disgust or indifference for the dramas which he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> represented in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a>. He seems, indeed, to have been completely dissatisfied with everything he witnessed in France, and contracted a dislike to its people, which his intercourse in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> years rather contributed to augment than diminish. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a> he became deeply enamoured of a married lady, who returned his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a>, but who was soon obliged to accompany her husband to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SWITZERLAND\">Switzerland</a>. Alfieri, whose feelings were of the most impetuous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>, was in despair at this separation, and returned to his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> in the utmost anguish and despondency of mind. While under this depression of spirits, he was induced to seek alleviation from works of literature; and the perusal of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLUTARCH\">Plutarch</a>'s Lives, which he read with profound emotion, inspired him with an enthusiastic passion for freedom and independence. Under the influence of this rage for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> he recommenced his travels; and his only gratification, in the absence of freedom among the Continental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">States</a>, appears to have been derived from contemplating the wild and sterile regions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a>; where gloomy forests, lakes, and precipices, conspired to excite those sublime and melancholy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> which were congenial to his disposition. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">Human</a> manners and human institutions he seems invariably to have surveyed with an eye of passion or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a>, instead of viewing them with the calmness of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>, who meditates how they may be rectified, or what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LESSONS\">lessons</a> may be drawn from them. In every country his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> felt as if confined by the bonds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>; he everywhere panted for something more free in governments, more elevated in sentiment, more devoted in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOVE\">love</a>, and more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> in friendship. In search of this ideal world, he posted through various countries, more with the rapidity of a courier, than of one who travels for amusement or instruction. During a journey to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, he engaged in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTRIGUE\">intrigue</a> with a married lady of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>; and having been detected, the publicity of a rencontre with the injured husband, and of a divorce, which followed, united to the knowledge he now acquired of the infamous character of the woman, to whom he was ardently attached, rendered it expedient and desirable for him to quit England. He then visited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PORTUGAL\">Portugal</a>, where he became acquainted with the Abb\u00e9 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CALUSO\">Caluso</a>, who remained through life the most attached and estimable friend he ever possessed. In 1772, Alfieri returned to Turin, where he again became enamoured of a lady, whom he loved with his usual ardour; and who seems to have been as undeserving of a sincere attachment as those he had hitherto adored. In the course of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> attendance on his mistress, during a malady with which she was afflicted, he one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> wrote a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIALOGUE\">dialogue</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of a drama, which he left at this lady's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>. About a year after, on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> taking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> between them, this piece was returned to him. Having then retouched and extended it to five acts, it was performed at Turin in 1775, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLEOPATRA\">Cleopatra</a>, whose amours had always been a favourite subject with Italian dramatists.\n\nFrom this moment, Alfieri was seized with an immeasurable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THIRST\">thirst</a> of theatrical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>, and the remainder of his life was devoted to its attainment. His two first tragedies, Filippo and Polinice, were originally written in French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROSE\">prose</a>; and when he came to versify them in Italian, he found that, from his Lombard origin, and long intercourse with foreigners, he expressed himself with febleness and inaccuracy. Accordingly, with the view of improving his Italian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a>, he went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TUSCANY\">Tuscany</a>, and, during an alternate residence at Florence and Siena, he completed his Filippo and Polinice, and conceived the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of various other dramas. While thus employed, he became acquainted with the Countess <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALBANY\">Albany</a>, who then resided with her husband at Florence. For her he formed an attachment, which, if less violent\nAlfieri than his former loves, appears to have been more permanent. With this motive to remain at Florence, he could not endure the chains by which his vast possessions bound him to Piedmont. He therefore resigned his whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> to his sister, the Countess Cumiana, reserving an annuity, which scarcely amounted to a half of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> revenues. At this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, the Countess Albany, urged by the ill-treatment she received from her husband, sought refuge in Rome, where she at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> received permission from the Pope to live apart from her tormentor. Alfieri followed the Countess to that capital, where he completed fourteen tragedies, four of which were now for the first time printed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIENNA\">Sienna</a>.\n\nAt length, however, it was thought proper, that, by leaving Rome, he should remove the aspersions which had been thrown on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of his affections. During the year 1783, he therefore travelled through different states of Italy, and published six additional tragedies. The interests of his love and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LITERARY\">literary</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> had not diminished his rage for horses, which seems to have been at least the third passion of his soul. He went to England solely for the purpose of purchasing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of these animals, which he brought with him to Italy. On his return, he learned that the Countess Albany had gone to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLMAR\">Colmar</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALSACE\">Alsace</a>, where he joined her, and resided with her under the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a> during the rest of his life. They chiefly passed their time between Alsace and Paris; but at length took up their abode entirely in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a>. While here, Alfieri made arrangements with Didot for an edition of his tragedies; but was soon after forced to quit Paris by the storms of the Revolution. He recrossed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ALPS\">Alps</a> with the Countess, and finally settled at Florence. The ten <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> years of his life, which he spent in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, seem to have been the happiest of his existence. During that long period, his tranquillity was only interrupted by the entrance of the Revolutionary armies into Florence in 1799. Though an enemy of kings, the aristocratic feelings of Alfieri rendered him also a decided foe to the principles and leaders of the French Revolution; and he rejected, with the utmost contempt, those advances which were made with a view to bring him over to their cause. The concluding years of his life were laudably employed in the study of Greek literature, and in perfecting a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of comedies. His assiduous labour on this object, which he pursued with his characteristic impetuosity, exhausted his strength, and brought on a malady, for which he would not adopt the prescriptions of his physicians, but obstinately persisted in employing remedies of his own. Under this regimen his disorder rapidly increased, and at length terminated his life on the 8th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OCTOBER\">October</a> 1803, in the fifty-fifth year of his age.\n\nThe character of Alfieri may be best appreciated from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PORTRAIT\">portrait</a> which he has drawn of himself in his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> of his Life. He was evidently of an irritable, impetuous, and almost ungovernable temper. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIDE\">Pride</a>, which seems to have been a ruling sentiment, may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> for many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> inconsistencies of his character. While it made him abhor kings, because superior to himself, it led him to detest those republicans who, by too near an approach, contaminated aristocratic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>; and it induced him, while yet undistinguished himself, and panting for literary fame, to decline a proffered introduction to Metastasio and Rousseau. But as all his bad qualities were greatly softened by the cultivation of literature, it may be presumed, that a better education, and an earlier employment of his faculties, would have rendered him a much more perfect character. His application to study gradually tranquillized his temper, and softened his manners; leaving him, at the same time, in perfect possession of those good qualities which he had inherited from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>\u2014a warm and disinterested attachment to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> and friends, united to a generosity, vigour, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELEVATION\">elevation</a> of character, which rendered him not unworthy to embody in his dramas the actions and sentiments of Grecian heroes.\n\nTo these dramas Alfieri is chiefly indebted for the high reputation to which he has attained. Before his time, the Italian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, so harmonious in the Sonnets of Petrarch, and so energetic in the Commedia of Dante, had been invariably languid and prosaic in dramatic dialogue. The pedantic and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INANIMATE\">inanimate</a> tragedies of the sixteenth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a> were followed, during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> age of Italian literature, by dramas, of which extravagance in the sentiments, and improbability in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, were the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> characteristics. The prodigious success of the Merope of Maffei, which appeared in the commencement of the last century, may be attributed more to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> with such productions, than to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTRINSIC\">intrinsic</a> merit. In this degradation of tragic taste, the appearance of the tragedies of Alfieri was, perhaps, the most important literary event that had occurred in Italy during the eighteenth century. On these tragedies it is difficult to pronounce a judgment, as the taste and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of the author underwent considerable change and modification during the intervals which elapsed between the three periods of their publication. An excessive harshness of style, an asperity of sentiment, and total want of poetical ornament, are the characteristics of his four first tragedies, Filippo, Polinice, Antigone, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGINIA\">Virginia</a>. These faults were, in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, corrected in the six tragedies which he gave to the world some years after; and in those which he published along with Saul, the drama which enjoyed the greatest success of all his productions\u2014a popularity, which may be partly attributed to the severe and unadorned manner of Alfieri being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> adapted to the patriarchal simplicity of the age in which the scene of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRAGEDY\">tragedy</a> is placed. But though there be a considerable difference in his dramas, there are certain observations applicable to them all. None of the plots are of his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>. They are founded either on mythological <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FABLE\">fable</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>; most of them had been previously treated by the Greek dramatists, or by Seneca. Rosmunda, the only one which could be supposed of his own contrivance, and which is certainly the least happy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EFFUSION\">effusion</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a>, is partly founded on the eighteenth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVEL\">novel</a> of the third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BANDELLO\">Bandello</a>, and partly on Prevost's M\u00e9moires d'un Homme de Qualit\u00e9. But whatever subjects he chooses, his dramas are always formed on the Grecian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODEL\">model</a>, and breathe a freedom and independence worthy an Athenian poet. Indeed, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGIS\">Agis</a> and Bruto may rather be considered oratorical declamations and dialogues on liberty than tragedies. The unities of time and place are not so scrupu-\npulously observed in his, as in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> dramas; but he has rigidly adhered to a unity of action and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>. He occupies his scene with one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> action, and one ruling passion, and removes from it every necessary event or feeling. In this excessive zeal for the observance of unity, he seems to have forgotten, that its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARM\">charm</a> consists in producing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> relation between multiplied feelings; and not in the bare <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXHIBITION\">exhibition</a> of one, divested of those various accompaniments which give <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a> to the whole.\n\nConsistently with that austere and simple manner which he considered the chief excellence of dramatic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>, he excluded from his scene all coups de th\u00e9\u00e2tre, all philosophical reflections, and that highly ornamented versification, which had been so assiduously cultivated by his predecessors. In his anxiety, however, to avoid all superfluous ornament, he has stripped his dramas of the embellishments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>; and for the harmony and flow of poetical language, he has substituted, even in his best performances, a style, which, though correct and pure, is generally harsh, elaborate, and abrupt\u2014often strained into unnatural energy, or condensed into factitious conciseness. The chief excellence of Alferi consists in powerful delineation of dramatic character. In his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a> II. he has represented, almost with the masterly touches of Tacitus, the sombre character, the dark mysterious counsels, the suspensa semper et obscura verba of the modern Tiberius. In Polinice the characters of the rival brothers are beautifully contrasted; in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARIA\">Maria</a> Stuarda, that unfortunate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> is represented unsuspicious, impatient of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a>, and violent in her attachments. In Mirraha, the character of Cynaras is perfect as a father and king, and Cenchris is a model of the virtues of a wife and mother. In the representation of that species of mental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALIENATION\">alienation</a> where the judgment has perished, but traces of character still remain, he is peculiarly happy. The insanity of Saul is skilfully managed; and the horrid joy of Orestes in killing Egishus rises finely and naturally to madness, in finding that, at the same time, he had inadvertently slain his mother.\n\nWhatever may be the merits or defects of Alferi, he may be considered as the founder of a new school in the Italian drama. His country hailed him as her sole tragic poet, and his successors in the same path of literature have regarded his bold, austere, and rapid manner, as the genuine model of tragic composition.\n\nBesides his tragedies, Alferi published during his life many sonnets, five odes on American independence, and the poem of Etruria, founded on the assassination of Alexander I. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">Duke</a> of Florence. Of his prose works, the most distinguished for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANIMATION\">animation</a> and eloquence is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PANEGYRIC\">Panegyric</a> on Trajan, composed in a transport of indignation at the supposed feebleness of Pliny's eulogium. The two books, entitled La Tirannide and the Essays on Literature and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">Government</a>, are remarkable for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEGANCE\">elegance</a> and vigour of style, but are too evidently imitations of the manner of Machiavel. His Antigallicus, which was written at the same time with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">Defence</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> XVI., comprehends a historical and satirical view of the French revolution. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POSTHUMOUS\">posthumous</a> works of Al-\n\nfieri consist of satires, six <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> comedies, and the Memoirs of his Life\u2014a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> always be read with interest, in spite of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> and languid gravity with which he delineates the most interesting adventures and the strongest passions of his agitated life.

There was another author of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a>, who translated the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALMAGEST\">Almagest</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMY\">Ptolemy</a>; but that writer lived during the reign of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CALIPH\">Caliph</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALMAMON\">Almamon</a>. In some accounts of Alhazen, we find it said, that he lived in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>; but it appears from Casiri, (Bibl. Arabico-Hispana Escurialensis), that, after he left his native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a> was his place of residence. It also appears, that he was invited to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> by one of the Fatemite Caliphs; and that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> was, some boasts which he had made of being able to obviate the evils attendant upon the overflowing, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as the decrease of the waters of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NILE\">Nile</a>. He surveyed the country with a view to this project, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-AID\">aid</a> which, every thing that he asked was liberally furnished by the Caliph; but finding that his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> had seduced him into a wild and impracticable scheme, he feigned madness, thereby to avoid the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> which he dreaded; and he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to play this humiliating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> till the Caliph's death relieved him from his apprehensions.\n\nBut whatever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> he may have made as a projector, there can be no doubt that he was a skilful geometrician; and that his name deserves a conspicuous place among the improvers of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPTICS\">optics</a>. He was not a mere compiler from the ancients, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> commentator upon their works; he followed the bent of his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a>; and, striking into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> path of experiment and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>, his inquiries were productive of a real accession to the stock of knowledge, in regard to some of the most interesting phenomena of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>. He refuted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> philosophers, that vision was produced by rays emitted from the eye.

He was the first who applied the laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-REFRACTION\">refraction</a>, to show how the heavenly bodies are sometimes seen as if above the horizon when still below it; and who, in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>, explained the cause of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> and evening <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TWILIGHT\">twilight</a>\u2014of that beneficent provision of nature, by which the glories of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> are made gradually to approach, and gradually to withdraw.

At a very early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> he showed such marks of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> as attracted the notice of some gentlemen living in the neighbourhood. In a remote <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, and deprived of the ordinary means of indulging his propensity to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a>, he took himself, when a boy, to such implements and materials as he could readily procure; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> skill and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> which, in particular, he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> in using his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a>, have been mentioned as remarkable for his years. Mr Stewart, then Collector of the Customs at Alloa, having mentioned these proofs of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a> to Mr Fowlis the Painter, who sometime before had instituted an Academy in Glasgow, for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a> and engraving, invited young Allan to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> under his care. Here he remained about seven years, studying the elementary principles of his art; and by the proficiency which he attained, justified the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of his talents, which had procured him admission to that ill-fated seminary. But, although, the public taste for the fine arts, which then existed in Scotland, was so feeble as to leave his preceptor without that support which his liberal and spirited efforts justly claimed, Allan, on leaving the academy, had the good fortune to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRONAGE\">patronage</a> of individuals, whose generosity enabled him to prosecute his views, and to improve his taste, by studying the works of art abroad. At the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> expense of several persons of fortune, particularly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Cathcart and Mr Abercrombie of Tullibody, he was enabled to go to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>; and at Rome he devoted himself with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> zeal to his profession. Here he remained for no less a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> than sixteen years, during which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, his subsistence chiefly depended on the copies which he made from the most celebrated pictures of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> masters; but one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> which he then painted, does the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> to his talents, namely, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> representing the Origin of Painting. On this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a>, indeed, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> of Mr Allan, as a historical painter, chiefly rests; and its merit was rewarded, by his receiving the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> medal given by the Academy of St Luke, in the year 1773, for the best specimen of historical composition. There is an excellent engraving of this piece by Cunego.\n\nOn his return to his native country, he took up his residence in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, where he was appointed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of the Academy established by the Trustees for Manufactures in Scotland. There he executed a great variety of works, of various degrees of merit; but perhaps none such as might have been expected from the author of the Origin of Painting. Those, indeed, by which he is most known, are of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> altogether different, being remarkable for the comic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a> which they display. The Scotch wedding; the Highland dance; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REPENTANCE\">Repentance</a>-stool, with his Illustrations of the Gentle Shepherd, are all of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a>, and so generally known, as to need no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>. Four pictures representing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARNIVAL\">Carnival</a>, are said to have been very successful.

With the talent of artfully arranging the various parts of a crowded and bustling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a>,\u2014such as appears in some of his comic productions, he possessed that feeling for simplicity, which gives to his graver compositions, a classical and antique <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEGANCE\">elegance</a>. In his drawing he often was hasty and incorrect. He executed a great variety of etchings and drawings in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, which are valuable, on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of their excellent humour; and the great knowledge of national character which they express. Many of the original plates and drawings are now in the possession of Mr George Thomson, to whose kindness and friendship their author was much indebted. We do not know that Allan left any pupil who has followed his particular line in painting. Mr H. W. Williams received from him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> of art, but his genius has directed him to a different course, which has conducted him to merited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMINENCE\">eminence</a> as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANDSCAPE\">landscape</a> painter.\n\nMr Allan is remembered and spoken of as an excellent private character.

The same fact was afterwards pointed out by Gay-Lussac.\n\nAlum is one of those substances which chemists have distinguished by the name of triple salts. It is composed of sulphuric acid, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POTASH\">potash</a>, alumina and water. That it contained sulphuric acid as a constituent, was known even to the Alchemists. Pott and Margraaf demonstrated, that alumina was another constituent. Mr Pott, in his Lithogeognosia, showed\nthat the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> of alum, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> the precipitate obtained when an alkali is poured into a solution of alum, is quite different from lime and chalk, with which it had been confounded by Stahl. Margraaf went much farther. He not only showed that alumina is one of the constituents of alum; but that this earth possesses peculiar properties, is different from every other substance, and is one of the ingredients in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> clay. (Experiences faites sur la terre d'alun. Margraaf's Opusc. II. 111.) Margraaf showed likewise, by many experiments, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CRYSTALS\">crystals</a> of alum cannot be obtained by dissolving alumina in sulphuric acid, and evaporating the solutions. The crystals formed are always soft, and quite different in their appearance from alum crystals. But, when a solution of potash or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol2.html#article-AMMONIA\">ammonia</a> is dropped into this liquid, it immediately deposits <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> crystals of alum. (Sur la <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGENERATION\">regeneration</a> de l'alun. Margraaf's Opusc. II. 86.) He mentions likewise, that manufacturers of alum, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a>, were unable to procure the salt without a similar addition; and that at first, it had been customary to add a quantity of putrid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-URINE\">urine</a>, and that afterwards a solution of carbonate of potash was substituted in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>. But subsequent chemists do not seem to have paid much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to these important observations of Margraaf; they still continued, without any rigid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>, to consider alum as a sulphate of alumina.\n\nBergman indeed had observed, that the addition of potash or ammonia made the alum crystallize; but that the same effect was not produced by the addition of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SODA\">soda</a> or of lime, (De confectione aluminis. Bergman's Opusc. I. 225.) He had observed likewise, that sulphate of potash is frequently found in alum. He decomposed the solution of alum by means of ammonia, evaporated the filtered liquid to dryness, and exposed the residue to a red heat. A quantity of sulphate of potash often remained behind in the crucible, (Ibid. p. 326.) He drew, as a conclusion from these facts, that sulphate of potash readily combines with sulphate of alumina. Yet, it is obvious from the whole of his dissertation, that he had no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> that alum is a triple salt. He ascribed the difficulty of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CRYSTALLIZATION\">crystallization</a>, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a> of sulphuric acid present. He thought that the only use of the potash was to saturate this excess; and advises manufacturers to substitute clay instead of potash, as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> which would not only saturate the excess of acid, but increase the quantity of alum. This very bad advice was not, we presume, followed by any alum makers. If they tried it, they would soon be convinced of its injurious consequences. Instead of alum, they would have obtained an insoluble tasteless powder, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> known by the name of alum saturated with its earth.\n\nAfter Klaproth had discovered the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> of potash as an ingredient in leucite and lepidolite, it occurred to Vauquelin, that it was probably an ingredient likewise in many other minerals. He collected that alum crystals often make their appearance during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a> of stony bodies; and, considering that alum cannot be obtained in crystals without the addition of potash, he began to suspect that this alkali constituted an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> ingredient in the salt. A set of experiments undertaken <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> purpose to elucidate this important point, soon satisfied him that his conjecture was well founded. Accordingly, in the year 1797, he published a dissertation, demonstrating that alum is a triple salt, composed of sulphuric acid, alumina and potash. (Annales de Chimie, XXII. 258.) Soon after, Chaptal published the analysis of four different kinds of alum, namely, Roman alum, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEVANT\">Levant</a> alum, British alum, and alum manufactured by himself. This analysis led to the same result as that of Vauquelin. (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol3.html#article-ANN\">Ann</a>. de Chim. XXII. 280.)\n\nSince that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, alum has been admitted by chemists to be a triple salt; and various analyses of it have been made to determine its constituents. Vauquelin, (Ann. de Chim. I. 167), Thenard and Roard, (Ibid. Tom. LIX. 72), Curandou, (Journal de Physique, LXVII. 1.) and Berzelius, (Ann. de Chim. LXXXII. 258.) successively published the results of their experiments. They differ but little from each other. We shall therefore satisfy ourselves with giving the analysis of Berzelius, which is the latest, and in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> the most accurate. His result was as follows:\n\n| Substance          | Weight |\n|--------------------|--------|\n| Sulphuric acid     | 34.23  |\n| Alumina            | 10.86  |\n| Potash             | 9.81   |\n| Water              | 45.00  |\n| Loss               | 0.10   |\n| **Total**          | **100.00** |\n\nOr\n\n| Substance          | Weight |\n|--------------------|--------|\n| Sulphate of alumina| 36.85  |\n| Sulphate of potash | 18.15  |\n| Water              | 45.00  |\n| **Total**          | **100.00** |\n\nNow, as we shall show in a subsequent article, (See Atomic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>), an integrant particle of sulphuric acid weighs 5, an integrant particle of alumina 2.136, and an integrant particle of potash 6. We shall show likewise in the same article, that sulphate of potash is composed of one integrant particle of sulphuric acid, united with one integrant particle of potash; and sulphate of alumina of one integrant particle of sulphuric acid, united to one integrant particle of alumina; therefore, the relative weight of an integrant particle of each of these salts, is as follows:\n\n| Substance          | Weight |\n|--------------------|--------|\n| Sulphate of potash | 11.000 |\n| Sulphate of alumina| 7.136  |\n\nBut the quantities of each of these salts in alum, according to the preceding analysis, are as the numbers 18.15 : 36.85. Now, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a> 18.15 : 36.85, is very nearly the same as 11 : 7.136 \u00d7 5. Hence it follows, that alum contains 1 integrant particle of sulphate of potash, and 5 integrant particles of sulphate of alumina. An integrant particle of water, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be shown likewise in the article Atomic philosophy, weighs 1.132. Now, one integrant particle of sulphate of potash, \u00d7 5 integrant particles of sulphate of alumina, weigh 46.680. But alum con-\ntains 45 per cent. of water. To find how many integrant particles of water these amount to, we have this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a>; \\( \\frac{56}{45} : \\frac{46,680}{38,213} \\). Now, 38,213, is very nearly the weight of 34 integrant particles of water. For \\( 1.132 \\times 34 = 38,488 \\).\n\nHence, it follows, that alum is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> of\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Sulphate of potash} & - 1 \\text{ integrant particle.} \\\\\n\\text{Sulphate of alumina} & - 5 \\\\\n\\text{Water} & - 34 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTotal 40\n\nMaking altogether no fewer than 40 integrant particles united together. It is not easy to see how these 40 particles, by their symmetrical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNION\">union</a> with each other, can form a tetrahedron, which Haury conceives to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIMITIVE\">primitive</a> form of the integrant particle of alum. The octahedron is a much more probable primitive form. It might be conceived to be formed by the six integrant particles of sulphate of potash, and sulphate of alumina, and the thirty four particles of water, which are probably much smaller, may fill up the intervals between them. The objection to this supposition is, that in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> the atom of sulphate of potash cannot be surrounded by the atoms of sulphate of alumina, as one would naturally expect, from their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> for each other. The most probable supposition of the arrangement of the integrant particles of alum is, that the atom of sulphate of potash occupies the centre; that it is surrounded at equal distances by the five atoms of sulphate of alumina, each surrounded by seven atoms of water. But, we do not readily see how such an arrangement would either form a tetrahedron or octahedron. This symmetrical arrangement of the different integrant particles that compose a crystal deserves to be studied with care, because it is probable, that it will throw <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of affinity, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> in which atoms combine together.\n\nThe word alumen, which we translate alum, occurs in Pliny's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">Natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a>. In the 15th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> of his 35th book, he gives us a detailed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of it. By comparing this with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of \u1f00\u03bb\u03cd\u03c4\u03c1\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 given by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIOSCORIDES\">Dioscorides</a> in the 123d chapter of his 5th book, it becomes quite obvious, that he alludes to the same substance. Hence it follows, that \u1f00\u03bb\u03cd\u03c4\u03c1\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 is the Greek name for alumen. Pliny informs us, that alumen was found naturally in the earth. He calls it salugatoriae. Different substances he informs us, were distinguished by the name of alumen; but they were all characterized by a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of astrin gency, and were all employed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DYEING\">dyeing</a> and in medicine. The light-coloured alumen was useful in brilliant dyes; the dark-coloured only in dyeing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>, or very dark colours. One <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of alumen was a liquid, which was apt to be adulterated; but, when pure, it had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of striking a black with the juice of the pomegranate. This property seems to characterize a solution of sulphate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> in water. It is quite obvious, that a solution of our alum would possess no such property. Pliny says, that there is another kind of alum which the Greeks <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CALL\">call</a> schistos. It forms in white threads upon the surface of certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>. From the name, schistos, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of formation, there can be little doubt, that this species was the salt which forms spontaneously on certain slaty minerals,\u2014as alum slate and bituminous shale, and which consists chiefly of sulphate of iron and sulphate of alumina. Possibly in certain places the sulphate of iron may have been nearly wanting; and then the salt would be white, and would answer, as Pliny says it did, for dyeing bright colours. Several other species of alumen are described by Pliny, but we are unable to make out to what minerals he alludes.\n\nThe alumen of the ancients, then, was not the same with the alum of the moderns. It was most commonly a sulphate of iron, sometimes probably a sulphate of alumina, and usually a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> of the two. But the ancients were unacquainted with our alum. They were acquainted with sulphate of iron in a crystallized state, and distinguished it by the names of misty, sory, chalcanthum, (Plini, xxxiv. 12.) As alum or green <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VITRIOL\">vitriol</a> were applied to a variety of purposes in common, and as both are distinguished by a sweetish and astringent taste, writers, even after the discovery of alum, do not seem to have discriminated the two salts accurately from each other. In the writings of the Alchemists we find the words misty, sory, chalcanthum, applied to the alum as well as sulphate of iron, and the name atramentum sutorium, which ought to belong (one would suppose) exclusively to green vitriol, applied indifferently to both.\n\nWhen our alum was discovered is entirely unknown. Beckman devoted a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of time to trace the history of this salt, and published a curious dissertation on the subject. But his attempts to trace its origin were unsuccessful. The manufacture of it was discovered in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EAST\">East</a>; but at what time or place is totally unknown. It would appear, that about four or five hundred years ago, there was a manufactory of it at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol8.html#article-EDESSA\">Edessa</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYRIA\">Syria</a>, at that time called Rocca. Hence, it is supposed, the origin of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> Rock alum, commonly employed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>; though there are others that pretend that the term originated at Civita Vecchia, where alum is made from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> mineral in the state of a hard rock.\n\nDifferent alum works existed in the neighbourhood of Constantinople. About the time of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> of the Grecian empire, the art of making alum was transported into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, at that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> the richest and most manufacturing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> in Europe. Bartholomew Pernix, a Genoese merchant, discovered alum ore in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISCHIA\">Ischia</a>, about the year 1459. Nearly at the same time, John di Castro, who was well acquainted with the alum works in the neighbourhood of Constantinople, suspected that a mineral fit for yielding alum existed at Tolfa, because it was covered with the same trees that grew on the alum mineral near Constantinople. His conjecture was verified by trials, and the celebrated manufactory at Tolfa established. Another was begun in the neighbourhood of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENOA\">Genoa</a>, and the manufactory flourished in different parts of Italy. To this country, it was confined for the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>. Various manufactories of it were established in Germany, by the year 1544. In the time of Agricola, there was a manufactory of it at Commoton in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOHEMIA\">Bohemia</a>. About the same time,\nan alum <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> was established near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARTHAGENA\">Carthagena</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, at Alcmaron.\n\nEngland possessed no alum works till the reign of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol6.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> I. Thomas Chaloner, Esq., son of Dr Chaloner, who had been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TUTOR\">tutor</a> to Charles, while hunting on a common in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-YORKSHIRE\">Yorkshire</a>, took notice of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERBAGE\">herbage</a>, and tasted the water. He found them similar to what he had seen in Germany, where alum works were established. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of this, he got a patent from Charles for an alum work. This manufactory was worth two thousand a-year, or perhaps more. But some of the Courtiers thinking this too much for him; prevailed with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">King</a>, notwithstanding the patent, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> a moiety of it to another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a>. This was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> why Mr Chaloner was such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARTISAN\">partisan</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a>, and such an enemy of the King, that, at the end of the civil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, he was one of those who sat in judgment upon his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJESTY\">Majesty</a> and condemned him.* Since that time, various alum works have been established in different parts of England and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a>. But none at present exist, except the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITBY\">Whitby</a> works, originally established by Mr Chaloner, and two works at the Hurlet and Campsie, both in the neighbourhood of Glasgow.\n\nSeveral alum works likewise exist in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a>, particularly in West Gothland. There is one for example at Hanseter, near the borders of the Wene lake, on the west side of the mountain called Kinnekulle. But, for a description of the Swedish works, we refer to Bergman's Opuscula, Vol. I. p. 284, or the English translation, Vol. I. p. 342. We do not know if any alum works exist in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLAND\">Poland</a> or Russia; but, as the greatest part of these extensive countries consists of alluvial soil to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> depth, it is probable, that little alum ore will be found in them.\n\nVarious minerals are employed in the manufacture of alum; but by far the most important of them are the following three: alum <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, alum slate, bituminous shale.\n\nAlum stone is the mineral which occurs at Tolfa, near Rome, from which the celebrated Roman alum is made. Werner also possesses specimens of the same mineral from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-HUNGARY\">Hungary</a>. At Tolfa, it is said to constitute a hill. Its colour is greyish white, sometimes yellowish grey, and sometimes, as Gay Lussac informs us (Ann. de Chim. LV. 267.) reddish from the peroxide of iron. It is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASSIVE\">massive</a> and rather hard. It has no lustre. It is translucent on the edges. Fractures uneven, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a> to the fine earthy. Fragments blunt edged. Does not adhere to the tongue. It is rather heavy; but its specific gravity is not accurately known. This mineral, according to the analysis of Klaproth (Gehlen's Neue Allgemeine Journal der Chemie, VI. 35.) is composed of the following constituents:\n\n| Silica | 56.5 |\n|--------|------|\n| Alumina| 19.0 |\n| Sulphuric Acid | 16.5 |\n| Potash | 4.0 |\n\nVauquelin likewise analyzed this mineral, and found the same constituents, though in different proportions. We have no analysis of the varieties of alum stone which contain peroxide of iron. Thus it appears, that alum stone contains all the ingredients of alum ready formed.\n\nAlum slate is a much more abundant mineral than alum stone. It is said to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> with primitive clay slate. It occurs abundantly along with transition slate; and there can be little doubt that it occurs likewise in the flint formations. In West Gothland in Sweden, it constitutes a part of different hills; as Kinnekulle, Hunneberg, and Halleberg; in all of which it appears to alternate with flint trap rocks. It occurs likewise abundantly in Whitby in Yorkshire. We have never ourselves been upon the spot; but, from the general structure of Yorkshire, and the neighbouring counties, indeed of the whole east <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of England, there can be very little doubt that, in this position, it is also a flint rock.\n\nAlum slate, as the name implies, is a slaty rock, though sometimes it occurs in balls. The colour is blueish-black, with a strong shade of grey. Fracture straight slaty. Fragments tabular. Its internal lustre is glimmering. It retains its colour in the streak; but acquires more lustre. Soft. Not particularly brittle. When exposed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a> it effloresces, and acquires an aluminous taste.\n\nThis mineral has never been accurately analyzed. But there can be no doubt that it contains silica, alumina, iron, sulphur, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CHARCOAL\">charcoal</a>, and often likewise potash. Probably this was the mineral upon which the alum scissile of the ancients was found.\n\nBituminous shale, the brandschiefer of the Germans, is a slaty mineral, which almost constantly accompanies beds of coal; and, accordingly, is very common in Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>. Its colour is brownish-black. Its fracture is thin slaty. Fragments tabular. Internal lustre glimmering; but the colour is not altered. Very soft. Rather sectile. Feels rather greasy. Easily frangible. When heated, it burns with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> and sulphureous odour, and becomes white. It has never been accurately analyzed; but it is probably nothing more than slate clay, which occurs so abundantly in the independent coal formation, impregnated with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of coal. Its other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> constituents must be silica, alumina, and iron <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYRITES\">pyrites</a>.\n\nSlate clay itself, at least not sufficiently impregnated with coaly matter to deserve the name of bituminous shale, is frequently employed in the making of alum. This is the case in the neighbourhood of Glasgow.\n\nFour different processes are employed by the alum manufacturers, according to the nature of the mineral from which the alum is to be extracted.\n\n---\n\n* Letters written by Eminent Persons, in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries; and Lives of Eminent Men, by John Aubrey, Esq.; Vol. II. p. 281.\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> employed at Tofia is the simplest of all. If the Tofia stone be kept constantly moistened with water for about two months, it falls to powder of itself, and yields alum by elixivation. But this is not the process employed by the manufacturers. The alum stone is broken into small pieces, and piled on the top of a perforated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOME\">dome</a>, in which a wood fire is kindled. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a> and flame of the wood penetrate through the pieces of alum stone, and a sulphurous odour is disengaged, owing to the decomposition of a portion of the sulphuric acid in the stone. This roasting is twice repeated; the pieces of ore which, the first time, were at the edge of the dome, being the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> time put in the middle. The process of roasting this stone requires considerable attention. If the heat be too great, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of yielding alum is destroyed. If the heat be too small, the stone does not readily fall to powder. There can be little doubt that the unroasted stone would yield more alum than the roasted; but probably the additional labour requisite in the latter case would more than swallow up the increase of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRODUCT\">product</a>.\n\nThe roasted stone, which has now acquired a reddish colour, is placed in rows between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRENCHES\">trenches</a> filled with water. This liquid is so frequently sprinkled on it, that the stone is always moist. In two or three days it falls to powder, like slackened quicklime; but the daily watering is continued for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>. The success of this part of the operation is said to depend very much on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>. When the weather is rainy, the alum is all washed out, and little or nothing left for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANUFACTURER\">manufacturer</a> to extract. In such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, it is obvious that the alum stone should be covered by a shade from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a>.\n\nWhen the stone has by this process been reduced to a sufficiently fine powder, it is thrown into a leaden boiler, filled two-thirds with water. During the boiling, the powder is frequently stirred up, and the water that evaporates is replaced. When the boiling has been continued for a sufficient time, the fire is withdrawn, and time allowed for the earthy matter to subside to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a>. A cock is then opened, which allows the clear liquor to flow out into deep wooden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> vessels, so made that they can be easily taken to pieces. Here the alum gradually crystallizes, and attaches itself to the sides and bottom of the vessel. The mother liquor is now drawn off into shallower wooden troughs, where more alum crystals are deposited. The liquid has now a red colour, and is muddy; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> alum crystals are mixed with this red matter. They are washed clean in the mother liquor, which is finally pumped into a trough, and used in subsequent processes.\n\nThe alum obtained at Tofia is the purest of all. It is known by the name of Roman alum, and is in very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> estimation. It is always mixed with a little reddish powdery matter, which is easily separated from it. What this red matter is, has not been ascertained; but it is not peroxide of iron. To the eye it has very much the appearance of a vegetable matter. We have some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> that it is added artificially by the sellers of Roman alum. Probably Roman alum at first had a red tinge, in consequence of the red matter in the mother liquor remaining partially attached to it. The goodness of the alum may have given the purchasers a partiality to the red colour, and induced the sellers to add a red powder artificially. We have never had an opportunity ourselves of examining this matter; but have been informed by those that have, that it contains no iron.\n\nIt is not improbable that this process would be improved by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRINDING\">grinding</a> the Tofia stone to a fine powder in a mill, without any previous roasting, and then keeping the powder moistened with water for a considerable time. If the residual earth, after the alum is extracted, be boiled with sulphuric acid, the liquid yields alum crystals by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a>. This is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a> that neither the alumina nor the potash is exhausted, and that the sulphuric acid, driven off by the roasting, is so much alum lost to the manufacturer. Indeed, the quantity of sulphuric acid in the alum stone is not sufficient to occupy the whole of the potash in the formation of alum. It would be necessary to add about one-tenth of the weight of the alum stone of sulphuric acid, if it were wanted to employ the whole potash present in the stone. The consequence of this addition (supposing no loss) would be an additional quantity of alum, amounting to rather more than one-fifth of the weight of the alum stone employed.\n\nAlum slate being very different in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>, requires a different treatment to fit it for yielding alum. If the alum slate contain a notable quantity of lime or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNESIA\">magnesia</a>, it does not answer the purposes of the manufacturer so well. Indeed, the proportion of lime present may be conceived to be such, that no alum would be obtained whatever. As alum slate has never been subjected to accurate analysis, we do not know in what proportion these two earths exist in it, or whether they may not, in many cases, be absent altogether. The essential ingredients in alum slate for the alum-makers are alumina and iron pyrites.\n\nThe first process is to roast the ore. In Sweden, where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol10.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a> is wood, and consequently expensive, it is customary to use the alum slate itself as fuel for roasting the ore. For this purpose, a small layer of brushwood is covered with pieces of alum slate, and set on fire; and, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMBUSTION\">combustion</a> proceeds, new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAYERS\">layers</a> of alum slate are added. It is usual to place alternate layers of roasted and unroasted alum slate. The combustion continues for a month or six weeks. At Whitby, coal is employed for roasting the alum slate. Indeed, the alum slate of Whitby is lighter coloured than that of Sweden, and probably would not burn of itself. So great is the quantity of combustible matter in the Swedish alum slate, that it is employed as fuel for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> limestone. Great quantities of limestone are burnt in this manner at Humeberg, near the south side of the lake Wener. The roasted ore has usually a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> colour. When it is red, the quantity of alum which it yields is considerably diminished.\n\nBy this roasting the pyrites is decomposed. The sulphur is converted into sulphuric acid, while the iron is oxidized. In what manner this change is produced it is not easy to say. Indeed, it does not seem certain that pyrites is a constant ingredient in alum slate. We have never been able to detect any, by the eye, in any specimens of Whitby alum slate which we have examined. At Hansacter in Sweden, no sulphate of iron crystallizes when the liquid is\nevaporated; yet, if pyrites had been present, it is difficult to see any reason that should prevent this salt from being formed. Hence it is probable, that, in alum slate, the sulphur is sometimes at least combined with other substances than iron. It must always be in a state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a>; for, if it were in a loose state, it would be driven off by the roasting. This point deserves to be elucidated, by analyzing different varieties of alum slate.\n\nThe roasted ore has an astringent taste, owing to the sulphate of iron and sulphate of alumina which it contains. The next process is to lixiviate it with water, in order to dissolve out these salts. For this purpose, it is put into reservoirs made of wood or masonry; with a stop-cock at the bottom to draw off the water. The usual method is to keep the water for twelve <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a> in contact with ore that has been twice lixiviated; then to draw it off, and allow it to remain for an equal period on ore that has been once lixiviated. Lastly, it is run upon fresh ore, and allowed to remain on it for twelve hours longer. If the specific gravity of the liquid thus treated be 1.25, at the temperature of 55\u00b0, it may be considered as saturated with sulphate of alumina and sulphate of iron. But we presume that this specific gravity is not often obtained.\n\nThe liquid, thus impregnated with salt, is now boiled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> in leaden vessels to the proper consistency for crystallization. In Sweden, the fuel employed for this purpose is alum slate. By this means, a double effect is produced. The liquid is evaporated, and the alum slate is roasted. During the boiling, abundance of oxide of iron falls mixed with gelinite, if lime be one of the constituents of the alum slate. When the liquid is sufficiently concentrated, it is let into a square reservoir, in order to crystallize. Great quantities of sulphate of iron crystals are usually deposited in this vessel. These are collected by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> the liquid off into another reservoir. When all the sulphate of iron that can be obtained has been separated, a quantity of sulphate of potash, muriate of potash, or putrid urine, is mixed with the liquid. The sulphate of potash is procured from the sulphuric acid-makers, and the muriate of potash from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOAP\">soap</a>-makers. By this addition, alum is formed in the liquid, and it gradually deposits itself in crystals on the sides of the vessel. These crystals are collected, and dissolved in the smallest quantity of boiling water that will take them up. This solution is poured into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> wooden casks. In a fortnight or three weeks the alum crystallizes, and covers the sides and bottom of the cask. The hoops are now taken off, and the staves of the cask removed. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of alum crystals, having the shape of the cask, remains. This mass is pierced, the mother liquor allowed to run out, and preserved for a subsequent process. The alum, being now broken in pieces, is fit for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a>.\n\nThe manufacture of alum from bituminous shale, and slate clay, bears a considerable resemblance to the manufacture from alum slate; but differs in several particulars. There are two works of this kind in the neighbourhood of Glasgow, managed with great skill, and excellent in every respect. We shall give a sketch of the processes followed in these works.\n\nThe bituminous shale and slate clay employed, are obtained from old coal pits, which are very extensive in the neighbourhood of Glasgow. The air in these coal-pits is moist, and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> temperature about 62\u00b0. The shale, having been exposed for many years, has gradually opened in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of its slaty fracture, so as to resemble in some respects a half-shut <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAN\">fan</a>, and all the chunks in it are filled with a saline <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EFFLORESCENCE\">efflorescence</a> in threads. This salt is white, with a shade of green; has a sweetish astringent taste, and consists of a mixture of sulphate of iron and sulphate of alumina. Nothing more is requisite than to lixiviate this shale with water, in order to obtain these salts in a state of solution. The lixiviated ore being left exposed to the weather, forms more salt, which is gradually washed out of it by the rain water, and this water is collected and preserved for use.\n\nThe next step in the process, is to boil down the liquid to a sufficient state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCENTRATION\">concentration</a>. At Campsie, all these boilers are composed of stone, and the heat applied by means of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEAM\">steam</a>. This is a great saving, as leaden vessels are not only much more expensive, but require more frequent renewal. When the liquid is raised to a sufficiently high temperature in the stone reservoir, pounded sulphate of potash, or muriate of potash, as they can be procured, is mixed with it, and there is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGITATOR\">agitator</a> in the vessel by which it is continually stirred about. This addition converts the sulphate of alumina into alum. The liquid is now let into another trough, and allowed to remain till it crystallizes. There are two salts contained in solution in this liquid, namely, sulphate of iron and alum; and it is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of great consequence to separate them completely from each other. The principal secret consists in drawing off the mother liquor at the proper time; for the alum is much less soluble in water than the sulphate of iron, and therefore crystallizes first. The first crystals of alum formed, are very impure. They have a yellow colour, and seem to be partly impregnated with sulphate of iron. They are dissolved in hot water, and the solution poured into troughs, and allowed to crystallize a second time. These second crystals, though much purer, are not quite free from sulphate of iron; but the separation is accomplished by washing them repeatedly with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> water; for sulphate of iron is much more soluble in that liquid than alum. These second crystals are now dissolved in as small a quantity of hot water as possible, and the concentrated liquid poured while hot into large casks, the surface of which is covered with two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> beams. As the liquor cools, a vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of alum crystals form on the sides and surface. The casks are allowed to remain, till the liquid within is supposed to be nearly of the temperature of the atmosphere. This, in winter, requires eleven days; in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, fourteen or more. We have seen the liquid in a cask that had stood eleven days in summer, still more than blood-hot. The hoops are then removed, precisely as in the manufacture of alum from alum slate.\n\nThere always remains in the boilers a yellowish substance, consisting chiefly of peroxide of iron. This is exposed to a strong heat in a reverberatory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FURNACE\">furnace</a>, and it becomes red. In this state it is washed, and yields more alum. The red residue is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>\nto a fine powder and dried. It then answers all the purposes of Venetian red, as a pigment. By altering the temperature to which this matter is exposed, a yellow ochre is obtained instead of a red.\n\nIn France, where alum ores are by no means abundant, alum is manufactured from clay. This method of making the salt, was first put in practice by Chaptal, when Professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">chemistry</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONTPELLIER\">Montpellier</a>. His methods have been since gradually improved, and brought to a state of considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a>. The first process tried was this: the clay was reduced to a fine powder in a mill, and then mixed with sulphuric acid. After remaining some days, it was exposed for twenty-four hours to a temperature of about 130\u00b0. It was then lixiviated, and the liquid mixed with urine or potash. This method being found inconvenient, was abandoned for the following: the clay being well ground, was mixed with half its weight of the saline residue, from a mixture of sulphur and nitre. This residue is little else than sulphate of potash. The mixture was formed into balls about five inches in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a>, which were calcined in a potter's furnace. They were then placed on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a> of a chamber, in which sulphuric acid was made. The acid vapour caused them to swell, and to open on all sides. In about a month, they were sufficiently penetrated with the acid. They were then exposed to the air, under shades, that the saturation might become more complete. Finally, they were lixiviated, and the liquid being evaporated, yielded pure alum.\n\nThis process has been considerably improved by Berard, the present proprietor of the Montpellier alum work. Instead of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> the calcined balls to the fumes of sulphuric acid, he sprinkles them with a quantity of sulphuric acid of the specific gravity 1.367, equal to the weight of the clay employed. But it is obvious, that the proportion must vary with the nature of the clay. The solution takes place with the greatest facility, and crystals of alum are obtained by evaporating the liquid.\n\nAnother process was put in practice by Chaptal in the neighbourhood of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, and is still followed, or was at least followed some years ago by M. Bouvier. A mixture is made of 100 parts of clay, 50 parts of nitro, and 50 parts of sulphuric acid of the specific gravity 1.367; and this mixture is put into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RETORT\">retort</a>, and distilled. Aquafortis comes over, and the residue in the retort being lixiviated with water, yields abundance of excellent alum.\n\nWe may mention another process described by Caraudan, and certainly practicable, and even easy, though we do not believe that it would be attended with profit. He forms 100 parts of clay into a paste with water, holding 5 parts of common salt in solution. This paste is formed into cakes, and calcined in a reverberatory furnace. The calcined mass is reduced to powder, and well mixed with the fourth part of its weight of concentrated sulphuric acid. When the muriatic acid vapours are dissipated, as much water is added as there had been employed of acid, and the mass is kneaded with care. A strong heat is produced; the composition swells; more water is added; and at last a solution of potash, in which the alkali amounts to one fourth of the acid employed. The liquor is now drawn off, and, on cooling, it yields a copious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEPOSIT\">deposit</a> of alum crystals.\n\nIn the preceding sketch of the manufacture of alum, no notice has been taken of alum earth as an alum ore, because the writer of this article has never had an opportunity of seeing any manufactory of the salt from this material. We conceive the process to be nearly the same as that followed, when bituminous shale or slate clay is the alum ore. Alum earth seems to be a vegetable substance, or rather to be derived from the vegetable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>. It is connected with coal, and may, without impropriety, be considered as a variety of brown coal. There is a manufacture of alum from this substance at Frienwalde, in Germany. Klaproth subjected this variety of alum earth to analysis, and from 1000 parts of it obtained the following constituents:\n\n| Substance          | Percentage |\n|--------------------|------------|\n| Sulphur            | 28.5       |\n| Charcoal           | 196.5      |\n| Alumina            | 160.0      |\n| Silica             | 400.0      |\n| Black oxide of iron| 64.0       |\n| Sulphate of iron   | 18.0       |\n| Gypsum             | 15.0       |\n| Magnesia           | 5.0        |\n| Sulphate of potash | 15.0       |\n| Muriate of potash  | 5.0        |\n| Water              | 107.5      |\n\nThe excess of one and a half per cent. obviously proceeded from the water adhering to the salts. (J.)\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBOYNA\">AMBOYNA</a>. The reader will find some interesting particulars regarding the history of this celebrated island in the body of the work. Its great importance, as the centre of the Clove-trade, renders it necessary that we should here enter into some further details. It is divided into two unequal parts, by two deep bays, which are separated only by a narrow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISTHMUS\">isthmus</a> of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> across. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BAY\">bay</a> on the west side extends to about two thirds of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> of the island, and forms a commodious and safe harbour. That on the east side is much smaller, and, as a harbour, very insecure, both on account of its bad anchorage, and of its rocky shores. The largest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> is called Hitoo, and the smallest division Leytimoor. Although the larger bay is more commodious for a settlement, it is in the Leytimoor division that the Europeans have chosen to fix their residence; and they have here erected their principal fortification of Victoria, which is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEXAGON\">hexagon</a>, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DITCH\">ditch</a> and covered way on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> side, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HORN\">horn</a>-work towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>. Being commanded however by two ranges of heights, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> of from 700 to 1200 yards, it could make no serious resistance against an invading force. \"The town of Amboyna is extremely clean, and both neatly and regularly built. The streets run at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a>, and the houses, on account of the frequency of earthquakes, are seldom above one storey high. From the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COVERT\">covert</a> way of the fort to the town, there is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESPLANADE\">esplanade</a> of nearly 250 yards, terminated by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANGE\">range</a> of handsome dwelling-houses, with a double row of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NUTMEG\">nutmeg</a>-trees.\"\nin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> of them. In these houses, the principal inhabitants reside. There are two well built churches in the towns established by the Dutch <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">Government</a>, one for the European, the other for the Malay <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>. All the other public buildings are in the fort, except the stadhouse, which fronts the esplanade, and is a neat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> of two stories.\" (Asiatic Annual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGISTER\">Register</a> for 1800.)\n\nAmboyna has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> been the seat of the supreme government of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPICE\">Spice</a> Islands; and, under its jurisdiction are comprehended ten other islands; namely Ceram, which is equal in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> to all the rest, Ceram Laut, Bouro, Amblaw, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANIPA\">Manipa</a>, Kelang, Bonoa, Harackau, Saporouna, and Noossa Laut. The cultivation of the nutmeg has been, for some years past, prohibited in Amboyna; the industry of its inhabitants being chiefly directed to the rearing of the clove-tree. It is only in Amboyna, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-THREE_ISLANDS\">three islands</a> of Harackau, Saporouna, and Noossa Laut, that cloves are now cultivated.\n\n\"The clove-tree grows to the height of about forty or fifty feet, its branches spread, and its leaves are long and pointed. In a favourable soil, it begins to bear at fifteen years' growth, is in perfection at twenty, and continues to bear, without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> decay, till the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of forty or fifty. Some trees yield thirty pounds of cloves; but the average quantity produced, does not amount to more than six pounds a tree. They grow to the greatest perfection in deep valleys, well sheltered by hills and woods, and in a soil of rich black mould, quite dry; though they require frequent rain for the greatest part of the year, and very hot weather at the gathering season; which commences generally about the latter end of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OCTOBER\">October</a>, or the beginning of November, and continues until February. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a> and May, there is an after-crop, but of a very inferior quality.\" (Asiatic Annual Register for 1800.)\n\nThe Dutch East <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">Company</a> appear to have been actuated by the same sordid, narrow, and oppressive views, which have, in a greater or less degree, characterized all the European governments established in the east. Cloves, the great article of produce throughout the island, are rigorously engrossed for the benefit of the Company. And for the convenience of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONOPOLY\">monopoly</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a>, and its dependencies, is divided into several districts, over which residents or governors are appointed, for the purpose of preventing all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRABAND\">contraband</a> trade, and to take care also, that the whole produce of the country is strictly delivered up, at a fixed price. The Governor has under his immediate management seven great, and twenty-four small districts; and the subordinate residents have committed to them from six to ten districts, with the exception of the resident of Saporouna, who has under his superintendence twenty-four districts. These districts are likewise called regencies; and the officers who govern them are distinguished by the names of Regents, Rajahs, Patties, and Orankaios. Several of these regencies are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a>, and are enjoyed by the lineal descendents of the Portuguese families who first settled in the island. All the others are appointed by the Governor, although, in this respect, he is obliged to regulate his choice by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> customs and prejudices of the people, whose reverence for the ties of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSANGUINITY\">consanguinity</a> carries them so far, as to induce them to keep a regular pedigree of their families, which is registered in the secretary's office, and on which the candidate for a vacant regency rests his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIMARY\">primary</a> claim. The regents are the vassals of the Company, who not only claim the sovereignty of the island, but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> property of the soil; the whole of the lands being in their immediate possession, except a few pieces of ground belonging to burghers and private persons, who, under the prohibition of cultivating the clove-tree, are permitted to alienate them. A similar claim has been advanced by the English East India Company to all the lands of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENGAL\">Bengal</a>. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> of these claims is exceedingly doubtful; for it is certain that, before the English or Dutch visited India, the soil was possessed; and the question is, how the new claimants came to have a better <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> proprietors? In Amboyna, however, though the Dutch Company claim a paramount right in the soil, they still so far acknowledge the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> of individuals to certain districts, that they do not attempt to deprive them of their property without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPENSATION\">compensation</a>; especially if their lands produce clove-trees, which, being considered the peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INHERITANCE\">inheritance</a> of the planters, are held to be inviolable.\n\nIt is only in the districts marked out by the state, that the cultivation of cloves is permitted; and the grounds which are appropriated for this purpose, are portioned out to the inhabitants. These grounds are called Daty-lands; a regular register of the produce of them is kept; the clove-trees are numbered once a-year; and their qualities particularly noted. The entire produce of these trees the people are bound, under pain of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, to deliver annually into the Company's stores. Where clove-trees flourish spontaneously without the limits of the lands appointed for their cultivation, an account of them is immediately taken, and inserted in the register; and where young trees shoot up, they are immediately transplanted into Daty-lands, unless the number of trees in them is already sufficient.\n\nTo enforce the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> down all the clove trees, which, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPONTANEOUS\">spontaneous</a> bounty of nature, may shoot up in different parts of the island, an annual circuit is made by the governor, accompanied by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DETACHMENT\">detachment</a> of troops, and such of the gentlemen of the settlement as he may appoint to accompany him. As this expedition is performed by water, it is escorted by a number of the regents of the districts in their barges, which they are obliged to equip at their own expense. The governor generally sets out in the middle of October, attended by all the residents of those districts under the immediate management of the supreme government. As he proceeds, he calls on the attendance of all the principal people of the district through which he passes. He makes the tour in this manner of his whole dominions, continuing to increase his train of attendants, until, having made the complete circuit of the island, he returns to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a>. His annual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAVALCADE\">cavalcade</a> is much complained of, on account of the numerous exactions to which it gives rise.\n\nIn gathering the cloves, each labourer brings the quantity which he gathers to a weigh-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, where the\nname of the person, together with the quantity delivered, is regularly noted. But, unless the cloves are thoroughly dried, the full weight is not always admitted. There must be an allowance for wastage, which is entirely at the discretion of the receiving officer, and under this pretence the unprotected inhabitants are exposed to numerous frauds. The price at which cloves are received by the State is 4s. 8d. per <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POUND\">pound</a>. But this price is merely nominal, in consequence of large deductions being subsequently made on various accounts. Of these the principal is an allowance of 20 per cent. on the weight of the cloves, for the benefit of the governor, and the other servants of the Company; besides which, there are other deductions for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGENT\">regent</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> magistrates of the district, and the labourer's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol21.html#article-WAGES\">wages</a> are also paid out of the price allowed by the State. The annual produce of cloves is estimated at 600,000 lb., from which a deduction of one-fifth, or twenty per cent., amounts to 120,000 lb.; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBUTE\">tribute</a> thus levied is portioned out among the residents and members of the executive government, according to their respective ranks. The produce of cloves is apt to vary, however, according as the season is favourable or otherwise.\n\nFor six years, ending 1791, the average quantity of cloves imported into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a> amounted to 597,617 lbs., and were sold for a sum equal to L. 155,129; besides which, considerable quantities are annually sent to various parts of India, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARABIA\">Arabia</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHINA\">China</a>; the exact amount of which it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to ascertain. When the island was taken possession of by the British in 1796, there were in store 515,940 lbs. of cloves. The quantity imported by the English East India Company after the conquest of the island by Britain, was, in the years 1803, 1804, 1805, respectively, 49,441; 127,866; 179,507 lbs, which were sold for L. 8,789; L. 19,994; L. 27,912.\n\nThe despotism under which this fine island is oppressed, is sufficiently implied in the monopoly of its produce for the state, and in the severe and sanguinary laws which are found necessary to prevent contraband trade. If the government were to deal fairly with its subjects, the temptation to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a> to other countries with this produce would be much diminished; and, in proportion to the severity of the laws established against such an intercourse, we may, therefore, fairly estimate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of the fraud practised upon the inhabitants by their mercantile despots. Monopoly, besides being in itself an odious abuse, is an impure source from which other abuses naturally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>; and in Amboyna, accordingly, we find that, as the produce of the inhabitants is engrossed by the State at an undervalue, they are upon the same principle forced to purchase at prices proportionally exorbitant, whatever necessaries they may require. A lucrative trade of this nature is carried on by the residents of the respective provinces, as well as by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> officers at the outposts with the peasantry under their authority. They procure from the supply of stores which the Dutch company used to send annually from Batavia, such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol8.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> as the natives require, particularly blue cloth, which they oblige them to purchase at a price far above its value; and, in order to furnish them with the means of satisfying their wants, the residents lend them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> at usurious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>; so that these people are reduced to the miserable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol1.html#article-ALTERNATIVE\">alternative</a> either of submitting to the grossest oppression and fraud, or of remaining destitute of those things which nature and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> unite to render necessary. The accumulated debt in which the peasantry are thus involved, is a never-falling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> of bondage and oppression; as it places them entirely at the discretion of their task-masters, to whose bounty they are indebted for their miserable subsistence. An order in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> was published by the Dutch government, some time before the island was conquered by the British, prohibiting the residents from stopping from the peasantry for debts due to themselves, more than two-thirds of the amount of their spice money. But, while the residents retain the extensive powers with which they are necessarily vested, in order to enforce the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of monopoly, the peasantry must be at their mercy; and in that case, the government being tyrannical in its principle, pretexts will never be wanting for evading the force of particular laws.\n\nThe maxims on which this country is governed are well explained in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CODE\">Code</a> of written regulations drawn up by order of the Dutch Company some years before the island came into the possession of the British. This Code, in place of containing mild and liberal regulations for the general improvement of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a>, is filled with all the impolitic restrictions of avarice and despotism; the general tendency of which is, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENDING\">bending</a> down and oppressing the lower orders of the community, to strike at the root of national prosperity, and, finally, to impoverish and degrade the country. From a view of those regulations, it appears to have been the settled policy of the government of Amboyna for 150 years back, to discourage cultivation,\u2014to check all attempts to establish manufactures,\u2014and, in short, to suppress every improvement which might enable the inhabitants to supply their own wants, and might thus render them independent of the monopolies established by their rulers. In this they have been but too successful; and hence the people are fettered down in a state of the most wretched poverty and dependence,\u2014destitute of the common necessaries of life, in consequence of their progressive advance in price; while, in the meantime, the wages of labour have been forcibly depressed, or rather indeed have been kept back from the labourer by fraud; he being bound to the state for a variety of severe duties and services, for which he receives no remuneration. In consequence of these oppressions, the inhabitants are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> and indolent. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">Agriculture</a> has made no progress. Not more than one-tenth of the island is under cultivation, and it is therefore dependent on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JAVA\">Java</a> for supplies of cattle, and grain. The same causes which have discouraged the cultivation of land and the rearing of cattle, have prevented the improvement of manufactures, or of the mechanic arts; of which the inhabitants are so ignorant, that they do not even manufacture the coarse cloth of which they make their own wearing apparel; but are furnished with it from Java or Ben-","sp":474,"ep":482},{"h":"AMBOYNA","t":"Amboyna gal, and receive it in retail from the residents and men in office, at such prices as they choose to fix <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> it.\n\nAll the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> productions of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> are in like manner neglected by the policy of its rulers.

But the growth of this valuable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMODITY\">commodity</a> was discouraged by the Dutch, chiefly with a view of protecting the indigo trade carried on between the mother <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> and her colonies in the West Indies; and from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JEALOUSY\">jealousy</a> also, that the natives, by acquiring wealth, might be enabled to assert their independence. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SUGAR\">Sugar</a> grows to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a>; but its cultivation is discouraged. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COFFEE\">Coffee</a> is produced in great plenty in different parts of the island; and, were the culture of it sufficiently attended to, it would be equal in quality to the first Mocha coffee. Wheat might be cultivated to great advantage on the beautiful heights <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTIGUOUS\">contiguous</a> to the town of Amboyna, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> adapted for it. Of maize there is already a great abundance; and the dry and mountain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol19.html#article-RICE\">rice</a> is known here; but they have been but little attended to. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>-fruit tree grows spontaneously all over the island; but is only made use of by the lowest orders of the people. The cocoa tree also grows here; but the cultivation of it is almost entirely neglected. If the culture of vegetables were sufficiently attended to, this island would produce a great variety of the finest quality. All sorts of roots are produced in abundance, particularly yams and sweet potatoes; and the increased circulation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>, since the island has been in possession of the English, has induced the farmers to bring ample and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> supplies to the market. There is also great variety of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>, of the finest quality and flavour. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> appearance of the island is extremely beautiful and picturesque. Mountains everywhere covered with lofty woods in perpetual foliage, and valleys clothed in verdure, interspersed with hamlets, and enriched by cultivation, exhibit the most delightful variety that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> in those tropical regions is capable of producing.\n\nAmboyna was captured by the British in 1796, and restored to the Dutch by the peace of Amiens.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a> excited throughout <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> discovery of America, gave rise among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MARITIME\">maritime</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> to such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of adventure, that in the course of the two succeeding centuries, the eastern, and a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the western <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> was surveyed with tolerable accuracy. But the spirit of enterprise, satisfied with such vast contributions to the stock of geographical knowledge, appears to have languished for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>; and the expeditions of different navigators, who had successfully explored the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> west coast of America, were either but imperfectly remembered, or were discredited as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FABULOUS\">fabulous</a>; while, in the absence of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> discovery, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of mankind was occupied with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> southern Continent, or with the impracticable scheme of a passage to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> through some of the inlets <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the American coast.\n\nIn pursuance of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> project, different expeditions were undertaken during the early part of the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>; and though they all failed as to their original <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>, they were nevertheless extremely useful, as they led to an accurate survey of the shores of the different bays and inlets, through which there was any possibility of finding this much desired passage. It was owing to views of this sort, that the shores of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HUDSON_S_BAY\">Hudson's <a </a>class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BAY\">bay</a> were so completely explored; and it was to the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> of finding out a north west passage to India, that we are indebted for the knowledge which we possess of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAFFIN_S_BAY\">Baffin's bay</a>. It was partly also with a view to this object, that Mr Hearne was dispatched, in the year 1770, under the orders of the Hudson's Bay <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">Company</a>, into the interior of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, for the purpose of penetrating by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> to the Northern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCEAN\">Ocean</a>. Mr Hearne set out in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> from Fort <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">Prince</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a>, situate in north <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LATITUDE\">latitude</a> 58\u00b0 50'; and, after passing in a north-west course through the various tribes, who, without any fixed habitations, spend their miserable lives roving over the dreary deserts and frozen lakes of this immense tract, first added to the known geography of the Globe by this adventurous traveller, he reached Coppermine river on the 13th of July. This river he pursued to its mouth, which he places in the 72\u00b0 of latitude, and about 25\u00b0 west <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a>, from the Fort from which he took his departure. It was then the 18th of July; and he states, that he viewed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> at the river's mouth, which was full of islands and shoals, and that, though the season was so far advanced, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ICE\">ice</a> was not yet broken up, but only thawed about three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> from the coast, and a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> round the islands and shoals. The result of this journey determined the northern limits of the American Continent, and set for ever at rest the notion of any passage through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARRIER\">barrier</a> of eternal ice which surrounds its shores.\n\nIt was for the purpose of exploring the north west\nAmerica, coast of America, in search of a passage which might communicate with Hudson's or Baffin's bay, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> Cook was dispatched on his third and last voyage, in the year 1776. Having touched at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol4.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> of Good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">Hope</a>, and at the various islands situate in the great Southern Ocean, this celebrated navigator did not arrive on the coast of America, till the year 1778. He anchored in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOOTKA\">Nootka</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> on the 29th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-MARCH\">March</a>; but he was so thwarted by unfavourable winds, that, with the exception of a few projecting headlands and capes, he could obtain no accurate view of the coast, until he reached the latitude of $55^\\circ 20'$. About the latitude of $58^\\circ$, he discovered an inlet, called by him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CROSS\">Cross</a> Sound; which is the last inlet towards the north, on that great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of broken coast commencing on the north west shores of the American Continent, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRAIT\">strait</a>, said to have been discovered by a Greek pilot named De Fuca, and of which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a> was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> called in question by subsequent navigators.\n\nFrom the 58th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a>, Cook made an accurate survey of the coast, having explored Prince William's Sound, and the inlet now distinguished by his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a>, until he was satisfied that they could <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> to no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-ULTERIOR\">ulterior</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a>. He thence coasted along the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENINSULA\">peninsula</a> of Alaska, and passing through that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARCHIPELAGO\">archipelago</a> which is known by the name of the Aleutian islands, and which has the appearance of being a prolongation of the two opposite Continents, he entered Beering's basin; and advancing to the straits which divide <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a> and America, he ascertained with accuracy the relative limits of these two great divisions of the Globe. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COASTING\">Coasting</a> along the American shore, and incessantly struggling with shoals and floating mountains of ice, he advanced into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCTIC\">Arctic</a> ocean, as far as the parallel of $70^\\circ 44'$, which he reached on the 18th of August. Here his further progress was arrested by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> of solid ice, which extended from shore to shore; and here, therefore, is the utmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIMIT\">limit</a> of the navigable ocean, betwixt the Continents of America and Asia. It may be remarked, that between Europe and America, the ocean continues navigable to within a few minutes of the 81st parallel, which was the latitude reached by Captain Phipps, in the year 1773, when he attempted to penetrate in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EAST\">east</a>.\n\nIt appears, from the researches made by Humboldt in New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-MEXICO\">Mexico</a>, that the north-west coast of America was, at an early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, visited by the Spanish navigators, as far as the 57th degree of north latitude. But the result of these expeditions was studiously concealed by the Spanish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>; from an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a>, that the other nations of Europe would be tempted to form establishments on that coast, and thus to encroach on the exclusive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> claimed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a> to its possession. But when it was found, that, notwithstanding the utmost caution of that power, the maritime states of Europe were proceeding to examine those hitherto unknown shores, various expeditions were fitted out after the year 1774, by the government of Spain for the same purpose. In the course of these expeditions, the Spanish navigators extended their survey from San Carlos de Monterrey, on the coast of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CALIFORNIA\">California</a>, as far as Cook's Inlet; but their researches, though they determined with great accuracy various insulated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>, were very far from affording an exact geographical delineation of the American coast.\n\nBeyond the 58th parallel, the discoveries of Captain Cook are blended with those of the Russians, who, from their vicinity to America, have been enabled in some degree to anticipate the visits of the other European states to the north western part of that continent. To him, however, still belongs the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> of having first ascertained the true bearings of this portion of America; of having determined the limits of the two Continents; and of having at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> furnished a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KEY\">key</a> to the interesting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a> as to the original <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> of the New World, formerly the source of so many vain, though <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> conjectures.\n\nWhile Captain Cook was engaged in these researches on the north-west coast of America, his sailors availed themselves of the opportunity of entering into an intercourse with the natives; from whom they procured, for European <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol8.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of small value, a supply of skins of sea otters and other animals. These being carried to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHINA\">China</a>, were sold at an exorbitant profit; and Captain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">King</a>, who succeeded Captain Cook in the command of the expedition, was so struck with the favourable opening which appeared to present itself for establishing a lucrative <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>, that his account of the voyage contained the exposition of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> trade between the north west coast of America and China. The merchants of Europe, America, and China, tempted by the prospect of enormous profits, were eager to enter into the proposed trade, and the hitherto unknown and uninviting shores of north west America, were now frequented by trading vessels from different quarters of the Globe. In the course of those commercial adventures, various important inlets were discovered in the American coasts, which had unaccountably escaped the researches of the different navigators by whom they had been visited. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of these discoveries, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a> of finding a north-west passage to India began to revive; and the expeditions of the Greek pilot De Fuca, and of the Spanish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ADMIRAL\">Admiral</a> De Fuente, both of which had long been treated as fabulous, were again brought into some degree of repute. With the original accounts of De Fuca's and Fuente's voyages, the most romantic tales had been circulated respecting the extent of coast which they had discovered, and the abundance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>, pearls, and precious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> to be found in those unknown countries. These embellishments were added, for the purpose, apparently, of amusing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-CREDULITY\">credulity</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, and of thus attracting a degree of consideration which the mere fact of the discovery of an unknown coast would have hardly secured. But as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a>, in both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, was accompanied with such obvious fictions, the reality of the voyages was disbelieved; and, indeed, the whole passed for a mere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>. The reader will find some curious details upon this subject, in the Introduction prefixed by Fleuriou to the account of Marchand's Voyage round the World.\n\nJuan de Fuca, a Greek pilot of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of Cephalonia, is said to have been dispatched, in 1592, by the Viceroy of Mexico, to examine the west coast of America, for an inlet which might lead to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATLANTIC_OCEAN\">Atlantic ocean</a>. When he ar-\nrived between the 47th and 48th parallels, the land extended to the north east, and presented a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> opening, into which he entered, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> sailing in it for twenty days. He frequently went on shore, where he met with the natives in great numbers, who were clothed in the skins of animals; and finally, the account stated that he reached the Atlantic ocean, and that he returned to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACAPULCO\">Acapulco</a> after an absence of two years, warmly soliciting to be rewarded for his pretended discovery.\n\nThe account of the voyage of Admiral de Fuente, which was undertaken in 1640, states, that, being on an expedition of discovery on the west coast of North America, he came, after a prosperous voyage, from the 26th to the 53rd degree of latitude, where, having found an extremely broken coast, he sailed about 260 leagues in crooked channels, and amongst an extensive collection of islands, which he named the Archipelago of St Lazarus. Here, it is said, his ships boats always sailed a mile a-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECONNOITRE\">reconnoitre</a> the passage, which was full of shoals, rocks, and sands. The account, besides, contains various details in regard to an extensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INLAND\">inland</a> navigation by means of lakes and rivers; and it is even asserted, that they met a vessel which had come in this way from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOSTON\">Boston</a> on the other side of the Continent; but M. Fleuriot contends, that this piece of fiction must have been a spurious addition to the original narrative, as it is explicitly stated in the concluding part of it, that no passage was found which communicates with the Atlantic ocean. If they had met with a vessel from Boston, this of course was a clear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> of a communication with that ocean.\n\nAlthough the accounts of these two voyages have been generally regarded as mere fables, the features of this part of the American shore, as they were gradually discovered by the commercial navigators who visited it, from the year 1787, were found to coincide so remarkably with the previous representations contained in the narratives of De Fuca and Fuente, as to afford a strong presumption that they had actually navigated those coasts. It was found, wherever the coast was explored, from about the 48th to nearly the 58th parallel, that it was broken by numerous inlets; and that it was in the latitude of 53, as Fuente had described it, a complete archipelago, full of bays, harbours, intricate channels, and islands. In like manner, one of the trading vessels which visited this coast in 1787, commanded by Captain Berkeley, discovered a large inlet or strait between the 47th and 48th parallels, which is the latitude assigned for De Fuca's inlet in the narrative of his voyage. The same strait was observed in the following year by Captain Duncan, who anchored also in several harbours on the east of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUEEN_CHARLOTTE_S_ISLANDS\"><a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol</a>17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> Charlotte's islands; and surveying all that portion of coast which lies between the 54th and 51st degrees, found one continued cluster of islands, with numerous bays and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a>. In 1789, this coast was visited by Captain Meares, who discovered the strait, and, anchoring in it, sent forward his long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a> to make observations. The boat, he observes, sailed near thirty leagues up the strait, and at that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> from the sea, it was about fifteen leagues <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, with a clear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZON\">horizon</a> stretching towards the east. The boat's crew were there attacked by the barbarous natives, who had entered into a scheme for robbing and murdering them. A desperate conflict ensued, in which Captain Meares's crew, having repulsed the attack, were glad to escape without attempting any farther <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of those inhospitable shores. In the course of this voyage, the account contained in the exploded narrative of De Fuca, as to the coast, and the inhabitants, was found to agree, in several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> circumstances, with the observations of Captain Meares. In particular, a great headland or island described by De Fuca, was recognized; as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-PINNACLE\">pinnacle</a> rock, placed, as he stated it, in the entrance of the inlet. The inhabitants were also found clothed in furs and bears skins; and a remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> related by De Fuca, of binding the children's heads between two boards when young, so as to give to them the form of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a> loaf, was still observed by Captain Meares, to prevail generally among these savages. The latitude assigned to the inlet by De Fuca and Captain Meares, was not exactly the same; but, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> was such, as may be easily accounted for by the comparatively <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> instruments in use among the early navigators. In addition to the preceding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a>, it was stated by Captain Meares, that the American ship the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WASHINGTON\">Washington</a>, Captain Gray, had completely explored this strait, and found that it inclosed a large part of the Continent, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> at both extremities with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PACIFIC_OCEAN\">Pacific Ocean</a>. In the chart annexed by Captain Meares to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, the track of the Washington through this interior sea is even marked. It appears, however, that no such voyage was ever made, Captain Gray, though he examined De Fuca's inlet, having returned by the same channel through which he had entered, without finding its termination.\n\nThe discovery of a great inlet in this part of the American coast, to which no termination had yet been found, and which had escaped the researches both of Cook and of the Spanish navigators, gave rise to various speculations. Among others, it revived the exploded hope of an existing communication between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. It was imagined, that this inland sea might be connected with some of the great lakes in the interior of North America; that, if no communication actually existed with Hudson's or Baffin's bay, it might not be found a very arduous task, by calling in art and industry to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-AID\">aid</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, to effect this great improvement; and at any rate, that the prospect of such an inland navigation as was now opened by the recent discoveries, must be of vast importance to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> commerce and civilization of the American Continent. To ascertain the precise extent of those discoveries, an expedition was fitted out by the British Government, and placed under the orders of Captain Vancouver, (who had sailed twice round the world with Cook); with instructions to survey the west coast of America, from the 30th degree of north latitude to Cook's river. He was particularly directed to examine all the inlets with which he found the coast indented, for the purpose of discovering whether any navigable communication existed with any of the great lakes in the interior; and with this view, Cook's river was\nalso recommended to his careful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>, as it was conjectured, that it might take its rise in some of the inland lakes already known to the Canadian traders. Captain Vancouver set out on his voyage in the end of the year 1790, and, after visiting several of the islands in the Pacific Ocean, he arrived on the coast of America in 1792. Having surveyed the coast from Cape Mendocino, he entered De Fuca's inlet in latitude 48\u00b0 23' N., and continuing his course almost directly into the Continent, for nearly 100 miles, he observed that the strait turned to the north west and south east. The southerly branch was found to terminate after a winding course of about ninety miles, in lat. 47\u00b0 21' N., long. E. 237\u00b0 6', in low and apparently swampy land. The northerly branch was next surveyed by Captain Vancouver, in all its numerous inlets; and after running in a north west direction, generally parallel with the coast, it was found to terminate at length in the Pacific Ocean, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUEEN_CHARLOTTE_S_SOUND\">Queen Charlotte's sound</a>, in N. lat. 51\u00b0 45', long. 222\u00b0 1 E.; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> off from the Continent that large island, since distinguished by the name of Quadra and Vancouver, the two navigators, the one belonging to Spain, the other to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, by whom it was first surveyed. The survey of this strait was conducted with singular perseverance through a course of most perilous navigation; occasioned by the numerous islands and sunken rocks, which in many parts interrupt the passage,\u2014by the rapidity of the current from those interruptions,\u2014and, finally, by the great depth of the channel, which frequently affords no anchorage. In many places, the strait is of an unfathomable depth; and where it was only two miles wide, no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> was found with 110 fathoms of line. Proceeding northwards, Captain Vancouver completed, amid various perils and fatigues, his laborious survey of that great archipelago, which extends along the American coast, to nearly the 59th parallel, and ends with Cross sound. Every bay was diligently explored, and every inlet traced to its termination. Prince William's sound was next examined, and, lastly, Cook's river, or rather inlet. Captain Cook, when he was advancing into this inlet, found the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> grow less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> the farther he penetrated, and he thence concluded it to be the outlet of a large river. Captain Vancouver entered the inlet with his vessel as far as it was navigable; and he afterwards advanced with his boats, until he found the eastern banks gradually unite with those on the western side, in N. lat. 61\u00b0 29' E. long. 211\u00b0 17'. Thus terminated for ever the long cherished hope of a north west passage to India. Every bay and inlet on the north west coast of America has now been minutely examined; and it has been found, that the Continent, throughout its whole extent, interposes between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and that beyond its northern limits, a frozen sea presents an impenetrable barrier of ice to the enterprises of navigation.\n\nWhile Captain Vancouver was engaged in his survey of the American coast, an expedition was fitted out nearly about the same time from Acapulco, under the orders of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DON\">Don</a> Dionisio Galiano, and Don Cayetano Valdes, for the purpose of surveying De Fuca's inlet, which had already been entered and examined to a certain extent by the Spanish navigators. In the course of this voyage, the Spanish and English American expeditions met. Their respective commanders made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> and unreserved communication of their discoveries; they assisted one another in their operations; and the best understanding possible subsisted between them till their separation. The charts drawn up in the course of these expeditions have been all published without reserve; and they contain a most correct delineation of the American coast, from the 45th degree of latitude to Cape Douglas, in the east of Cook's inlet, which, before this period, was but imperfectly known. The coast from the 58th parallel, having been in some parts visited much about the same time by the English, the Spaniards, and the Russians, the same place has frequently received a name from the navigators of each of these nations. From this circumstance some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a> is apt to arise. We are occasionally perplexed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYNONYMOUS\">synonymous</a> appellations of different navigators; and it is only by a minute <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of their respective charts that this inconvenience can be obviated.\n\nII. While, in the course of three centuries, from its first discovery, the seaward limits of the North American Continent have been thus accurately surveyed, the progress of discovery in the interior has necessarily been much slower. Although numerous perils, no doubt, beset the navigator of an unknown coast, the ocean still presents a more favourable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of enterprise than the land. An insulated band of travellers, traversing the deserts of an unknown Continent, are exposed to so many causes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a> from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, from fatigue, famine, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSTILITY\">hostility</a> of barbarous tribes, that enterprises of this nature are more unpromising than maritime expeditions; and they have accordingly been less frequently undertaken. Since the first settlement, however, of the European colonists in America, population and improvement have been regularly advancing; and the European inhabitants, gradually extending themselves over a large tract of the country, have now penetrated, more especially in North America, to a great extent into the interior. The rapid increase of population naturally produces an anxiety to inquire into the state of the unexplored country, and to ascertain how far it is adapted to the purposes of civilized life. With this view, several important journeys have of late been undertaken, under the orders of the American government; while, in other parts, individuals have been occasionally prompted by a spirit of adventurous curiosity, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>, to penetrate the unfrequented deserts of the New World. Of these journeys, with their geographical results, we shall endeavour to submit a short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> to our readers.\n\nThe ardour with which the fur trade in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CANADA\">Canada</a> began to be prosecuted from about the year 1770, naturally induced the rival <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ADVENTURERS\">adventurers</a> who were engaged in it to advance as far as possible into the interior parts of the country; and it is now affirmed, that their journeys extend from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTREAL\">Montreal</a>, in a north-westerly direction, to the astonishing length of nearly 4000 miles. The superintendents, clerks, interpreters, canoe-men, and Indians, by whom this trade is carried on, generally set out, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of about two thousand persons, from Montreal, in the beginning\nof May, and arrive upon Lake Superior about the middle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a>. After transacting their business at this station, the different detachments proceed into the interior, for the purpose of collecting furs from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> tribes, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a> for European goods. In conducting this commerce, they pass along a vast succession of dreary lakes and dangerous rivers, interrupted by rapids and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a>-places, which stretch into the interior as far as Fort Chepewyan, on the banks of the Lake of the Hills. Mr Mackenzie, who belonged to the Canada Fur Company, and who, in the course of his commercial business, had been accustomed to encounter all the hardships of this interior navigation, was encouraged, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> and knowledge which he had acquired of the country, to undertake a journey across the Continent, with the hope of reaching the Pacific Ocean. He accordingly set out from Fort Chepewyan, on the Lake of the Hills, and passed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the Peace, or Slave River, to the great Slave Lake; the waters of which he found so much incumbered with ice, in the middle of June, that he was obliged to coast round it till he reached its main inlet, towards the north-west, in lat. 61\u00b0 N. He embarked on this stream, of which, the course being at first westerly, he naturally conceived that it would lead to the Pacific Ocean. It afterwards turned, however, to the north-west, and finally took a northerly course, carrying him forward with a rapid current, not towards the Pacific, but towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FROZEN_OCEAN\">Frozen Ocean</a>. He was warned of his approach to the sea by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the tide in the channel, and on the shores; and he was then in lat. 69\u00b0 N., west long. 134\u00b0; about 24 degrees to the westward of the point at which Mr Hearne arrived in 1771.\n\nThe result of this expedition sufficiently demonstrated to Mr Mackenzie, that the route to the Pacific must be sought further to the south; and, far from being discouraged by the fatigues and perils which he had encountered in his first journey, he resolved to ascend to the source of the Unijah, or Peace River, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROCKY_MOUNTAINS\">Rocky Mountains</a>, from which it flows nearly in an easterly direction, joining Slave River, and finally entering Slave Lake from the south. That he might have the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> before him, Mr Mackenzie set out from Fort Chepewyan, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OCTOBER\">October</a> 1792, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTENTION\">intention</a> of wintering in the remotest establishment of the Company, and of beginning his journey from this advanced station, as early in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> as the river was navigable. He spent the winter accordingly among a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> of Chepewyan Indians, and set out upon his adventurous expedition on the 9th May 1793. He arrived, after many difficulties and dangers, at the source of the Unijah, in lat. 54\u00b0 N. long. 121\u00b0 W. on the 13th of June. Here he found that he was only a few miles from the Tacoutche or Columbia, which, taking a southerly course, falls into the Pacific, in 46\u00b0 10' N. lat. He embarked on this stream, and experienced great difficulties at first, from rapids and falls; but, as the stream enlarged, the navigation became easier, and he followed the course of this river till the 24th of the month, when he was induced, by the information which he received from the natives, to leave it, and to proceed by land directly across the Continent to the sea. In the course of twelve days, during which he was exposed to a variety of fatigues and dangers, he reached another stream, of which the navigation was more practicable; and having procured a canoe, he arrived on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, about the 22nd of July, in lat. 52\u00b0 21' N., long. 128\u00b0 2' W.; immediately to the southward of the islands which Vancouver has distinguished by the name of Princess <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a>'s Islands. Mr Mackenzie returned by the same route, and arrived safely at the point from which he set out, on the 24th August 1793.\n\nThe journeys of Mr Mackenzie appear to have been conducted with singular perseverance and intrepidity; and they have thrown considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> on the geography of North America. The countries, indeed, which he traversed, are inhabited by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> tribes, who possess no peculiarity in their character different from other savages; being chiefly occupied with the mere wants of animal life, and having little attention or curiosity to bestow on any thing else. They are fickle besides, and treacherous, but easily deterred from open violence. It was of importance, however, to determine, at particular points, the northern limits of the American Continent, and to mark the course of the rivers which flow through this dreary country into the Frozen Ocean; and the account of the river since known by the name of Mackenzie's River, is in this view a real accession to geography. It is pleasing also to observe the near approach of the sources of the Unijah, or Peace River (which is connected with that great succession of lakes and rivers, terminating in the St Lawrence), and the Tacoutche, or the Columbia, which flows into the Pacific Ocean. In the present desolate state of this part of the American Continent, the vicinity of the various streams which flow in opposite directions into the Atlantic and Pacific, from that great dividing ridge of mountains which intersects the interior almost to the Frozen Ocean, can be of little moment; but, in a different stage of its progress, when these dreary abodes, at present the haunts of savages or of beasts of prey, are filled with industrious inhabitants, the facilities of inland communication which the country derives from the convenient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a> of its lakes and rivers, must be of vast importance to its future improvement.\n\nThe expeditions of discovery into the interior of North America, undertaken by order of the government of the United States, have been productive of much interesting information. These are, first, the journey of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJOR\">Major</a> Pike, with a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DETACHMENT\">detachment</a> of troops, to the source of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MISSISSIPPI\">Mississippi</a>; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, his journey into the interior of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-LOUISIANA\">Louisiana</a>, for the purpose of exploring the course of several of its subordinate streams; and, third, the remarkable journey of Captains <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEWIS\">Lewis</a> and Clarke to the source of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MISSOURI\">Missouri</a>, and afterwards across the Rocky Mountains to the mouth of the Columbia, which flows into the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe source of the Mississippi, and the country through which it takes its course, were but imperfectly known before they were visited by Major Pike. This enterprising officer left Fort St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a>, near the\nAmerica, junction of the Missouri with the Mississippi, on the 9th August 1805, and was nearly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> months in performing his interesting journey; during which, he laid down, with the greatest accuracy, the course of the Mississippi. He examined its banks, and collected information respecting the barbarous tribes who inhabit the adjacent country. The Mississippi, it appears, is divided near its source into two branches, one of which loses itself in Leech Lake, while the other, which may be termed the upper source of the river, takes its rise in Upper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">Red</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CEDAR\">Cedar</a> Lake, of which the lat. is $47^\\circ 42' 40''$ N. From this point, the distance to some of the head waters, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> into Hudson's bay, is only about two leagues; the waters of the American continent being, in this manner here, as in other places, admirably disposed for interior navigation and commerce. The Mississippi generally flows from N.W. to S.W., and from its source to its mouth, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GULF\">Gulf</a> of Mexico, is estimated to run a course of 2000 miles.\n\nThe second expedition of Major Pike was undertaken in the years 1806 and 1807; and was directed into the interior of Louisiana, with a view of examining the course of the various rivers which take their rise in the Rocky Mountains, and, running nearly westward, either fall into the Missouri from the south, before its confluence with the Mississippi, or into the Mississippi, after the two rivers are joined. Within this space four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> streams flow into these rivers; namely, the Kansas and the Osage, which join the Missouri, and the Arkansaw and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-RED_RIVER\">Red River</a>, which flow into the Mississippi. The course of these rivers was but very imperfectly known until of late years, when they were surveyed by different parties of discovery, sent out by the Spanish or American governments. Several rivers were seen, indeed, to rise in the Rocky Mountains, which, it was nearly certain, must fall into the Missouri or the Mississippi; and as these last rivers were, in like manner, known to receive several large streams, it was naturally conjectured, that they were the same of which the source had been discovered at so vast a distance in the Rocky Mountains. Humboldt, accordingly, concluded that the river which rises to the north-east of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VILLAGE\">village</a> of Taos, and which receives the Rio Mora from the vicinity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SANTA_FE\">Santa Fe</a>, is the same river which, in Louisiana, is called the Red River; and recent investigations have proved his conjecture to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>. In the course of Major Pike's expedition, in which the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PARTY\">party</a> had nearly perished from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> and famine, the Osage river was first surveyed, and was found to run a course of 1500 miles before its junction with the Missouri. The party next proceeded by land across the country to the Arkansaw, which they traced to its source; from which this great river, taking its windings into the account, was estimated, before it joins the Mississippi, to run the enormous length of 2178 miles. During the whole of this space, it may be navigated with boats properly constructed for the purpose, except for about 200 miles after it enters into the mountains. It receives, also, several small rivers, which are navigable for upwards of a hundred miles. From the Arkansaw, the exploring party proceeded northwards, and discovered the sources of America's two streams, which they conjectured to be the headwaters of the Plate and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">Yellow</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> rivers.\n\nGreat light has been thrown on the geography of this part of the country, by the journey of Lewis and Clarke, and from their researches, Major Pike's conjecture as to the Plate appears to have been right; but he has mistaken a subordinate branch of the Yellow-stone River, called by Lewis and Clarke Beghorn river, for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> stream. Major Pike returning, and proceeding to the south, struck into another stream, which he supposed to be the Red River. But he was met by a party of Spanish troops, who informed him that it was the Rio del Norte; and, being on the Spanish territory, he was made prisoner with his whole party, and carried into New Mexico.\n\nThe course held by Major Pike never brought him near the Red River. This river, however, had been previously examined in 1804, in the lower part of its course, to its confluence with the Mississippi, by Mr. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUNBAR\">Dunbar</a> and Dr. Hunter, who were employed for this purpose by the government of the United States; while it had been explored from its source downwards, for about 230 leagues, by a large body of Spanish cavalry, who set out on this expedition from Santa Fe, in 1806. The course of this river, taking in all its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> windings, cannot, according to recent observation, be estimated at less than 2000 miles. By the researches of these travellers, we have thus obtained a sufficiently accurate view of the course of the various streams which intersect this part of the American Continent; and it will be found, that all these rivers are so disposed, as greatly to facilitate the progress of cultivation and improvement. The countries visited by the exploring party of Major Pike, were inhabited by savage tribes, who subsist almost entirely by hunting; and the abundance of wild animals of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> to be found in those parts, affords ample encouragement to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of life. The borders of the Arkansaw he calls the terrestrial paradise of the wandering savage, on account of the immense herds there to be found, of buffalo, elk, and deer. The antelope is also <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a>; and of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARNIVOROUS\">carnivorous</a> animals, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WOLF\">wolf</a> and bear are the most remarkable.\n\nWhile the interior of Louisiana was, in this manner, so successfully examined, and the course of the various <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBUTARY\">tributary</a> rivers, which either flow into the lower Missouri or Mississippi, was so accurately determined; Captains Lewis and Clarke were entrusted by the American government with the still more important task of exploring the main stream of the Missouri, from its confluence with the Mississippi, to its source; and of afterwards proceeding across the Rocky Mountains to the first navigable river they should meet with, which they were to descend until they should arrive at the Pacific Ocean. They set out with an intrepid band of forty-five followers, mostly American soldiers, from the point of junction between the Missouri and Mississippi, in May 1804; and by the beginning of November, they had nearly ascended about half the course.\nnot plentiful, the abundance of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol10.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a> must be of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> importance towards the colonization of the country. The adjacent hills exhibited also, as they advanced, large irregular masses of rocks and stones; some of which, although two hundred feet above the river, seem to have been once subject to its influence, being apparently worn smooth by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGITATION\">agitation</a> of the water. These rocks and stones consist of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> and grey <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANITE\">granite</a>; a brittle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> rock; flint, limestone, freestone; some small specimens of an excellent pebble; and occasionally broken <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRATA\">strata</a> of a black-coloured stone, like petrified wood, which makes good whetstones. The country in the neighbourhood abounds with deer, elk, beaver, buffaloes, antelopes, and their followers the wolves, who make great ravages among them. Here also were met the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> and white bear, which were both found to be exceedingly ferocious. With these animals the party had frequent encounters; and though they were all well armed, and expert marksmen, they were often in great danger from this formidable enemy.\n\nAdvancing towards the Rocky Mountains, they found the river divided into two branches, and they were much at a loss which to pursue. At length they chose the branch that came from the south; and having ascended for some time, their ears were saluted with a tremendous noise occasioned by the great falls of the Missouri, and which, from the information of the Indians, they knew to be a certain mark that they were on the main stream. Higher up the river, they found it divided into three branches, which they distinguished by the names of the three leading statesmen in America, viz. Jefferson, Gallatin, and Maddison. They ascended the first of these streams, with a view of reaching, by the nearest course across the mountains, some of the smaller branches which join the Columbia, and lead to the Pacific Ocean.\n\nIt being necessary to obtain some knowledge of the country through which they were to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> their perilous course, Captain Lewis set out, accompanied by one of the most expert hunters, and two soldiers, along the Jefferson; and having advanced until the river had become so small that they could step across it, they ascended a high ridge towards the west, which forms the dividing ridge between the waters of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Here they began to descend; and they reached a stream of clear water running to the west, which they rightly conjectured must belong to the waters of the Columbia. After various difficulties and uncertainties, they met with an Indian tribe, whom they fortunately persuaded to return with them to their companions at the source of the Missouri. By this tribe they were directed into the proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> across the mountains, which was to the north-west, the course of the Missouri having carried them considerably to the south of the head waters of the Columbia. In travelling this road, they encountered innumerable hardships from famine, occasioned by the scarcity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAME\">game</a>, and the great cold in those higher regions, to which they had now penetrated. This part of their journey lasted about seven weeks, from the 18th August to the 7th October; at which period they em-\nbarked in canoes built by themselves on the river Kooskooske. This river they found to be much embarrassed by a succession of dangerous rapids and shoals. These difficulties, however, they encountered with all the alacrity of men accustomed to danger; and, after a hazardous navigation, they descended into Lewis's river, and, sailing down this stream, they reached the Columbia, about 400 miles from its mouth. They came within sight of the ocean about the 7th November, when they were deluged for a time with almost perpetual rains. At this station they remained for the winter, which, as usually happens on the western coast of America, was extremely mild. As soon as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> permitted, they set out on their return; and having, with great difficulty, succeeded in crossing the ridge of the Rocky Mountains, they arrived at Fort Lewis, on the Mississippi, on the 23rd <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEPTEMBER\">September</a>; having, in the course of this remarkable journey, travelled over a space of about 9000 miles.\n\nThe countries bordering on the Missouri they found inhabited by barbarous tribes, who subsist chiefly by the chace, few or none of them looking to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a> as any resource. On the western side of the Rocky Mountains, the rivers yielded vast quantities of salmon; and such was the abundance of this fish in the Columbia, that they were caught in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> with little trouble. Here the inhabitants draw their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> subsistence from the rivers; and in many parts the salmon were seen, after being cured in a particular manner, built up in large stacks, as a provision for future consumption.\n\nThe expedition of Captains Lewis and Clarke, whether we consider the singular perseverance, courage, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a>, with which it was conducted, or the important information to which it has led, may be undoubtedly regarded as one of the most memorable exploratory enterprises of which any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> has to boast. The chart which they have laid down of the course of the Missouri, with its subordinate streams, has filled up an immense chasm in the geography of North America, which may now be considered as complete in all its great features; namely, the direction of its mountains, and the course of its chief rivers. The researches of future travellers must therefore be limited to the subordinate task of filling up the details of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a>, of which the general outline has been already so boldly and successfully sketched. This, however, must be the work of time. At present, our knowledge of the interior of North America seems to be sufficient for every useful purpose; and it is only when population and improvement have made greater progress, that a more exact survey of the country will be required.\n\nIII. In South America, although the country may be said to be merely skirted with an exterior border of cultivation and improvement, the interior has been explored with considerable success. The immense rivers, with the innumerable tributary streams, which flow through the country in all directions, afford great facilities for traversing those vast regions; and it is no doubt in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> to this inland navigation that we are indebted for the geographical knowledge which we possess, imperfect as it is, of this portion of the American Continent. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>, a difference of climate, and a difference also in the configuration of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>, has given rise to a different disposition of its rivers. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NILE\">Nile</a> holds its solitary course through parched and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> deserts, where no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> ever falls, and where, for more than a thousand miles, not a single stream arises to pour its waters into the main channel. The water, on the contrary, which falls on the American Continent, seeks its way to the ocean through many different channels; and all the great rivers, until they fall into the ocean, are joined, in their course, by a variety of capital streams; all of which, communicating either by means of the main channel, or by its tributary waters, with a vast space of inland country, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFUSE\">diffuse</a> throughout the Continent all the advantages of a maritime boundary, and afford facilities for exploring the interior, which could not otherwise exist.\n\nThe Spaniards, ever since their first settlement in America, have been chiefly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTENT\">intent</a> on the aggrandizement of their power and influence, and on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of their authority as widely as possible among the native tribes. For this purpose, they seem occasionally to have employed persuasion and address, and, at other times, to have had recourse to violence. In the latter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, troops were employed to take possession of a certain district; a particular space was then assigned for the villages of the native inhabitants, to which it was understood they were afterwards to be confined. Here they were gradually subjected to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of magistracy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-POLICE\">police</a>, and they were afterwards reduced under a mild species of servitude, for the benefit of their conquerors. In general, the Indians were forced tamely to submit to this injustice; but, in some cases, they rather chose, after a violent struggle, to retire into the interior; from whence, under the influence of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESENTMENT\">resentment</a> against their oppressors, they continued to make incursions into the Spanish territories. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONTIER\">frontier</a> which divides those hostile classes of inhabitants is in this manner the scene of a constant and inveterate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-WAR\">war</a>; and the Europeans are only secured against the irruption of the native tribes, by the imposing aspect of a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> force.\n\nAgainst this system of conquest the ecclesiastics always remonstrated, with laudable and becoming zeal; and they have uniformly recommended, that the improvement of the native Americans should rather be attempted by policy than by arms. Their humane counsels have so far prevailed, that, in later times, the Spaniards, in their attempts to civilize the native Indians, seem to have trusted almost entirely to conciliation. Missions or settlements have been established in different parts under the authority of ecclesiastics, and a few soldiers have generally accompanied the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANT\">infant</a> colony, to repel aggression, but not to offer violence. They to whom the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMINISTRATION\">administration</a> of these settlements is committed, are directed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> over the Indians by gentle means to habits of civilization,\u2014to make distributions among them of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, or of such implements of industry as may enable them to better their condition,\u2014and gradually to inure them to the restraints, by making them duly sensible of the various advantages, of social life. It is also accounted of great\nimportance, that they should be converted to the Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> at the same time that they are instructed in all useful and necessary arts. How far this system, so full of enlightened <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>, is likely to succeed on any great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a>, is a question of some difficulty. Azara, in his instructive account of the Spanish settlements in Paraguay, depreciates the services of the ecclesiastics in that part of the Continent. The Indians are so inveterately attached to their habits of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARBARISM\">barbarism</a>, that force, he seems to think, is absolutely necessary to bring them under the yoke of civilization. It is seldom, he insists, that the savage has any attention to bestow on futurity. He is generally swayed by present objects; and hence the superior advantages of civilization, though they are continually <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> before him, have no effect in withdrawing him from the habits of his wandering and unsettled life. This is no doubt true; and it proves the difficulty, but certainly not the impossibility, of succeeding in the benevolent task undertaken by the Spanish missionaries. There is a very striking account, in the narrative of Vancouver's voyages, of the state of the Spanish missions on the coast of California; and the fine picture which is there exhibited of the reverence and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> of the Indian population to their pastor, and of his unbounded ascendancy over them, evinces such a spirit of docility and affection in this simple people, as plainly shews that, under a wise system of management, they are capable of civilization; and that, though the existing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a> were to remain in their original barbarism, the rising generation at least might be trained to agriculture, and to those other arts by which life is supplied with its most necessary comforts. We cannot, indeed, readily admit, that injustice is in any case the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> of policy, or that there is no other way of guiding and controlling the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> mind but by violence and cruelty.\n\nWith a view of extending civilization among the native tribes, various expeditions have from time to time been undertaken into the interior by the Spanish missionaries. Of these the latest and most remarkable appear to be, first, the voyage of Father Sobriela on the river Guallaga; and, second, the voyages of Father Girval on the great river <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMAZONS\">Amazons</a>.\n\nBeyond the easternmost of the three ridges of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ANDES\">Andes</a>, which run in a direction nearly north and south, through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-PERU\">Peru</a>, immense plains stretch out, to the extent of nearly 8000 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> leagues, and so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a>, that they have been compared to the ocean. They <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> between the river Ucayale and the Guallaga, which bound them to the east and west, while to the north they are bounded by the river Amazons. These vast plains, which have been denominated by the missionaries Pampas del Sacramento, are shaded with forests of eternal verdure, which form a delicious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSPECTIVE\">perspective</a>; they contain also abundance of lakes and rivers, the isles and borders of which are inhabited by tribes greatly diversified in their manners and habits. Rain and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a> are frequent, and for some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> thick fogs always rest on the tall trees. The thickness of the woods prevents the rain from penetrating, and the warmth and moisture give birth to innumerable insects and reptiles. Many of the rarest vegetable products are found in those regions: balsams, oils, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUMS\">gums</a>, resins, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCENSE\">incense</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-CINNAMON\">cinnamon</a>\u2014superior in strength to that of Ceylon, but not so valuable, on account of a disagreeable juice which it transudes:\u2014cocoa, cascarilla, and excellent spiceries are abundant. But, notwithstanding its valuable produce, and the inviting aspect of its evergreen forests, the warmth and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HUMIDITY\">humidity</a> of the climate render the country so unhealthy, that few among the native tribes are said to live beyond fifty years of age. This vast region was first discovered about the year 1726; and several missions appear to have been established, all of which were, however, afterwards abandoned. As this territory was considered by the Spanish government to be of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> importance, Father Sobriela was dispatched in 1790 to explore the course of the river Guallaga, its western boundary. This river rises in south latitude 10\u00b0 57', and, after a course of about 400 miles, falls into the Amazons. He set out in July for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Guanuco, near the source of the Guallaga, where he spent some time in visiting the Indians; to whom, along with his spiritual doctrines, he gave <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LESSONS\">lessons</a> in agriculture, and the necessary implements of iron, by which those lessons were to be reduced to practice. Having embarked on the Guallaga, he descended the stream, and safely passed several rapids. At the rapid of Aguirre the chains of mountains join on either side, and form the Ponquilo\u2014a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> borrowed from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of Peru, signifying a door; and which is generally applied to those narrow and tremendous outlets where the rivers burst from the mountains. This passage forms a sort of gate, where the traveller passes as it were from one world into another, the whole aspect of nature having undergone a complete change; vast plains clothed with eternal verdure, and extending as far as the eye can reach, now succeeding to the lofty summits of the Andes lost in the clouds, and buried in perpetual snow. After passing the mountains, the Guallaga begins to spread, and rolls its majestic stream along the plain, which is now so large as to be navigable both day and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>; while its banks, covered with lofty palms, and trees of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a>, are enlivened by numerous birds of the richest plumage, and most diversified <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SONG\">song</a>. The scene is rendered still more interesting by the prospect of numerous trading canoes sailing up and down the river; while the crews of others are employed in gathering the cocoa-nuts produced in those immense forests, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a> made by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIMINUTIVE\">diminutive</a> bees, which lodge their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURE\">treasure</a> in hollow trunks. The banks of the Guallaga are infested by innumerable swarms of mosquitoes, by which the inhabitants are cruelly tormented; and by that still more formidable animal the cayman or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALLIGATOR\">alligator</a>, which grows here to an enormous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIZE\">size</a>, and is seen lurking about in search of its prey. Father Sobriela, having passed the missionary village of Yurimaguas (where he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> the Indian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of catching the tiger or jaguar, in a kind of trap formed of stakes), arrived at Laguna, the capital of the province of Maynas, situate in 5\u00b0 14' south latitude, on a lake, which, by a narrow channel, enters the Guallaga from the east. This settlement is not above thirty miles from\nthe confluence of the Guallaga with the main channel of the Amazons. It is the residence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-PRESIDENT\">President</a> of the missions, who is assisted by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">Lieutenant</a>-governor. The number of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> is 8895, with nineteen Curates, and a Superior of the missions. Great care is taken to train the Indians to industry and to habits of morality; and the benevolent efforts of the ecclesiastics have so far succeeded, that the natives unite, with their ordinary employments of hunting and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISHING\">fishing</a>, the cultivation of little fields of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol19.html#article-RICE\">rice</a> and sugar-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CANES\">canes</a>. The villages of this province trade with each other, and with Quito, and Lamas, in salted fish, chocolate, wax, and vegetable candles, being the fruit of a tree, which, when lighted, presents both wax and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WICK\">wick</a>; and the reformation which has been thus brought about in the habits of the native tribes, must be chiefly ascribed to the address, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a>, and indefatigable zeal of the Spanish missionaries, and to the benevolent principles upon which they proceed.\n\nIn 1791 the viceroy of Peru received an order to extend and secure the labours of the missionaries; and Father Girval was in consequence instructed to survey the great river Ucayale, which falls into the Amazons from the south, and which may be considered indeed as the main stream, as its course is longer, and as it also contains a larger body of water. In the course of three successive voyages, undertaken in 1791 and 1794, this enterprising missionary ascended the Ucayale, which he explored to its confluence with the Pachitea. Having two canoes with fourteen Omaguan Indians, robust and dexterous rowers, he made great progress, frequently meeting with fleets of canoes filled with the natives, whom he always contrived either to soothe or to escape. The Guallaga and the Ucayale, which bound on the west and east the immense plains known under the name of Pampas del Sacramento, hold a parallel course at the distance of between 300 or 400 miles, until they fall into the Amazons; and it was an object of Father Girval's expedition, to discover whether there existed any navigable streams by which a communication might be opened across the country between these two rivers. After sixteen days navigation, he reached the Manoa, which falls into the Ucayale from the west; and, notwithstanding the rapidity of its stream, he proceeded to ascend it, expecting that it might either conduct him to the Guallaga, or to some of its tributary streams. Being obliged, however, to proceed partly by land, he found the road exceedingly difficult and dangerous on account of the precipices and thick woods; and having discovered a large river, which he supposed to be the Guallaga, but which afterwards proved to be the Manoa, the river he had previously ascended, he returned to the Ucayale; and, embarking on its stream, he arrived on the Amazons, and, ascending this river, he reached the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MISSION\">mission</a> of the Maynas on the Guallaga, after an absence of four months.\n\nFather Girval proceeded on his second voyage in 1791. He entered the Ucayale on the 14th November, unaccompanied by any soldier or white <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a>. The natives received him with great cordiality, though he was afraid of encountering the Casibos on the eastern shore, reputed the most ferocious tribe in those regions. But those whom he chiefly met in this part of the river, belonged to the tribe of the Comibos, who are more peaceable and humane, and, who generally, with their rude flutes, make signals of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITALITY\">hospitality</a> and peace. They navigate the river in large canoes, from sixteen to twenty yards in length, which they will employ a whole year in hollowing out of a single tree. This they accomplish by means of sharp stones and fire. The canoes of the Paros, another tribe of native Indians, afterwards began to make their appearance; and father Girval proceeded up the river, accompanied by a bark and sixty canoes of friendly savages. Arrived at the river Manoa, he immediately began, in consequence of the orders of the viceroy, to inquire for the beautiful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BIRD\">bird</a> called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARBUNCLE\">Carbuncle</a>, which is said to be about half a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-YARD\">yard</a> in height, of a most exquisite plumage; while its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a> is also finely spotted. He was informed, that it was known to the Piro tribe, who inhabit the upper banks of the Ucayale. The next object of inquiry was, whether any of the tributary streams of the Guallaga and the Ucayale, approached so near each other as to facilitate the communication between the principal streams; and this point, so important to the future civilization of the country, was established by this second journey of father Girval. It was found that, from the Manoa, which enters the Ucayale from the west, the distance to the Chipurana, which enters the Guallaga from the east, is not great. A party of ten men and two women, being accordingly dispatched in this direction, reached the head waters of the Chipurana, after dragging their canoes over the land, which is here a beautiful plain, only one day; and embarking on this stream, they soon entered the Guallaga, which they descended to its junction with the Amazons, after a journey of fifteen days.\n\nIn a subsequent voyage, undertaken in the year 1794, father Girval ascended the Ucayale for about 600 miles, to its junction with the Pachitea. He found the river flowing in a gentle current, and abounding with fish, while animals of chace swarmed upon its shores. The savage tribes were generally pacific, and seemed to speak different dialects of the same language. Besides hunting and fishing, they cultivate a few herbs, particularly the Yuca, from which they extract an intoxicating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRINK\">drink</a>; they also gather cotton, which serves them for the slight clothing which they wear, and they use axes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>. They seem to be very dextrous at extracting an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POISON\">poison</a> from noxious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a>; and so great is their confidence in the deadly power which it gives to their arms, that they will awake the fury, and await the attack of the fiercest tiger. They laugh when he prepares to spring, and, aiming at him the fatal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHAFT\">shaft</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARROW\">arrow</a> flies, and he is dead. War is their ruling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>, and they are almost continually engaged in hostility with the neighbouring tribes.\n\nThe interior navigable communications which have been disclosed by the journeys of those adventurous missionaries, may be of considerable importance to the commerce of South America. The sources of the Rio Guallaga, are not above two or three days' journey from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIMA\">Lima</a>, which may thus open an intercourse, not only with the whole in-\nterior of the country, but even with Europe. The productions of Peru may be carried down the great rivers Ucayale or the Guallaga, to the mouth of the Amazons, and from thence to Europe, in the space of five or six weeks; while it would require four months to reach the same point by doubling Cape <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HORN\">Horn</a>. But where the waters of an immense Continent, in their course to the sea, pass through the territories of different nations, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> arrangements are frequently necessary to secure the advantages of nature. The Amazons, for about one thousand miles of its course, is in the power of the Portuguese; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PORTUGAL\">Portugal</a> has refused to the Spaniards the free navigation of this important river; although the cultivation of those extensive regions, situated on the eastern declivity of the Andes, and the prosperity of their inhabitants, depend, in a great measure, on the possession of this valuable privilege. It is to be hoped, however, that more liberal views will prevail; and that, in the present era of increasing improvement, the Portuguese government will not persist in imposing such a pernicious and useless restriction on the commerce of a great Continent.\n\nThe latest, and by far the most interesting journey, which has been undertaken into the interior of America, is that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARON\">Baron</a> de Humboldt, a Prussian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol10.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>; who having, by a long course of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a>, instructed himself in all those important branches of knowledge, both moral and physical, necessary to form an accomplished traveller, set out, under the impulse of his own ardent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a>, and love of science, to explore the wonders which nature has so profusely displayed in the interesting regions of the new world. He was accompanied by M. Bonpland, who, to indefatigable zeal, joined extensive acquisitions in science; and those two travellers arrived, in July 1799, at the port of Cumana, in South America. They employed the remainder of the year in visiting the coasts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIA\">Paria</a>, the missions of the Indian Chaymas, the province of New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANDALUSIA\">Andalusia</a> (a country liable to the most frightful earthquakes, and of which the climate, though the hottest, is perhaps one of the most salubrious in the world), New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARCELONA\">Barcelona</a>, Venezuela, and Spanish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUIANA\">Guiana</a>. In the beginning of the year 1800, leaving the Caracas, they went to visit the beautiful valleys of Aragua; and, proceeding southwards from Porto <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CABELLO\">Cabello</a>, they crossed the immense plains of Cabo Boza, the Apure, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORINOCO\">Orinoco</a>. They next traversed the Llanos, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a> similar to those in Africa, wholly without vegetation, and where, by the operation of a vertical sun upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>, the horizon everywhere exhibits the well-known illusion of the distant sea. The country is here such an uniform level, that, for a space of 2000 square leagues, the inequality of the ground does not exceed five inches. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> is excessive; the thermometer, in the shade, rising by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVERBERATION\">reverberation</a> of the sun's rays, to 110 and 115 degrees of Fahrenheit's scale. The parched <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> conceals crocodiles and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERPENTS\">serpents</a>, which lie in a state of torpor, till they are called into life and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> by the periodical torrents which, for a time, deluge those barren regions. Humboldt and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a> travelled whole days in this pathless expanse, without meeting with a single shrub, or with one solitary dwelling, to refresh the eye. At St Fernando d'Apure, they commenced a most fatiguing navigation of 1000 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">marine</a> leagues, which they performed in canoes, laying down an accurate chart of the country through which they proceeded. They descended the stream of the Apure, which falls into the Orinoco, at the 7th degree of latitude; and, remounting the last river, they reached the confluence of the Guaviari, after passing the celebrated cataracts of Mapures and Atures. They afterwards ascended several rivers of interior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTE\">note</a>; and from the mission of Sarita, they travelled over-land to the sources of the Rio Negro; which Condamine saw at its point of junction with the Amazons, and which he designates a sea of smooth water. About thirty Indians carried their canoes through lofty forests, to the creek of Pemichin. By this rivulet, they entered the Rio Negro, which they descended to Fort-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol6.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a>. From this station, ascending the river Cassiquari, they reached the Orinoco; and from thence they proceeded to the volcano of Daida, and to the mission of Esmeralda, near the sources of the last mentioned river. These sources they were prevented from reaching by the Guanicas, a pigmy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>, of a fair <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a>, but exceedingly warlike and ferocious. From the mission of Esmeralda, Humboldt and his companion descended the Orinoco to its mouth; and, in the course of this painful navigation, they were exposed to sufferings of every sort. They were in want both of food and shelter; and, during the night, they were exposed to the periodical rains, which fell in torrents. If they went a-shore to seek shelter or subsistence in the woods, they were tormented by the muskitoes, and by other loathsome insects; if they ventured to bathe their parched limbs in the stream, they were in danger of being devoured by the crocodile; or of being attacked by a small species of voracious crab; and, in addition to all these evils, they were exposed to the unhealthy exhalations of a moist climate under a burning sun.\n\nHaving escaped these various dangers, they returned to Cumana, where, after remaining for some months, they set sail for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUBA\">Cuba</a>; and returning from this island to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARTHAGENA\">Carthagena</a>, they successively visited the cities of Quito, Santa Fe, Lima, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUAYAQUIL\">Guayaquil</a>; and, proceeding to the province of New Mexico, they staid in that country for about a year; from whence they returned to France, by the way of North America.\n\nThose illustrious travellers have been since engaged in communicating to the world the result of their inquiries, which are of such extent, that they embrace every object connected either with nature or with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>. The works which they have already published abound in the most valuable details, relative to the political institutions of the country, the manners of the people, and the state of the economical arts; while they contain besides much curious information, of great importance to general science. Of these various and interesting details, we shall endeavour to present our readers with an abstract, under the articles to which they more particularly relate; and, in the meantime, it may be added, that the researches of Humboldt have tended to correct many prevailing errors in the geography of America; as he has accurately fixed the position of nearly","sp":483,"ep":493},{"h":"AMERICA","t":"UNITED <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">STATES</a> OF.

His father, Dr Nathaniel Ames, who practised as a physician in Bridgewater, died in 1764, leaving his mother with four sons and one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a>. Of these Fisher was the youngest; and though his mother was left in narrow circumstances, she determined to educate him with the utmost care. He accordingly began the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of Latin when he was six years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, and in July 1770, soon after he was twelve years old, he was admitted to Harvard <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">College</a>; previous to which, he was examined by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol10.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> accustomed to teach the languages, who expressed surprise at his uncommon quickness and accuracy. At the university, the singular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a> and mildness of his character, joined to the pleasantness and vivacity of his manners, endeared him both to his companions and to his instructors. He was scrupulous in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to his studies, and equally so in the choice of his associates; by which means he soon acquired the character of shining parts, and of unblemished morals.\n\nAmong the students who attended this seminary, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> was formed for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a>, and Mr Ames here first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> his talents for contemporaneous eloquence. But though he was resolved to embrace the profession of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, several years passed away before he entered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> a course of professional study. During this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, he appears to have maintained himself chiefly by teaching a school; and his intervals of leisure were filled up by a diligent perusal of the works of classical writers, both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a>.\n\nHe at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> commenced his professional <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CAREER\">career</a> at Dedham, his native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, in the year 1781; and he soon began to be distinguished by his eloquence as a pleader. At this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, however, his attention was attracted to public events, which began to be unusually interesting, and to threaten the rupture which afterwards took place between the colonies and the mother <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. Mr Ames espoused the cause of the former, and though he was not of an age at the commencement of the contest to take any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a>, he watched its progress with all the anxiety of a genuine patriot. In the course of this eventful struggle, the provisional rulers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a> were greatly distressed for the means of paying the troops, and of defraying the other necessary expenses of the state; and they were therefore induced to have recourse to the most exceptionable expedients. Among these, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> of a depreciated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> currency formed a standing resource, and this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> was also accompanied by an arbitrary regulation of prices. Of all these projects Mr Ames was a zealous opposer. At a meeting of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVENTION\">Convention</a> of Delegates assembled at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONCORD\">Concord</a>, he pointed out the certain mischief which would result from attempts of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>; expatiating, in strong terms, on the futility and injustice of endeavouring to regulate by force the value of that which must be fixed in the market by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUNTARY\">voluntary</a> consent of the buyer and the seller.\n\nIn the convention for ratifying the federal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> in 1788, Mr Ames acted a conspicuous part. He was chosen the same year a member of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUSE\">House</a> of Representatives, and for eight years he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> a firm supporter of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WASHINGTON\">Washington</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMINISTRATION\">administration</a>. In the contests occasioned in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> by the progress of the French revolution, he appears to have been a keen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARTISAN\">partisan</a> of the powers combined against France; and in the controversy which took place between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> and America, respecting the privilege of the neutral powers during <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, he espoused the cause of the belligerent; pleading warmly for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MARITIME\">maritime</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> of Britain in their fullest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>. In his zealous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSTILITY\">hostility</a> against France, he advised his countrymen, both in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> speeches and writings, to submit to all the restrictions imposed by this country on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> of the neutral powers.\n\nIn the year 1796, he retired from public business...\nin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of his declining <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>; but he still continued a diligent writer of political essays. The purpose of these publications was generally to support the declining cause of the federalists,\u2014to vindicate the policy of Britain,\u2014and to awaken the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JEALOUSY\">jealousy</a> of his countrymen against the hostile and ambitious views of France. His health, however, which had been on the decline since the year 1796, was now broken, and though he was chosen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-PRESIDENT\">president</a> of Harvard college, he was obliged to decline the office. He continued for two years in a state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> debility, and on the 4th July 1804 he expired. When intelligence reached Boston of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, a meeting of the citizens took place to testify their respect for his services and character, and at their request, his remains were brought to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERMENT\">interment</a>.\n\nIn America, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LITERARY\">literary</a> character of Fisher Ames appears to be held in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> estimation; and some of his countrymen have even been absurd enough to compare him to Burke. We perused his essays with a curiosity greatly excited by so ambitious a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a>; but without being able to discover one trait of resemblance to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of political <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> and eloquent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>;\u2014without perceiving anything much above mediocrity, either in thought <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>;\u2014and with frequent feelings of tedium and disgust, excited by abortive strainings after imagery and eloquence.

It requires rather more than three times its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> to dissolve it. By proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a>, the sal-ammoniac may be obtained in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CRYSTALS\">crystals</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIMITIVE\">primitive</a> form of these crystals, according to Haury, is the octahedron; but most frequently they appear in the state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> four-sided pyramids, or of thin plates, like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a> blades. It often assumes the form of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PLUMOSE\">plumose</a> crystals, consisting of long hexahedral pyramids attached to a stem. These crystals contain a little water, and therefore dissolve in somewhat less than three times their weight of cold water. A hundred parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALCOHOL\">alcohol</a>, of the specific gravity 0.834, dissolve 13 parts of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>.\n\nWhen exposed to a moist <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>, it gradually absorbs water and deliquesces, though very slowly. When heated, it sublimes unaltered in a white <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a>, having a peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a>, very characteristic of sal-ammoniac. If a cold body be presented to this smoke, the sal-ammoniac condenses <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> it, and forms a white crust. When thus sublimed, it has the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> along with it various bodies, which, when heated by themselves, are perfectly fixed. Thus, if it be mixed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a>, filings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, or oxide of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>, these substances rise along with it, and tinge the sal-ammoniac purple, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>.\n\nIf quicklime or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POTASH\">potash</a> be triturated with sal-ammoniac, a strong smell of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol2.html#article-AMMONIA\">ammonia</a> exhales. If sulphuric acid be poured upon it, vapours of muriatic acid are separated in abundance. If equal bulks of muriatic acid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAS\">gas</a>, and ammoniacal gas be brought into contact, they immediately combine and condense into sal-ammoniac. These facts, which are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> known, show us, that sal-ammoniac is a salt composed of muriatic acid and ammonia. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of this salt seems to have been first discovered by Tournefort in 1700. The experiments of Geoffroy junior in 1716, and 1723, were still more decisive, and those of Duhamel, in 1735, left no doubt upon the subject. Various experiments have been made by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> chemists, to determine the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> of the constituents of this salt. But its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a> is attended with peculiar difficulties, on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of the volatility of the sal-ammoniac, and the want of a simple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of determining the proportion of ammonia. Dr Thomson first pointed out a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> by synthesis, which has the advantage of being very simple, and at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> rigidly accurate. He observed, that Ammonia when muriatic gas, and ammoniacal gas, both as dry as possible, are brought in contact with each other, they always combine in equal volumes. Therefore, sal-ammoniac is composed of 100 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> of muriatic acid gas, united with 100 measures of ammoniacal gas. Now, 100 cubic inches of muriatic acid weigh 38.979 grains, and 100 cubic inches of ammoniacal gas weigh 18 grains. Hence, sal-ammoniac is composed of\n\n| Muriatic acid | 38.979 |\n| Ammonia      | 18.000 |\n\nOr of\n\n| Muriatic acid | 68.41 | 100 |\n| Ammonia       | 31.59 | 46.178 |\n\nThis gives us the exact proportions of the acid and base. But, at present, we are not in possession of any exact method of determining the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of water which the salt contains. From the property which the salt has of deliquescing in a moist <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, it is obvious, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> of water must be considerable. Hence, it is probable, that the quantity of water in this salt is pretty great.\n\nAn integrant particle of muriatic acid weighs 4.762, and an integrant particle of ammonia 2.149. Hence, it is obvious, that sal-ammoniac is composed of one integrant particle of muriatic acid, united to one integrant particle of ammonia.\n\nBut there is another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> in which the composition of this salt may be viewed. Muriatic acid is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> of chlorine and hydrogen. It has been shown, that most of the substances hitherto called muriates are in fact chlorides, or combinations of chlorine, with the metallic bases of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol4.html#article-ALKALIES\">alkalies</a>, earths, or metallic oxides respectively. Thus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> salt is a chloride of sodium, or a compound of chlorine and sodium; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HORN\">horn</a> silver is a chloride of silver, or a compound of chlorine and silver. Now, of all the bases capable of combining with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a>, amounting to fifty at least, every one is known to contain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OXYGEN\">oxygen</a> except ammonia. It would be singular if such a solitary exception were to exist. Hence, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> is in favour of the supposition that ammonia contains oxygen. If a hole be dug in a piece of sal-ammoniac; if this hole be slightly moistened by breathing on it; if a globule of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a> be put into it, and this globule be subjected to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of a tolerably powerful galvanic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATTERY\">battery</a>, the mercury speedily acquires the consistence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a>, and swells up so, as to amount to nearly four times its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> bulk. In short, it is converted into an amalgam. Ammonia itself may be substituted for sal-ammoniac; but the experiment, in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, is attended with greater difficulty. In this case, the ammonia is evidently decomposed by the galvanic energy, and one of its constituents has combined with the mercury, and converted it into an amalgam. If the amalgam be put under water, it is speedily reduced to the state of pure mercury, while, in the meantime, ammonia and hydrogen gas\nAmmoniac, Sal\n\nAmmoniac, are evolved. The same thing happens, if the amalgam be put into a glass tube without any water.\n\nNow, no instance can be produced of any substance uniting with mercury, and forming an amalgam which retains the metallic lustre, except a metal. Hence, we are entitled to infer, that the mercury in the preceding experiment has united with a metal, and that the base of ammonia is therefore a metal. Gay-Lussac and Thenard have endeavoured to show, that the amalgam is a compound of hydrogen and mercury. Supposing their experiments correct, the inference would be, that hydrogen in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONCRETE\">concrete</a> state is a metal, and that azote, the other constituent of ammonia, is a compound of hydrogen and oxygen. But, whatever shall be the fate of these inferences, it seems reasonable to conclude, from the preceding experiment, that ammonia is a compound of oxygen, and an unknown metallic basis, to which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of ammonium has been given.\n\nNow, supposing this conclusion correct, is it not probable that sal-ammoniac, like the other supposed muriates, is in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a> a chloride? This supposition is much strengthened, by comparing sal-ammoniac with the other salts having a base of ammonia. Sulphate of ammonia, sulphite of ammonia, nitrate of ammonia, and, in short, the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a> of ammoniacal salts, are decomposed when exposed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>. But sal-ammoniac is sublimed unaltered. This difficult decomposition characterizes all the chlorides. But if sal-ammoniac be a chloride, it is obvious, that the hydrogen in the muriatic acid must find a quantity of oxygen in the ammonia, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> capable of saturating it, and converting it into water. But 100 muriatic acid contain 2.86 hydrogen, which requires 21\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) of oxygen to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> them into water. Therefore, 46.175 ammonia contain 21\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) oxygen. Of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, ammonia is composed of:\n\n| Ammonium | 24.511 or 100 |\n| Oxygen   | 21.666 88.39 |\n\nand chloride of ammonium, or pure sal-ammoniac, is a compound of 97.14 chlorine + 24.511 ammonium, or of one atom of chlorine, and one atom of ammonia.\n\nIf this analysis of sal-ammoniac be correct, as we think it is, it follows that this salt, when purest and driest, contains one integrant particle of chloride of ammonium, and thirty-seven integrant particles of water. Or, that it is composed by weight of:\n\n| Chloride of ammonium | 75.07 |\n| Water                | 24.93 |\n\nBut if the smallest quantity of water which sal-ammoniac, made from perfectly dry muriatic acid gas and ammoniacal gas, can contain, be almost one fourth of its weight, the inconclusiveness of the experiments of Bostock, Trail, and Murray, respecting the possibility of extricating water from sal-ammoniac, made by uniting these two gases, becomes too evident to require any refutation.\n\nThe name sal-ammoniacus occurs in Pliny. (Lib. xxxi. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>. vii.) He tells us, that it was applied to a kind of fossil-salt found below the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>, in a district of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CYRENAICA\">Cyrenaica</a>, from which circumstance its name was derived. It was similar in appearance to the alumena scissile, had a disagreeable taste, but was useful in medicine. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> is, that the sal-ammoniac of the ancients was the same as that of the moderns; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of Pliny is far from being sufficient to decide the point. The native sal-ammoniac of Bucharia, as described by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODEL\">Model</a> and Karsten, and which was analyzed by Klapproth, has no resemblance to the salt described by Pliny. The same remark applies to the sal-ammoniac of volcanoes. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIOSCORIDES\">Dioscorides</a>, in mentioning sal-ammoniac, (Book v. chap. cxxvi.) makes use of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHRASE\">phrase</a> quite irreconcilable with the description of Pliny, and rather applicable to rock-salt, than to our sal-ammoniac. Sal-ammoniac, he says, is peculiarly prized, if it can be easily split into rectangular fragments. Finally, we have no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> whatever, that sal-ammoniac occurs at present, either near the temple of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMMON\">Ammon</a>, or in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of Cyrenaica. These circumstances induce us to conclude, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> sal-ammoniac was applied as indefinitely by the ancients, as most of their other chemical words. It may have been given to the same salt, which is known to the moderns by that appellation, but was not confined to it.\n\nThe name \"sal-ammoniac\" is derived, according to some, from the temple of Jupiter Ammon, in the neighbourhood of which it was found; according to others, from a district of Cyrenaica called Ammonia; but, according to Pliny, from the sand in which it occurred,\u2014the Greek name for sand being \u1f00\u03bc\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2.\n\nBut whether our sal-ammoniac was known to the ancients or not, there can be no doubt that it was well known to the Alchemists. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALBERTUS_MAGNUS\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALBERTUS\">Albertus</a> Magnus, in his treatise De Alchymia, informs us, that there were two kinds of sal-ammoniac, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> and an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a>. The natural was sometimes white, and sometimes red; the artificial was more useful to the chemist. He does not tell us how it was prepared, but he describes the method of subliming it, which can leave no doubt that it was real sal-ammoniac. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPERA\">Opera</a> Mineralia of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Hollandus the father, addressed to his son, there is likewise a description of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of subliming sal-ammoniac. There can be no doubt then, that true sal-ammoniac was known in the thirteenth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BASIL\">Basil</a> Valentine, in his Currus Triumphalis Antimonii, describes some of the peculiar properties of sal-ammoniac in a still less equivocal manner, if possible. But after the two older writers already quoted, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> is unnecessary.\n\nSal-ammoniac occurs native in Bucharia, and probably in other parts of the world. It is found also in small quantities near volcanoes, being formed during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> convulsions of these mountains. This fact seems in corroboration of an opinion advanced by some mineralogists, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol10.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a> of volcanoes is pit-coal, and that they are always\nAmmoniac, moistened with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>-water; for sal-ammoniac is sublimed in small quantities during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> bricks, the sand of which is brought from the sea-shore, while the fuel is pit-coal.\n\nIn the Latin, English, and French chemical books, published in the seventeenth, and the beginning of the eighteenth century, the name of this salt is usually written sal-armoniac. This we conceive to be an old German word; for Agricola has given us an alphabetical catalogue of all the Latin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TECHNICAL\">technical</a> terms which he uses in his works, with a German translation of each. Now, the German translation which he gives of sal-ammoniacus is sal-armoniac. The present German name for this salt is salmiak.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a> is the country where sal-ammoniac was first manufactured, and from which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> for many years was supplied with it. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> was first carried on by the Venetians, and afterwards by the Dutch. Nothing was known about the method employed by the Egyptians till the year 1719. In 1716, Geoffroy junior read a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> to the French Academy, showing that sal-ammoniac must be formed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUBLIMATION\">sublimation</a>. But his opinion was opposed so violently by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOMBERG\">Homberg</a> and Lemaire, that the paper was not printed. In 1719, M. Lemaire, the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSUL\">Consul</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CAIRO\">Cairo</a>, sent the Academy an account of the mode of manufacturing sal-ammoniac in Egypt. The salt it appeared was obtained by simple sublimation from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SOOT\">soot</a>. In the year 1760, Linnaeus communicated to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> a correct detail of the whole process, which he had received from Dr Hasselquist, who had travelled in that country as a naturalist. This account is published in the 51st <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the Philosophical Transactions (1760, p. 504).\n\nAlmost the only fuel used in Egypt is the dung of cattle. This is collected during the four first months of the year, when the cattle feed on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> grass, which in Egypt is a kind of clover. It is dried, and sold to the common people as fuel. The soot from this fuel is carefully collected and sold to the sal-ammoniac makers, who only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> during the months of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a>; for at other periods of the year the dung of their cattle is not fit for their purpose. An <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a> oven is built of bricks and moist dung, as long again as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, and of such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> that the outside or flat part of the top of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> may hold fifty glass vessels, ten in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>, and five in breadth, each vessel having a cavity left for it in the brick work of the arch. These glass vessels are globular, with a neck an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a> long, and two inches wide. In general, they are about eighteen inches in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a>. Each vessel is coated over with a fine clay found in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NILE\">Nile</a>, and afterwards with straw. They are filled two-thirds with soot, and put into their holes at the top of the oven. At first a gentle fire is raised, and the temperature is gradually increased to the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, at which it is kept for three days. A smoke with a sourish smell, not unpleasant, issues first from the glasses, then the salt sublimes, and coats the upper part of the vessel.\n\nIt was long supposed, that camels' <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-URINE\">urine</a> and camels' dung were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> for the success of the above process. But this is a mistake. The dung of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>-cattle, horses, sheep, goats, &c. are all used promiscuously. The dung of these animals contains the sal-ammoniac ready formed. This depends upon the food which the animals live on, and accordingly it is only fit for the purpose at one season of the year. The soot contains the sal-ammoniac likewise ready formed, and merely mixed with a quantity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CHARCOAL\">charcoal</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>, &c. from which it is freed by sublimation. Chaptal informs us, that he found sal-ammoniac in the soot obtained by burning the dung of cattle that had fed on the saline <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> in the marshes near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a>. Thus the Egyptian method of obtaining sal-ammoniac is the simplest possible.\n\nThe first attempt to manufacture sal-ammoniac in Europe was made by Mr Goodwin, a chemist of London, about the beginning of the eighteenth century. We do not know his process accurately; but he appears to have used the mother ley of common salt and putrid urine as ingredients. Dossie, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INSTITUTES\">Institutes</a> of Experimental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">Chemistry</a>, gives it as his opinion, that the salt obtained by this process was not sal-ammoniac, but sulphate of ammonia, and even describes a process for subliming that salt. But he must have been mistaken; for sulphate of ammonia, as appears from the experiments of Hatchett, is entirely decomposed when we attempt to sublime it. Goodwin's process, however, whatever it was, did not succeed, and was speedily abandoned. In the year 1740, a patent was taken out for making sal-ammoniac by a London <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANUFACTURER\">manufacturer</a>. The process was nearly the same as Goodwin's, and was equally unsuccessful. The first successful manufacture of sal-ammoniac in this country was established in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> by Dr Hutton and Mr Davy. We do not know in what year the manufactory was begun, but as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> was concerted while these gentlemen were students at the university of Edinburgh, the establishment of the work cannot have been far from the year 1760. From the University of Edinburgh, Dr Hutton went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>. During his absence, Mr Davy began the manufactory, and, on his return, admitted him as a partner. This original manufactory existed in Edinburgh till within these few years. The low price of sal-ammoniac during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-WAR\">war</a> with Russia, induced the proprietors to abandon it, as was the case with almost all the sal-ammoniac works in Britain.\n\nSal-ammoniac was first manufactured in France by Baume, who established a work about the year 1760; but whether it was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POSTERIOR\">posterior</a> or anterior to the work of Hutton and Davy, we do not know. Manufactories of it were afterwards established in Germany, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLANDERS\">Flanders</a>.\n\nVarious modes were followed in Europe to procure this salt. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> (if we can apply the term here) of most of the manufacturers was the same. They formed a sulphate of ammonia, which they mixed with common salt. A double decomposition took <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>. The sulphuric acid of the sulphate united with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SODA\">soda</a> of the common salt, and formed Glauber's salt, which was obtained in great abundance by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CRYSTALLIZATION\">crystallization</a>, and sold as a medicine. The muriatic acid and ammonia, uniting together, formed sal-ammoniac, which was sublimed. When the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">Government</a> imposed a heavy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a> on Glauber salts, the manufacture of sal-ammoniac in\nAmmoniac, this country received so severe a blow, that it is not likely ever to recover it. We shall give a short sketch of the processes followed in different manufactories, in order to afford a more distinct idea of the method of procuring this salt.\n\nBefore the French revolution, several manufactures of sal-ammoniac existed in Flanders, which deserve to be described; first, because they were in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of the original Egyptian method. Bricks, or rather balls, were formed of the following materials: twenty-five parts of pounded pit-coal, five parts of soot, two parts of clay, and as much of a saturated aqueous solution of common salt, as was sufficient to convert the whole into a paste; this paste was moulded in an iron mould, and the balls suffered to dry. These were burnt in a brick <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FURNACE\">furnace</a>, along with a quantity of dry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BONES\">bones</a>, the proportion of which does not appear to have been accurately determined. The furnace communicated by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APERTURE\">aperture</a>, two inches wide, into a vaulted brick chamber above. From the top of this chamber, there was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a>, likewise two inches wide, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GALLERY\">gallery</a>, which terminated in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> chimney. The fire was kept up with these materials for five or six months, and then allowed to go out. By the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMBUSTION\">combustion</a> of the pit-coals, soot, and bones, a quantity of carbonate of ammonia is formed. The common salt is decomposed by the clay, and muriatic acid disengaged. This acid coming in contact with the carbonate of ammonia, decomposes it, and sal-ammoniac is formed. The sides and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a> of the vaulted chamber are found coated with this impure sal-ammoniac, which is carefully removed. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> of the chamber, and the horizontal gallery above, contain likewise sal-ammoniac; but so much loaded with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BITUMEN\">bitumen</a>, that it requires to be burnt a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> time before the sal-ammoniac can be extracted. The impure sal-ammoniac is put into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGG\">egg</a>-shaped clay vessels, twenty inches long, and sixteen in diameter. Each is filled to within three inches of the top. The lower part of these vessels is exposed to a graduated heat for forty-eight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a>, while the upper part, being left in the air, is comparatively cool. The oily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> is first driven off; and then the sal-ammoniac is sublimed in a cake in the upper part of the vessel. The charcoal, and any other fixed matter present, remains at the bottom. Finally, the clay vessels are broken, and the cakes of sal-ammoniac taken out. There is a small hole in the upper part of the clay vessels, and care is taken to keep this hole open during the whole process, to prevent the vessels from bursting. Fifteen parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOOTY\">sooty</a> matter, taken from the vaulted chambers, yield about five parts of sal-ammoniac. Journal des <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINES\">Mines</a>, No. x. p. 3.\n\nThe original process of Baum\u00e9 was to distil animal substances, in order to procure from them carbonate of ammonia. With this salt he decomposed the muriate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNESIA\">magnesia</a>, which exists in considerable quantity in the mother ley of common salt, when that substance is procured from sea water; the liquid containing the sal-ammoniac was evaporated, and the sal-ammoniac sublimed.\n\nThis process was speedily abandoned, and another substituted in its place, by MM. Leblanc and Diz\u00e9. They brought into contact, in a leaden chamber, vapours of ammonia and of muriatic acid. The ammonia was procured by distilling animal substances, and the muriatic acid by decomposing common salt by means of sulphuric acid. But this method, though it yielded a very pure sal-ammoniac, was speedily abandoned on account of its expense.\n\nThe process of Hutton and Davy was to procure ammonia, which they did chiefly from soot. This they converted into sulphate of ammonia. The sulphate was mixed with common salt, and thus two salts were procured; Glauber's salt, which they obtained by crystallization, and sal-ammoniac, which was sublimed.\n\nAlmost all the manufactures of sal-ammoniac, whether in Britain, France, or Germany, were similar in principle to that of Hutton and Davy. The only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> consisted in the means employed to procure the sulphate of ammonia. We shall describe a manufacture, formerly existing in London, in which the methods employed were both scientific and economical.\n\nThe material from which the ammonia was extracted was bones. These were collected in the streets, and from dunghills, chiefly by old women. The bones were bruised and boiled, in order to extract the fat which they contained, which was sold to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOAP\">soap</a>-makers. They were then put into iron cylinders eight feet long, and three feet in diameter, placed horizontally over a fire-place, so that they could be made red hot. At one end of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a> was a mouth, about fourteen inches in diameter, by which the bones were introduced. This mouth was accurately shut by a cover, and made air-tight by means of lute. From the other end of the cylinder proceeded a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a>-iron <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIPE\">pipe</a>, from six to eight inches in diameter, and twenty feet long, terminating in one or more oblong leaden receivers, which were kept cool by water placed in a leaden vessel, the bottom of which formed their cover, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNCTURE\">juncture</a> being secured by lute. Of these receivers there were commonly two to each still, or three to two stills. Every receiver was about twelve feet long, one foot deep, and fourteen inches wide; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REFRIGERATORY\">refrigeratory</a> that covered it held about four inches in depth of water. At the end most remote from the still was a pipe, fitted with a wooden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLUG\">plug</a>, for the purpose of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> off the condensed liquor; and above this was a hole through which the gas and uncondensible vapour passed off into the open air.\n\nA single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of each still yielded about 86 pounds of impure alkaline liquor, and about 30 pounds of black fetid oil floating on its surface. This latter being skimmed off, the ammonia was saturated with sulphuric acid, either by means of the mother liquor from the green <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VITRIOL\">vitriol</a> makers, or still more economically by means of calcined and pulverized gypsum. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> case the materials were mixed, and left in contact for some hours. A double decomposition took place; the sulphuric acid of the gypsum uniting with the ammonia, while the carbonic acid of the carbonate combined with the lime of the gypsum. The solution of sulphate of ammonia thus produced was mixed with common salt, by which Glauber's salt and sal-ammoniac were formed, and separated from each other.\nFor this purpose the liquid, clarified by subsidence and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECANTATION\">decantation</a>, was transferred into oblong leaden boilers, about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> feet long, three wide, and nine inches deep. Two-thirds of the length of these boilers were set upon iron plates heated by a fire beneath; the remaining part was supported by flat tiles, and defended from the heat by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> brick work. As the water evaporates, the Glauber's salt begins to crystallize. It is swept from time to time to the cool extremity of the boiler, whence it is shovelled into baskets placed over the end of the boiler, that the liquid which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DRAINS\">drains</a> off may not be lost. The evaporation is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> till feathered crystals of sal-ammoniac begin to appear on the surface. The liquid is then run into coolers, and deposits little else than sal-ammoniac till the temperature sinks to 70\u00b0. The crystals must now be removed, that they may not be mixed with the Glauber's salt, which begins at that temperature to be deposited. The sal-ammoniac thus obtained is first drained in baskets, and then exposed to heat in a kind of oven, till the water of crystallization is driven off. It becomes spongy, friable, of an ash-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, mixed with small white filaments.\n\nThis salt is introduced, while still hot, into globular grey earthen jars, fitted with a cover (with a hole of about half an inch diameter in its centre), luted on with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> of clay and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>-dung. These are set in earthen pots over a strong fire, in a furnace of either a circular or oval form, and capable of containing from six to eighteen, surrounded with sand up to the edge of the pot, and also having about 2\u00bd inches of sand on the cover, confined by an iron <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol18.html#article-RING\">ring</a> about three inches deep, and two inches less in diameter than the cover, in order that the luting, should it give way, may be repaired without suffering the covers to be cooled by the removal of the sand; for, during the sublimation, their temperature should be about 320\u00b0. These earthen vessels may be filled with the dried salt, to within two inches of the top. It may be gently pressed in, but not rammed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a>. The fire, which has been lighted some time before, is now to be raised gradually till the iron pots are of a pretty strong red heat all round. They are so placed in the furnace, that the upper part is first heated; the bottoms resting on solid brick work. At first, a quantity of aqueous vapour, carrying with it a portion of the salt, escapes through the hole in the cover. The hole must be left open as long as any moisture exhales. This is known by bringing a cold smooth iron plate near the hole, in order to condense the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUBLIMATE\">sublimate</a>. When the water is gone, the salt attaches itself to this plate, in the form of a dry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEMI\">semi</a>-transparent crust. The hole is now to be stopped up with lute, and more sand put upon the cover. The heat is to be kept up till it is judged that most of the sal-ammoniac, but not the whole, has sublimed. The time requisite for this depending on the furnace, can only be learned by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>. If the heat be continued too long, the cake of sal-ammoniac acquires a yellow colour, and a scorched, opaque, cracked appearance, which, injuring its saleability, ought to be avoided. When the lute gives way, and requires repairing during the process, the appearance of the cake of sal-ammoniac is injured. On this account, glass vessels would be preferable to those of clay. But, in this country, the expense of glass is so great, on account of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> duty laid upon it, that manufacturers are scarcely able to use it in those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> where the vessels must be broken at the end of every process, as is the case in the sublimation of sal-ammoniac. Aikin's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DICTIONARY\">Dictionary</a> of Chemistry, art. Sal-Ammoniac.\n\nOne process more deserves to be mentioned, on account of its ingenuity and simplicity. It is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of Mr Astley, who has secured the exclusive privilege by a patent, and has a manufactory at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BORROWSTOUNNESS\">Borrowstounness</a> on the Firth of Forth, and another at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PORTOBELLO\">Portobello</a>, near Edinburgh. He mixes together animal matters (chiefly woollen rags), with what in Scotland is called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of salt. It is the mother ley that remains after all the crystals of common salt that can be got have been separated from sea water. It consists chiefly of nitrate of magnesia. This mixture is burnt in furnaces, and the produce received in small chambers placed over the furnaces. This produce contains abundance of sal-ammoniac, which is obtained pure by sublimation. We conceive the theory of this process to be, that carbonate of ammonia is formed by the combustion of the animal matter. This carbonate immediately decomposes the nitrate of magnesia, and sal-ammoniac sublimes. In principle, therefore, it does not differ from Baume's original process, though, in point of economy, it is probably greatly superior to it. We have little doubt that Baume's method yields a greater return from the same quantity of materials; but this is probably much more than counterbalanced by the much greater expense attending his process. Nothing can demonstrate this more clearly than the circumstance that his method was abandoned in France as too expensive, though labour be much cheaper in that country than in this, while Mr Astley manufactures his sal-ammoniac with profit in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMPHIBIA\">AMPHIBIA</a>.

Though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> Ana is but of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> origin, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> to which it has been applied, is not of such recent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a> as some persons have imagined. It appears from D'Herbelot's Biblioth\u00e8que Orientale, that, since the earliest periods, the Eastern nations have been in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of preserving the maxims of their sages. From them this practice passed to the Greeks and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-XENOPHON\">Xenophon</a> treasured up and recorded the sayings of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCRATES\">Socrates</a>. From their example, Arrian, in the concluding books of his Enchiridion, which have not descended to posterity, collected the casual observations which had dropped from Epictetus. The numerous apophthegms scattered in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLUTARCH\">Plutarch</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol8.html#article-DIOGENES\">Diogenes</a> Laertius, and other writers, evince that it had been customary in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a> to preserve the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> deliver-\ned by illustrious characters. It appears that Julius Caesar compiled a book of apophthegms, in which he related the bon-mots of Cicero; and Quintilian informs us, that a freedman of that celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-WIT\">wit</a> and orator composed three books of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> entitled De Joici Ciceronis. We are told by Suetonius that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CAIUS\">Caius</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MELISSUS\">Melissus</a>, originally the slave, but afterwards the freedman and Librarian of Maecenas, collected the sayings of his master; and Aulus Gellius has filled his Noctes Atticae with anecdotes which he heard from those distinguished characters whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> he frequented in Rome. Were the books compiled by the freedmen of Cicero and Maecenas now extant, they might be entitled Ana; and it is certainly to be regretted, that we possess no authentic record of the conversational remarks or hints which dropped from the sages, orators, or statesmen of Greece and Rome. How interesting would be a Colloquia Mensalia of Atticus or Caesar!\n\nBut, though vestiges of this species of composition may be traced in the classical ages, it is only in modern times that it has attained to full popularity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LITERARY\">Literary</a> anecdotes, critical reflections, and historical incidents, came to be mingled with the detail of bon-mots and ludicrous tales; so that instruction and entertainment were agreeably blended. The term Ana seems to have been applied to such collections as far back as the beginning of the fifteenth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>. Thus, Francesco Barbaro, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to Poggio, says, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> and anecdotes which Poggio and Bartholomaei Montepolitano had picked up during a literary excursion through Germany, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be called Ana: \"Quemadmodum Mala ab Appio et <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLAUDIA\">Claudia</a> gente Appiana, et pira a Mallio Malliana cognominata sunt, sic habe literarum quae vestr\u00e6 ope et <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPERA\">opera</a> Germania in Italia defecerunt, aliquando et Poggiana et Montepolitana vocabuntur.\"\n\nPoggio Bracciolini, to whom this letter is addressed, and to whom the world is indebted for the preservation of so many classical remains, is the first eminent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> of modern times whose jests and opinions have been transmitted to posterity. Poggio was secretary to five successive Popes. During the pontificate of Martin V., who was chosen in 1417, Poggio and other members of the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CHANCERY\">Chancery</a> were in the habit of assembling in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HALL\">hall</a> adjoining the Vatican, in order to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVERSE\">converse</a> freely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> all subjects. Being more studious of wit than of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, they termed this apartment Buggiale; a word signifying a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of recreation where tales are related, and which Poggio himself interprets Mendaciorum Officina. At these meetings Poggio and his friends discussed the news and scandal of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, and communicated to each other entertaining anecdotes; they attacked what they did not approve, and they approved of little; they also indulged in the utmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LATITUDE\">latitude</a> of satiric remark; dealing out their sarcasms with such impartiality, that they did not spare even the Pope and Cardinals. The pointed jests and humorous stories which occurred in these unrestrained conversations were collected by Poggio, and formed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> materials of his Facetiae, first printed, according to De Bure, in 1470. This celebrated collection, which forms a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the Poggiana, is chiefly valuable as recording interesting anecdotes of eminent men of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. It also contains a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of quibbles or jeux-de-mots, and a still greater number of idle and licentious stories. Many of these, however, are not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a>, some of them being taken from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> authors, and a still greater number from the Fabliaux of the Trouv\u00e8res. Thus the Fabliau La <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CALOTTE\">Calotte</a> des Cordeliers, is the Breccae Divi Francisci of Poggio, Le Menuier d'Aleia, is Poggio's Quinque Ova, Du Vilain et de sa Femme, is his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MULIER\">Mulier</a> Demersa, and du Pr\u00e9 Tomdu, is the Pertinacia Muliebris of the Facetiae. On the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, Poggio has suggested much to succeeding writers. Hans Carvel's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol18.html#article-RING\">Ring</a>, is his Visio Francisci Filifli; and Fontaine's fables,\u2014Le Chatlarian, Le Cog et le Renard, and that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WOLF\">Wolf</a> and Fox pleading before the Ape, are from stories originally related by Poggio. The Facetiae forms, upon the whole, the most amusing and interesting part of the Poggiana printed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMSTERDAM\">Amsterdam</a> in 1720; but this Poggiana collection also comprehends some farther anecdotes of his life, and a few scattered maxims extracted from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAVER\">graver</a> compositions.\n\nThough Poggio was the first person whose remarks and bon-mots were collected under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of Ana, the Scaligerana, which contains the opinions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a> Scaliger, was the first work published under that appellation; and accordingly may be regarded as having led the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a> of publications.\n\nThere are two collections called Scaligerana\u2014a Scaligerana prima and secunda Scaligerana. The first was compiled by a Physician, named Francis Vertunien, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIEUR\">Sieur</a> de Lavau, who attended the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> of the Messieurs Chateigner, in whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> Joseph Scaliger resided. He, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, had frequent opportunities of meeting that celebrated critic, and was in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> of committing to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> the learned or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> observations which dropped from him in the course of conversation; to which he occasionally added remarks of his own. This collection, which was chiefly in Latin, remained in manuscript many years after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of the compiler. It was at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> purchased by M. de Sigogne, who published it in 1669, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of Prima Scaligerana, nusquam antehac edita; bestowing upon it the title prima, in order to preserve its claim of priority over another Scaligerana, which had been published three years before, but had been more recently compiled. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> work, known by the name of Secunda Scaligerana, was collected by two brothers of the name of Vassan, who went to complete their studies at the University of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-LEYDEN\">Leyden</a>, of which Scaliger was at that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> one of the Professors. Being particularly recommended to Scaliger, they were received in his house, and daily enjoyed his conversation; in the course of which, he gave them much information concerning various topics of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> and criticism. The Vassans immediately wrote <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> what they had heard, and soon made up a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> manuscript <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a>, in which, however, there was neither connection nor arrangement of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>. In this state, the manuscript was delivered by one of the Vassans, on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RETIREMENT\">retirement</a> to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONASTERY\">monastery</a>, to M. de Puy; and after passing through various <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, it came into the possession of M. Daille, who, for his own use, arranged the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol8.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> it contained in alphabetical order. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a>\nVossius having come to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> on a visit to M. Daill\u00e9, obtained the loan of the manuscript, which he transcribed, and afterwards published at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAGUE\">Hague</a>, under the title of Scaligerana, sine excerpta ex ore Josephi Scaligeri. This edition was full of inaccuracies and blunders; but a more correct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> was afterwards published by M. Daill\u00e9, with a preface complaining of the use Vossius had made of the manuscript, which he declares was never intended for publication, and was not of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> to be given to the world. Indeed, most literary men in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> conceived, that the Scaligerana, particularly the second, detracted considerably from the reputation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> scholar whose sentiments they recorded. They are full of mistakes and contradictions; and Bayle has remarked, that the Vassans <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> to him observations which it is almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> he could have uttered. Joseph Scaliger, with more extensive erudition, but less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> than his father, Julius Caesar Scaliger, had inherited his ridiculous vanity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOGMATICAL\">dogmatical</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a>. He wished it to be thought that he knew everything, and that his opinions were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INFALLIBLE\">infallible</a>. Conversing with two young students of an university, of which he formed the principal ornament, he would probably be but little cautious in the opinions he expressed, as his literary errors could not be detected or exposed. Unfortunately, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a> admiration of his pupils led them to regard even his most absurd opinions as the responses of an oracle, and his most unmerited censures as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> condemnations. The Scaligerana, accordingly, contain many falsehoods, with much unworthy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> abuse, of the most distinguished characters of the age. Thus, he calls <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARDINAL\">Cardinal</a> Bellarmin a mere atheist (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> atheneus), and compares the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">Duke</a> of Sully to Sejanus. Indeed, M. Daill\u00e9, in his preface to the Secunda Scaligerana, confesses that it contains \"multa futilia, scurrilia, obscena: quamdam manifeste falsa. Ubique de se quisque magnific\u00e9, ne dicam, thraconice, loquitur\u2014landum parcus, convitiorum largus, in omnes contumeliosissime invehitur\u2014denique neminem sibi de manibus elabi patitur, cujus non errata, vitia, naves etiam levissimos, acerrime insectetur, et plusquam cynica licentia arrodat.\"\n\nIn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of the Scaligerana, a prodigious number of similar works appeared in France, towards the end of the seventeenth, and beginning of the eighteenth century. At first, these collections were confined to what had fallen from eminent men in conversation; but they were afterwards made to embrace fragments found among their papers, and even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> extracted from their works, and epistolary correspondence. Of those which merely record the conversations of eminent men, the best known, the fullest, and most valuable, is the Menagiana. Menage was a person of good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, of various and extensive information, and of the most communicative disposition. He lived during the greater part of his life in the best society. An <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a> of literary characters met, during a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of time, at his house every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEDNESDAY\">Wednesday</a>; and, during his latter years, he daily received persons of that description. Much of his time was thus spent in conversation; and those of his friends who habitually enjoyed it were at pains to record his opinions, which were generally founded on a correct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> and judgment; and were always delivered in a manner the most interesting and lively. A collection of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-ORAL\">oral</a> opinions was published in 1693, soon after his death; and this collection, which was entitled Menagiana, was afterwards corrected and enlarged by M. La Monnoye, in an edition published by him in 1715. Among the most curious articles in the Menagiana may be numbered the dissertation on Le Moyen de Parvenir, a work attributed to Beroalde de Verreville; that on Le Songe de Poliphile; as also a letter of La Monnoye on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> of a book supposed to have been entitled De Tribus Impostoribus, concerning which there has been much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a> and controversy.\n\nThe Perroniana, which exhibits the opinions of Perron, Cardinal Perron, was composed from his familiar conversation, by M. de Puy, and published by Vossius, by the same contrivance which put him in possession of the Scaligerana. Some parts of this collection are useful in illustrating the literary and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> history of the age in which Perron lived; but it also contains many puerile, imprudent, and absurd remarks, which it is generally supposed he never uttered, and many of which were proved by M. Chevreau (Chevraeana) to have been the interpolations of his friends. Some of his assertions,\u2014as that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUTHER\">Luther</a> denied the immortality of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a>, and that every English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEASANT\">peasant</a> drinks from a silver goblet,\u2014are evidently <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSE\">false</a>. Nor can much reliance be placed on the judgment or taste of an author, who has elsewhere declared, that a page of Quintus Curtius is worth thirty of Tacitus, and that, next to Quintus Curtius, Florus is the greatest Roman Historian. The Thurna, or observations of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-PRESIDENT\">President</a> De Thou, have usually been published along with the Perroniana. This collection is not extensive, and by no means of such value as might have been expected from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> so able and distinguished.\n\nThe Valoisiana is a collection of the literary opinions of the historiographer Adrian Valois, published by his son. M. Valois was a great student of history, and the Valoisiana, accordingly, comprehends many valuable historical observations, particularly on the works of Du Cange.\n\nThe Fureteriana contains the bas-mots of M. Furetiere, of the French Academy, the stories which he was in the habit of telling, and a number of anecdotes and remarks found among his papers after his decease. This production, however, consists chiefly of short stories, and comprehends but few thoughts, opinions, or criticisms on books. Furetiere, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> known, had a violent quarrel with the French Academy, of which he was a member, concerning his Dictionnaire Universel de la Langue Fran\u00e7oise. Having published a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRELIMINARY\">preliminary</a> discourse, the further <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-PRINTING\">printing</a> was interdicted by the French Academy, which accused him of purloining materials they had amassed for a similar work. This controversy subsisted during the rest of the life of Furetiere, who spent his concluding years in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> and publishing libels on his associates. The Fureteriana, accordingly, is replete with allusions to a subject with which his thoughts were so completely engrossed. In particular, we find there the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>\nand outline of an allegorical and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BURLESQUE\">burlesque</a> poem, entitled *Les Couches de l'Acad\u00e9mie*; in which he has satirized different members of the academy, especially M. Charpentier, one of his bitterest foes, whom he has designated by the name of *Marmecuetier*.\n\nThe *Chevreauana*, so called from M. Chevreau, exhibits more research than most works of a similar description; and is probably more accurate, as it was published during the life of the author, and revised by himself. Among other interesting articles, it contains a learned and ingenious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMENTARY\">commentary</a> on the works of Malherbe, to whom the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a> were highly indebted for the perfection to which they attained.\n\n*Parrhasiana* is the work of Jean Le Clerc, a Professor of Amsterdam, who bestowed this appellation on his miscellaneous productions, with the view of discussing various topics of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> and politics, with more freedom than he could have employed under his own name. This work is not of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> and unconnected description of most of the Ana which have been above enumerated; as it contains much learned philological <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISQUISITION\">disquisition</a>, and a long dissertation on poetry and eloquence. In the first volume, there is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of his published works, and a bitter reply to all those who had censured them.\n\nThe *Huetiana*, which has always held a distinguished place among the Ana, contains the detached thoughts and criticisms of Hu\u00e9t, Bishop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-AVRANCHES\">Avranches</a>, which he himself committed to writing during his life. This author was well fitted to produce a valuable work in this department of literature. He enjoyed the friendship of a number of distinguished characters, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> was various and extensive. This collection, however, was not begun by him till he was far advanced in life. Hu\u00e9t was born in 1630, and, in 1712, he was attacked by a malady which impaired his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>, and rendered him incapable of the sustained <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> necessary for the completion of a long or laborious work. In this situation, he employed himself during the concluding years of his life in throwing his detached observations on paper. These were published by the Abb\u00e9 d'<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OLIVET\">Olivet</a> the year after his death, under the name of *Huetiana*; a work which is not, like some other Ana, a succession of bon-mots or anecdotes; but forms a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of thoughts and criticisms on various topics of morals, philosophy, and literature; and also comprehends pretty long dissertations on the origin of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RHYME\">rhyme</a>, the comparative merit of the ancients and moderns, with similar topics. One of the most instructive discussions to a scholar, in this collection, is that on the Latinization of names and surnames; in which he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> out and criticizes the different modes of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a>. His critical judgments on Montaigne, Rochefoucauld, and Tacitus, seem also well founded; and if some of his opinions in matters of taste betray singular or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFECTIVE\">defective</a> feelings, there are others which appear equally just and refined. But were there no other literary memorials of the Bishop of Avranches, he certainly would not derive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> reputation from the *Huetiana*. D'Alembert has treated this collection with contempt; and has selected some articles to show the Bishop's incompetent judgment and frivolous taste. It may be suspected, indeed, from the circumstances in which the articles contained in the *Huetiana* were composed, that they do not always display that correct judgment which distinguishes many of the other works of this learned writer.\n\nThe *Casauboniana* presents us with the miscellaneous observations, chiefly philological, of the celebrated Isaac Casaubon. During the course of a long life, that eminent commentator was in the daily practice of committing to paper any thing remarkable which he heard in conversation with his friends, especially if it bore on the studies in which he was engaged. He also made diurnal annotations on the works he was employed in reading, with which he connected his judgments concerning the author and his writings. This compilation, which was styled *Ephemerides*, together with its *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADVERSARIA\">Adversaria</a>*, and materials amassed for a refutation of the *Ecclesiastical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANNALS\">Annals</a> of Baronius*, came, at his death, into the possession of his son, Meric Casaubon, who bequeathed the whole to the Bodleian Library at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a>. These were shown to Christopher Wolfius, during a visit which he paid to that university, and having been transcribed by him, were published under the title of *Casauboniana*. This collection consists of opinions concerning various eminent writers; illustrations of passages in scripture; and philological observations and animadversions on the thirty-four first years of the *Annals of Baronius*. The materials and information which it contains are probably more accurate than is usually the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> in works of the same description; as they were not communicated in casual conversation, and reported by others, but were daily committed to writing by Casaubon himself, while the works from which they were derived remained fresh in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOLLECTION\">recollection</a>.\n\nBesides the above, a great many works, under the title of Ana, appeared in France about the same period. Thus, the opinions and conversation of Charpentier, Colomesius, and St Evremond, were recorded in the *Carpenteriana*, *Colomesiana*, and *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARPENTER\">Carpenter</a>-St Evremoniana*; and those of Segrais in the *Segraisiana*;\u2014a collection formed by a person stationed behind the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TAPESTRY\">tapestry</a> in a house where Segrais was accustomed to visit, and of which Voltaire has declared, \"que de tous les Ana c'est celui qui Segraisiana merite le plus d'\u00eatre mis au rang des mensonges imprim\u00e9s, et surtout des mensonges insipides.\" The Ana, indeed, from the popularity which they now enjoyed, were compiled in such numbers, and with so little care, that they became almost proverbial for inaccuracy. About the middle of the eighteenth century, they were sometimes made the vehicles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> squibs,\u2014as in the *Maupouiana*, and of heretical opinions,\u2014as in the *Longueriana*. Thus, the evil naturally began to cure itself, and by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RE\">re</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, which is very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> in regard to all productions of literature, the French Ana sunk in public esteem, as much below their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTRINSIC\">intrinsic</a> value, as they had formerly been exalted above it.\n\nAlthough these collections have been chiefly formed from the oral opinions of eminent men on the Continent, particularly in France, England has also produced one or two examples of this species of composition, which are not altogether undeserving\nof attention. Of these, perhaps, the most curious is the *Walpoliana*, which is a transcript of the literary conversation of Horace Walpole. That multifarious author was distinguished for his resources of anecdote, wit, and judicious remark, as well as for his epistolary qualifications. From his father, Sir Robert Walpole, he had learned many anecdotes concerning the political characters who figured during the period of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMINISTRATION\">administration</a>. He was himself personally acquainted with all the eminent literary characters of his own day in England; and his repeated visits to Paris, and constant correspondence with friends in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-CAPITAL\">Capital</a>, supplied him with the most interesting information with regard to France. A great part of his life was devoted to conversation. While residing at Strawberry-hill, he generally rose from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> about five o'clock, and taking his place on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a>-room sofa, to which his gout in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> confined him, he passed the time till two o'clock in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, in miscellaneous chit-chat, full of singular anecdotes, strokes of wit, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACUTE\">acute</a> observations. As he possessed, and was daily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> such stores of instruction and amusement, it was suggested to him that he ought to form a collection of these anecdotes and observations. This he declined, but he furnished the editor of the *Walpoliana* with many anecdotes in his own hand-writing. After his death, several specimens of this miscellany were published in the *Monthly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGAZINE\">Magazine</a>*; and being afterwards enlarged by anecdotes, retained in the memory of the editor, or communicated by others, were published in two volumes, under the title of *Walpoliana*. Most other works, which, in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, have been published under the name of *Ana*,\u2014as *Baconiana*, *Atterburyana*,\u2014are rather extracts from the writings and correspondence of eminent men, than memorials of their conversation.\n\nThere are some works which, though they do not bear the title, belong more strictly to the class of *Ana* than many of those collections which are known under that appellation. Such are the *M\u00e9lange d'Histoire et de Litt\u00e9rature*, published under the name of *Vigneul Marville*; and the *Locorum Communionis collectanea, ex Lectionibus Philippii Melanchthonis*,\u2014a work which was published as far back as the sixteenth century, and has obtained considerable reputation on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of its theological learning, and the information it communicates concerning the early state of the reformed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>. But of those productions which belong to the class, though they do not bear the name of *Ana*, the most celebrated are the *Colloquia Mensalia* of Luther, and Selden's *Table-Talk*,\u2014both of which merit particular notice. The first, which comprehends the conversation of Luther with his friends, and coadjutors in the great work of the Reformation, was first published in 1566. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> Henry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELL\">Bell</a>, who translated it into English, in the time of the Commonwealth, informs us, that, at the instigation of the Pope, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">Emperor</a> of Germany had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMULGATED\">promulgated</a> an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EDICT\">edict</a> commanding the works of Luther to be destroyed. It was for some time supposed that all the copies of the *Colloquia Mensalia* had been burned in consequence of this order; but at length, in 1626, a German called Van Sparz, having occasion to build on the old foundation of a house in which his grandfather dwelt, when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERIAL\">imperial</a> edict was issued, he found lying in a deep hole, and wrapped up in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol13.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> cloth, a printed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> of the *Colloquia Mensalia*. Captain Bell, having formerly become acquainted with Van Sparz during a long residence in Germany, his friend transmitted the work to him in England, where he executed a translation of it; an undertaking to which he pretends that he was urged by the vision of an old man with a long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEARD\">beard</a>, arrayed in white, who spoke these words: \"Sirrah, will you not take time to translate that book?\" The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> book translated by Bell, at the instance of this vision, is said to have been originally collected by Dr Anthony <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAUTERBACH\">Lauterbach</a>, \"out of the holy mouth of Luther;\" and was afterwards digested into common-places by Dr John Aurifaber. It chiefly contains observations and discussions on idolatry, auricular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONFESSION\">confession</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCOMMUNICATION\">excommunication</a>, clerical jurisdiction, general councils, and all the points agitated by the reformed church in those early periods. With such topics, there is intermixed many diatribes against <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTICHRIST\">Antichrist</a> and the Cardinals, and much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SARCASM\">sarcasm</a> on popish miracles and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELICS\">relics</a>. Occasionally, however, it must be confessed, that our great reformer expresses a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> in superstitions fully as wild and monstrous as those which he derides, and which he was called to overthrow. Thus, he asserted that he was repeatedly kept from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a>, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEVIL\">Devil</a> cracking nuts in his chamber; and he affirmed that there was a child at Dessau, which had been substituted by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">Arch</a>-Fiend instead of one he had stolen away, and which child Luther earnestly advised the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">Prince</a> of Anhalt to throw into the river Moldaw.\n\nIf the collection of Selden's aphorisms and sayings, entitled *Table-Talk*, be regarded of good authority, we shall find in it a more genuine and undisguised <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> of the sentiments of that eminent man, than in his more studied productions. This work was published, after the death of Selden, by Richard Milward, his Amanuensis; who, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEDICATION\">dedication</a> to Selden's executors, affirms, that, for twenty years, he enjoyed the opportunity of daily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEARING\">hearing</a> his discourse, during which long period he made it his practice, from time to time, faithfully to commit to writing \"the excellent things that usually fell from him.\" Dr Wilkins, in his introductory discourse to the works of Selden, has attempted to throw discredit on the authenticity of this compilation; asserting, that it contains many things derogatory from Selden's erudition, and foreign from his manners and principles. It is not improbable, indeed, that the memory of the Amanuensis may have occasionally failed him, and that he may have recorded sayings which inadvertently escaped his master in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of conversation, and such as he probably would not have deliberately maintained. But, on the whole, the work has completely an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a> of genuineness; and although the familiarity of his illustrations and parallels may appear to clash with the idea formed of so great a scholar, they are characteristic of a man who had been conversant with scenes of common life, no less than the speculations\nof the closet. That such was the usual manner of Selden's conversation, the Editor of the Table-Talk recalls to the recollection of those friends of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a>, to whom the work is dedicated; and this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> forms a presumption of his veracity. The Table-Talk contains many curious facts and opinions concerning the political and ecclesiastical history of the interesting period during which Selden lived, and in the important events of which he bore a considerable share.\n\nTo judge from this work, Selden had great contempt for the theologians of his day; and seems to have been of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> that the State should invariably keep a rein on the Church. He was partial to the Episcopal form of worship; but was evidently not very strict in doctrinal points, as appears from what he is reported to have said on the subject of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERESY\">heresy</a>. In his political opinions, he seems to have entertained a high respect for the sacredness of the social <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a>; and he justified the resistance to the Stewarts, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> that they had infringed and violated this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a> between prince and people. Besides <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> and political opinions, the Table-Talk contains much of a lighter description; in consequence of which, Selden has been accused of showing more laxness, in point of moral principle, than might have been expected from so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a> and respectable a character. Many of those sentiments, however, which have been considered objectionable, may have been merely advanced as plausible deductions from principles assumed for the sake of argument. But whatever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of opinion may exist, with regard to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of the Table-Talk, the manner in which the sentiments are there expressed must be universally admitted to be perspicuous and agreeable. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a> of Selden, in most of the works published under his own care, is harsh and obscure; but Clarendon, who differed from him so widely in political opinions, acknowledges that he was \"a clear discourser;\" and that he possessed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> of making difficult things easy, and presenting them clearly to the understanding.\" Accordingly, this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a> for elucidation shines chiefly in his Table-Talk; which is filled with the stores of his extensive reading, delivered without any pretensions to that order and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a>, the want of which has been attributed to his other productions.\n\nIt thus appears, that although the compilations designated by the name of Ana belong more particularly to France, they have not been wholly unknown in this country. In their Moti e Burle, and sometimes in their Novels, the Italians also have recorded the witticisms of their distinguished poets and artists. The novels of Sacchetti are full of repartees attributed to Dante, and the Palsters Giotto and Buffalmacco. Almost every Italian biographical work, of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, like Boswell's Life of Johnson, records at great length the conversational remarks of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a> whose life is detailed. Thus, Manso has dedicated one of the books of his life of Torquato Tasso to an account of the wise and witty sayings of that illustrious poet, who, towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of his days, had become the intimate friend of his biographer. The conversation of the poet, however, was neither gay nor brilliant: One of the characters in Goldoni's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAMA\">drama</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TOR\">Tor</a>-\n\nquato Tasso thus contrasts his writings and conversation:\n\nAmmiro il suo talento, gradisco i suoi modi;\nMa piacer non trovo <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AI\">ai</a> conversar casuali.\n\nIt also unfortunately happens, that the greater part of the sayings recorded by Manso may be found in the Apophthegms of Erasmus, which were published before the birth of Tasso. Indeed, Manso seems to have been aware of the want of originality in the bons mots of his friend; for, after mentioning one, he says, \"questo motto fu da alcuni <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AD\">ad</a> Epicteto attribuito.\" It was usual, indeed, among the biographers of those times, to pilage Xenophon or Plutarch, for good things to put into the mouths of their heroes; a practice from which Machiavel could not abstain in his short account of the illiterate soldier Castruccio Castracani. In these ages of pedantry, however, it is not improbable, that many sayings of the old philosophers might have been repeated as their own by the learned men of the times; and that the Italian literati might occasionally attempt to make their hearers merry with the jests of Socrates or Diogenes. The genius and character of the people rendered any collection of this nature less agreeable than the Ana of the neighbouring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, gravity was numbered among the virtues, and, in the eulogy of any illustrious man, is always mentioned as one of his most commendable qualities. There seems, in that country, to have been no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDIUM\">medium</a> between the most fantastic buffoonery, and a certain tragic solemnity. The Italians wanted that \"mobility of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>,\" that facility, rapidity, abandonment and gaiety, which seems almost peculiar to the French, and forms the chief <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARM\">charm</a> of social intercourse, as well as of those works in which it is represented; though, no doubt, when reduced into writing, much of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a> and spirit must evaporate and disappear.\n\nThe existence of similar causes, and perhaps in a stronger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, prevented the popularity of Ana among the Spaniards; though they too have related the jests and opinions of the Duke d'Osuna, and of some others. Indeed, whatever may be the genius or disposition of a people, traces of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of composition may in some shape or other be discovered among them.\n\nWhen presented in their most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> form, which is that of the French Ana, these Collections are certainly entertaining from their variety, and curious, as presenting a lively <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGE\">image</a> of the distinguished characters whose sentiments they record. If men <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> more correctly on paper, they usually display their feelings and convictions with more truth in unpremeditated conversation. Few are so cautious or hyporitical, that they do not sometimes drop the mask in the society of their friends, and express what they think or feel, when they no longer entertain apprehensions that their sentiments will be communicated to the vulgar. In general, however, the Ana should rather be regarded as affording a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> of the spirit and turn of thinking of those whose conversation they detail, than as authorities for particular opinions. A spirit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a>,\u2014a wish to display ingenuity,\u2014to astonish by\nparadoxes,\u2014or even to support conversation, may often <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> men to maintain opinions in colloquial intercourse which they perhaps never seriously held, or at least would be ready to disclaim on mature consideration. It also unfortunately happens, that in many of the Ana, those who collected the conversations which they presented to the world, interpolated their own opinions; which, of course, greatly diminishes their authority as characteristical records. It has also been objected to this species of composition, that every subject is treated superficially; but it should be recollected that the Ana do not profess to contain profound dissertations; and in fact no one consults them with the view of being deeply informed on any topic. A better founded objection is, that many subjects are treated, not merely superficially, but inaccurately. Such compositions are liable to a double risk of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>; first, of the person who delivers opinions in the heat of discourse, or relates anecdotes from vague recollection; and, secondly, of the person who records them, who must be liable to mistake, what he has only heard in the course of conversation. From these causes, and from their wide and general circulation, many of the most current literary errors may be traced to the Ana. When read, however, with discrimination, they may prove highly useful, in illustrating various points of literary history; as they certainly contain a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> which is not to be found in the formal compositions of the learned.\n\nWolfius has given a history of the Ana, in a preliminary discourse to his edition of the Casauboniana, published in 1710. In the R\u00e9pertoire de Bibliographies sp\u00e9ciales, curieuses et instructives, by Peignot, there is a Notice Bibliographique of these Collections; but many of the books there enumerated consist of mere extracts from the writings of popular authors, and do not, therefore, belong to that class of literary works described in the preceding article.","sp":504,"ep":510},{"h":"ANATOMY","t":"The provinces of Anatomy and Physiology may now, we believe, be looked upon as distinctly and permanently defined.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> height of the female seems to be about five feet five inches; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> of the different regions proportionally less than in the male.\n\n8. The length of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMBRYO\">embryo</a> of three or four weeks represented by Soemmerring, is only about one-eighth of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a>; one of eight weeks is about an inch; and one at the end of the fifth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> about ten inches. According to Mr Burns, (Principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MIDWIFERY\">Midwifery</a>, p. 121), however, the fetus, in the fifth month, is only about six or seven inches in length.\n\nThe same intelligent author <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> the length of the fetus in the sixth month to be about eight or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> inches; in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEVENTH\">seventh</a> about twelve inches; and in the eighth about fifteen inches.\n\nAccording to the observations of Roederer (Comment. Reg. Soc. Scien. Gotting. 1753), the length of the fetus at the period of birth is, on an average, about 20\u00bd inches.\n\n9. The only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a> part of the fetus, of which it is important to ascertain the average dimensions at the period of birth, is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>. Now, the longest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a> of the head, at this period, is that from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> to the chin; and this seems in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> about five inches. The breadth of the head, at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, from one parietal protuberance to the other, is usually about 3\u00bd inches. In an exceedingly interesting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> in the Philosophical Transactions (Phil. Trans. 1786), Dr Clarke has stated, that he measured the heads of sixty male, and sixty female children, born at the full time; and that he found the circumference passing through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCCIPITAL\">occipital</a> protuberance, and the middle of the brow, to be, on an average, 19.8 inches; while the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-EAR\">ear</a> to ear over the crown was 7.32 inches. One measured fifteen inches in circumference, and one 8\u00bd inches from ear to ear; but none were under twelve inches in the one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>, or 6\u00bd inches in the other.\n\n10. There are some general remarks on the progressive growth of the fetus by Soemmerring, accompanying the engravings to which we have already referred, which present some singular results. According to him, the most rapid increase of the fetus takes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> during the first weeks, after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a>. He has observed, however, that the growth does not proceed in a uniform <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a>; but that it is a little retarded during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> month; accelerated during the third; again somewhat retarded at the beginning of the fourth; from the middle of the fourth to the sixth again accelerated; and from this period till the end of the ninth month once more retarded.\n\n11. It seems to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> established, that there is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> in the average dimensions of the male and female, even in the fetal state. Roederer found the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> length of sixteen male children born at the full time to be 20\u00bd inches; and of eight females only 20\u00bd; and Dr Clarke, in his measurement of the heads of sixty male, and sixty female children, born at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> period, found that the circumference was, on an average, 14 inches in the males, and only 13\u00bd inches in the females, and the arch from ear to ear over the crown 7\u00bd inches in the males, and only 7\u00bd in the females. Out of one hundred and twenty children, there were only six in whom the circumference of the head exceeded 14\u00bd inches, and these six were males.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">Weight</a>.\n\n12. We have examined a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGISTER\">register</a> of the weights of about fifty full grown males of the average stature, and find their mean weight to be about 140 lbs. English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TROY\">Troy</a>. The average weight of an equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of adult females, we suppose, would be found to be about 30 or 40 lbs. less; but we have had no opportunity of ascertaining this.\n\n13. The average weight of the fetus in the earlier months is uncertain. According to Mr Burns (Principles of Midwifery, p. 121), however, it generally weighs about 2 oz. in the twelfth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>; about 1 lbs. in the sixth month, and about 4 or 5 lbs. Troy in the eighth month.\n\n14. Its mean weight at the natural period of birth has been better ascertained. It seems to be about 7 lbs. avoirdupois. The celebrated Dr Hunter (Anatomical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">Description</a> of the Gravid Uterus, p. 68) states, that of several thousand new-born and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> children, which were weighed at the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">Hospital</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> by Dr Macaulay, the smallest was about 4 lbs., and the largest about 11 lbs. 2 oz.; but by far the greatest number were from 5 to 8 lbs. avoirdupois. He adds, that he never knew an instance of a child born at the natural period that weighed 12 lbs. avoirdupois. Of sixty male and sixty female children, born at the full time, which were weighed by Dr Clarke, the lightest was 4 lbs., and the heaviest 10 lbs.; and the average weight was 7 lbs. 13 dr. avoirdupois. The average weight of twenty-six children, born at the natural period, which were weighed by Roederer, seems to have been about 6\u00bd lbs.; the heaviest being 8 lbs., and the lightest about 5\u00bd lbs.; but we are uncertain as to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a> of the weights which he employed.\n\n15. Dr Clarke estimates the difference between the average weight of the male and female at birth at about 9 oz. avoirdupois; and the results of Roederer's observations do not appear to differ materially from this estimate.\n\n16. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> of twins, it would seem that the weight of each twin is in general less than the average weight of single children, though their combined weight is greater. Dr Clarke found the average weight of twelve twins to be 11 lbs. avoirdupois a pair; the heaviest pair weighing 13 lbs., and the lightest 8\u00bd lbs. Mr Burns, however, states, that he has known instances, in which each twin was rather above than under the usual weight of a single child.\n\nANIMAL.\n\n138. The cuticle is transparent, and of a slightly yellowish-grey <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>. The colour of the outer surface of the true skin is, therefore, seen through it; and we have no doubt that the colour of the surface of the body, in the inhabitants of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> in general, depends entirely on the colour of the outer surface of the true skin, blended with the slight tinge of grey from the cuticle.\n\n139. In almost all persons in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, there are certain parts of the soles of the feet, in which the epidermis is divisible into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAYERS\">layers</a>; but this seems to be purely the effect of compression; which accumulates into a thick stratum those portions of the cuticle which are constantly separating from its surface, and which, in other parts of the body, are immediately removed. This laminated appearance is never seen in the soles of persons who have been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> confined to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a>, or in those who, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCIDENT\">accident</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>, have not been able to put the foot to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>. The cuticle, in other parts of the body, does not exhibit the slightest appearance either of laminae or fibres.\n\n140. This part of the skin is entirely destitute of blood-vessels, absorbents, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NERVES\">nerves</a>. It is truly a non-vascular part, like the enamel of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>.\n\n141. It is well known that when a piece of cuticle is plunged into pure nitric acid, it instantly acquires a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> colour. In the course of twenty minutes or so, we have found, that it becomes thicker, softer, and more opaque; in twenty-four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a> it is reduced to a yellowish pulp; and in about a month or six weeks it is almost entirely dissolved. Pure muriatic acid acts upon it somewhat in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>; but less powerfully, and less speedily. Pure sulphuric acid immediately gives it a deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> colour; in the course of twenty hours, renders it thicker and more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a>; and, after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAPSE\">lapse</a> of several weeks, reduces it to the state of a very thin deep brown pulp.\n\n142. We have satisfied ourselves, by a variety of dissections, that there is in the Negro, Caffre, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">Black</a> Mem.-Malay, a black membrane interposed between the epidermis and the true skin, upon which the dark colour of these people entirely depends. This membrane sometimes peels off with the cuticle, and sometimes adheres to the true skin. It is more tender than the cuticle, and thinner; but, like it, is entirely without vessels, and without any appearance of holes, or plates, or fibres. We conclude, that in all black men there is a similar membrane, to which their dark colour is owing.\n\n143. After the strictest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>, however, we have not been able to discover any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>-coloured membrane or pigment, such as has been described under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of rete mucosum, between the cuticle and true skin, in the inhabitants of this country, nor in those of other European nations resembling them in colour. We have sought for it in every way, but without success. We are disposed, therefore, to deny its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a>. The cause of the light colour of the skin in fair people has been already explained. (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SECT\">Sect</a>. 138.)\n\n144. Whether there be any brownish membrane in tawny people, like the black membrane in the negro, we have had no opportunity of ascertaining.\n\nV. THE ANATOMY IN GENERAL OF <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIR\">HAIR</a>.\n\n145. We <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CALL\">call</a> the root of a hair, not only that part of it which is contained in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BULB\">bulb</a>, but the portion which is lodged in the skin. The middle part and the point are the parts which project beyond the surface of the skin.\n\n146. All the hairs in the body seem to be cylindrical, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TAPER\">taper</a> regularly from the root to the point.\n\n147. Of whatever colour they be, the root is always whitish, and transparent, particularly that part of it which is lodged in the bulb. This part, too, is always much softer than the rest; the very extremity being almost fluid.\n\n148. As far as we can judge from microscopical observations, the hairs seem to be quite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a>. We have never seen any appearance of cells, or canals, or laminae, or fibres, in any part of them. In the whiskers of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEAL\">seal</a>, however, the part of the root of the hair which is lodged in the bulb, contains a conical cavity; and we suspect it is the same in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> hair.\n\n149. Dr Brewster has ascertained that hairs depolarise light, and possess the most perfect neutral axes; the axes being parallel and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol3.html#article-AXIS\">axis</a> of the hair. (Phil. Trans. 1815.)\n\n150. The chemical properties of hair have been very minutely investigated by Vauquelin. (See Annales de Chimie, Vol. LVIII., and Nicholson's Journal, Vol. XV.)\n\n151. Judging by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a>, from the structure of the bulbs of those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> hairs which form the whiskers of such animals as the seal, we should imagine that the bulbs of the human hairs consisted of two coats or tunics; an inner one of a tender consistence, very vascular, and embracing immediately the root of the hair; and an outer, firmer, and less vascular one, closely surrounding the former.\n\n152. The bulbs of the hairs are always situate under the true skin; but so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> to its inner surface, that no part of the hair is perceptible between it and the bulb. Immediately after leaving the bulb, the hair is received into a canal in the true skin, which is constantly observed to be more or less oblique. A small hole in the cuticle corresponds to this canal; and the hair passing through it also, reaches the outer surface of the skin. In its passage through the true skin, we believe that it adheres to the sides of the canal, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> as epidermis would do.\n\nVI. THE ANATOMY IN GENERAL OF CARTILAGE.\n\n153. On careful examination of this substance with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MICROSCOPE\">microscope</a>, it appears to us to be uniform and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMOGENEOUS\">homogeneous</a> in its structure, like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JELLY\">jelly</a>, and without fibres, or laminae, or cells.\n\n154. In its purest form, no blood-vessels are seen in it, nor can they be injected even with the finest colouring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>. In those pieces of cartilage, however, which are attached to the edges or extremities of growing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BONES\">bones</a>, blood-vessels of considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> may often be seen ramifying, even without the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-AID\">aid</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INJECTION\">injection</a>.\n155. The chemical properties of cartilage have not yet been sufficiently investigated. In its purest form, we believe that it is entirely soluble in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a> seem to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> on thin dried slices of it nearly as they do on cuticle.\n\nVII. THE ANATOMY IN GENERAL OF BONE.\n\n156. The structure of this substance is exceedingly simple. Divide it, and examine its surfaces with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNIFYING\">magnifying</a>-glass, or cut off slender films of it, and inspect them in a powerful microscope, and it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> appear to be a uniform substance without fibres, plates, or cells, penetrated everywhere by delicate blood-vessels.\n\n157. The sulphuric, nitric, muriatic, and acetic acids, when properly diluted, soften bone, and render it pliable, without its being possible to discover, by the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> inspection, that a single particle of its substance has been removed.\n\n158. Calcination produces just the reverse effects. If a bit of bone be placed in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CHARCOAL\">charcoal</a> fire, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> be gradually raised to whiteness, it will first burn with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a>, and then become quite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>. If it be now removed carefully, and slowly cooled, it will be found to have been rendered as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> as chalk, and exceedingly brittle. Still not a particle of the substance will appear to have been destroyed.\n\n159. With respect to the chemical properties of this substance, we have only to remark, that we are convinced from experiment, that the fat which has been considered as an ingredient in bone, and which is extracted from it by boiling in water, is no part of the osseous substance, but an adventitious admixture either from adipose substance without, or from marrow within.\n\n160. We have often endeavoured to discover sulphate of lime in the acid solution both of calcined and uncalcined bone; but always without success.\n\nVIII. THE ANATOMY IN GENERAL OF TENDON.\n\n161. Bichat has described this common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEXTURE\">texture</a> under the name of Syst\u00e8me Fibreux. (Anat. G\u00e9n\u00e9r. III.) The term is objectionable, however, because it is equally applicable to nerve, muscle, or even cellular substance, as to the texture to which he has applied it.\n\n162. Its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a> is very various, and very extensive. It forms not only those appendages to muscular fasciculi, called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TENDONS\">tendons</a>, from which it has received its name, but also ligaments, periosteum, aponeuroses, fasciae, membranes, &c.\n\n163. It appears to be chiefly composed of very delicate, white, silvery-looking fibres, collected into fasciculi, which are united with each other in various ways. Sometimes they are tied together longitudinally; at other times, interwoven almost with the same regularity as the threads in a piece of cloth; and at other times intermingled in every direction.\n\n164. The sulphuric, nitric, and muriatic acids, act upon it very nearly as they do upon cuticle. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INSTANT\">instant</a> it is plunged into either of them, it shrinks up, and becomes semitransparent and elastic, just as it does in boiling water, but in a much greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>. The effects of the pure fixed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol4.html#article-ALKALIES\">alkalies</a> upon it are singular. At first, they operate upon it somewhat like the acids just mentioned; but, instead of dissolving it after a little while, as these do, they seem to produce very little further change upon it for a considerable length of time. If, in this state, we remove it from the alkali, and pull its parts gently asunder, its delicate fibres will unfold themselves very readily, exhibiting at same time very bright prismatic colours.\n\nIX. THE ANATOMY IN GENERAL OF SEROUS MEMBRANE.\n\n165. A successful injection of size or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURPENTINE\">turpentine</a>, coloured with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERMILION\">vermilion</a>, brings into view so many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CAPILLARY\">capillary</a> blood-vessels in this membrane, that one would be almost inclined to suppose, that it was entirely composed of arteries and veins. By proper management, however, absorbents may be injected in it with quicksilver to an equal degree of minuteness. There can be no doubt, therefore, that it is chiefly composed of these two systems of vessels. Whether it contain any thing else but vessels, remains to be ascertained. Nerves have not yet been traced into it, although they may be often seen ramifying abundantly on the parts with which its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> surface is connected.\n\nX. THE ANATOMY IN GENERAL OF SYNOVIAL MEMBRANE.\n\n166. Bichat has enumerated a variety of circumstances, in which he conceives, that the serous and synovial membrane differ from each other. (Anat. G\u00e9n\u00e9r. IV.) It seems to us very doubtful, however; whether all these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> be well founded; at all events, we do not think that any of them can with propriety be adopted as the basis of an anatomical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a>.\n\n167. Synovial membrane resembles serous membrane, in so far as it is a thin substance, having one smooth free surface, turned towards certain cavities of the body, and another connected by delicate cellular substance to the sides of these cavities, or to the parts contained in them. It resembles this substance also in being transparent.\n\n168. But it differs from serous membrane in the following circumstances:\u2014In the first place, it is a substance possessing very little vascularity in its healthy state; none of its blood-vessels are almost ever seen filled with blood after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, nor can they be made to receive the finest injection. In the second place, its absorbents are quite incapable of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a>. Thirdly, very delicate fibres, like those of cellular substance, or like the finest filaments of tendon, are distinctly perceptible in it after slight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MACERATION\">maceration</a>. Fourthly, it is considerably inferior in strength to serous membrane.","sp":510,"ep":523},{"h":"ANATOMY","t":"VEGETABLE.\n\n10. Another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> circumstance in the vessels of Elementary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a>, is, that we do not discover in them any structure which has the true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> and use of valves, similar to what is met with in the veins and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSORBENT\">absorbent</a> vessels of animals. Dr Hooke could never observe in their canal anything that had the appearance of valves. (Micrographia, p. 116.) Did such a structure exist, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSORPTION\">absorption</a> of nutrient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> from the lobes of the seed, and its conveyance, in a backward course, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMBRYO\">embryo</a>, could not, says Grew, have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>; neither could the root, as it often does, grow upward and downward both at once. (Anatomy of Plants.) If the piece of a root of elm-tree be cut in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUTUMN\">autumn</a>, the juices, says Du Hamel, are found to escape indifferently at either end, as the one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> the other is alternately held downward; a circumstance, he observes, inconsistent with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of Mariotte, who maintained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> of valves. (Phys. des Arbres, Tom. I. p. 56.) It is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> known also, that many plants may be made to grow in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERTED\">inverted</a> position, so as to put forth leaves and flowers from their roots; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> trees have been nourished by juices received through the extremities of their engrafted branches, after all connection between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> and the roots had been cut off. In general, indeed, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> minuteness of the vessels seems almost to preclude the possible existence of valves in their canal: but in some instances, where the vessels in aged trees have become enlarged, membranous productions have been found to occupy their cavities, which some have alleged to perform the office of valves. They occur, however, only at an advanced <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of growth, and form no necessary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the structure of the vessel; and, instead of promoting, contribute only to obstruct the course of the fluids. It was the opinion of Malpighi that the frequent junctions which the fasciculi of vessels make with each other in their ramifications, might be considered to bestow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> them a sort of valvular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a>: but, in most instances, these fasciculi run <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> without forming ramifications, and no such valvular function can then be considered to have place.\n\nThus far with regard to the general nature of the vessels of plants: let us next discriminate their several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> or kinds.","sp":538,"ep":539},{"h":"ANATOMY","t":"VEGETABLE.\n\nElementary conveyed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRAL\">spiral</a> tube of Hedwig they have regarded as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> plate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> filament. From the different appearances which they exhibit, M. Treviranus and Bernhardi distinguish several varieties of spiral vessels, as does also M. Kieser, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of these vessels is not only the latest and most elaborate, but that probably which approaches nearest to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>. We shall, therefore, subjoin a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIEF\">brief</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> of his observations <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the situation and structure of these vessels, and more particularly on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of transformations which they seem to undergo.\n\nAccording to M. Kieser (M\u00e9m. sur l'Organisation des Plantes, p. 115, \u00e0 Harlem, 1814), spiral vessels are found in all the more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a>, from the earliest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a>, and in all parts of them except the bark and pith. In herbs, they are collected into fasciculi of thirty or more vessels; in trees they constitute the wood, and are annually augmented in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> by a new layer. In different plants, and even in different parts of the same plant, they vary much in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIZE\">size</a>, being generally largest in succulent plants, especially those of rapid growth; and in such plants, they continually augment in size. In some woods, they are extremely small; in others, much larger. In aged plants, both in the root and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a>, they are at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> more or less completely obstructed by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of membranous vesicles, previously observed by Malpighi and Leuwenhoek, which originate from the sides of the vessels. Nothing but air is commonly found in their cavity; but in the wood of Guaiacum, he has seen all the spiral vessels entirely filled with resinous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, and the whole cellular tissue completely filled with the same matter. He does not know what anatomical relation subsists between the spiral vessels and the other organs; but thinks there is no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> between them and the cells.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of these vessels M. Kieser professes to have studied with the greatest care, and to have established incontestably the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>. Sometimes, says he, only one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIBRE\">fibre</a>, sometimes many, go to form the spire of a vessel. These fibres are commonly round, sometimes a little flattened, and are twisted spirally about an empty space, so as to form a tube. The spiral fibres in young plants, and sometimes in mature ones, are in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> contact; in other instances they are separated, and the interstices are then occupied by a dotted or punctuated membrane, as is very frequent in trees; or sometimes they are connected by ramifications which proceed from the spiral fibres themselves. From the minuteness of the spiral fibre, it is difficult to decide whether it is a solid or tubular body, and often, from the same cause, to pronounce whether it is round or flattened. It is transparent; has considerable consistence and tensility; and, in some plants, appears to possess <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTICITY\">elasticity</a>.\n\nThe number of fibres that form the spire of a vessel is very various; sometimes, as before remarked, there is only one, but more often several, which are twisted in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a>, and the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>. He has seen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> fibres thus united, and when unrolled, the spires of the vessel then seem to form a kind of ribband. When many fibres are employed to form a spire, they always run <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a>, and do not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a>; so that the side of the vessel has never more than the thickness of a single fibre. At their first formation, the fibres are not united; it is only in more advanced <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> that they become united, either by ramifications from their edges, or by a peculiar membrane. The direction of the fibre, in twisting, is sometimes from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to left, and sometimes the contrary. The size also is very various. In young plants it is very small, so that a millimetre comprises the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a> of 2600 of these fibres; and, in some instances, they have little more than half that size. In older vessels they have a larger size. Between the knots of the trunk, they are simple, and do not ramify, but in the knots they undergo <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> changes of form, and are variously ramified and combined.\n\nARTICLE V.\n\nOf the Transformations of the Spiral Vessels.\n\nM. Kieser proceeds next to treat of the transformations or metamorphoses of the simple spiral vessels into several varieties; to which, from their peculiarities of construction, he assigns the names of the annular, the punctuated, the ramified and reticulated spiral vessels, and another variety he calls vessels en chapelet. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> character and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a>, however, all these varieties are said to agree; the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> is, that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> form. Of each of these varieties, we shall subjoin a short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>.\n\nThe first variety, or rather species of vessel, out of which the others are produced, he calls the simple spiral. It is constructed of one or more fibres, twisted spirally, and placed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTIGUOUS\">contiguous</a> to each other, so as to form a round cavity within. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a>, the spires of the fibre are in contact, but sometimes there is a space between them. See fig. 51, Plate XV. In the latter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, the side of the vessel is closed by the walls of the adjacent cells, but never by any new production of membrane, either without or within the vessel itself. These simple spiral vessels are found in every young plant, and in the newly formed parts of old ones, and give origin to the other varieties. Their size is smaller than that of others; in some instances they have not more than one-eighth or one-tenth of the diameter of other varieties. They are the only variety found in some of the inferior tribes of vegetables. The number of fibres in each spire varies from one to nine.\n\nAnother form of these vessels is that of the Annular annular spiral. In this variety, the component fibre has the form of numerous rings, disposed in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> line between the ranges of cells; fig. 51, b. These rings are very analogous to the spires of the preceding variety, are of the same size, and are often combined with them in the same vessel. They occur in a great many plants, and, in herbaceous plants, occupy the same position as the simple spiral vessels, that is, next to the pith. The rings of which they are constructed are sometimes separated from each other only by a space equal to their own diameter; but, in other instances, they are separated to eight or ten times that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a>, forming then the substratum of the third variety, or punctuated spiral vessel.\n42. From the two simple varieties of form <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> described, other more complicated forms are produced as the plant advances in age. Thus, the third variety, called the punctuated spiral vessel, is constructed by one or more round or flattened spiral fibres; the spires or rings of which, not being connected, leave between them interstices more or less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>; which interstices are filled with a membrane more or less thick and transparent, and variously dotted or punctuated, from which circumstance the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> is derived.\n\nThis structure is imperfectly represented in fig. 51. c, and much more clearly by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> d of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, in which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> lines indicate the spiral rings, and the intervening dotted substance represents the punctuated membrane; at the top, a portion of the anterior side of the vessel has been removed, so as to display its inner and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POSTERIOR\">posterior</a> surface. In this variety, the rings are never contiguous. Such vessels occur only in the more advanced age of herbaceous plants, but seem to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> formations in the albumen of trees. Their size is frequently eight or ten times greater than that of the two former varieties, especially in the stem; but they are much smaller in the root. They always occupy the most exterior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the vascular fasciculus of herbs, while the two preceding varieties are found next to the pith. In trees, on the contrary, the largest vessels of the annual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAYERS\">layers</a> occupy the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> nearest to the pith; and all the spiral vessels in these layers belong to this punctuated variety, except those immediately next to the pith. The spiral fibre of these vessels is of very various size. In the largest vessels of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a>, its size is greatest; in other instances, it is so small as to be scarcely visible. It is often difficult to determine whether its form is spiral or annular; in herbs, it appears to be spiral; in trees, annular.\n\n43. The membrane which fills the interstices of the spires and rings, and connects them together, is not visible in young vessels; but is produced in more mature age, as is proved by the fact that this membrane is often <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> to two contiguous vessels, and connects respectively their rings together. Hence it is, that the membrane never surrounds the spires, nor is it surrounded by them, but only occupies the interstices between them; and, from the same cause, the spires themselves are always prominent on the surface of the membrane. In this variety of vessel, the spires cannot be unrolled without tearing their connecting membrane. This membrane, at an early period, is transparent, but becomes opaque from age.\n\n44. As to the points or dots on this membrane, they have by some been taken for pores on the surface; by others for clefts produced by the junction of the spires. M. Kieser confesses that he has not yet been able to satisfy himself on this subject. They are clearly not clefts, and it is against the supposition of their being pores, that their position has always a relation to the spires, and not to the adjacent cells. In the wood of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SASSAFRAS\">Sassafras</a>, however, these points seemed pierced by a hole exceedingly small; but, in other instances, they appear quite dark, and similar to those which are found on the vesicles that fill the cavity of aged vessels, and where there is not the smallest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> for considering them as pores.\n\nHe thinks there is a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> between the formation of these vesicular membranes within the vessels, and that membrane by which the spires are connected in this variety of vessel. In some plants, the size of these dots is large, and they appear transparent at the centre; in other instances, they are extremely small. Their form is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a> or elliptical, and they are always ranged in a determined line, parallel, in general, to the direction of the spires.\n\n45. The fourth variety of spiral vessel is said to have the same origin as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a>, being formed in part by the spires or rings of the two first varieties; but the interstices between these are filled, not by membrane, but by small ramifications, produced from the rings themselves; and these ramifications are often so implicated as to form a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">net</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>; whence the names of ramified and reticulated spiral vessels. Like the former variety, they do not exist in the young plant, but are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the gradual changes of advanced age, and produced by a similar series of actions. They are formed of one or more spiral fibres, the spires of which are contiguous in the young plant, but separate at a later period; and the interstices are filled up by new ramifications from the spiral fibre itself. In the first period of their formation, when there are but few ramifications, he names them ramified spirals; and when these become more numerous and implicated, reticulated spirals. They are found but in few plants, and those of the more succulent kind; they do not attain the size of the preceding variety; are associated in the same plant with the simple and annular spirals; and in the fasciculi, occupy the same place as the punctuated spirals, that is, next to the bark. They are more transparent than the punctuated spirals, and occur more frequently in the root than the stem. In the representations given of these vessels by M. Kieser, they appear to differ from the preceding variety, chiefly in the position of the spiral rings, which are more or less obliquely situated, and sometimes send off a sort of branch, as is represented near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> of the vessel d in fig. 51.\n\n46. The last variety, or vessels en chapelet, discovered and named by M. Mirbel, are found only in those parts where the perpendicular growth is obstructed, and the vessels, taking a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> direction, suffer a complete change of character. It is therefore in the knots of the trunk, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TUBERCLES\">tubercles</a> of roots, and in similar parts, that such vessels occur. They take their origin occasionally from all the other varieties, and are, in truth, nothing but these varieties changed by the qualities of the knot. They are formed by contractions occurring at short distances, which diminish the diameter of the vessel, and dispose it into the form of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> oblong cells or utricles threaded on one another, as in fig. 51. e; or as in fig. 11, copied from Mirbel, with which the representations of Kieser nearly coincide; but he makes the figure of the utricles much less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a>. The vessel itself also has a tortuous course in the knot, and sometimes many are ramified and combined, so as to form a kind of reticulated appearance. This, however, is effected by vessels leaving one fasci-\nElementary culus and passing to another, and does not seem to be a true ramification of one vessel out of another.\n\nThe construction of the sides of this variety of vessels is the same as that from which they take their origin. Thus, if they are formed from simple spiral vessels, their sides have the simple spiral form; if from punctuated spirals, then the vessels en chapelet possess the punctuated membrane, and so with respect to the ramified variety of vessels. The contractions in these vessels are not produced by any displacement of the spiral fibres of the other varieties; but their true cause is to be sought in the function of the part, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the knot itself. Every spiral vessel, whether simple, punctuated, or reticulated, may thus be metamorphosed in the knots, into a vessel en chapelet, and again lose this character, and resume its original form in the intermodal spaces.\n\n47. Such is the account given of the construction and metamorphoses of the spiral vessels by M. Kieser. It is, in every part, amply illustrated by figures, made from dissections of various plants. These drawings everywhere support the descriptive detail; and if the microscopical observations from which they are made be correct, no doubt can exist of the truth of the doctrine. That considerable changes do occur in the vessels of plants, after their formation, seems most certain; and the series of appearances exhibited by M. Kieser, presents, as we think, nothing inconsistent with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>, nor beyond the powers of vegetable organization. Neither do they militate against the previous descriptions of Malpighi, Grew, and Hedwig; but, on the contrary, receive, generally, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> from them. M. Kieser, however, has pushed his inquiries much farther, and given to the doctrine of transformation a more precise and systematic form. He has not ventured to speculate on the probable causes of these curious changes; but were this the proper place for such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a>, and were the facts, connected with the functions of these vessels, fairly before us, in addition to those which regard their structure, we think that an explanation, tolerably satisfactory, might be obtained. But the prosecution of this subject we must defer to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> occasion.\n\n48. We <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLECT\">collect</a>, then, from the whole of the foregoing statements, that all that part of plants, which is commonly stiled the ligneous portion, is composed chiefly of vessels, which, however different in size and external figure, are destined to one and the same office, that of conveying <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAP\">sap</a>; and that these sap-vessels extend from the extremities of the roots to the points of the leaves, and exist in all the organized productions of plants.\n\nThis, however, is not the conclusion at which M. Kieser arrived. Though he has demonstrated that the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of the ligneous part of plants consists of spiral vessels, and admits that they receive and convey coloured fluids, yet, from the circumstance of their appearing sometimes empty, he regards them, with Malpighi, as tubes destined to convey only air; and supposes the sap of plants to be carried, not by what are called the vessels, but by certain little canals, of doubtful existence, hereafter to be described, and which have been named intercellular canals. (M\u00e9m. sur l'Organisation des Plantes, p. 87, 199.) That, however, he should, at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, admit the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a> of the spiral vessels to receive coloured fluids, and reject the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> that fluids, destitute of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, are received by them, is not a little singular; for the colouring particles in the liquor must, and do oppose obstacles to its reception, which fluids of a more simple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> do not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>; and when once such liquors <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> admission, they leave behind them traces of their course, which a colourless fluid does not. M. Kieser has altogether overlooked the facts observed by Grew and Du Hamel, of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> existence of sap in these vessels, both in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUTUMN\">autumn</a>; and he seems to be entirely unacquainted with the influence which the development of the leaves, as we shall presently show, exerts on the movements of the vegetable fluids.\n\n49. But it has been the fate of these vessels to experience the utmost licence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> in regard both to their structure and functions; nor does it seem probable, that these opinions <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> soon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> into anything like uniformity. While some have supposed the vegetable to be composed almost entirely of spiral vessels, others <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIMIT\">limit</a> their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a> to a few parts only; and others again altogether deny their existence. Some will have them to be solid fibres; others make them sap-vessels, or nutrient vessels; and others again suppose them to convey only air. Hedwig believed them to convey at the same time both nutrient matter and air; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BONNET\">Bonnet</a> was of opinion that they were entitled to be considered not only as the lungs of the plant, but a sort of muscles also, by which many of its parts executed different movements. (Recherches sur les Feuilles, p. 138.) A late writer, however, and a Professor, it seems, of medicine in the university of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JENA\">Jena</a>, M. Oken, is of opinion, that they ought not to be deemed either simple fibres, or vessels, or lungs, or muscles; but that they execute a function for the plant analogous to that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NERVES\">nerves</a> of animals; and ought therefore to be named the vegetable nerves. (Kieser's M\u00e9m. sur l'Organisation des Plantes, p. 174.) The bare enunciation of such opinions must, we think, be sufficient to ensure their rejection.\n\n50. Rejecting these fanciful and extravagant notions, and adhering to the opinion that the spiral vessels are a variety only of the common sap-vessels of the plant, we shall conclude this branch of the subject with a brief notice of their common modes of termination. If we begin at the root, we may consider these vessels as terminating at that part, by continuation of canal, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CAPILLARY\">capillary</a> absorbents of the rootlet. As, farther, the vessels of plants, like those of animals, are the only organs which convey the materials out of which, not only the fluid, but the solid parts of the plant are formed; it may, in a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, be said, that their modes of termination are as numerous as the kinds of distinct parts or organs which the vegetable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> contains. Hence, therefore, as the cellular tissue of plants contains various matters often precisely similar to those which exist in the vessels, it may be inferred, that the vessels have a termination in those organs; and this inference may perhaps carry more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> with many than the attempts before related, of Malpighi and Leuwenhoek, to demonstrate it\n\nVEGETABLE.\n\nElementary anatomically. Another termination of these vessels must be in certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> and ill-defined organs called glands, which separate from the mass of fluids peculiar secretions; and a fourth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> may, in the leaves, be in other vessels, which carry back the juices from those organs. The last and fifth mode of termination is into transpiring or exhalent organs, by which a certain portion of the contents of the vessels is discharged: So that in plants, the sap-vessels terminate externally at one extremity in absorbents, by which fluids are received; and at the other in exhaustants, by which these fluids are discharged.","sp":544,"ep":548},{"h":"ANATOMY","t":"VEGETABLE.\n\nother are not produced; neither, for similar reasons, is there any distinct appearance of the larger partitions, that, at certain distances, intersect the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a> of other trees. The cellular tissue, therefore, in such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a>, retains more of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIMITIVE\">primitive</a> character, and appears everywhere to surround the vascular fasciculi, but nowhere to be so compressed as to form <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> partitions between them. In some plants which possess this structure, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SUGAR\">Sugar</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CANE\">cane</a> (fig. 26, Plate XVI.), the cells indeed retain their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> forms, and even the fasciculi of vessels, though standing at considerable distances from each other, have towards the centre of the plant a symmetrical arrangement. This latter circumstance is observable in many other plants, which have even fewer vessels than the Sugar-cane; so that it is probable, that, in the first instance, it takes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in all; and that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> position of the vessels in the Palm and similar trees, particularly towards their circumference, proceeds from the peculiar modes of their growth, and are not a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIMARY\">primary</a> condition of their structure. This intermixture of the vessels and cells in the plants now under consideration, extends from the circumference to the centre, so as to constitute their entire bulk, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCLUSION\">exclusion</a> of bark and pith; unless we choose rather to say, that, in such plants, the medullary, ligneous, and cortical textures, are all blended together.\n\n117. In other examples, the vessels form a still smaller portion of the ligneous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEXTURE\">texture</a>, consisting only of a few fasciculi, which stand at considerable distances from each other, the intervening spaces being occupied by cellular tissue, which forms the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> bulk of the plant. See fig. 32, Plate XVI. Though few in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, the vessels, however, are symmetrically disposed, and, in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>, preserve always the same position, the fasciculi being placed at the same relative <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> from each other, and from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> centre of the pith. Sometimes, instead of a few solitary fasciculi, they consist of several ranges, forming an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCENTRIC\">concentric</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAYERS\">layers</a>, and in such examples, the ligneous texture is commonly separated by distinct but irregular marks from the two other textures. In these plants, the cellular tissue preserves its characters, and exhibits no appearance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIVERGENT\">divergent</a> rays.\n\n118. The three modes of arrangement above described, appear to constitute the chief varieties of structure in the ligneous texture; but in each variety, and through every stage by which they graduate into one another, the greatest diversity of forms prevails. Each species of plant has its peculiar internal structure, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> form; and this seems to be in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> determined by the number of vessels that enter into its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>, and their peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of arrangement. If the vessels are few, the cellular tissue is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a>, and its characters are distinct and well preserved\u2014if they are numerous, and disposed in rays, the tissue is compressed in various directions, loses more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> less completely its cellular character, and forms alike those divergent rays, or transverse partitions already so often noticed, and those thin membranous expansions, or fasciae, which, both in the bark and wood, are seen sometimes to cover the vessels in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONGITUDINAL\">longitudinal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>.\n\n119. The manner, too, or rather the place, in which the vessels are developed, in perennial plants, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> greatly contribute to vary the appearance of the ligneous texture. In those trees, whose diameter is annually increased by the formation of new vessels around the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a> of older wood, the new parts must necessarily present in their longitudinal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> the appearance of annular layers superimposed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> one another, and, in their transverse section, that of concentric circles; but in Palms and similar trees, where the development of new parts seems to be accomplished in a different manner, their appearance, under similar sections, may be expected to be different.\n\n120. In a longitudinal section of the Palm, says M. Desfontaines, we discover an assemblage of large ligneous fibres (that is, vascular fasciculi), solid, smooth, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEXIBLE\">flexible</a>; and these are composed of others still smaller, which are firmly united together; they mostly run <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol3.html#article-AXIS\">axis</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a>, from the base to the summit, without interruption; but some proceed obliquely, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> the others at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> more or less sharp. See fig. 29, Plate XVI. In a transverse section of the same stem, continues the author, we remark neither concentric circles, nor transverse partitions; but the fasciculi of vessels placed without order by the side of each other, are enveloped by the cellular tissue, which fills up all the intervals: they sensibly approach each other, harden and diminish in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> in proceeding from the centre to the circumference. See fig. 28, Plate XVI. So that the stem has much more strength and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOLIDITY\">solidity</a> near the surface, than in the interior, an organization quite distinct from that of ordinary trees.\n\n121. The cause of this diversity of structure seems to be amply accounted for by the different modes in which the growth of these trees is accomplished. When the seed of a Palm is sown, the leaves, says M. Desfontaines, successively develop and augment in number for four or five years; the neck of the root augments in the same proportion; the bulbous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a>, formed by the reunion of the petioles of the leaves, increases insensibly; its solidity augments, and at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> the stem rises above the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> with all the size it ever acquires. Its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> is cylindrical from the base to the summit, and if the diameter be measured at different epochs, it will be seen, as Kampfer had already remarked, not to increase. The Palm, therefore, is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a>, whose summit is crowned with leaves, disposed above each other circularly; those which grow in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> shoot always from the top; the older ones, placed below, dry, and when they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a>, leave circular impressions, which furrow the surface of the stem, and mark its years until it has ceased to grow.\n\n122. If next we examine the interior, we discover, as M. Desfontaines thinks, the true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> why the stem rises in a column, and does not, like other trees, yearly augment in size. This was done by M. Dau-benton, who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, that every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">Date</a>-palm, in proceeding from the bud, is formed by a prolongation of the vascular fasciculi and cellular tissue which exist in the trunk of the tree, as is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> in the petiole of the recent leaves, and of the dried\nones that adhere to the trunk. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELONGATION\">elongation</a> of the trunk is produced, therefore, by the leaves which annually proceed from it; and as the parts which form these leaves, spring from the centre, they always, as they shoot, force the older leaves outwards. Hence, therefore, as the augmentation of these trees originates at the centre, all the parts capable of displacement must be pushed outwards, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> as the new layers of bark and wood, formed annually in ordinary trees, force outward the older layers of bark exterior to them.\n\n123. In these latter trees, continues M. Dauben- ton, the recession of the bark has no limits, so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> as new parts continue to be formed beneath it; because the new cortical layers are flexible, and the older ones readily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> and give <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>: but in the Palm, the substance of the trunk has more compactness as we approach the circumference, and, at a certain point of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol7.html#article-DENSITY\">density</a>, it no longer yields to the central force of the interior parts; so that, when this point is reached, no farther enlargement takes place; and hence, the Date-palm scarcely exceeds ten inches in diameter. It is for similar reasons that the trunk of the Date-palm is of the same size through its entire length; for, in proportion as the tree rises, the exterior parts of the trunk lose successively their flexibility, and when they have reached a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of density, they no longer yield to the force from within; and as this is equally the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> in all parts, the trunk is necessarily of the same size throughout. (M\u00e9m. de l'Inst. Nat. Tom. I. p. 482, &c.)\n\n124. It is farther evident, that, in this mode of growth, no appearance of concentric circles, similar to those of ordinary trees, can have place; for, by the growth at the centre, the exterior vessels are continually displaced from their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> positions, are more and more compressed as they are forced towards the circumference, and present, in their transverse section, that irregular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a> which they have been described to possess. Hence, the cylindrical figure and the absence of concentric layers are as necessary consequences of the mode of growth in these trees, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a> of those layers and the conical figure are of the mode of growth in ordinary trees. The greater solidity of the parts at the circumference is clearly to be ascribed to the same cause; and even the want of regular transverse partitions must in part also have a similar origin, and be ascribed, perhaps, in part to the smaller number of vessels which these plants possess, as well as to their irregular distribution.\n\nSection III.\n\nOf the Bark or Cortical Texture.\n\nThe Bark.\n\n125. This texture, in its component parts, resembles that of the wood, being made up, like it, of vessels and cellular tissue intimately connected with each other. Its structure, as a distinct texture, is best characterized in the bark of ordinary trees, as it is there separated, in a great measure, from the ligneous texture. As, in these plants, a new layer of vessels is annually made to the wood, so a similar, but much thinner layer, is yearly added to the bark, to which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIBER\">liber</a> has commonly been applied. These vessels are at first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRAIT\">strait</a>, and run parallel to the axis of the trunk; but, by the successive formation of new layers beneath them, they are gradually forced outward, become separated more and more from each other, and, touching in a few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> only, exhibit at length a reticulated figure (See fig. 18. Plate XV.); the meshes of which yearly augment in size, from the greater space over which they are continually spread.\n\n126. Between the vessels thus annually formed, a considerable portion of cellular tissue is interposed, which, in the young and succulent state of parts, contributes chiefly to the thickness of the bark. This tissue is variously compressed by the vessels, so as to form transverse partitions betwixt them, which, in the Vine, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OAK\">Oak</a>, and many other trees, as both Grew and Malpighi remarked, are seen to be continuous with those of the wood; and in this way the two textures are united together. In the expressive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of Grew, the bark, therefore, does not merely surround the wood as a scabbard does a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>, or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLOVE\">glove</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, but is truly continuous with it, as the skin of the body is with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>.\" In the Willow and other trees, when full of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAP\">sap</a>, the bark is so easily separated that it seems to have no connection with the wood; but this is supposed by Grew to arise merely from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> fineness and tenderness of the vessels that are annually formed in that part, and which, on that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a>, oppose no obstacle to the separation. (Anat. of Plants, p. 129.) It is probable, however, that the cellular tissue forms the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> connection betwixt the cortical and ligneous textures, and that, if a vascular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> exist, it is only, as in all other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDIUM\">medium</a> of that tissue.\n\n127. Beside the transverse compression which the cellular tissue experiences from the vessels, it is compressed, in the opposite direction, by the formation of the new layers of bark and wood beneath the older bark. These, in the progress of their growth, exert an expansive force outwards, so that the cells of the tissue are made to assume an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a> or flattened form in the direction of the vessels of the trunk, or sometimes to form a thin fascia upon the vessels, in which the cellular character is nearly or entirely obliterated. It is by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> exertion of this force, acting on the exterior and desiccated layers, that these latter ultimately crack; producing figures of different sizes, which have frequently the shape of rhombs, the fissures of which represent, according to Grew, the position and track of the vessels in their reticulations. (Anat. of Plants, p. 129.) The spaces or meshes formed by these reticulations, are always filled up by cellular tissue, which, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of Malpighi, originates from the vessels themselves.\n\n128. Both in the vessels and cells of this texture, Collections of the proper juices frequently occur; especially in plants in which these juices are of a viscid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, and disposed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONCRETE\">concrete</a>; as was before remarked, when treating of the proper vessels. Similar collections of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, originally existing in the bark, are likewise met with in every layer of wood, and even in the pith of certain trees. It is only in plants in which the proper juices are coloured, or\ndisposed to concrete, that this intermixture of the cortical and ligneous textures has been traced through the whole substance of the tree; but it is probable, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONJUNCTION\">conjunction</a> of the vessels of the bark and wood at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of their formation, that it is common to other plants, the nature and properties of whose juices afford no clue to its detection.\n\n129. In most herbaceous plants, the cortical texture is not so clearly distinguished from that of the wood, since in them the greatest variety obtains both in regard to the number and relative position of the sap and proper vessels; and very frequently the cellular tissue is quite continuous, and of uniform appearance through the entire substance of the plant. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a>, however, the sap-vessels occupy the inner place, and are surrounded by the proper vessels, disposed either in rings, or distinct fasciculi, more or fewer in number. Sometimes the sap-vessels seem to be placed exterior to the others, and hence it is difficult to discover the true place of the proper vessels in such plants, unless the nature of their juices conduct to it. From the position of the vessels, therefore, it is often difficult to define the boundaries of the cortical and ligneous textures, and for the reason already assigned, the cellular tissue rarely affords much assistance. According, however, to the number and disposition of the vessels, this tissue, even in these plants, suffers a certain degree of compression, so as to form thickened boundaries around the fasciculi, or sometimes large transverse partitions which communicate with those of the wood, in which, though the figure of the cells is more or less altered, the cellular character is usually preserved.\n\n130. In other plants, the intermixture of proper vessels with those that carry sap, seems to be general through the whole plant; and consequently no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> can be made between the ligneous and cortical textures. In such plants, the proper juices must be considered to exist in every part; and accordingly Malpighi, as we before remarked, points out a vas proprium, or proper vessel, as accompanying every fasciculus of vessels in different species of wheat. (Anat. Plantar. p. 24.) From the similarity of structure in Palms, and especially from their mode of growth, there can be little doubt that a similar intermixture of the two kinds of vessels prevails everywhere in them; and with respect to these plants, what has already been said of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of the ligneous texture, is equally applicable to that of the bark.\n\n131. We have thus given a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIEF\">brief</a> and general view of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> textures that enter into the construction of plants, and pointed out the more prominent diversities of character and appearance which they exhibit, as well in their simple as in their more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPLEX\">complex</a> forms; and as they exist either separately or variously intermingled together. Our descriptions have been confined entirely to the trunk or stem, but, with slight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a>, they are applicable equally to the root and branch, in which a similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of the elementary organs obtains. In the root, however, they commonly exist in a more compressed and compacted form, so that the ligneous texture is seen chiefly to predominate, frequently to the entire exclusion of the pith; and often, in great part also, to that of the cellular portion of the bark. This is not however <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a>, especially in annual plants, some of which, as the carrot and others, particularly in a cultivated state, are distinguished by the very large portion of cellular tissue which enters into the construction of the cortical texture. Of the modifications of these several textures, as they exist in leaves and other organs, we shall have occasion to speak when we come to treat of them individually. We may now observe, that, how varied soever they may appear, when viewed only in their extreme results, yet all these variations seem to spring from a few original differences in character; which differences, modified by circumstances of subsequent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> and growth, produce, by gradations almost insensible, the manifold diversities of form and structure, which hereafter we shall attempt to describe.\n\n132. In our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a> of those several textures, we have noticed only in a general way, the direct means by which the vessels and cells that construct them are connected with each other; but, when treating of the sap-vessels of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSORBENT\">absorbent</a> vessels, and of the cellular tissue, we endeavoured to show, that an universal communication obtains between these elementary organs, and consequently inferred, that some mode of connection, by which it can be accomplished, must have place. Grew considered Opinion of the vascular and cellular parts to be connected with each other, not only by the transverse partitions of cellular substance that intercept the vessels\u2014but \"per minimas partes organicas;\" that is to say, the parenchymous fibres are wrapped round about the vessels, or at least interwoven with them, and with every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIBRE\">fibre</a> of every vessel, as in very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> ash or fir wood may be observed.\" (Anat. of Plants, p. 121.) These fibres, Grew elsewhere considers as vessels, and consequently must be regarded as maintaining, with Malpighi, a vascular connection between these organs. In a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of the young branches of of Mal- Chesnut and Oak, Malpighi delineates <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> filaments, springing on every side from the vessels of the wood, and continued into the adjacent cellular tissue (Anat. Plantar. p. 27.), but he does not state whether they are to be regarded as vessels or simple fibres. We have before shown, however, that he considered the cells to be everywhere furnished with minute ramifications derived from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> vessels; and, indeed, he held it probable, that the nutrient fluids, moving through the vessels, were, in all parts, poured into the cells, and there undergoing a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a>, were afterwards mixed with more recent juices, and with them taken up and applied to the support of the young buds and leaves. (Anat. Plantar. p. 30.) This doctrine has since been held by Darwin and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KNIGHT\">Knight</a>, and it necessarily supposes a vascular connection between the vessels and the cells, by which the functions both of secretion and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSORPTION\">absorption</a> can be performed. The microscopical observations of Leuwenhoeck, already noticed, supply farther <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> in support of this opinion.\n\n133. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> of Mirbel, both cells and vessels are considered as one and the same membrane. He rejects, therefore, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-AID\">aid</a> of all intermediate organs, as necessary to connect them together;\nand supposes a communication to be everywhere maintained between the vessels and cells, by the medium of pores in their sides. As, however, these pores are nowhere proved to have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> but in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> of the author, we may altogether reject their agency in maintaining a communication betwixt the vessels and cells of plants. In the opinion of M. Kieser, the conjunction of the cells with the vessels is extremely simple, the sides of the cells, says he, being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTIGUOUS\">contiguous</a> to the sides of the vessels.\n\n(M\u00e9m. sur l'Organisation des Plantes, p. 94.) But mere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTIGUITY\">contiguity</a> of parts does not amount to connection, much less does it afford any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> concerning the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> communication that exists between these organs. In addition, therefore, to connection by cellular substance, it seems absolutely necessary to suppose also the existence of a vascular structure, which shall at once serve as a medium both of connection and communication.\n\n134. Before concluding this branch of the subject, we may observe that the structure of the cellular tissue, and its relation to the vascular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> in plants, appears, in many points, to resemble that of the adipose cells, and their relation to the vascular system of animals. These cells are described as minute <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> cavities, possessing no apparent communication with each other; and within them adipose matter is alternately deposited and removed. Now, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEPOSITION\">deposition</a> of this matter could only be accomplished by secreting vessels, which terminated in the cells, and its removal be effected by absorbents, which originated from them; and accordingly, both blood-vessels and absorbents are found to be present in this texture; but neither the secreting nor absorbing orifices have ever been actually observed. Within the cells of the cellular tissue of plants, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> deposition and removal of various matters are not less certain; and in the germinating seed, the matter that actually existed in the cells is found afterwards in the vessels. We are led, therefore, or rather we are driven, not only by the direct exclusion of all other alleged means of communication, but by a close <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of these animal and vegetable functions, to conclude, that secreting and absorbing vessels must be employed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEPOSIT\">deposit</a> and remove the secreted matter from the cells of plants, in the same way as they are considered to effect similar depositions and removals of adipose matter from the cells of animals; and as this alternate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a> seems to go on in every part of the plant, capable of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> vegetation, it may farther be inferred, that a vascular connection and communication exists between the vessels and cells in all parts of the vegetable system.\n\n135. By means of this general communication between the vessels and the cells, we are enabled to assign satisfactory reasons for some puzzling phenomena, which have occurred in relation to the movements of the sap. It is by this alternate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of secretion and absorption, that, in young plants, we must suppose the cells of the pith, during the first year, to be filled with fluid; and to be rendered dry for the most part ever after. In like manner, the surface of the bark, in contact with the wood, appears, in some trees, as the Birch, to be rendered moist during the rise of the sap in spring; which led Dr Wal-\n\nker and others to suppose, that the sap rose in part betwixt the bark and the wood; an opinion not at all probable in itself, and certainly not supported by what is observed in most other trees. The fact, however, is easily explicable, on the supposition that the sap was transposed from the albuminous vessels of the wood, in the same manner as, at a later period, it is secreted in the same part, but in a different form, by the vessels of the bark, to form the new matter that is annually added to the tree.\n\n136. That the sap of plants was capable of moving in a lateral direction, was inferred by Malpighi from the fact that parts lived and grew, when the perpendicular vessels that supplied them with nutriment had been destroyed. (Anat. Plantar, p. 13.) The experiments of Hales afford more decisive evidence regarding this lateral movement of the sap. He cut two large gaps in the opposite sides of an Oak branch, at four inches distance from each other, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> the incisions <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to the pith; the branch nevertheless absorbed and perspired <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, but only in half the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> that another similar, but uncut, branch did. In branch of Cherry-tree, he made four similar cuts down to the pith, at four inches distance from each other, and opposed to the four points of the compass; the branch notwithstanding absorbed, in forty-eight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a>, twenty-four ounces of water. (Veg. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATICS\">Statics</a>, p. 128, 3d Edit.) And when similar incisions were made on branches, while still attached to the tree, their leaves continued green, nearly as long as those of other branches in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> state; whence he justly inferred, that, at these gaps made in the branch, a lateral movement of the sap must have taken place. Experiments of a similar nature have been made, and like results obtained, by Mr Knight (Phil. Trans. 1808); so that it seems clear, that, in certain circumstances, a lateral movement of the sap must have place.\n\n137. In what manner, then, must we suppose this movement to be accomplished? Grew supposed the cellular tissue, that stretches from the circumference to the centre of the plant, to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> by which such a communication could be maintained; but the impermeability of this tissue to fluids opposes such an opinion. Malpighi thought the lateral communication to be made by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANASTOMOSIS\">anastomosis</a> of vessels; but in the vessels of plants no such mode of communication appears to exist. From the ascent of the sap in branches in which the vessels had been thus previously cut through, Mr Knight infers, that this fluid does not rise in the vessels at all, but is conveyed through the cellular tissue. This opinion necessarily implies the permeability of this tissue by fluids, which, as we have shown, is contradicted by direct experiment, as well as by microscopical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>. Since, therefore, this lateral movement of the sap cannot be accomplished, either by simple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERCOLATION\">percolation</a> through the cells or vessels, or by direct anastomosis of the vessels with one another, no other known means of effecting it remain, but those of alternate deposition and absorption by the vessels into and from the cells. And if, as we have seen, the sap-vessels of plants deposit coloured fluids in the cells which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CAPILLARY\">capillary</a> absorbents of parasitic plants are able to take up, there seems no reason for deny-\ning to the vascular productions, which have been supposed everywhere to spring from the perpendicular vessels, a like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a> of absorbing fluids from the adjacent cells. These fluids must, however, in all cases, have been deposited before they could be absorbed; and by the alternate exercise of these functions, there is no difficulty in conceiving how a lateral movement of the sap might be accomplished, in parts, where, by the incision of the vessels, a stop was necessarily put to its perpendicular ascent.\n\nSection IV.\nOf the Skin or Cuticular Texture, and its Appendages.\n\nArticle I.\nDescription and Structure of the Skin.\n\n138. The skin, rind, cuticle, or epidermis, as it has been variously named, is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> of the common textures that remains to be described. It is the general envelope which invests all parts of the plant and all its productions, being equally common to the trunk and branches, the root, the leaves, the flowers, and the fruit; but in these different parts, and even in similar parts of different plants, it exhibits the greatest diversity of appearance, form, and texture.\n\n139. In herbaceous plants, and in the young shoots of those which are arborescent, it resembles a thin membrane, but is generally thicker on the stem than on the roots or leaves, and is of still more delicate texture where it is extended on the flowers. In some leaves, however, it is thick and dense, as is the case also in several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>, and is thereby fitted to resist the effects of too rapid desiccation. On the upper surface of some leaves, on many fruits, and on roots, it is an entire membrane, destitute of any apertures or pores; but on many stems, on the under surfaces of leaves, and sometimes on the upper, it is frequently furnished with numerous pores, often visible to the naked eye, and with other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUMINOUS\">luminous</a> points of smaller dimensions, which Du Hamel also regards as apertures. It is readily separable from the bark in recent and succulent parts, or after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MACERATION\">maceration</a> in water; and, in certain leaves, it is very completely separated by a species of caterpillar, named by Reaumur, the miner. It appears then to be a thin transparent membrane, often destitute of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, and deriving, therefore, its appearance from the colour of the parts beneath; but both in leaves and flowers it is often itself coloured. It is frequently seen to extend in all its dimensions, in common with the parts it covers. Very often too, as will be noticed hereafter, its surface is covered with hairs, and sometimes small follicles or utricles are met with, which exercise a glandular function.\n\n140. The characters above enumerated belong chiefly to the cuticle in its young and succulent state; in perennial plants, it commonly possesses others that are quite dissimilar. It is of a different colour not only on different trees, but on different parts of the same tree. It is white and shining on the trunk of the Birch, and browner on the branches; greyish on the Plum-tree; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> and silvery on the Cherry; green on the young branches of the Peach, and ash-coloured on the larger branches.\n\nIn these and many other instances, it does not, says Du Hamel, merely participate in the colour of the body it covers, but contributes itself to give colour to the exterior bark; for when it is stripped off, the substance below has frequently a different colour. (Phys. des Arbres, Tom. I. p. 10.) By the gradual enlargement of the trunk it is stretched and dried, and at length loses its vitality, and, as well as the bark beneath, is variously cracked and broken. Before this happens, however, it often undergoes considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> in all its dimensions, enlarging in breadth, and stretching longitudinally over the young shoots. This expanded state is particularly remarkable in certain fruits, in which, when they enlarge slowly, the cuticle is extended without rupture, to a very large size; but if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPANSION\">expansion</a> be very rapid, as after considerable rains, the cuticle then gives way. In certain trees, the cuticle is more susceptible of expansion than in others; and in very vigorous trees, it breaks more slowly than in those whose growth is languishing; although these latter push forward more slowly than the former. (Ibid. p. 11.) In some vigorous trees of this description, it altogether resists rupture, and in this state the tree is often said to be hide-bound, or bark-bound.\n\n141. In most instances, the cuticle, when taken Composed from young branches, appears to consist of a single layer; but on the branches of many species, says Du Hamel, after one plate or layer has been removed, another may be seen beneath, which resembles the former in its texture, but is much thinner and more green and succulent. From the Birch-tree, he has removed more than six layers; very thin and very distinct from each other, and is of opinion that more might still be separated. Sometimes the original cuticle seems to be entirely thrown off, and the exterior covering is formed by a portion of the cellular tissue of the bark. Grew thinks that this substitution takes place annually, the older skin being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> off like the skin of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADDER\">adder</a>, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a> of a new one beneath. (Anat. of Plants, p. 114.) Du Hamel describes also the existence of small leaflets or scales, which are continually detached from the cuticle of some trees; and these he considers to be as constantly replaced, by the formation of new ones beneath them.\n\n142. Concerning the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGENERATION\">regeneration</a> of the cuticle, Du Hamel observes, that when the wound is covered with waxed-cloth, a new cuticle is promptly formed without any separation of a portion of the bark beneath. When the exterior portion of the bark is removed with the skin, the inner part of it is equally capable of regenerating a cuticle; but if the wound be not protected from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, a certain degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXFOLIATION\">exfoliation</a> first occurs, and, under the decayed parts, a new skin forms. Even where the bark of a Cherry-tree was entirely removed from the trunk, he found that the wood was capable of regenerating a new bark and cuticle, if the parts were properly protected from the air. This cuticle did not originate from that which remained on the roots and branches; but was reproduced in isolated portions on different parts of the trunk; it continued, however, after the\n\nVEGETABLE.\n\nCommon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAPSE\">lapse</a> of fifteen years, always different from that of the natural growth. In other instances, he adds, the cuticle does not seem to be regenerated at all. He remarks certain analogies to exist between the cuticle in some plants and animals. Both, he adds, seem, in certain circumstances, capable of great extension; both are easily regenerated, and that in isolated portions, and not by continuity of organs, as is common in other instances; and both, lastly, are perpetually obliterated, and continually and imperceptibly renewed. (Phys. des Arbres, Tom. I. p. 11.)\n\nIts Nature.\n\n143. With respect to the nature of the cuticle, very different opinions have been advanced, and still continue to prevail. Are we to regard it as a peculiar organ, formed immediately by the proper exercise of the vegetative functions, or is it produced in a sort of secondary manner, by some changes induced on some previously constructed organ? Grew asserted it to be sometimes original, and in some instances produced out of the exterior layer of the cortical texture beneath it; and this view of its origin seems to be generally supported by the descriptive character which has been assigned to it. Its coexistence with the first traces of vegetable organization, its continued growth and expansion, and its subsequent regeneration, after removal, all seem to favour its primary and independent origin; and this view is also supported by investigations into its minute structure. Mirbel, however, and some other writers after Hill, have regarded it, in all cases, not as an original membrane, but formed by the exterior sides of the common tissue of the plant; and where there is no separation of these sides in the form of a membrane, such plants are held to be destitute of a cuticle. (Exposit. de l'Organisat. Veg. p. 103.) This may assimilate very well with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> views that pervade all this author's speculations concerning vegetable organization; but will, we suspect, make few converts among those accustomed to contemplate the powers and properties of living textures.\n\n144. Another question relating to this organ is, Whether it must be considered a simple membrane of uniform structure, or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> of two distinct parts, like the true skin and the cuticle in animals? Grew seems to have regarded it as a simple body, but constructed both of vessels and cells, the cells being continuous with those of the bark. (Anat. of Plants, p. 62.) Such too seems to have been nearly the opinion of Malpighi, who describes it as constructed of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> ranges of cells, but often delineates reticulations of vessels as constituting a part of its structure. (Anat. Plantar. p. 2\u201419.) In the Birch, the Plum, the Cherry-tree, and others, Du Hamel declares the component fibres of the cuticle to possess a direction transverse to that of the trunk; but this is not general. In the Birch-tree, the fibres seemed to be placed parallel to each other, and to be connected together by lateral fibres; but he could see nothing of the vesicular structure of Malpighi and Grew, and regards, therefore, the structure of this texture to be altogether fibrous. (Phys. des Arbres, Tom. I. p. 8 and 9.) M. Desfontaines, on the other hand, describes it as a membrane, resembling in appearance a thin plate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARCHMENT\">parchment</a>, and perforated by imperceptible pores, which give <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> to the insensible transpiration. Its structure he regards as unknown, but considers it capable of regeneration. (M\u00e9m. de l'Inst. Nat. Tom. I. p. 481.)\n\n145. M. Kieser, who professes to have studied this texture with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, adopts nearly the opinion of Grew; pronouncing the cuticle to be constructed of a very fine cellular tissue, and of extremely minute vessels, which run through its whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>. These vessels form an exceedingly delicate and subtle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">net</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, the meshes of which possess very different forms, and their vessels terminate at the orifice of a pore. His observations were made on the cuticle of leaves. On the inferior surface of the leaf of Amaryllis formosissima, (fig. 14. A. Plate XVIII.) magnified 260 times, these vascular meshes of the cuticle have an elongated hexagonal form; and four of their vessels proceed always to terminate at the orifice of the little oblong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APERTURE\">aperture</a> or pore situated at their junction. In Canna Indica, the vessels of the meshes on the lower part of the leaf, which thus terminate in the pores, are said to originate from a fasciculus of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRAL\">spiral</a> vessels that ramify through the leaf; as is represented at a' in fig. 14. B. Plate XVIII.; and within the areas of the larger meshes, a still finer net-work of vessels is seen. On the inferior surface of the leaf of a species of Fern, the vessels of the cuticle, instead of forming meshes of different figures, exhibit the appearance of sinuous lines, which run in every direction through the cuticle. See fig. 15. Plate XVIII., which represents the central part of the little adjoining leaf, magnified 180 times. These sinuous vessels often join, and, after making a half circle, terminate by one extremity in the minute pores everywhere spread over the leaf, and by the other in the larger vascular fasciculi that ramify through it. At the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> b', in this figure, the hexagonal cells that construct the parenchyme of the leaf, are distinctly visible through the vascular sinuosities of the cuticle. It was by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of this leaf that M. Kieser was first enabled to discover the origin and termination of the vessels that construct the cuticle; having in all his previous investigations examined the cuticle in its separated state, after it was detached from its connection with the other organs; but the researches made on this leaf rendered everything clear. (M\u00e9m. sur l'Organisat. des Plantes, p. 141-2.)\n\n146. The vascular net-work of the cuticle, thus described by M. Kieser and others, had been regarded as a deception by M. Krocker, who considered these reticulated figures as no part of the real structure of the cuticle, but merely as the sides of the subjacent cells; in which opinion, Sprengel, Link, Jurine, and Mirbel, concurred; but M. Kieser, in opposition to this opinion, maintains that, in the Fern and other leaves, the real cellular structure of the parenchyme is seen entire through the vascular reticulations of the cuticle, with the meshes of which the sides of the subjacent cells do not anywhere coincide. He observes that these cells are commonly much smaller than the vascular meshes which cover them; and that the vessels of these meshes may be traced, as before remarked, to the larger fasciculi that construct the leaf. In the Fern, the vascular structure of the cuti-\n\nVEGETABLE.\n\n147. A very different view of the structure of the cuticle was taken by the late celebrated M. De Saussure. He regarded it not as a simple, but a compound texture, consisting of a very delicate external pellicle or membrane, beneath which was placed a net-work of very fine vessels. The external membrane he describes as perforated by pores of unequal figure, between which he observed some opaque and tortuous filaments, disposed in a reticulated manner, each mesh being formed by six filaments, four of which terminated at each pore. To this arrangement of filaments, he gave the name of cortical network, and regarded it as quite distinct from the cuticle that covered it. The meshes of this net-work differ much in size and figure in different leaves; and, when minutely examined, they are often seen to form junctions, but never to cross each other; whence he was led to regard them as vessels derived from those of the expanded petiole, and thus constituting a very fine vascular net-work. A similar structure was observed in the petals of the flower. (Encyclop. M\u00e9thod. Tom. I. p. 67.)\n\n148. M. Decandolle, to whose researches we before alluded when treating of the absorbent system, adopts a similar view of the compound nature of this texture. He describes it as consisting of a proper cuticle, and of a cortical net-work, the vessels of which terminate at oval pores, more or less elongated. Around these pores, the vessels (or fibres, as he calls them) form an oval <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol18.html#article-RING\">ring</a>, which is connected to the rest of the net-work, by two, three, or four radiating vessels, derived from the vessels of the petiole. These vessels of the petiole he considers to form, first, the larger vascular fasciculi; then, by their subdivision, the parenchymic of the leaf, and afterwards to construct the net-work that terminates at the pores. The form of the meshes of the vascular rings, and of the pores, is the same always in the same species, and on the same faces of the stem, the leaves, and the flowers. (M\u00e9m. de l'Institut Nat. Tom. I. p. 351.)\n\n149. Such are the very different opinions held by enlightened observers concerning this texture. Each professes to have given descriptions from accurate microscopical observation, and it would therefore be presumptuous, on mere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> alone, to decide on their respective merits. Granting to each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PARTY\">party</a> similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a>, as far as regards accuracy of observation, we confess that the latter opinion seems to us, on other grounds, best entitled to preference. In both views, the direct connection of the vascular system with the external pores of the leaf is admitted, which is perhaps the most important point in the inquiry; and the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> is, whether these vessels shall be regarded as a constituent part of the cuticle itself, or as forming a fine vascular net-work, connected with, but still distinct from it.","sp":562,"ep":569},{"h":"ANATOMY","t":"VEGETABLE.\n\nOf the Seed-ture is placed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the side; in the Chestnut, on the top; in the Gourd, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a>; and in each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, the point of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RADICLE\">radicle</a> is opposed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APERTURE\">aperture</a>, and first pushes forth through it.

In many seeds, however, the radicle is not thus opposed to the umbilicus; but, according to Gaertner, is variously placed with regard to it; and in the seeds of the Apple and Pear, Malpighi considers no proper umbilical aperture to exist, but only an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HIATUS\">hiatus</a> to be formed by the relaxation of the tunics, through which the radicle makes its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>. (Anat. Plantar. p. 9.)\n\nVarieties in its Form.\n\n177. There can be no doubt, that, in every case, a connection subsisted between the seed and the ovary, during the formation of the seed; but this, in different examples, may have much varied. In all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, an umbilical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CORD\">cord</a> must have existed, and appears, in many examples, from inspection of mature seeds, to have been the only visible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDIUM\">medium</a> of connection. In the Bean, however, beside the umbilical cord, there are marks of a connection also between the coats of the seed and those of the ovary that contained it; so that the scar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> cicatrix, in that and similar cases, is distinct from the umbilical aperture. The scar is the mark left by the separation of the tunics <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> from the ovary; the foramen is the aperture produced by the separation of the umbilical cord. It <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be afterwards stated, that the outer coat of the seed appears always to have originated from the inner coat of the ovary; so that it forms a sheath about the umbilical cord. If, therefore, as in the Bean, these coats are thick, and the umbilical cord short, then traces of the separation, both of the coats and of the cord, will remain on the seed; if, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, the coats are thin, and the cord more elongated, this latter will be closely invested by the former, and the umbilical scar will present the appearance only of a simple aperture, as is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> to many seeds.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">Opinion</a> of M. Turpin.\n\n178. A late writer, M. Turpin, regards the umbilical scar as consisting of three parts, viz. the proper cicatrix itself, in the centre of which he describes an aperture through which the nutrient vessels passed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMBRYO\">embryo</a>, and near to it another smaller aperture, through which he believes the spermatic vessels to have passed. The former he calls the omphalode, the latter the micropyle; and declares, that he observed it in more than 1200 seeds. (An. du Mus. d'Hist. Nat. Tom. VII. p. 199.) Aware, however, of the fallacy of microscopical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> employed on such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> objects, we shall suspend our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> of this structure, until it receive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> from some other observer. As yet, we believe, no one has been able to share with M. Turpin the benefit of this discovery.\n\nRegions of the Seed.\n\n179. From the situation of the umbilicus, the several parts or regions of the seed have been defined. They are six in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> where the umbilicus itself is placed, is termed the basis, and the point at the opposite extremity, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERTEX\">vertex</a> of the seed; the upper or back part is named the dorsum or back; and the part opposite to it the venter or belly; while the two lateral portions are called the sides (lateral). The point where the umbilical cord is inserted into the inner coat has been named the internal umbilicus. This point usually coincides with that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a>, but, from a change in the relative position of the parts during their formation, this coincidence is not always to be observed. Umbilicus, (Gaertner de Fructib. et Seminib. Plantar. Vol. I.)\n\n180. When examined in its mature state, the seed coat is found to be composed of certain coats or tunics, which enclose a kernel or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUCLEUS\">nucleus</a>, that also consists of several distinct parts. At an early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of growth, while the parts are still green and succulent, two coats are easily distinguished; as in the transverse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> of the bean, D. fig. 21. Plate XV.; in which the inner coat appears much thicker than the outer, and the radicle (b) is seen rising through it.\n\nWhen these coats are stripped off, the other parts, its Nucleus, which form the nucleus, are brought into view. They consist, in the Bean and most other seeds, of two distinct parts, the lobes or cotyledons, as they have been called, and the radicle and plumule. These several parts can be seen only by separating the two lobes from each other, as is done in fig. 22., where the letters (cc) denote the cotyledons, (d) the radicle, in Dicotyledons, and (e) the plumule. Such seeds as have thus two cotyledons, are named dicotyledonous.\n\n181. In many seeds, however, the part called cotyledon is single, and bears but a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to the entire bulk of the seed. An example of this kind is presented in fig. 23., which represents a section of the seed of Canna Indica. The nucleus enclosed in its two tunics, forms, as before, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> bulk of the seed, and in its centre appears an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a> body (f), in Mono-cotyledons, the cotyledon, at the base of which the mono-cotyledonate radicle and plumule (g) may be discovered. The little oblong body below, represents the cotyledon alone. Seeds, which have thus but one cotyledon, are named Monocotyledons; and to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> the seeds of wheat, barley, and all the grasses belong.\n\n182. Some botanists have alleged, that several orders of the lower tribes of plants are entirely destitute of a cotyledon, and have given to such the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of Acotyledons. This title was formerly considered to apply to all cryptogamic plants; but the researches of the elder Jussieu and of Hedwig, are said to have proved it to be inapplicable to Ferns and Mosses; and the seeds of the Algae and Fungi have not yet been discovered. Others assert, that some seeds have more than two cotyledons, and such seeds they have denominated Polycotyledons; but others again choose to consider these appearances not as distinct cotyledons, but only as deep fissures, or divisions in two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIMARY\">primary</a> lobes\u2014and hence conclude, that all seeds may be classed under the two divisions of mono and di-cotyledons. We are not competent to decide on the merits of these opposite opinions; but shall only observe, that they seem to be governed as much, at least, by preconceived views of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a>, as by unprejudiced observations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>.","sp":573,"ep":574},{"h":"ANATOMY","t":"VEGETABLE.\n\nOf the Seed, as the tunics come first into view, we shall begin with them. These tunics, in some seeds, are two; in others, three, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>. By Grew, they were named coats <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> covers; by Malpighi, secondine; and by Gaertner, testa and membrana interna. We shall speak of them in the familiar terms of the outer, the inner, and the middle coats, or tunics.\n\nOuter Coat. 184. The outer coat or testa of Gaertner, is described as a constant and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the seed. It existed before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of fecundation, and is sometimes the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> covering possessed by the mature seed. Some seeds have indeed been considered to possess no tunic whatever; and have therefore, says Gaertner, been named accor; but in such seeds there existed a coat before they arrived at maturity, and its apparent absence has been inferred from its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> thinness, or its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONDENSATION\">condensation</a> with the sides of the surrounding ovary. (De Fructib. Plantar. Vol. I. p. 132.) A distinguished botanist, however, Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">Brown</a>, is said to have lately discovered two examples of seeds absolutely destitute of a covering, from their first appearance to their state of maturity. (Thomson's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANNALS\">Annals</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">Philosophy</a>, Vol. I. p. 319.)\n\nIn Structure. 185. In different seeds, this tunic possesses a very different structure, being in some thin and membranous; in others of a spongy or fleshy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>; and in others, again, it approaches to the consistence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a> or bone. But how various soever in this respect, it is always an entire tunic, and has no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APERTURE\">aperture</a> but that of the umbilical foramen. Its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> is usually deeper than that of the other parts of the seed, and in this particular it presents every possible variety. It has rarely any connection with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUCLEUS\">nucleus</a>, except in some monocotyledons. (Gaertner. Vol. I. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>. 9.) With regard to its origin, Malpighi describes it, in its earliest state in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALMOND\">Almond</a>, as derived from the ovary itself, being composed of reticulated vessels, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> from the surrounding organ. In other instances, it is thicker, and is distinctly seen to be cellular, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as vascular; and in the Bean and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol17.html#article-PEA\">Pea</a>, little tubes are said by Malpighi to originate from the cells, and terminate by open mouths <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the surface. (Anat. Plantar. p. 9.)\n\nPellicula. 186. Both Malpighi and Grew discovered, in some instances, a very thin membrane to cover this outer coat, which, according to Gaertner, may be found in most seeds, if the parts be scrupulously examined. Its structure is sometimes membranous, often downy, and sometimes mucilaginous; it possesses occasionally considerable thickness, and at other times is a mere pellicle; and thence has been named pellicula. It covers the whole seed, and does not ever separate spontaneously from it. (Gaertner de Fructib. &c. Vol. I. cap. 9.)\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARILLUS\">Arillus</a>. 187. Besides this pellicle, another fine tunic named arillus, is sometimes observed on the surface of the seed, as in the seed of Euphorbia. It originates from the umbilical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CORD\">cord</a> at the base, and extends more or less completely over the body of the seed. Its structure is very various, being sometimes soft and pulpy; at others, thin and membranous; and in others, forming a husky covering. It forms, in some instances, only a loose and partial covering; and in others, it invests the seed so closely and completely, that it can scarcely be distinguished from the outer coat itself. Both of the Seed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> and colour it often varies greatly; but, like the pellicle before described, it is regarded rather as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCESSORY\">accessory</a>, than a necessary integument.\n\n188. To the exterior coat of the seed, various appendages are sometimes attached, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>, wings, spines, hooks, all designed either as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> to seeds, or to facilitate their dispersion. They are distinguished and described by the botanist; but are, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a>, of too fine a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEXTURE\">texture</a> to be made the subject of anatomical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a>.\n\n189. The inner tunic (membrana interna of Gaertner) is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a>, but not constant part of the mature seed. It appears sometimes to be wanting, when in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a> it is present. During the formation of the seed, it is frequently so attenuated, or coalesces so completely with the outer coat, that it cannot be properly distinguished. In its earlier state, it is represented by Grew as a very spongy and succulent body, and as thick and bulky as one of the lobes itself; but it dries and shrinks up as the seed approaches maturity, so that it is sometimes scarcely discernible. (Anat. of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTS\">Plants</a>, p. 47.) In the seeds of most plants, it closely invests the nucleus, but is easily separable from the outer tunic. In those of the Gramineae, where the bulk of the seed consists almost entirely of inorganic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, no separation of this tunic from the contained parts occurs; but its inner surface is formed into a cellular tissue, in the cells of which the nutrient matter is lodged. In other instances, the inner surface is prolonged into processes, which penetrate into the nucleus, and intersect it in various directions.\n\n190. This inner tunic does not, like the former, exist before fecundation, but is formed subsequently to it. It is composed of vessels and cellular tissue. The cells are commonly larger than those of the outer coat. It has no aperture, says Gaertner, not even an umbilical one; but resembles a shut sac, over whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> surface the umbilical vessels creep, and open, in an insensible manner, within its cavity. (De Fructib. &c. cap. 9.) The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a> of the vessels throughout the whole of this coat Grew compares to that in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a>.\n\n191. Beneath this inner tunic, Grew describes another fine membrane, which immediately invests the third coat, the lobes or cotyledons of the seed. In the Bean, it is exquisitely thin, and so firmly continuous with the lobes, that some dexterity is required to accomplish its separation. It is spread not only over the convex surface of the lobes, but also over the inner or flat surfaces, where they are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTIGUOUS\">contiguous</a>, extending likewise over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RADICLE\">radicle</a> and plume, and so over the whole nucleus of the seed. It does not, like the other tunics, cease to grow in germination, but is augmented and grows with the organic parts. (Anat. of Plants, B. I. ch. 1.) This tunic may be regarded either as a covering to the nucleus, or as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> portion of it, as Gaertner, who speaks only of two coats, seems to have considered it. It appears, however, more proper to regard it as the innermost coat, and thus to conclude with Grew that the covers in most seeds are three. (Ibid. B. IV. ch. 3.) The coat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> described must, in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, be considered as the middle tunic, being situated between the outer\nOf the Seed\u2014One, and that which is continuous with the nucleus.\n\nIn many seeds, however, only two coats are distinctly visible.\n\nUses of the Coats.\n\n192. The foregoing tunics not only contain the nutrient matter, and afford a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> protection to the organic parts, but seem fitted also, by their chemical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>, to resist the operation of agents that might otherwise effect their decomposition, and that of the nucleus they enclose. From the experiments of Fourcroy and Vauquelin, on the tunics of certain seeds that grow in marshy situations, it appears, that, beside the usual ingredients of vegetable substances, there exists in them a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a>, formed by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of tannin with a peculiar matter of an animal nature, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNION\">union</a> with a vegetable acid. This combination of tannin with the matter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> mentioned, renders these tunics insoluble in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, and enables them to resist <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUTREFACTION\">putrefaction</a>, although buried for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> periods in the moist <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>. The tunics of those seeds, which do not possess this chemical constitution, may, it is added, by their ligneous or horny texture, or by the oily matter with which they are penetrated, present similar obstacles to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of decomposing agents. (An. du Mus. d'Hist. Nat. Tom. XV. p. 77.)\n\nArticle III.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">Description</a> and Structure of the Nucleus of the Seed.\n\n193. We proceed next to describe the parts contained within the above-mentioned coats or tunics, and which constitute the nucleus of the seed. These parts, as already observed, consist of the radicle, the plume, and cotyledons, together, in most instances, with the nutrient matter destined to support their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> growth. The three former bodies are completely organized, but the nutrient matter is wholly inorganic, varies greatly in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> in different seeds, and is very variously situated with respect to the organized parts.\n\n194. These parts, which, in the progress of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVOLUTION\">evolution</a>, give birth to the new vegetable, derive their visible origin from a medullary point, that succeeds to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of fecundation. By some, these organized parts have been called the corculum; by others, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMBRYO\">embryo</a>; by others, fetus; and by others, plantula seminalis. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIMARY\">primary</a> point or particle, from which they originate, may, with propriety, says Gaertner, be termed corculum, since it is the source and seat of vegetable life, and from it the whole vascular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of the embryo proceeds. In some instances, this corculum increases so little as to be scarcely visible even in the mature seed; or exhibits only a palish spot, which has been termed cicatricula. In others, it forms a roundish radicle, whose apex is free, and rises above the nucleus, but whose base is firmly connected with it. In others, again, the corculum is still more disengaged, enlarging at each extremity, and producing at one end the radicle; and separating at the other into the two lobes called cotyledons, between which the first bud or plume of the future plant is situated. From this varying growth of the corculum, an embryo, more or less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a>, is produced. When the embryo presents only a mere germinating point, it is stiled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a>; when it exhibits a simple radicle, it is deemed incomplete; when it possesses both radicle and cotyledon, it is considered perfect; and when it consists of radicle, cotyledon, and plume, it is pronounced complete. (Gaertner de Fructib. &c. Vol. I. cap. 13.)\n\n195. In the mature seeds of the less perfect plants, the embryo is altogether invisible until after germination, and even, in many other instances, its characters cannot be accurately traced. Its general figure is determined by that of the radicle and cotyledons, and is exceedingly various in different seeds. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIZE\">size</a>, it ranges from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> point to that of a body of considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a>. In consistence, it is almost always soft and herbaceous, but its radicle possesses sometimes a ligneous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a>. No seed contains more than one embryo, except in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> of superfection, of which Gaertner <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> one instance in Pinus Cembra, a seed of which contained two embryos within one and the same cavity. (De Fructib. Vol. I. p. 168.) Malpighi also records a similar occurrence in a seed of Prunus Armeniaca; and the seeds of the Gramineae, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> afterwards be shown, are capable of evolving an indefinite number of embryos. Every complete embryo is said to consist of three distinct parts, beside cotyledons. These are the radicle, the stem, and the plume.\n\n196. The radicle (radicula), called rostellum by Linnaeus, is the most constant part of the embryo, being found in some seeds, in which no other trace of that body can be discovered. In the seeds, however, of the less perfect plants, and even in those of some monocotyledons, no radicle is visible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTECEDENT\">antecedent</a> to germination. In some rare instances among dicotyledons, as in Nelumbo nucifera, no radicle exists; but, in germination, the stem first rises upward, and afterwards emits rootlets from its sides. (An. du Mus. d'Hist. Nat. Tom. XIII.)\n\n197. The size of the radicle is very various, and so also is its figure, being either conical, cylindrical, filiform, or tubercular, &c. It always, says Gaertner, occurs solitary, except in Secale, Triticum, and Hordeum, to which alone, of all known seeds, three, four, or six radicles, properly formed, and distinct from each other, are furnished to each embryo. (De Fructib. &c. p. 169.) This plurality of radicles in the cerealia had before been remarked by Malpighi. M. Du Hamel describes the seed of Mistletoe (Viscum <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALBUM\">Album</a>), as emitting numerous radicles like those of wheat. (M\u00e9m. de l'<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol2.html#article-ACAD\">Acad</a>. des Sciences, 1740.)\n\n198. The stem (scapus) of the embryo is a continuation of the radicle, and connects it with the plume. It is frequently wanting altogether, nor, when it is present, can we fix precisely on the point where the radicle ends and the stem begins. What is called stem, descends frequently into the earth, and becomes a true root; so that every part of the embryo, situated beneath the cotyledons, might, without impropriety, be denominated radicle. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of junction between the radicle and stem was called by Grew the coarcture, from its presenting often an evident <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a>; but M. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BONNET\">Bonnet</a>, and others, have given it the more appropriate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of the neck (collum) of the seed.\n\n199. The plume (plumula) is the first bud of the\nOf the Seed, new plant. In seeds that possess but one cotyledon, it is very generally wanting; and, even in those which have two cotyledons, it is not unfrequently absent, or is at least concealed within the stem. In most of the latter sort of seeds, however, the plume is met with. It is placed on the top of the stem or radicle, and lies between the cotyledons, by which it is variously compressed and folded on itself. In the greater number of seeds it is not entire, but, at its free end, is divided into several pieces, all closely coiled together, like feathers in a bunch, and thence called the plume by Grew. In different seeds, its several little leaves vary much, both in figure, size, and number. The structure, both of the radicle and plume, will be most advantageously <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> in connection with that of the cotyledons.\n\n200. Of the organized parts of the seed, the organs called by Grew lobes, or dissimilar leaves; by Malpighi, seminal leaves, or cotyledons, remain to be described. The cotyledons derive their origin from the embryo itself, of which they constitute a part. The seeds, however, of some tribes of vegetables, as before remarked, are held not to possess these organs; and in many others, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of nutrient matter has been confounded with them. When present, they are either simple or divided. The simple cotyledon is formed by the mere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of the corculum, and is in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> scarcely distinguishable from the stem itself. The double, or conjugate cotyledons, are produced by fissures which usually divide that part of the embryo that is opposed to the radicle, into two or more equal portions or lobes. These lobes have, at first, the appearance of mere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TUBERCLES\">tubercles</a>, and in many seeds they retain this form unchanged; but, in others, they gradually expand into lamellae, or plates, which augment in size, and finally exhibit the proper form of cotyledons. This form is very various, as likewise is the size of these organs. Sometimes they are so small as to be scarcely visible, and sometimes so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> as to form the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> portion of the seed. Their substance is either thin, or thick, or turgid. Their colour is commonly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>, but sometimes yellowish, purple, or green; the colour into which they all pass during germination.\n\n201. Concerning the structure of the cotyledons, it may be said that, in the more perfectly developed seeds, they are formed of cellular tissue, through which vessels are everywhere distributed; and, as we have already remarked, they are everywhere covered by a fine pellicle, or coat, which prevents alike their adherence to the plume and to each other. This cellular structure of the cotyledon is well displayed by Grew (fig. 24. Pl. XV.) in a slice of the cotyledon of the recent bean; and it is easily seen in a thin slice of almost any mature seed, if it be held against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> after it has been soaked in water. This cellular structure extends into the radicle and plume, but in much smaller proportion, constituting, according to Grew, about 3/8ths of the plume, 3/8ths of the radicle, and 3/8ths of the cotyledon.\n\n202. Through all the organs that compose the nucleus, vessels are distributed, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDIUM\">medium</a> of which a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> is established among them. This vascular system is likewise exhibited by Grew in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISSECTION\">dissection</a> of a Bean (fig. 26. Plate XV.), in which the vessels are seen to branch off on each side from the radicle, and spread themselves, by innumerable ramifications, through the cotyledons. From the radicle, vessels also pass upwards to the plume. These vessels of the radicle are visible when a transverse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> is made through it, as in fig. 27. E., in which they are seen to occupy the middle of that body. When the section is made higher up at the neck of the embryo, as in the same fig. F, then the central <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a>, surrounded by several smaller fasciculi of vessels, passing to the different parts of the plume, is still more clearly exposed. In many seeds, however, the organized parts are so small that their general structure cannot be traced, except during the progress of their germination. We shall therefore defer the description of them, till we come to treat of their evolution; and shall then also go more fully into the structure of the parts just mentioned.\n\n203. Within the cells of the cotyledon, in many dicotyledonous seeds, the nutrient matter, destined to support the future growth of the embryo, is entirely contained. In other instances, this matter is only in part received into those organs; and in the Gramineae, and other monocotyledons, it is often placed almost entirely exterior to the cotyledon. This matter is produced from a clear liquor that is secreted in the tunic during the formation of the seed. To this liquor Grew gave the name of albumen, from its likeness not only in appearance, but, as he conceived, in use also, to the white of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGG\">egg</a> in animals. By Malpighi, this matter, considered in connection with the tissue that contains it, is often called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> (caro) of the seed; and from its being sometimes situated around the embryo, it has been denominated perisperm by M. Jussieu. We follow Grew and Gaertner in the use of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> albumen; meaning to express thereby, not the primary animal compound to which chemists have of late assigned that term, and which is found but in few vegetables; but that compound substance which, whatever be its situation, quantity, or colour, constitutes the nutrient matter of the seed.\n\n204. This albumen is a very constant part of the mature seed, but its proportion, in some seeds, is so extremely small, that the seeds in which this occurs have been termed exalbuminous; and, in a few instances, it seems to be entirely wanting. Its quantity, situation, and figure, in different seeds, are subject to very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a>. In the seeds of the Gramineae, where the embryo acquires only a very small size, the albumen constitutes almost the entire bulk of the seed, and is placed wholly exterior to the embryo. In the Leguminose, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, the embryo is more completely developed, and the whole of the albuminous matter is contained within the cotyledons. In beet (Beta), and many others, the albumen is partly received into the cotyledons, and lies in part exterior to them; and where this occurs, the embryo sometimes encircles the albumen, and is sometimes encircled by it. In Rheum, the embryo is placed in the centre of the albumen; in Rumex, and some others, it is applied on the side of it; in Atriplex, the long cylindrical embryo surrounds the albumen; in Boerhaavia, the embryo and its cotyle-\nOf the Seed. The albumen cover entirely the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANULATED\">granulated</a> substance of the albumen. (M. Jussieu, *An. du Mus. d'Hist. Nat.* Tom. V. p. 224.) In the Onion (*Allium cepa*), the embryo makes several curves within the substance of the albumen; and in dodder (*<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSCUTA\">Cuscuta</a>*), it is twisted around it in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRAL\">spiral</a> form; so that the relative positions of the embryo and albumen, as well as their quantity, proportion, and figure, are subject to endless variation.\n\nAlbumen of Wheat. 205. But however much, in these respects, the albumen may vary, it is always contained within an organized structure. Sometimes this structure is that of the cotyledon, as already exhibited in the Bean, fig. 24, the cells of which contain this albuminous matter. Where the albumen is placed exterior to the embryo, as in the seeds of Wheat, it is nevertheless contained in a cellular tissue. This is exhibited in fig. 25, Plate XV., copied from Leeuwenhoek, in which cells of an hexagonal form are seen to be filled with the albuminous particles that constitute the white matter or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLOUR\">flour</a> of that seed. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAL\">meal</a> part of Wheat he describes as consisting of minute globules, enclosed in a kind of membrane so exquisitely thin as scarcely to be observed, within which the globules are contained, as it were, in cells. The globules appeared to be of different sizes, not perfect spheres, but having an indentation on one part, which led him to suppose that they were not formed by simple accretion, but by some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of growth, and that \"the membranes which enclose them in cells, must be provided with so many veins or vessels, that every particle of meal may have its separate vessel.\" He even conceived the globules themselves to be enclosed individually in a thin skin or shell; but this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> he never brought to ocular demonstration. (*Select Works by Hoole*, Vol. I. p. 169.) It may, therefore, be presumed that, in this instance, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> went beyond the powers of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MICROSCOPE\">microscope</a>. Similar observations on the albuminous part of Wheat have since been given by Mirbel; and Kieser and others have delineated the globular particles contained in the cotyledonous cells of the Bean and other seeds; so that whether the albumen be situated in the cotyledons, or be placed exterior to them, it is, in every case, contained in a similar and distinctly organized structure.\n\nVarieties of Albumen. 206. In consistence, the albumen varies; it is said to be either farinaceous, fleshy, or cartilaginous; and it may exist in various intermediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>. The farinaceous kind is readily reduced to powder, and is dissolved by water into a viscous mass. The embryo is generally placed exterior to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of albumen, as in the Gramineae. The fleshy albumen is more frequent. It is softer than the former, and dissolves by water into a gelatinous mass. It is often entirely contained within the embryo and its cotyledons, and yields the thick <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> that is expressed from many seeds. Lastly, the cartilaginous species has a horny consistence, is difficulty soluble in water, and not easily reduced to powder. The embryo is never placed exterior to it, and when it contains oil, this is usually very thin. (*Gartner de Fructib.* Vol. I. cap. x.)\n\nUses of Albumen. 207. In many seeds, the albumen serves as a support and defence to the embryo as well as for nutriment. If it be removed previous to germination, as was done by Mirbel (*An. du Mus. d'Hist. Nat.* Tom. XIII. p. 157.), in the seed of the onion, and by Dr Yule (*Wern. Trans.* Vol. I. p. 591.), in different species of Gramineae, the embryo, though planted in a rich <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, and carefully tended, grows but feebly, and for the most part dies.\n\n208. Besides the albumen above described, Gaert-Vitellus has revived the use of the term *vittellus*, but employed it to designate a very different part from that to which it was originally applied by Grew. The latter made use of this term to designate the inorganic matter of the mature seed, which, in the early stage of its production, he called albumen (*Anat. of Plants*, Book iv. ch. iii.); but it is employed by Gaertner to indicate a small membranous body, which, in many seeds, is placed between the embryo and albumen, and is closely connected with the former, but separates easily from the latter. The figure of this small body is described as being very various in different seeds. It is said not to rise out of the earth during germination; but, like the albumen, seems destined to afford nutriment to the embryo. It forms the chief bulk of the seeds of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CRYPTOGAMIA\">Cryptogamia</a>; and in those of the Gramineae, it represents a thin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a> interposed between the albumen and embryo, to which, from its shield-like form, he gives the name of *scutellum*. (*De Fructib. Plantar.* Vol. I. cap. xii.) There can be no doubt that this scutellum of Gaertner is the little \"conglobate leaf\" first observed in Wheat by Malpighi, and which later writers have denominated the cotyledon of that seed. In the next section, its form and situation will be clearly displayed.\n\nVEGETABLE.\n\nOf the Seed, gins to look green; the three radicles have pierced the enveloping sac, and are everywhere thickly covered with hairs; and above the two first lateral radicles, two small protuberances, v. z. fig. 43, the origins of two more radicles, are now seen to emerge, while the sac that envelopes them is observed sensibly to waste.\n\n4th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>:\n\n223. When the third day has elapsed, the plume, enclosed in a fine transparent membrane, is still more elevated, and acquires a greenish colour; the protuberances of the two new radicles are more prominent, and the three former radicles have greatly augmented: the cotyledon is much softer, and as if milky, yielding, when compressed, a white and sweetish liquor.\n\n5th day:\n\n224. After the completion of the fourth day, the plume v., fig. 44, continuing to ascend, pierces the membranous covering x, and pushes into day a permanent leaf, green and convoluted, around which the membrane forms a sheath. Inferiorly, the three first radicles have greatly extended, and the two others yy, are much increased: the outer coat of the seed now begins to lessen, but still contains a sweetish liquor. M. Poiteau gives a section of the entire plantule about this period of its growth, which agrees very exactly with the figure of Malpighi. In this section, fig. 45, the plume a' is seen to have pierced the membrane b' that formerly enclosed it; the albumen c' is diminished; the cotyledon d' retains its situation and form; and the five radicles e'e' are nearly of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>, and covered with hairs.\n\n6th day:\n\n225. About the sixth day, the plantule, still invested by its sheath, begins to open and expand; the seminal tunics shrink, and the surface of the outer coat is corrugated. If these tunics are cut open, the cotyledon within is observed, in some parts, to be firmer than before, and has the appearance of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCAVE\">concave</a> leaf; but in other parts, it is more vascular, and filled with juice, especially in that part near to the mammary vessels.\n\n11th day:\n\n226. After the eleventh day, these tunics still adhere to the plantule, but appear much wasted, and the juice they contain is mixed with bubbles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>; while the stem, forming many knots, and the radicles emitting innumerable rootlets, continually augment in size. Where the vegetation has been very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a>, the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> contents of the seminal tunics are by this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> exhausted, and, when compressed, they yield only a watery fluid.\n\n227. After the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAPSE\">lapse</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>, when the parts, already developed, are still farther advanced, new buds <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> out from the primary seat of growth and rise upward; and new radicles push forth and descend. So readily are these radicles produced, that sometimes, if the primary ones be removed, others in crowds spring forth; at the same time, new buds or shoots, protected in their proper sheaths, arise from the same part, and, surrounding the primary plantule, are borne upward with it. Of these appearances accurate delineations are given, and they may be observed in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a> of growing wheat.\n\n228. The foregoing descriptions of Malpighi are, in general, very correct, and his figures, though somewhat rude, exhibit, as usual, faithful delineations of the objects they are destined to represent. In one or two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>, however, he has fallen into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>, which, in the above statement of his opinions, to avoid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a>, we corrected as we went along. Thus, though he distinctly points out the \"conglobate farinaceous leaf,\" as the organ by which nutrient is administered to the radicle and plume; he assigns to the sac that, in an early state, envelopes the radicles, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a> of placenta; and even gives to the exterior tunic of the seed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of seminal leaf. The true cotyledon, however (which never in this seed is produced into a seminal leaf), is the little conglobate body above mentioned; and the common tunics of the seed have no title to the appellation of seminal leaves. To this cotyledon, Gaertner, of Gartner, from its shield-like form, gave, as before observed, the name of scutellum. He held it to be characteristic of the graminaceae, and analogous to the organ to which, in some other seeds, he gave the name of vitellus. (De Fructibus Plantarum. Vol. I. p. 139.) But most later writers, as Jussieu, Smith, Brown, and Poiteau, have all restored to it its proper office of cotyledon.\n\n229. M. Poiteau has gone even farther, and asserted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> cotyledon in this seed, and in the oat, which he describes as situated directly opposite to the former. (An. du Mus. d'Histoire Nat. Tom. XIII. p. 388.) In this instance, however, he has mistaken the rudiment of the second bud for a second cotyledon, as Dr Yule ascertained by tracing the growth of this supposed cotyledon from its first becoming visible, to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> development as a plant.\" (Werner. Transac. Vol. I. p. 594.) M. Mirbel considers the sac that invests the plantule of Mirbel to be the cotyledon of this seed; and this cotyledon to form the first ensheathing leaf. (An. du Mus. d'Histoire Nat. Tom. XIII. p. 148.) But, as already remarked, the cotyledon never, in this seed, rises out of the tunics; and, as Dr Yule observes, differs totally in situation, structure, and consistence, from the ensheathing leaf of the plantule.\n\n230. A very remarkable peculiarity in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> of plants is their great productive power, as displayed in the indefinite number of new plants which we have seen to be evolved from one primary seed. Malpighi not only observed this peculiarity, but has described the structure from which it originates. He considered the radicle and plume of the embryo to be connected with the cotyledon, not by the mammary vessels, as we have stated, but by a little body which he called the umbilical node. In a section of the lower part of the stem of the plantule, made after the third day of germination, he delineates this node as situated at the junction of the radicle and plume, as represented by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> f', fig. 46. Plate XV.; and describes it as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> externally, and softer and more medullary within. If a section of the same part be made on the fourth day, as in fig. 47, the stem (g') Malpighi of the plantule will be seen, says he, to spring from this node, from which also the radicles equally take their origin.\n\n231. This peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> in the Gramineae, was of Leuwenhoek also observed by Leuwenhoek, though he seems not clearly to have apprehended the nature of the organs from which it proceeded. In the embryo of wheat he describes three points, from which not only\nOf the Seed three distinct radicles spring; but they are also, he adds, \"the beginnings of three several spires or stalks of wheat; so that from every grain of wheat (which is well worthy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>), there will arise not merely a single stalk, but three distinct ones, which are formed in the seed itself.\" Select Works by Hoole, Vol. I. p. 169; and in Vol. II. p. 289, are to be found similar observations on the seeds of Oats, Barley, and Rye.\n\n232. By M. Mirbel, the umbilical node of Malpighi is considered as a fleshy knot (un n\u0153ud charnu), by the medium of which the plumule and radicle are united. The lateral radicles, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> from it, he regards as distinct in their nature from the primary one, and as resembling those which spring from knots in the stem; he therefore names them articulare roots, les racines articulaires. (An. du Mus. d'Hist. Nat. Tom. XIII. p. 149.) According to Dr Yule, however, this fleshy knot is to be considered as a tuber, analogous to the tuberous substance, interposed between the bulbs and roots of the Liliaceae and other monocotyledonous tribes; and which is destined to produce an indefinite number of young plants, a greater or less number of which are subsequently evolved by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> agency of the roots and leaves. The \"articulate roots\" of M. Mirbel he regards as in reality young plants, the roots of the Gramineae being invariably fibrous. It is by means of these lateral shoots and their tubera, that bushes, consisting of from sixty to several hundred stems, are sometimes seen to originate from one seed.\n\n233. The above important peculiarities in the germination of the seeds of the Gramineae, are very conspicuously displayed by Dr Yule in the three figures which we have copied from his Memoir. In fig. 48. Plate XV. Dr Yule represents the embryo of wheat as it appears when detached from the albumen, a short time after germination has commenced; the ascent of the plume covered with its membrane, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> of the three primary radicles, which have pierced their containing sac, are clearly exhibited, and the letter h' points to the little cotyledon, placed at the junction of the two parts just mentioned. In fig. 49. the germination of the same seed is shown in a more advanced stage; the plume (r') has now risen to a considerable height, and pierced the investing membrane; and at k' a second bud or plume (which M. Poiteau mistook for a second cotyledon), is seen to shoot from the tuber like the first: the letter t denotes the seminal tunics. At a still more advanced period, four young plants, m' m' m' m', fig. 50. of the second month, with their sheaths in part withered, are seen to have sprung from the same part; but the two seminal tunics of the seed, exhausted of their contents, still remain attached, as indicated by the letter n'. (Wernerian Trans. Vol. I. p. 589.)\n\n234. The description given above of the evolution of wheat is applicable, with little variation, to the seeds of all the cerealia. The seed of the Oat emits from four to six radicles, all of which break through their enveloping sac at the same place, and thus appear to be contained in one sheath; such too is the case with Barley, the plume of which extends beneath the seminal tunics, and pushes out at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERTEX\">vertex</a> of the seed.\n\n235. This peculiar constitution of the seeds of the Gramineae, is attended with important advantages in their culture, and explains the source of their great productive power. A single grain of Barley was observed by Du Hamel to have produced 200 ears, each of which yielded 24 grains; so that one single seed planted in a good soil, has produced 4800 grains. Curtis and others, by transplantation of the several plantules of Wheat, obtained still higher returns from single seeds. For the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a>, these plants are better enabled than others to resist the injurious effects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCIDENT\">accident</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>. If a seed, says Dr Yule, be buried under a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> or lump of indurated clay, the seminal plantules cannot shoot upward; but stems are then sent off in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>, until they can effect their escape upward. Sometimes it happens, that a small insect (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSCA\">Musca</a> pumilionis) deposits its egg in Wheat, and the grub is lodged in the very centre of the stem, just above the root, by which the stem is invariably destroyed, and the root so materially injured, as to prevent its throwing out fresh shoots on each side, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STOCKING\">stocking</a> itself, as the farmers term it. Nevertheless, the plants thus attacked are not permanently injured; for, in the instance where these depredations occurred, the crop of Wheat was good, and the ears large and fine through the whole field; so that these injured plants, by the production of lateral shoots, yielded an abundant crop. (Lin. Trans. Vol. II. p. 76.)\n\n236. In the germination of other monocotyledonous seeds, a similar succession of phenomena present themselves, with the exception of those which relate to the multiplication of so many individuals from a single seed, and which seem to be peculiar to the Gramineae. In all, the radicle first shoots forth, and the plume soon follows; the cotyledon is commonly of small size, and is retained within the tunics. As the embryo grows, the albumen is taken up and conveyed through the cotyledon to the young plantule; and, before the albumen is exhausted, the embryo is enabled to draw its nutriment from the soil in which it grows.\n\n237. In many instances, it appears, that the primary radicle of these seeds, after a short time, becomes dry, and falls off, and is replaced by a great number of secondary rootlets. M. Poiteau regards this last circumstance as common and peculiar to monocotyledonous seeds. He has remarked it in many hundred palms, not one of which had a descending or tap-root. No plant in the numerous family of the Liliaceae is said to possess such a root. The radicle of the Cyperaceae does not, perhaps, perish so soon, but it does not continue long. This premature and constant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a> of the radicle he considers as the cause of the bulbs and truncations which occur, particularly in the Liliaceae; for the lateral roots not being capable of receiving all the descending <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAP\">sap</a>, it collects at the lower part of the stem, and occasions these different enlargements. (An. du Mus. d'Hist. Nat. Tom. XIII. p. 392.)\n\n238. The effects which thus succeed to the spon-\n\nVEGETABLE.\n\nOf the Seed. Taneous destruction of the radicle, occur partly in other plants, in which the first radicle is naturally permanent, if it be artificially removed. Du Hamel found, that, if the extremity of permanent radicles were cut off; lateral rootlets were produced; that even mechanical obstruction to the descent of the radicle frequently gave rise to divisions in it, and the production of these lateral rootlets. He ascertained, also, by experiment, that roots extend invariably, not by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELONGATION\">elongation</a> of parts already formed, but by new matter added to their extremities; and hence it is, that roots, whether ligneous or herbaceous, do not elongate, if even the smallest portion of their extremity be cut off. (Phys. des Arbres, Tom. I. p. 83.) The results of observations on the growth of Carrots, in different soils, by Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KNIGHT\">Knight</a>, correspond with those of M. Du Hamel.\n\nVEGETABLE.\n\nOf the Seed, I. tution, are subject to the greatest variation, not only as relates to the species of seed, but to the soil, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, and season in which it is destined to grow.\n\nInternal Structure of the Pea: Having thus surveyed the changes in external form, which the germinating seed exhibits, we shall conclude our description by a display of the peculiarities of its internal structure. This we shall find to consist entirely of vessels and cellular tissue, variously proportioned and combined. In a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONGITUDINAL\">longitudinal</a> section of the radicle of the Pea, in an early stage, Malpighi represents it, as in fig. 12, to be composed entirely of cellular tissue exteriorly, in the centre of which the vascular system, separating at the top into three divisions, to supply the plume and cotyledons, is placed. A similar section of the radicle (fig. 13), on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEVENTH\">seventh</a> day, exhibits corresponding sections of the rootlets it puts forth, which are seen also to consist of cellular tissue, and of vessels that come off from the central fasciculus of the radicle.\n\n255. The stem, when about a month old, is composed of a thick bark formed of cellular tissue, within which are two rings of vessels, as seen in the transverse section, fig. 14. The inner <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol18.html#article-RING\">ring</a> (v) is said to consist of sap and spiral vessels; and exterior to this, a zone of vessels (w), yielding a peculiar juice, is said to be placed. In some very thin slices of the stem of the pea, viewed through a microscope of considerable power, the arrangement and distribution of the vessels and cellular tissue appeared to us as represented in fig. 20. The centre of the stem was occupied by cellular tissue, round which was a zone of vessels (v), forming four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> fasciculi. Exterior to this zone was a small ring of thickened cellular tissue, and beyond this, the proper cellular substance of the bark. Near the circumference of the stem were four larger fasciculi, which may probably be considered as the \"proper vessels,\" while those near the centre may be deemed the sap-vessels.\n\n256. In the plantule of the Gourd, a similar structure is observable. Fig. 15, exhibits a longitudinal section of the plume and radicle of that seed, considerably magnified, as they appear before germination, and shows the position of the vessels x, as they pass up towards the plume y. In the next figure (16.), a similar section of a radicle, on the second day of germination, is shown, in which the vessels that form the rootlets are seen to originate from the fasciculi that exist in the radicle. In figure 17, is represented a longitudinal section of the stem and radicle of the same plantule on the ninth day. In the stem, the vessels are disposed in a circle that surrounds the pith; but as they descend towards the root, they approach each other, and give off ramifications to form the rootlets. In a transverse section of the stem, on the 21st day, Malpighi describes it as hollow in the centre, fig. 18, around which six fasciculi of vessels are disposed, and the intermediate portion is occupied by cellular tissue. Hedwig, however, and Kieser, enumerate not fewer than ten fasciculi of vessels in the stem of this plant, some of which are placed next the pith, and others near to the bark.\n\n257. To these representations of the structure of the Pea and Gourd by Malpighi, we shall add that of the Bean, in its early stages, as delineated by Grew, who has traced the distribution of the vessels in the radicle and cotyledons with great minuteness. In fig. 19, is exhibited a vertical section of a young Bean, which is made to pass through the cotyledons, the plume, and radicle. From the extremity of the radicle, the vessels ascend in fasciculi to the neck of the plantule, where they are seen to diverge towards each cotyledon, and ramify through it, while a central vascular portion is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to the plume. In fig. 21, the vascular and cellular structure of the germinating Bean, at an early period, are shown in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONJUNCTION\">conjunction</a>, in a highly magnified representation, presented here in a reduced size from Grew. In this figure, a' denotes the cotyledon; b' the enveloping tunics; c' the cellular tissue; d' the vascular system continued from the fasciculus e' in the radicle, and ramified through the substance of the cotyledon; the letter f' points to the plume, which also receives vessels from those of the radicle; and g' indicates a depression in the cotyledon, in which, antecedent to germination, the plume was partly lodged; a similar depression existed in the other corresponding cotyledon.\n\nCHAP. II.\n\nVEGETABLE.\n\nOf Roots. to M. Decandolle, are so organized as to fix themselves on any other plant, and derive nourishment from it. (Th\u00e9orie \u00c9l\u00e9ment. de la Bot. p. 344.) For descriptions of the several varieties of these organs enumerated by botanists, and for the terms employed to express them, we must refer to their works.\n\nVEGETABLE.\n\nOf Roots of Asparagus, copied from Grew, but on too small a scale to show more than the relative position of the parts; the letter r denotes the bark, at the inner margin of which the proper vessels are placed in a ring; s', the sap-vessels or woody part placed more interiorly; and t', the pith at the centre. A very highly magnified representation of this root is given by Grew in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> 10. of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>. If his view of its structure be correct, it exhibits a remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> in the arrangement of parts in the stem and root; for the stem of Asparagus is one of those in which neither distinct bark, nor wood, nor pith, exists; but the cortical and ligneous textures are blended together.\n\n317. In the root of Mallow, the position of the vessels is quite different, as exhibited in fig 14., in which the letter v denotes clusters of proper vessels, postured in a radiated form in the cellular tissue of the bark; within these rays is a portion of cellular tissue, through which a few sap-vessels are dispersed; but they are chiefly accumulated at the centre (w) of the stem. In several of Grew's tables, transverse sections of various other herbs are given, which display the greatest possible variety, in the proportion and arrangement of the vascular systems of the bark and wood; to them we must refer the reader who may desire farther <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a>.\n\n318. In shrubs, the arrangement of the parts of the root is commonly more distinct than in herbs, and corresponds with that in the trunk. In the transverse section of the root of the Vine, fig. 15. the letter x' denotes the place of the \"proper vessels,\" situated in the cellular tissue of the bark; y', the sap-vessels extending in radii to the centre of the root, which is altogether destitute of pith; and z' marks the transverse septa which are interposed between the rays of vessels. Of this figure a very highly magnified view is also given by Grew in table 17. of his work. In table 16. the same author represents the structure of the root of Wormwood. His delineation of it is copied in Plate CCCCXX. (Article Plant) in the body of this work, to which we refer the reader. The disposition of the parts resembles almost exactly that of the Vine, except that the \"proper,\" or \"balsam vessels,\" as he calls them, are placed at greater distances from each other; and, from containing a viscid fluid, are enlarged, and rendered more distinct.\n\n319. We before noticed the manner in which the rootlets were given off from the radicle in the Pea and the Gourd. All parts of the root possess the power of emitting rootlets when they are placed in favourable circumstances; and this power is possessed also by the branch. If the branch of many trees be cut off and planted in the earth, it emits rootlets from its sides beneath the soil, and becomes at length an entire plant, possessing the several members of root, trunk, and branches. If even the bark of a branch be partially removed, so as to intercept the course of the descending sap, and the detached part be, at the same time, surrounded with moist earth in the manner of a graft, the upper portion of the divided bark will emit rootlets into the earth; and if, after a certain period, the branch be separated and planted, it will form a tree, sooner, it is said, than by most other methods. The simple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMMERSION\">immersion</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> of some trees in water, as of the Willow, is sufficient to elicit the production of rootlets. The origin of these has been traced by Malpighi in the Will. (Anat. Plantaar. p. 146.), and is exhibited in fig. 16. low.\n\nPlate XVII.; in which is represented a longitudinal section of the cutting of the willow, and of the rootlets it emits from its sides. These rootlets spring from the cutting, just at the surface of the water, not below it. They appear, at first, like small tumours in the bark, which protrude and gradually force their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> through it, forming fissures, which are, as it were, bordered by a lip, and afford passage to the springing rootlets. In the figure just referred to, a denotes the outer portion of the bark that forms the lip; b, the inner portion which protects the springing rootlet; ccc, three rootlets which are seen to originate from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> vessels of the wood.\n\n320. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CAPILLARY\">capillary</a> rootlets which thus spring from the larger roots, and from branches, are much more rootlets, simple in structure than buds, being made up chiefly of the ligneous texture of the trunk, which, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHOOTING\">shooting</a>, carries with it a portion of the cortical texture that covers it. They are the organs which absorb nutriment from the earth, and convey it into the larger rootlets, by which it is transmitted to the trunk. Hence, as Du Hamel observed, the earth is exhausted of its nutrient matter, chiefly where these capillary rootlets are distributed, and not in the neighbourhood of the larger roots. On examining the roots of trees, after a severe winter, he found these capillary rootlets to be generally dead, which led him to suspect that trees lose, in the earth, their annual rootlets; as, in the air, they lose their leaves. He found, that, even after slight frosts, during every period of winter, many of these capillary rootlets were destroyed; and that, when the temperature became milder, new rootlets were developed, which abundantly replaced the others. (Phys. des Arbres, Tom. I. p. 88, 89.)\n\n321. Analogous to the production of rootlets from the branches, when the descending sap is intercepted, is that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMANATION\">emanation</a> of similar organs from the knots in the stems of many plants, as those of the Gramineae. Wherever a knot of this description is brought into contact with the moist earth, numerous rootlets break out, and buds also, from which entire plants are produced. In the culture of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SUGAR\">Sugar</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CANE\">cane</a>, the propagation of the plant is continued entirely in this way, and never by means of seed; in the several modes of engrafting, and various other horticultural operations, the cultivation of vegetables proceeds on a similar principle; for the graft, which is attached to and becomes rooted in another tree, may, by a different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a>, be made, like the cuttings of willow, to furnish roots from its own substance.\n\n322. In some plants, as filipendula, the roots and Tubers rootlets swell out into globular bodies, or tubers of the shape of olives: these tubers are composed of vessels with a large portion of cellular tissue, and from them other rootlets spring. In other instances, the tuber that forms on the root is a true bud, which acquires a large size, and from it the real rootlets,\npossessing a filiform figure, also spring. (Malpighi, Anat. Plantar. p. 150.) The bulbs attached to the roots of many plants are likewise to be regarded as real buds, and will be briefly noticed in the next section.\n\n323. M. Du Hamel has made many observations and experiments on the effects of the soil in determining the form of the root. All roots that spring from seeds have, according to him, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPINDLE\">spindle</a> shape, if they are made to grow in soil that is easily penetrable. He has seen the root of a young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OAK\">Oak</a> extend in such a soil to the depth of four feet in the form of a tap-root, when the stem possessed only six inches in height. If, however, at a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> from the surface, it meet with obstacles, which oppose its descent, it then continues short, and divides into lateral branches. A similar production of lateral branches is observed, if, by any accident, the leading trunks of the root be destroyed.\n\nIf, on the contrary, a trench be dug in the neighbourhood of a root, and then filled up with fresh earth, the root will extend through the soft earth, without producing lateral branches; and the same often is observed to occur in very moist situations. The direction of roots is also greatly varied by the qualities of the soil, for they extend into that which is richest, while the barren parts are nearly destitute of roots. (Phys. des Arbres, Tom. I. p. 82.) So great, indeed, appears to be the influence which the qualities and texture of the soil exert on the growth of roots, that in many instances, before we could pronounce on the true form of a root, it would be necessary to define the kind and condition of soil that is most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> to it.\n\nCHAP. III.\n\nVEGETABLE.\n\nOf Buds. ter, made in the month of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEPTEMBER\">September</a>. It displays the tunicated structure of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BULB\">bulb</a>, at the base and in the centre of which, the young flower, destined to appear in the following spring, is observed. See his Anatomy of Plants, tab. 63., or Plate CCCXXI. fig. 17., in the body of this work, accompanying the article PLANT. Of the tunicated variety, the common onion affords also a good example. The coats that compose its bulb, are to be regarded as fleshy leaves, and the true root, according to Du Hamel, is the fleshy plate that supports the bulb, from which the rootlets spring. The common potatoe affords an example of the solid bulb, on whose surface numerous buds, all capable of producing entire plants, are seen. Botanists enumerate a great many other varieties of bulbs, for which we must refer to their writings; and to the works of Malpighi and Du Hamel for the anatomy of many of them.\n\n333. The true bud of the stem and branch was distinguished by the ancients into two kinds, according as it produced either a leaf or a flower, and to it they assigned different names. \"Germen autem est id quod ex ipsis arborum succulis primo vere exit, ex quo deinde folium producitur,\" says Pliny: and this he distinguishes from the flower-bud, \"nam gemma proprie floris est.\" By Grew, the term germin, and by Malpighi, the word gemma, is employed to denote each variety of bud. By Linn\u00e6us, the term germin is used to denote, not the bud of a branch, but the rudiment of a seed; and not the rudiment of the seed only, but the organ also that contains it. The word gemma he uses to denote a bud. Gaertner adopts the word germin in a generic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, to express every species of bud, and with Malpighi and Linn\u00e6us, employs the term gemma as indicative of that species now under consideration. This, therefore, as the most generally received appellation, we shall in future employ.\n\n334. During <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, says Du Hamel, buds are gradually formed in the axils of the leaves, viz. in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> which the petiole forms with the branch. They are at first exceedingly minute; are seen in winter chiefly on the young branches, sometimes on the larger ones; and more rarely on the trunk. They exhibit different forms, according to the kind of tree that bears them, and are attached to it by a very short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEDICLE\">pedicle</a>. Their position on the branch was considered by M. Bonnet to be reducible to five classes; sometimes they are situated on opposite sides of the branch, but placed alternately, and sometimes they are placed exactly opposite to each other. In other instances, they form a kind of ring round the branch. Sometimes they have a spiral disposition; and at others constitute a sort of double spiral around the branch. In those cases, where the buds stand opposite on the branch, the extremity of the branch is frequently terminated by three buds; but where the buds are only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a>, the young branch is commonly terminated by a single bud. In the Pine, the true buds are placed, not in the axils of the leaves, but at the extremity of the branch alone. Some buds stand out a considerable distance from the branch; others are placed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> contact with it; and these varieties occur sometimes on the same branch in regard to the buds that issue from its sides and extremity. The shape of buds is also very various\u2014some being long and pointed, others short and round; some again are hairy, others smooth; some very small, and others large. (Phys. des Arbres, Tom. I. p. 99.)\n\n335. Beside these varieties in position and form, Leaf and which serve to distinguish the buds of different genera and species, there are also many sorts of buds to be observed on the same tree, whose characters are discoverable by their form. Those which are pointed, usually produce leaves and branches; and from those which are large and rounder, commonly proceed flowers. The former are named leaf or wood buds (gemmae foliiferae); the latter flower or fruit buds (gemmae floriferae); others, which possess both leaves and flowers, have been called mixed buds (gemmae mixtae.) In some trees, as those of Apple and Pear, two varieties of wood-buds occur, one of which is small, produces only a small bunch of leaves, and in the end becomes a fruit-bud; the other is larger, and gives origin to a branch.\n\n336. As the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> of the flower appear in the formation of roots, the season before they are destined to bloom, so those of the leaf and the flower are distinguishable, at the same period, in the bud of the branch. They are to be perceived, says Du Hamel, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUTUMN\">autumn</a>, and continue to grow even during winter, appearing to be clandestinely formed in that season, when the movements of the sap seem to be suspended; and are thus prepared to shoot forth on the return of spring. It is, however, only in perennial plants that these phenomena are observed. Annual plants do not produce buds, and even those whose roots survive the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> of the stem, produce buds only on their roots. (Phys. des Arbres, Tom I. p. 103.)\n\n337. Climate appears to exert the greatest influence on the formation and evolution of buds. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> regions, as we have just observed, the bud is formed many months before it is destined to shoot into a leaf or branch; but in warmer regions, scarcely any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> occurs between the periods of formation and evolution. The buds in such climates, are said to unfold themselves immediately from the bark into branches, without having remained, in the form of buds, for any length of time. Sometimes, in the milder seasons of our own climate, the evolution of buds rapidly succeeds to their formation, and the vegetative <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> with us, emulates the productive powers of more favoured climes. In some examples, however, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIFIC\">specific</a> characters of particular plants overcome these general tendencies of climate; and thus hot climates are said to possess some bud-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> plants, and in colder climates, there are a few shrubs which are said never to bud. (Willdenow's Princip. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTANY\">Botany</a>, p. 273.) It seems, however, more correct, to consider all plants as bearing buds, from which the branches, the leaves, and the flowers, successively proceed; and to say that in warm climates in general, no suspension of the vegetative process occurs as in cold ones; and no marked interval is observed therefore between the formation and evolution of buds. The few exceptions that occur respectively in warm and cold climates, must be considered in reference to the specific characters of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a> plants. The process by which buds are\nactually formed, has been called Gemmation or Gem-\n\nmification.\n\n338. Having made these few general remarks on the nature and formation of buds, we have next to exhibit a few examples of their structure and evolution, confining ourselves at present to a description of those which produce either branches or leaves. The mature bud consists of two parts\u2014one that forms the new branch or leaf, and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of botanists may be termed persistent\u2014the other serving only a temporary purpose, and falling when that purpose is accomplished. To the former may properly be applied the term germ or gem, and the latter, from its office, may be called hybernaculum. In its leading characters, the bud bears a near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> to the more perfect seed; for the germ very exactly resembles the plume; and the hybernaculum, as we shall see, in structure, office, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>, approaches near to certain cotyledons.\n\n339. The leaves or scales which constitute the hybernaculum, and which, in future, we shall denominate the hybernacular leaves, vary much in number, size, and figure, in different buds. Even in the same bud, the inner ones are thinner, and much more tender and succulent than the outer, and are besmeared with a viscid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a> which intimately unites them; while the outer ones are commonly hard, hairy, and of a scaly texture. Like the cotyledonous leaves of seeds, those of the hybernacle sometimes grow for a certain time with the germ, and fall successively, at periods more or less distant; they are also not less distinct in figure from those of the germ, than the leaves of the cotyledon are from those of the plume. This arises from the peculiarity in the distribution of their vessels, which do not spring from one common central trunk, as in ordinary leaves, but are derived from several distinct fasciculi at the base, like those of the cotyledonous leaf, as seen in that of the Gourd, Plate XVI. fig. 11. According to the manner in which they are disposed or folded up in the bud, botanists have assigned them different names, for an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of which we must refer to their writings. In the opinion of Du Hamel, they all derive their origin from the inner layer of the bark, of which they seem to be only a prolongation. (Phys. des Arb. Tom. I. p. 103.)\n\n340. The germ of the bud, which is contained within and protected by these enveloping leaves, is composed of one or more leaves generally folded and curled; but in some instances open and expanded. At first they are very small, and their form is indistinct, so that the pedicle alone is distinctly visible, from which branch off the vessels that form the middle rib, and are afterwards expanded to construct the lobes of the leaf. From the figure, which the germ possesses before its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPANSION\">expansion</a>, being like that of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KEEL\">keel</a>, its vascular portion, at this period, has been named carina, and its softer part medulla or pith.\n\n341. With respect to the particular portion of the branch, from which the germ internally derives its origin, opinions have much varied. Some have held that it proceeded from the pith alone; others from the first circle of vessels that immediately surrounds the pith; others from the tender wood alone; and others from the pith, the wood, and the bark conjointly. Grew held this latter opinion. (Anat. of Plants, p. 28.) Malpighi describes the germ as a tender ligneous substance, formed of vessels and cellular tissue, and surrounded by its proper cortical texture. (Anat. Plantar. p. 45.) According to Du Hamel, it originates from the ligneous texture and the pith (Phys. des Arbres, Tom. I. p. 103.); and Hill considered it to spring from the first circle of vessels alone, but not to carry with it any portion of the pith.\n\n342. As every germ is composed of the cortical and ligneous textures, it may be said to originate in part from both, as all these writers seem to admit. Sometimes also the pith of the germ is continuous with that of the branch; but, in other instances, no such connection subsists, and there is nothing in the character of the pith of the trunk that renders it at all essential to the constitution of the germ. That, in many instances also, the germ springs from the first circle of vessels, is most certain; but it is not less certain that buds spring from trees long after this first circle of vessels has lost its vegetative power, or has been entirely destroyed. The view already given of the origin of rootlets from a branch, fig. 16. Plate XVII. seems very nearly to represent that of a bud, the latter possessing only a larger portion of cellular tissue in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of its bark and pith.\n\n343. In the oak, Malpighi describes the entire bud as consisting of many scales enveloping each other, Oak. and forming an oval body. When evolution commences, these open and expand, and in part fall; but two generally remain and protect the springing germ for a long time. In fig. 17. Plate XVII. is represented one of the hybernacular leaves (d) of the Oak-bud, at the base of which the germ (e) is placed. The leaf (d) is described as possessing an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a> form, and is very evidently vascular; the germ is exceedingly small, and is represented as possessing at this period only one fasciculus of vessels. By degrees, three fasciculi become apparent, which are continued through the germ, and form three pointed extremities, as in fig. 18. A. These parts augment, and the vascular fasciculi separate, so as to produce successively the appearance in fig. 18. B. and in fig. 19. (f.) At length, the small curled leaf (i) rising between the two hybernacular leaves hh, fig. 20. is seen to resemble the plume of the seed, and to possess a form altogether different from the enveloping leaves, which, in appearance, resemble more the cotyledonous leaves of certain seeds. In fig. 21. is given a vertical section of the germ considerably magnified, in which k denotes the pith that occupies the centre of its pedicle; it is enclosed by vascular fasciculi (l) that send off through the bark (m) ramifications to the several little processes that compose the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERRATED\">serrated</a> border of the leaf. (Anat. Plantar. p. 41. 45.)\n\n344. But the method of nature, in the evolution of buds, continues Malpighi, is not always the same; for the hybernacular leaves do not always waste and fall as those of the germ increase. On the contrary, in many trees, these leaves, especially those about the base of the bud, losing their primary figure,\n\nVEGETABLE.\n\nExamples of this sort occur in Laurel, in the Apple, the Almond-tree, and many others. In other instances, as in the Rose, the permanent leaves seem to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> out of those of the hybernaculum, from the apex of which they emerge; and gradually the latter is changed into a sort of petiole, to the sides of which two slender appendages, the remains of the former hybernacular leaf, adhere. (Ibid. p. 41.) Similar transformations are said to occur in many other plants.\n\n345. The buds, such as they have been described, pullulate variously from the sides of stems and branches, and always above the insertion of the fallen leaves; but they spring also from their extremities, and produce the annual elongation of the branch or stem. The manner in which this takes place, and the appearance which the parts exhibit, have been well illustrated by the observations and dissections of M. Du Hamel. In the evolution of the seed, the plume, as we have seen, rises above the earth, and produces the stem which puts forth leaves. When these leaves fall in autumn, the stem continues, and is terminated by one or more buds. The roots, as already remarked (238.), do not increase in length, but at their extremity, and therefore never elongate, after the smallest portion of their extremity has been cut off. It is not the same with branches; for the newly formed part of the young shoot actually elongates, especially at its extremity, where it is most succulent and tender; less in the parts lower down where it is harder; and in its more ligneous parts not at all\u2014as Du Hamel, by very simple and decisive experiments, ascertained. (Phys. des Arbres, Tom. II. p. 14.)\n\n346. The appearance, structure, and evolution of a bud, at the extremity of a branch of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HORSE\">Horse</a>-chesnut-tree, are given by the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> author, whose candour, ability, and success in the prosecution of these curious researches, render him worthy to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> by the side of Malpighi and Grew. In fig. 1. Plate XVIII. is represented part of the annual shoot of this tree, terminated by its appropriate bud, formed in autumn, and which is the commencement of the next year's shoot. In fig. 2. a vertical section of the same bud is exhibited, in which the number and disposition of the hybernacular leaves that envelope and protect the germ in the centre are displayed. In the stem of the shoot, the letter a denotes the pith, which is surrounded by the wood bb, and this again is covered by the bark cc. In fig. 3. is represented a section of part of the bud, detached from the woody part of the shoot, and a little magnified, to show that the leaves of the hybernaculum take their origin from the inner portion of the bark.\n\n347. Proceeding next to the interior part of the bud, Du Hamel represents it as composed of numerous small leaves (fig. 4.), which are more and more minute as we proceed inward, and are covered with fine hairs. In fig. 5. is a branch-bud of the Peach, as seen in February, after all the enveloping scales have been removed. It is composed of greenish filaments, ranged nearly as they appear in the figure.\n\nWhen some of these filaments were detached, and viewed with the microscope, they appeared toothed at the edges, as in fig. 6., and were covered with hairs. All these filaments were afterwards detached, in order to disclose a small body lodged within them, and which appeared to consist of two small leaflets, folded and toothed at their edges, but not covered with hairs. It is represented in fig. 7. It occupied the centre of the shoot, and seemed to be connected with the pith.\n\n348. In the next figure 8. is represented the bud of the Horse-chesnut, in the state of evolution. The letters dd indicate the scales of the hybernaculum thrust aside by the shooting of the germ e, accompanied by two permanent leaves ff. The letter g denotes the place of a second bud. A vertical section of the same bud is shown in fig. 9., from which all the scaly envelopes have been removed. It exhibits an entire shoot of one year's growth, attached to part of one of two years. From h to i denotes the growth of two years; and from i to k that of one year, with the germ k in the centre and the lateral leaves, as in the preceding figure. The letter l marks the pith, mm the wood, and nn the bark of the young branch. From l to n, the pith is white; from n to o, greenish; and towards i, it is of a brownish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> colour. From i to k, which marks the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of the annual shoot, the pith is green and succulent; and at pp, it is seen to be prolonged into the lateral branches. The wood of two years' growth, from m to i, is white, and forms a continuous tube round the pith, except where the branches go off. It is covered by another layer so thin as to be scarcely visible, but which will, in the end, become wood; and this layer is covered by the bark. The ligneous layer of the annual shoot appears to be a prolongation of the new layer of the older one, and, like it, possesses at first an herbaceous character. The cortical layer also seems to be a prolongation of that of the older shoot. As to the pith, though in both shoots it is continuous, it is to be observed, that that of the older branch is white and dry, and that of the young shoot green and succulent. (Phys. des Arbres, Tom. I. p. 117.)\n\n349. It is thus by the formation of a bud in autumn at the extremity of a branch, and the shooting of branches and growth of that bud in the succeeding spring and summer, that the trunk of the tree and its branches are annually elongated. During the first season, the shoot retains, in great part, its herbaceous characters; but, in the second, it becomes perfectly ligneous. In the axils of the permanent leaves of the young shoot, the rudiments of new buds become apparent, even in the first season.\n\n350. It was before remarked, that trees receive an additional circular layer every year, and that from these new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAYERS\">layers</a> buds successively spring, so that the earliest branches may contain as many ligneous layers as the trunk, and those of later formation a smaller number, according to the year in which they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a> forth, and the circle of wood from which they sprang. Combining this growth in breadth with that in length, it will appear, says Du Hamel, that at the base and centre of a tree 100 years old, there is wood of 100 years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>; whilst, at the exterior part of the same tree, and at the extremities of its branches,\nthere is wood of one year's age only. As the latitudinal growth was before illustrated by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIAGRAM\">diagram</a>, a similar mode may be adopted to explain the longitudinal increase.\n\n351. Let figure 10. Plate XVIII. represent in \\( q r \\) the ligneous portion of a tree that has proceeded from a seed in spring, and is observed in autumn. The following spring, a second shoot proceeds from the bud \\( r \\), which reaches as far as \\( s \\); but, at the same time, there is a second ligneous layer formed on the first shoot \\( q r \\), by which its thickness is proportionally augmented; and, at the end of the second year, the tree has the form and extent of the unshaded portion of the figure \\( q s \\). The next spring, the bud (\\( s \\)) opens and sends out another shoot to \\( t \\); and ligneous layers are added as before to the two preceding shoots; and thus the tree is extended from \\( q \\) to \\( t \\). The fourth year the same processes are repeated, and the tree extends from \\( q \\) to \\( w \\); and each annual shoot, from the base to the summit of the figure, is seen to be composed successively of four, three, two, and last of one layer in thickness. This figure, therefore, illustrates the mode in which trees increase at the same time in height and breadth. The ligneous layers may be compared to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of cones which envelope each other, and which annually augment the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a> of the tree by the two thicknesses of the layers. It shows also that trees grow much more in height than in breadth, and that this growth is effected by the successive formation and evolution of buds at the extremity of the stem, precisely as the first shoot issues from the seed. (Phys. des Arbres, Tom. II. p. 50.)\n\nSection II.\n\nOf the Structure of Leaves.\n\n352. These are organs of great importance in the vegetable economy; they are not, however, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a>, for the Cactus, some species of Schemus, and a few other plants, are considered to be destitute of leaves. Like other parts of the plant, they may be regarded with reference either to their external form, or their internal structure. The former view belongs more especially to the botanist, who has very happily applied his descriptive language to portray the almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFINITE\">infinite</a> diversity of figure, size, and character, which the leaves of different species of vegetables exhibit. On this branch of the subject we shall but lightly touch, recalling simply to notice the more leading distinctions of the botanist, and such only of them as may appear to be more immediately connected with the structure of these organs.\n\n353. The leaves (folia) are distinguished and denominated according as they are simple or compound. Simple leaves are such as have only a single leaf on the stalk or petiole that supports them, and where all the parts of the leaf are continuous with one another. Compound leaves are those which are made up of more than one piece, or where the leaf is formed of parts or leaflets articulated together. In regard to their place, situation, and insertion, leaves are said to be determinate. By the place of a leaf, is meant the part of the plant to which it is attached. By situation, is understood the disposition of the leaves on the stem or branch, which corresponds to that of the buds. By insertion, is expressed the mode of connection between the leaf and the stem or branch; and the direction of leaves is considered to bear reference to the position in which they stand to the stem.\n\n354. The foregoing observations apply to leaves considered in connection with other members; when we regard them singly, we remark several parts which are common to almost all leaves, and to which particular names have been assigned. The part at which the leaf springs from the branch or stem, whether directly or by means of a petiole, is called the base, and the point opposed to this, the apex of the leaf. Each leaf has also two sides, faces or surfaces, as they are indifferently called. The prominent lines that appear on these surfaces were named riblets (costulae) by Malpighi, and have very improperly been called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NERVES\">nerves</a> by most writers; for the term nerve denotes an organ of a totally different nature, of which not even the existence has yet been demonstrated in any part of the vegetable system. To the line that circumscribes and forms the boundary of the leaf, the term margin is commonly applied.\n\n355. The figure of leaves exhibits the greatest diversity, to express which various terms are employed; their margin also is either entire or variously fissured, notched, or toothed; their surfaces are naked and smooth, or clothed with hairs, and studded with excrescences; sometimes they are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> and flat, at others furrowed or plaited; and in all these particulars, the opposite surfaces present also the greatest diversity. In size, leaves exhibit the most remarkable differences; and, with respect to substance, some are exceedingly thin, and have a membranous texture, others very thick, and of a fleshy nature. As to colour, they exhibit every shade of green, from the most gay and lively, to the deepest and most obscure. In some, the tint of colour approaches to blue; in others to red; and previous to their fall, they all undergo those changes of colour which produce the diversified beauties of an autumnal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a>. The period, however, at which this occurs, is very different. Some leaves fall early, before the summer has passed, and are termed caducous; others retain their place till autumn, and then fall, and are named <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECIDUOUS\">deciduous</a>; others continue beyond the summer, and are styled persistent; and others, which have a still longer duration, are denominated perennial.\n\n356. In the preceding section on the structure of buds, we exhibited the form and appearance of leaves in the earlier periods of their existence. They were shown to possess a very minute size, and to be curiously folded up, and concealed within their various scales or coverings, which effectually protected them from the rigour of the winter season. The germ of the bud, from which the leaves originate, was stated to be composed of the same elementary parts as the stem and branch from which it sprang. From the ligneous ring in the annual shoot, it derived its vessels, which, after having traversed obliquely the cortical layers, were prolonged into the pedicle by which it remained attached to the branch. This pedicle\nOf Leaves was shown to consist of a pith, encircled by vessels, which branched off through the cortical texture, to form the keel of the germ in its folded state; and, in its more expanded forms, to constitute the vascular riblets of the leaf. By subsequent growth, this gradually extends and elongates, becomes more ligneous, and is formed, at length, into the slender stalk or petiole, by which the leaf remains attached to the branch. (Phys. des Arbres, Tom. I. p. 123.)\n\nStructure of the Petiole\n\n357. The vessels, which are given off from the branch to form the petiole, are not collected into one bundle, but constitute several fasciculi, which are disposed, in different ways, about the centre of the stalk. In some stalks there are three, in others five or six, and in others seven or more fasciculi, all placed, says Grew, either in an angular or circular posture, and at a greater or less distance from the centre. This centre is generally occupied by a pith, but sometimes it is hollow or tubular. In table 49. of the Anatomy of Plants, several transverse sections of the petioles of the leaves of different plants are given, exhibiting the different modes in which these fasciculi are dispersed through the cellular tissue that forms the greater portion of the stalk. In every instance, the pith and bark of these petioles are represented as forming one continuous substance. In some plants, the fasciculi of vessels that come off from the stem are not collected into a cylindrical figure, but, after being variously implicated with each other, expand at once into a leaf. Such leaves rise by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> base, and, from being destitute of a petiole, are termed sessile, forming often a sort of sheath about the stem, of which several varieties are enumerated by botanists.\n\n358. The petiole, as it springs from the branch, may be compared to a small stem, which, at the basis of the leaf, expands into numerous branches. Frequently, it is continued through the centre of the leaf, forming its middle rib, and giving off, in its course, numerous branches. At other times, on reaching the base of the leaf, it separates at once into three or more equal portions, which form as many distinct leaves or parts of a leaf, supported by their respective petioles. The structure of the petiole is the same as that of the branch, being composed of the ligneous and cortical textures, in which sap and proper vessels are discoverable, and the whole is invested by the cuticle.\n\n359. Where the petiole terminates, the proper or expanded portion of the leaf commences, the figure of which is determined by the number and distribution of the vessels. These vessels divide and ramify in various modes, till at their termination they form a finely reticulated structure. In many recent leaves this structure is very visible, but when the softer parts are removed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPONTANEOUS\">spontaneous</a> decomposition, the vascular system of the leaf remains nearly entire, and its extent and form are then more completely exposed. In fig. 11. Plate XVIII. this distribution of the vessels is exhibited in a leaf of Holly. From the central fasciculus, branches are everywhere given off, which farther subdivide, and form smaller ramifications, that terminate, at length, in a minutely reticulated structure. Around the margin of the leaf, the vessels are continued, and, at certain parts, are prolonged into the thorns that bound the circumference of this leaf.\n\n360. In this, and similar instances, the vessels appear to be ramified out of greater into less; but, as already observed (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SECT\">sect</a>. 9.), this does not appear to be really the fact, the vessels being all of the same size everywhere in the leaf, and all continued through it, like so many distinct tubes. This structure Grew represents in a highly magnified view of the leaf of Borage, in table 50. of his work; part of which is represented, on a reduced scale, in fig. 13. Plate XVIII., designed to show that the ramified vessels (o) are all clusters of tubes of the same size, which, though they separate continually, and come into contact, are never produced, or ramified one out of another. Neither do they ever inoculate or anastomose with each other, until, according to Grew, they come to their final distribution.\n\n361. The vessels thus distributed through the leaf belong chiefly to the order of spiral vessels, as was shown by Grew in the leaf of the Vine, and many others; and, from the observations of Malpighi, Darwin, and Knight, already related (sect. 57.), it appears, that \"proper vessels\" are everywhere associated with them. It would seem, from the observations of Darwin, that these two orders of vessels communicate in the leaf by continuation of canal, as the arteries and veins do in animal bodies. In the stalk he considered them to be disposed in two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCENTRIC\">concentric</a> rings, the inner one of which carried out the sap to the leaves, and by the outer one it was returned to the bark. (Phytologia, p. 43 and 58.) In branches of the Apple and Horse-chesnut, Mr Knight also observed coloured fluids to rise through the vascular fasciculi in the petiole of the leaf. These fasciculi were surrounded by others free from colour, and which conveyed a different fluid, and, on being traced down the stalk, were found to enter the inner bark, and to have no communication with those of the wood. The returning vessels he describes as being situated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to, and surrounding those which carry up the sap. (Phil. Trans. 1801, p. 336.)\n\n362. Beside the vascular system which thus, by its ramifications, forms the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SKELETON\">skeleton</a> of the leaf, there is another structure that requires to be noticed. We have seen that the vessels, in their ultimate distribution, form a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">net</a>-work, more or less fine and minute in different leaves; so that a great number of intervascular spaces are produced. These spaces, or areas, says Malpighi, are occupied by cellular tissue, which springs from the vessels themselves, and seems to depend from them, and by its means the thickness of the leaf is formed. In the recent part of the Borage-leaf, represented in fig. 13. Plate XVIII., this cellular structure, occupying the reticulated spaces formed by the vessels, is observed; but it is most clearly seen in thick leaves, when the cuticle has been removed, and the vessels in part dissected away. The cells or utricles which form this parenchyme, as it has been called, are of different figures, and are mutually contiguous; they are composed of a membrane formed into the shape of a little vesicle or bladder, from the middle of each of which, a little vascular production issues; they are all connect-\nOf Leaves, ed with each other, and with the vascular system of the leaf. In fig. 12. Plate XVIII. this cellular structure is represented in the leaf of Cactus by Malpighi, in which the oblong cells are described as proceeding from the central vessel, and mutually <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> with each other. (Anat. Plantar. p. 52.) A similar idea of the formation of the cells seems to have been entertained by De Saussure. In different leaves, the cells possess very different sizes and forms, and sometimes the sides of the greater ones are said to be made up of smaller. In the experiments of M. De La Baisse, they are said to have become tinged by coloured fluids conveyed from the vessels. Whether they communicate with each other is not known; but analogy, derived from other similar structures, would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> us to suppose that they communicate only with vessels, as seems to be the case in the cotyledous leaf of the seed.\n\n363. Beside this cellular tissue, which forms so large a portion of the leaf, certain small follicles are described by Malpighi as being connected with it. Between the vessels and the cells of the parenchyme, in most leaves, variously figured follicles of this kind are stated to exist, from which a peculiar halitus or humour is discharged; their external orifice is bounded by a rising lip, and is often furnished with hairs. They are rendered more apparent as the more succulent parts of the leaf waste; and, in different leaves, possess very different forms. (Anat. Plantar. p. 52.) They appear to be the glandular organs, described as pouring out peculiar fluids on the surface of many leaves.\n\n364. The whole structure of vessels and cells that constitute the leaf, is covered by a cuticle variously furnished with pores, hairs, and other appendages, as already described when treating of the cuticular texture.\n\n365. To this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of our subject belong the small leaves called bracteae, stipulae, &c. which serve often but a temporary purpose to the flowers and leaves; and though of some importance in the descriptive details of the botanist, are but of small consideration with the anatomist. Like the scales that envelope buds, they probably derive their origin chiefly from the cortical texture.\n\nSection III.\n\nOf the Structure of Flowers.\n\n366. The flower is understood to comprehend the organs by which fructification is accomplished, and those also which surround and protect them. These organs are the Calix, Corolla, Nectarium, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAMINA\">Stamina</a>, and Pistillum. The three first are not essential parts, but the two last are indispensable. All these parts are commonly borne on a stalk called the peduncle, which, expanding at its extremity, forms the receptacle, upon which all the other parts are supported. In fig. 1, Plate XIX., is the representation of a perfect flower, in which the principal parts above mentioned are exhibited. The letter a denotes the corolla, formed of six petals; b the stamens, c the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PISTIL\">pistil</a>, and d the peduncle of the flower. In the next figure (fig. 2.), the corolla has been removed, and the parts within it are then more clearly displayed. At the base of the flower, the calyx (e) is seen: the pistil is composed of three parts, the ovarium (f), the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a> (g), and the stigma (h); the stamens are each distinguished into the filament (i), and the anther (k).\n\n367. The flower, as well as the leaf, originates from a bud, and, in many respects, the buds of flowers resemble those of leaves; they are covered and protected in the same manner, but they are generally larger, and have a more rounded form. They consist of two parts, the gem or eye (oculus), as it is sometimes called, and the hybernaculum, or protecting envelopes. In some trees, they spring from the extremity of particular branches; in others, from the branches in common with the leaf-buds; in others, from the axils of the leaves; and in others, from the leaf itself\u2014but in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENUS\">genus</a>, the position of the flower-buds is uniform. In fig. 3. Plate XIX., is a portion of the branch of the Peach-tree, bearing two flower-buds (ll), between which the smaller and more pointed leaf-bud (m) is placed.\n\n368. Grew discovered, and has exhibited many examples of the complete formation of the flower buds for many months before it is destined to bloom. (Anat. of Plants, tab. 63, 64.) Of this fact also, Du Hamel has given several examples. In fig. 4. is a longitudinal section of the flower-bud of the Peach-tree, made in the month of February, to show the complete formation of the stamens and pistils within the surrounding envelopes of the bud. In fig. 5. is another representation of a similar bud, from which the enveloping scales have been removed; it displays the calyx, which, at this period, completely envelopes the other parts of the flower. When the leaflets of the calyx are separated, as is done in fig. 6. then the stamens and pistils are fully disclosed; the petals also of this flower were visible, but at this period were very small. Even the anthers were found to contain a fine dust, but no rudiment of the future embryo could be detected in the ovary. In the flower-bud of the Pear, examined in February, the parts of fructification were also visible, but indistinct; a month later, all the parts were more advanced, and the stamens, petals, and pistils were distinct; and towards the end of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-MARCH\">March</a>, even the rudiments of future seeds were visible in the base of the pistil. (Phys. des Arbres, Tom. I. p. 200.) Thus it appears, that, through the winter season, the several parts of the flower are clandestinely formed, though still extremely minute. As they enlarge, their position within the bud is very various in different species; they gradually expand, and form the perfect flower, whose several parts we have next briefly to describe.\n\n369. The greater number of flowers contain both stamens and pistils, and are then styled complete or perfect; but frequently it is otherwise, and such flowers are deemed incomplete or imperfect. In most instances also, there is only one set of organs of fructification on the same flower, when it is deemed simple\u2014in others, there are more than one, and it is named compound. Our limits will permit us to describe only one of these varieties, which we shall select from the division of complete simple flowers.\n\n370. The peduncle of the flower, by which all the other parts are connected with the stem or branch, the Peduncle is frequently single, but often divides into several ele.\n\nVEGETABLE.\n\nOf Flowers parts or pedicels, as they are named, each of which supports one or more flowers. The modes in which the flowers are disposed on the pedicels, have received different names from botanists, and to the general circumstance they assign the term inflorescence. The peduncle, in structure, resembles the stalk of the leaf; being formed, like it, of the several common textures. In size, in length, and other external characters, it exhibits all the varieties already noticed in the petiole of the leaf.\n\n371. At the extremity of the peduncle, is placed the flower-cup or calyx, which has very different forms, and has received, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, different names. Even in its most common forms, it exhibits great variety. It is sometimes composed of a single piece, and has a tubular form; in others, of many pieces, which vary in number, position, and size, and for an account of which, we must refer to the writers on botany. In some instances, this organ falls when the fruit has set; in others, it continues till the fruit is mature; and in others, the fruit is formed within it, to which it becomes a permanent covering, and exercises the office of pericarp. The colour of the calyx is commonly green, but sometimes partly red, or white, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a>. To some flowers it is entirely wanting. From the dissections of Grew and Malpighi, it appears to be constructed, like the leaves, of a cuticle, a pretty thick cellular tissue, and of vessels, all of which exist in the peduncle, and are derived from the common textures of the plant.\n\n372. Above the calyx, the corolla, the chief ornament of flowers, is borne. It is enclosed by the calyx, but surrounds the interior parts of the flower, and is commonly of some other colour than green. It consists of one piece, or of several; these pieces are called petals, and according to the number of these pieces, the corolla is variously denominated. The monopetalous corolla, or that composed of one piece, is also distinguished into several parts, expressive of form, position, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>; and in the polypetalous variety, which consists of several pieces, each petal has its claw (angulus) situated at the base, and by which it is attached to the calyx or receptacle, and its expanded part (lamina), which is of very various figure, size, and colour. At the base of the petal, a tuft of hairs is often observed, and their surface is frequently covered with a fine down, or sometimes with jointed hairs bearing globulets, as occurs on leaves. With regard to structure, Malpighi describes it as composed of the same textures as the common leaf, as is distinctly visible in the thicker varieties of it. Grew showed it to possess spiral vessels, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a>, as Du Hamel observes, that it is partly derived from the ligneous texture, since such vessels are not found in the bark. The odour these organs possess, leads to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a>, that they contain also a peculiar juice. (Phys. des Arbres, Tom. I. p. 215.)\n\n373. The organ next to be noticed, is that called the nectary (nectarium.) It was observed and described by Malpighi, as a small organ situate at the base of some flowers, to which, from its figure, he gave the name of concha. Linnaeus considered it to be the organ which bears the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a>, and as belonging to the flower only; but his descriptions of it are so exceedingly vague and inconsistent, that no attempt to define and exhibit its anatomical character can be made with any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">hope</a> of success.\n\n374. Having thus described the several parts that envelope the sexual organs, we must now briefly notice them; and first, the stamens.\u2014These, in different flowers, vary greatly in origin, size, number, figure, and mode of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a>; and upon these differences, chiefly, the Linnean classes are founded. In general, each stamen is said to consist of two parts\u2014the filament and the anther. The filaments exhibit various shapes, and are of very different size in different flowers; they are inserted occasionally into the corolla, the calyx, or even the pistil; but more commonly, like the calyx and corolla, are attached to the receptacle. Malpighi describes the filaments as originating from the ligneous texture, being formed of vessels and elongated cells. As they originate sometimes from petals, they must necessarily, he adds, be composed of the same parts (Anat. Plantar. p. 64.); and it is well known that, by culture alone, they are often reduced entirely to the condition of petals.\n\n375. The anther is a little case or sac, formed by a thin but vascular membrane, and borne on the summit of the filament. It is filled with innumerable small particles, of various colour, size, and figure, in different plants, to which the name of pollen has been given. In fig. 9, A., is exhibited one of the filaments, bearing its anther, as it appears when detached from the pistil of the flower of Mallow, fig. 8, in which the particles of pollen are seen; and in fig. 9, B., these particles are represented as viewed by a still higher <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNIFYING\">magnifying</a> power. The anther itself is of very various size, figure, and colour, in different flowers; and its mode of attachment to the filament is not less subject to variation.\n\n376. The pollen, contained in the anthers, is described by Grew as consisting of numerous regularly figured small particles, which, in different flowers, possess a very different figure, colour, and size. Many of their forms are delineated by Grew in table 58. of his work; and in fig. 10, Plate XVIII., several representations of these forms have been copied from Du Hamel. (Phys. des Arbres, Tom. I. lib. 3. Plate III.) The number of particles in each anther is very great, extending, it is said, from a few hundreds to several thousands. In some flowers, the pollen consists of transparent globules; in others, they are white, purple, blue, or brown, or more frequently yellow; their surface is either smooth or rough; they are regularly organized, and when examined under the microscope, may be seen to burst, and yield a fluid, in which, according to Du Hamel, small particles are seen to float. This fluid is represented as being sometimes thin, or viscid, or oily, and is said, by Hedwig, to be discharged at once on the bursting of the little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPSULE\">capsule</a> that contains it; while, according to K\u00f6clereuter, it is slowly transmitted through pores in the side, or hairs on the surface of the capsule. (Willdenow's Prin. of Botany, p. 310.)\n\n377. The parts of the flower, hitherto described, are constructed, says Malpighi, with reference to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> organ, in which the seed, the last result sought by nature, is curiously formed, and carefully guarded. This organ, called pistillum, consists of\nOf Flowers, three parts, as represented in the pistil of the Almond-flower, fig. 11., in which the letter p denotes the stigma, q the style, and r the ovary. To this latter organ Malpighi gave the name of uterus; Linnaeus of germen; but we prefer the appellation of ovarium, assigned it by Gartner. Like the stamen, the pistil exhibits great variety in form, size, number, and mode of attachment; upon which, and other peculiarities, many of the orders, in the Linnean system of classification, are founded.\n\nIts Ovary. 278. The ovarium, situate at the base of the pistil, differs greatly in size, shape, and structure, in different plants. It is the part in which the seed is formed, and, antecedent to fecundation, vesicles, which are the rudiments of future seeds, may frequently be detected in it. Its cavity consists often of but one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CELL\">cell</a> or loculum, in which one or more seeds are produced; sometimes it is formed into many loculae, with which only one style communicates; and sometimes the several loculae have communication with distinct styles. Its structure will be noticed in treating of the changes of form it undergoes in consequence of fecundation.\n\nStyle. 379. The style, which is seated on the ovarium, and is commonly so situate in the flower, as to be surrounded by the stamens, exhibits, like all the other parts, the greatest diversity in all its external characters. It is commonly a hollow tube, which communicates, as observed above, with the ovary. Most commonly there is but one style to one ovary, but frequently more than one. In some instances, the pistils correspond in number with the loculae, into which the ovary is divided; in other instances, every seed that is formed has its distinct pistil connected with it; while, in other examples, only one pistil is allotted to a great number of seeds. In some flowers, there is no proper style, but the stigma is placed directly on the ovary.\n\nStigma. 380. The stigma, which forms the summit of the pistil, presents also the greatest diversities of appearance. It sometimes terminates the style by an open mouth; sometimes it appears like a small bud; in other instances, it is variously divided or forked; sometimes it is smooth, and is sometimes covered with hairs. The number of parts into which it is divided, corresponds, in many flowers, with the number of loculae in the ovary, as in the Liliaceae, the Umbelliferae, and others. (Phys. des Arbres, Tom. I. p. 225.) At the period of fecundation, the stigma is rendered moist by a peculiar secreted fluid. Its structure resembles that of the other parts of the flower, being composed of all the common textures, and a peculiar secreting structure. Some have professed to have discovered hollow channels in the stigma, which are described as being continued through the style to the umbilical cord of the seed; but this must be regarded as doubtful.\n\n381. The foregoing descriptions apply, in detail, only to the more perfect flower, and that variety of it which is denominated simple. For an account of the numerous diversities of form, size, position, number, and attachment, exhibited in the sexual organs of the flowers of different classes and genera of plants, we must refer to the writers on botany; and to the works of Malpighi and Grew for the anatomy of many of them. We have room only farther to remark, that all the several parts of the flower seem very nearly to approximate in internal structure; for, under particular modes of cultivation, almost any individual organ may be made to lose its original character, and to assume that of any other.\n\nSection IV.\n\nOf the Structure of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">Fruits</a>, and Formation of Seeds.\n\n382. In the preceding section we described the structure of the flower, antecedent to fecundation; we have now to exhibit, as concisely as possible, the changes of form it undergoes after that event, and particularly as it regards the production of the seed.\n\n383. After fecundation has been effected, the calyx, corolla, stamens, and even style of the pistil, commonly fade and fall; the ovary alone remains, and undergoes very different changes of form in different plants. In the latter periods of its enlargement, it is usually called pericarp (pericarpium), a term which is understood by botanists to apply also in certain cases to the calyx, the corolla, or any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> of organs that serves as a support and defence to the seed. For an account of these varieties in the pericarp, and of the terms employed to express them, we must refer to the writers on botany, and more especially to the carpological labours of Gartner, who, in his learned and elaborate work, already so often referred to, has delineated the forms, and, to a certain extent, described the structure of the pericarps and seeds in more than 1000 genera of plants.\n\n384. In its early state, the ovarium is described by Gartner as possessing at first a simple cellular structure, which, at a later period, assumes the form of distinct cells or loculae. Within these loculae, minute globules or papillae are afterwards seen, which are the rudiments of future seeds. At this period, they are mere pulpy globules attached to their containing cells, but, in some instances, approach to the character of small vesicles. So far the rudiments of the ovulum, like the entire bud, are produced without fecundation; but if that function be not performed, they scarcely acquire any increase, and at length spontaneously degenerate. The progressive series of changes that occur in the ovary itself, and in its contained ovulum, subsequent to fecundation, have been exhibited in the almond by Malpighi, whose observations we shall briefly detail.\n\n385. In fig. 11. Plate XIX. is represented the pistil of the Almond, as it appears soon after fecundation, in which the ovary (r) is seen to be somewhat enlarged, and has an oval form. In the next figure (fig. 12.), a longitudinal section of the same pistil is exhibited, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> the cavity of the ovary (s), within which a small vesicle (t) is placed. As the ovary (fig. 13.) enlarges, it becomes rounder, its style is contorted, and diminished in size. If in this stage it be laid open, as in fig. 14. its vessels, which, in the peduncle (w), are disposed cylindrically, are observed to be dilated at the place of the calyx (x), and to give off branches to the ovary itself, and to the shell (y) that now begins to be formed within it. In the centre, the ovulum (z) is now seen to be much increased.\n\nVEGETABLE.\n\nOf Fruits. All the parts continue to augment; the ovary (fig. 15.) becomes rounder, and the appearance of the style is obliterated. On exposing its cavity, as in fig. 16., the ovulum (a) in the centre is observed to be much increased, and the outer layer (b) of the shelly covering that invests it now begins to harden. Such are the changes of form and structure exhibited by the ovary: we have next to trace more minutely those of the ovulum that is produced within it.\n\nStructure of the Ovulum.\n\n386. The earlier appearances of this body have been exhibited in figures 12. and 14. When removed from its seat, a few days after fecundation has been accomplished, and viewed by a moderately magnifying power, it exhibits the form and appearance represented in fig. 17. Externally it is covered by a vascular tunic (c), derived from the inner coat of the ovarium, a part of which coat adheres to it at d. If in this stage the ovulum be laid open by a vertical section, as in fig. 18., it is seen to be composed of two tunics or sacs, one within the other; the inner one is filled with a cellular tissue that contains a transparent juice. To this inner tunic, the term chorion may be properly applied.\n\nIts Chorion; chorion may be properly applied.\n\n387. At a period a little later, when the ovulum is examined, a tubular body (e, fig. 19.) is observed to extend through the chorion or tunic last mentioned. Shortly after, this tube expands at its apex, and is found to contain a small vesicle. In fig. 20., which represents a section of the entire ovulum, the outer tunic, the chorion, and this tube (f), expanded at its apex, are exhibited. To it, the appellation of amnios may be given; for it is the organ in which the embryo, or rather the corelum, as at this early period it may be called, is first seen to emerge. Through several successive days, the expanded portion of this tube enlarges, and forms a sort of sac, which is filled with cellular tissue, and the summit of which, says Malpighi, the embryo is seen to occupy. In fig. 21., this amnios is separated from the other tunics, and, at its summit, the embryo (g) is observed. If removed from its seat, the embryo presents the appearance h (fig. 22.), and when expanded, as in fig. 22. (i), is seen to consist of a body and two little wings.\n\nIts Embryo.\n\nGrowth of the Ovulum.\n\n388. Having thus viewed the several parts of which the ovulum is composed in their separate state, let us next observe them in connection, and trace the series of appearances they exhibit, and the effects they produce on each other. In figure 23., is given a vertical section of the entire ovulum in a more advanced state; the outer coat (k) still envelopes the others; the embryo (l) occupies the summit of the amnios (m), whose lower part, still tubular, is continued through the chorion (n). In the next figure (fig. 24.), from which the outer coat has been removed, the embryo (o) and the amnios (p) are represented as enlarged; but the chorion (q) is partly exhausted of its juice, and has fallen down in a collapsed state. At this period, the embryo, when separated from the amnios, has the form (r) fig. 25., and in its expanded state is represented by the letter s of the same figure. The bulk of the embryo (t) fig. 26., continually augments, and encroaches on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a> of the two tunics (v, x,) whose forms are constantly changing; and from being successively emptied of their juices, with which the embryo becomes filled, they are gradually pressed downward. At last, the embryo (y) of fig. 27., is so much augmented as to fill the cavity of the outer tunic, and by this time the amnios and chorion, exhausted of their fluids, exhibit the shrunk and corrugated forms in which they appear at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> of the figure. According to this representation, the outer tunic (k, fig. 23.), derived from the ovary itself, and the fine membrane that immediately invests the embryo, form the only permanent coverings of the mature ovum or seed; for during the progress of formation, the chorion and amnios, which are successively produced subsequent to fecundation, are again obliterated by the growth of the contained embryo. Malpighi describes the process of formation in many other seeds to be nearly similar; for his descriptions of which, we must refer the reader to his work. (Anat. Plantar. p. 71.)\n\n389. In the above descriptions of Malpighi, the several parts seem to be clearly exhibited, except in one important particular, namely, the situation and course of the umbilical cord. In almost every instance, he designates the tube, which we have represented as the first form of the amnios, as the umbilical vessel (vasculum umbilicale), which the subsequent appearances it exhibits shows to be erroneous. In the descriptions of Grew, this deficiency in the representations of Malpighi is supplied. He has particularly observed the formation of the seed in the Apricot, which, in many respects, resembles that of the Almond; and we shall subjoin an abridged account of his observations.\n\n390. In this fruit, the pericarp that envelopes the seed is seen, in its mature state, to be composed of three parts: the pulpy part (a) fig. 28., within which is the osseous envelope (b), and at the centre, the kernel or true seed (c). At an early period, both the pulp and stone are observed to consist of cellular tissue; and through the stone, the vessels, passing from the peduncle, are continued. At the base of the figure, the letter d denotes one fasciculus of vessels continued through the stone, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> inward where it reaches the apex of the seed. These vessels form the umbilical cord or seed-branch of Grew, while the fasciculus (e) that runs on the opposite side, is continued to the flower. In fig. 29., a vertical section of the ovulum, as well as pericarp, is exhibited, as it appears at a very early period; in which f denotes the pulp, g the stone, through which the umbilical vessels pass and enter the outer tunic (h) of the ovulum, around which they make a ring. Within this tunic is another (i) filled with cellular tissue, and through its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol3.html#article-AXIS\">axis</a> a small tube extends, at the apex of which the embryo (k) is first seen to emerge.\n\n391. In fig. 30., these several parts of the ovulum are exhibited on a larger scale; the letter l denotes the outer tunic that immediately lines the stone; m the inner one, corresponding to the chorion of Malpighi; and n the tube answering to the amnios of the same author. Through the outer tunic, Grew represents the umbilical vessels to pass and be continued to the middle tunic; the cavity of which is occupied by large cells that contain a pure lymph. At first this tunic is entire, but soon there appears in it the small duct (n). This duct is not at first\n\nVEGETABLE.\n\nOf Fruits. wider than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>, and is dilated at each extremity into an oval cavity that contains a pure lymph. A few days after, a soft node is seen to emerge in the upper cavity of this tube. This node (o) fig. 31. is described to possess a conical figure, and to be another tunic filled with very minute cells. It is at first entire, but when about the size of a Carraway-seed, it becomes a little hollowed near its apex, at which part the vessels enter and terminate in another very small node, fig. 32., which is the first appearance of the embryo of the seed. This embryo, when about one-fifth part as big as a cheese-mite, begins to be distinguished by a little fissure, which marks the division of the lobes, as in fig. 33. When the lobes have increased, and are more fully formed, the node contracts at its base, fig. 34., indicating the place of the umbilical cord, which subsequently becomes the radicle of the seed. (Anat. of Plants, p. 209.)\n\n392. This description corresponds nearly with that of Malpighi as far as regards the situation and general form of the tunics, and the place in which the embryo is seen first to emerge. It also displays the course of the vessels to form the umbilical cord; but the growth of the embryo in this seed, does not seem to produce the obliteration of some of the tunics in the manner delineated by Malpighi.\n\nStructure of the Pear. An example of a different kind is observed in the Pear. Its structure has been described by Grew, and more minutely by Du Hamel. In its mature state, it consists of a pulpy matter, in the centre of which are five loculae that contain each two seeds. These appearances are exhibited in the transverse section, fig. 35.; and in the longitudinal section, fig. 36. the seeds are further shown to be attached by a small umbilical cord. The pulp of the fruit is made up of a very fine cellular tissue, filled with the proper substance of the fruit, and is everywhere furnished with vessels. Through this pulpy matter a number of solid particles are met with, which are more particularly accumulated at the top and about the core. They are formed of an assemblage of small particles, of a stony consistence, with which a little knot of vessels (fig. 37.) is everywhere connected. In fig. 38. is a thin transverse slice, showing the relative position of these stony particles, as indicated by the knots of vessels with which they are associated. The stony matter is not observed at an early period, but seems to be deposited from the juices in a more mature state.\n\n394. By long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MACERATION\">maceration</a> in water, the pulpy matter is dissolved, and the vascular system is obtained separate. In the peduncle of the fruit, fifteen principal fasciculi of vessels are contained. Ten of these are distributed to the seeds and flower, and the five others are dispersed through the pulp. This vascular structure is represented in fig. 39. after the removal of the pulpy part; the larger vessels embrace the core, and, after variously ramifying, terminate in the little vascular processes before described as connected with the stony matter of the pulp. In fig. 40. is represented one of the loculae of the capsule, with the seed in it, receiving vessels from fasciculi continued from the peduncle; and in fig. 41. an entire seed is represented, and also a section of the same, in which the umbilical vessels that enter at the base are shown, as in other instances, to be continued, beneath the tunic, to the apex of the seed. (Phys. des Arbres, Tom. I. p. 242.)\n\n395. The last variety we shall notice in the Ovulum of formation of the seed, is that of Wheat (triticum), Wheat, as given by Malpighi. In fig. 42. A. is represented the pistil of the flower of this plant, consisting of the ovarium (q), the two styles (r), and the feathered parts that form the stigmata. Previous to fecundation, the ovarium is found to contain a little vesicle, fig. 42. B. which is the rudiment of the future ovulum. After fecundation, the styles soon fall, and the ovarium acquires a more pointed figure, as in fig. 43. If now it be opened, the little vesicle has changed its appearance, and contains within it another smaller vesicle (u), fig. 24. The ovarium continues to alter its shape, and assumes a more oblong form, fig. 45. and the appearance of styles is now quite obliterated. Gradually the little vesicle is formed into a small plantule, convex anteriorly, fig. 46. but more hollowed within, fig. 47. and which is situated at the base of the ovarium. The two portions thus described in figures 46. and 47. are the minute germ and cotyledon of this seed, which are represented in their appropriate place in fig. 48., in which the letter x denotes the germ, resting in the concavity of the cotyledon; y the albumen that forms the chief bulk of the seed; and z the ovarium which, in this seed, continues permanent, and forms its outer tunic. (Anat. Plantar. p. 73.)\n\n396. We have thus, in different examples, exhibited the structure of the seed; have followed the changes of form displayed in its evolution; and, in various instances, have demonstrated the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of the several members of which the mature plant is composed. We have then described the formation of buds on the trunk, the branch, and the root, and displayed their structure in the successive stages of their evolution, by which not only new roots and branches, but leaves and flowers, are produced; and, lastly, we have followed the changes of form and condition manifested in the flower itself, from which a new seed originates, fitted to undergo and exhibit the same series of changes.\n\nThe external agents required to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCOMPLISHMENT\">accomplishment</a> of these various changes, the circumstances in which they act, and the modes of their operation, belong to the department of Physiology, and will form the subjects of future consideration.

It is doubtful whether he was ever acquainted with the famous Vieta, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">Master</a> of Requests at Paris, who died in 1603; but his pure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> and skill in mathematical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>, had pointed him out to the executors of that illustrious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, who had found leisure, in the intervals of a laborious profession, to cultivate and extend the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">geometry</a>, and by adopting a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> symbols, to lay the foundation, and begin the superstructure of Algebraical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> most proper for revising and publishing his valuable manuscripts.

The subject of this article, who has been brought into notice, principally from the more recent encouragement given to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>, and the versatility of his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a>, was born at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VILLAGE\">village</a> of Hermannston, in the county of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, in the year 1730. His parents were in humble life, and had possessed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARM\">farm</a> for some generations, which he was destined to inherit and to cultivate. At that period improvement was in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANCY\">infancy</a>, and the husbandman had to contend with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, whose uncertainty seemed to keep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PACE\">pace</a> with the progress of his skill, and which too often disappointed him of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> of his industry. Anderson, while yet at an early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, lost his parents; however, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> was uninterrupted, and conceiving that an acquaintance with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">Chemistry</a> would promote his profession, he attended a course of lectures <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> that science, then delivered by Dr. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CULLEN\">Cullen</a>. None of the other pupils besides himself took notes of his lectures, which being afterwards surreptitiously obtained from him, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of publication, he defeated the intended purpose, apprehensive that his preceptor's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> might be diminished by these imperfect transcripts. His own active occupations had already commenced, and along with the practice of husbandry, he prosecuted his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> taste for literature.\n\nEnlarging the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPHERE\">sphere</a> of his employments, Anderson forsook his first possession, for a farm of 1300 acres, which he rented in Aberdeenshire, though nearly in a state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, and where agriculture is still behind the southern districts. But, previous to this, he became known to men of letters, by some Essays on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTING\">planting</a>, which, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIGNATURE\">signature</a> Agricola, he ventured to commit to the world through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDIUM\">medium</a> of the Edinburgh Weekly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGAZINE\">Magazine</a>, in 1771. Soon embarking in a higher sphere of literature, he composed the article Monsoon, for the first edition of this Encyclopaedia, in 1773, wherein he threw out some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUMINOUS\">luminous</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a>, and among other observations, predicted, from physical facts, and the state of geographical knowledge, that no polar continent would be found by the circumnavigators then employed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">Government</a>. In the year 1777, he published a considerable quarto <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a>, said to have been composed two years preceding, on the means of exerting a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of national industry, with regard to Agriculture, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMERCE\">Commerce</a>, Manufactures, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FISHERIES\">Fisheries</a>; and in this, he enters into detailed views of many subjects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">Political</a> Economy. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland is in a particular manner considered, and the author maintains, that the only effectual means of increasing agriculture, is by promoting manufactures; as also, that the neglect which the agriculture of these parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> experienced, resulted from the neglect of manufactures. Scotland, he affirms, is better adapted than England for the production of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a>, and this, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as other products, he thought, would be best encouraged by premiums. The advantages which might result from attending to the fisheries, he judged would be very great, and the shoals of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERRING\">herring</a> frequenting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a>, could be converted to a source of national wealth under suitable establishments. Dr. Anderson, who, soon after, had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOCTOR\">Doctor</a> of Laws conferred on him by the University of Aberdeen, did not abandon these inquiries. He printed a tract regarding the fisheries, which was circulated among his friends; and, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of being more widely diffused, he was appointed, by the Lords of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TREASURY\">Treasury</a>, to survey the western coast of Scotland, for the purpose of obtaining satisfactory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> on the subject. This he did in 1784, and received the full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROBATION\">approbation</a> of his employers; and he published a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIEF\">brief</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEBRIDES\">Hebrides</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a> of Islands then as little within the general acquaintance of the inhabitants of Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, as if they had been under the dominion of another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> obstacles to the fishery, Dr. Anderson considered, were to be found in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a> on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> and coals, and he recommended the repeal of both. It is certain, that, from thenceforward, this great branch of national industry has received infinitely more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRONAGE\">patronage</a> than before his report, and, while we only shared the labours of the Dutch for centuries, the fisheries on our own coast have since been monopolized by ourselves. Nothing can be more impolitic than to fetter the exertions of the industrious by exorbitant duties; or equally oppressive, with denying <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol10.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a> to the poorer classes where it is scarce, by duties on its importation.\n\nDr. Anderson had now withdrawn from his northern farm, where he resided above twenty years, and settled in the vicinity of Edinburgh. His agricultural speculations were still <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>, and, when a Parliamentary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> was about to be proposed to Mr. Elkington, for a particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of draining <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, he reclaimed the practice as having been observed by himself many years anterior. Repeated examples, indeed, prove that the rewards granted by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a> for improvement are attended with such slight investigations, that the merits of real <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> are overlooked. Dr. Anderson now projected a periodical publication, called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEE\">Bee</a>, consisting of miscellaneous original <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, which attained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of eighteen volumes in octavo. It was published weekly, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> of it came from his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEN\">pen</a>, which is seldom a prudent course in an Editor. The relation of Great Britain and her Colonies, and the political <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> of man-\nkind, \u2014 subjects which had excited strong interests throughout <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>,\u2014also received some commentaries from Dr Anderson. He wrote a tract, called *The Interest of Great Britain with respect to her Colonies*, and commenced a correspondence with General <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WASHINGTON\">Washington</a>, which was afterwards published.\n\nTowards the year 1797, he again removed to Isleworth, in the neighbourhood of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, where he undertook another periodical publication, appearing at more distant intervals than the former, entitled *Recreations in Agriculture, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">Natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a>, Arts, and Miscellaneous Literature*. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> was prefaced by two copious dissertations, the one on Agriculture, the other on Natural History; and opened with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a> regarding a very curious and important subject, namely, an inquiry into what are denominated varieties in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> and animals. Many useful and interesting remarks appear in the course of this publication, a portion of which was supplied by other contributors, and it is embellished by beautiful vignettes from engravings on wood. Owing to some difficulties attending the publication, it ceased in 1802, having subsisted three years. Though natural history is rather predominant, the rest of his leading subjects are not overlooked. Dr Anderson henceforward lived in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RETIREMENT\">retirement</a>, though occasionally reminding the world of his wonted inquiries, by the publication of tracts on unconnected subjects. He obtained a patent for an improved Hot-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, wherein no fuel was used; and employed himself in experiments regarding the degree of temperature and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HUMIDITY\">humidity</a> most beneficial to plants. Likewise, having observed the uncommon depredations of wasps, he is said, after satisfying himself of their manner of increase, to have devised a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> extermination. This was chiefly by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a> of the females before founding their respective colonies by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEPOSITION\">deposition</a> of innumerable eggs; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>-bills were circulated under the auspices of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">association</a> formed by him, offering a reward for every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> brought in dead within a specified time. It does not appear, however, that the breed was at all diminished by the proposed expedient.\n\nDr Anderson still remained in his retreat, enjoying the cultivation of his garden, and nothing of importance is known to have proceeded from his pen. After a gradual decline, partly occasioned by the over-exertion of the mental energies, he died in the year 1808, aged 69. He was twice married; first to Miss <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SETON\">Seton</a> of Mounie; secondly, to an English lady. By his first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> he had thirteen children, six of whom survived him. One of his sons, who died a few years ago, made distinguished progress in the art of engraving on wood; and, if the vignettes of the *Recreations in Agriculture* are executed by him, they afford ample testimony of his abilities.\n\nDr Anderson was endowed with a vigorous understanding, which he chiefly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> in treating of agricultural matters, and those connected with rural economy; but he was, at the same time, of a versatile talent, which could readily be occupied on transient facts and occurrences. Many of his works were of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUGITIVE\">fugitive</a> nature, consisting of small impressions, which were not renewed, and hence are difficult to be obtained at present, if they have not totally disappeared. None of them soar to the more lofty regions of science; they are directed to practical views in useful projects, and, for the most part, relate to subjects of ordinary detail. Of this the reader <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be enabled to judge by the subjoined <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIST\">list</a>, which we believe is the most copious that has yet appeared. The industry of Dr Anderson was indefatigable, whether in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> exertion, or mental energy, and he possessed elevated sentiments of independence. During a period of overstrained political fervour, certain papers formed part of the periodical works already referred to, which were thought libellous on the Government. Although Dr Anderson's principles were noted for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to the existing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMINISTRATION\">administration</a>, he was called upon to give up the author of the obnoxious compositions, which he steadily refused, and, even in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of the civil magistrates, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> his printers not to violate their fidelity to him and the author in betraying his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a>. The business terminated here, until a factious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a> insinuated to the same magistrates, that the compositions had proceeded from one of the Supreme Judges, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PARTY\">party</a> politics were avowedly hostile to those of Government. Dr Anderson having learned the reproach, hastened to relieve the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of it by divulging the name of the real author, who, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> surprise of the public, proved to be none other than the traducer himself.\n\n1776.

The Encyclopedia contains such particulars relative to that amazing chain of mountains as could be gathered from the accounts of the early writers, and especially from the more precise descriptions given by the Academicians who were sent to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-PERU\">Peru</a> in 1736, to measure the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> of a degree of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERIDIAN\">meridian</a> under the Equator. But, since that period, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">Geography</a> has made rapid advances, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-MINERALOGY\">Mineralogy</a>, emerging from its obscurity, has risen to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of a science. The vast American Continent has been explored in different directions, by adventurous and intelligent travellers. Of these by far the most conspicuous for enterprise, accuracy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>, and extent of scientific research, is the celebrated Humboldt, whose various discoveries in the regions of the New World have deservedly excited so much interest. The narrative, however, of this accomplished traveller is not yet completed, and we must content ourselves at present with combining the incidental sketches which occur in his other publications. We trust that we shall be enabled to give a fuller and more precise account of the Andes in the article MOUNTAINS.\n\nThe Andes are distinguished above all the known mountain-chains, by their immense extent and their prodigious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ALTITUDE\">altitude</a>. They run almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to the west coast of the southern Continent of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>, at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> of between 100 and 200 miles, rising in some places to the enormous height of 20,000 feet; and stretch from the mouth of the river Atrato, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISTHMUS\">isthmus</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DARIEN\">Darien</a>, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LATITUDE\">latitude</a> of 8 degrees <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>, as far as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol4.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> Pilares, at the outlet of the Straits of Magellan, in the 53rd degree of south latitude,\u2014a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANGE\">range</a> of at least 4200 miles. According to Humboldt, they send out, nearly at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> to their colossal ridge, three dependent branches, called likewise Cordilleras by the Spaniards.\n\nOf these secondary chains, the first and most northern is that of the coast of Venezuela, which is besides the highest and narrowest. With an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> altitude, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENDS\">bends</a> eastwards from the Atrato, forming the Sierra of Abib\u00f3, the mountains of Cauca, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> Savannahs of Folu, till it reaches the stream of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGDALENA\">Magdalena</a>, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of St Martha. It contracts, as it approaches the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GULF\">Gulf</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-MEXICO\">Mexico</a> at Cape Vela; and thence extends to the mountain of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIA\">Paria</a>, or rather the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GALLEY\">Galley</a>-Point in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of Trinidad, where it terminates. This secondary chain attains its greatest known <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELEVATION\">elevation</a> where it rears the snowy summit, or Sierra Nevada, of St Martha and of Merida, the former being nearly 14,000, and the latter above 15,000 feet, in altitude. These insulated mountains, covered so near the equator with eternal snow, yet discharging <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> sulphureous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> from their sides, are higher than the Peak of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TENERIFFE\">Teneriffe</a>, and can be compared only with Mont-blanc. In their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a>, they leave the Paramo or lofty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a> of Rosa and of Mucachi; and on the west side of the lake Maracaibo, they form <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> and very narrow vales, running from south to north, and covered with forests. At Cape Vela, the mountain-chain divides into two parallel ridges, which form three confined valleys, ranging from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EAST\">east</a> to west, and having all the appearance of being the beds of ancient lakes. These ridges, of which the northern is the continuation of the Sierra Nevada of St Martha, and the southern the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of the snowy summits of Merida, are united again by two arms which seem to have been placed by the hand of nature, as dikes to confine the primeval collections of water. The three valleys thus enclosed are remarkable for their elevation above the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, rising like steps one above another, the eastmost, or that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CARACCAS\">Caraccas</a>, being the highest. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> was found by Humboldt to be elevated 2660 feet, while the basin of Aragua has only 1350 feet in height, and the Llanos, or reedy plains of Monai, spread within 500 or 600 feet above the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> of the shore. The lake of the Caraccas appears to have forced a passage for itself through the quebrada, or cleft of Tip\u00e9, while that of Aragua has been gradually dissipated by a slow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a>, leaving some vestiges of its former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> in pools charged with muriate of lime, and in the low islets called Aparecidas. The medium height of the Cordillera of the coast is about 4000 or 5000 feet; but its loftiest summit, next to the Sierra Nevada of Merida, is the Silla (or saddle) of the Caraccas, which was visited by Humboldt, and ascertained from barometrical measurement to have an elevation of 8420 feet. Farther to the eastward, the mountain-chain becomes suddenly depressed, especially its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIMITIVE\">primitive</a> rocks; the beds of gneiss and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MICA\">mica</a> slate, meeting as they advance with accumulations of secondary calcareous substances, which envelope them completely, and rise to a great eleva-\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCUMBENT\">incumbent</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of sandstone, with a calcareous base, extending from Capellnari, forms a detached range of mountains, in which no trace of primitive rock is found.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> branch, which stretches from the Andes across the American Continent, and exhibits a chain of primitive mountains, is named by Humboldt the Cordillera of the cataracts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORINOCO\">Orinoco</a>. This very enterprising traveller surveyed it over an extent of upwards of 600 miles, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">Black</a> River to the frontiers of the Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol2.html#article-BARA\">Bara</a>; but the rest of the chain is very little known, running through unexplored wilds and regions almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INACCESSIBLE\">inaccessible</a>, occupied by fierce and independent tribes of savages. It leaves the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a> between the 3d and 6th degree of southern latitude, and runs eastwards from the Paramo, or high desert of Tuquillo and St Martin, and the sources of the Guaviari, rearing the lofty summits of Umana and Caravani, and pouring forth the large rivers <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-META\">Meta</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZAMA\">Zama</a>, and Ymerida, which form the roudals, or tremendous rapids of Ature and Maypare, the only openings existing at present between the interior of the Continent and the plain of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMAZONS\">Amazons</a>. Beyond these cataracts, the chain of mountains again acquires greater elevation and breadth, occupying the vast tract enclosed between the rivers Caura, Cavyon, and Padamo, and stretching southwards to the boundless forests where the Portuguese settlers gather that potent drug, the sarpapilla. Farther eastwards this chain is not traced, no European or civilized <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> having ever explored the sources of the Orinoco; all access in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> being prevented by the ferocity of the Guaiacas, a dwarfish but very fair and warlike <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>, and by the valour of the Guajaribos, a most desperate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> of cannibals. Beyond these recesses, however, we are made acquainted with the continuation of the chain of the cataracts, by the astonishing journey performed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DON\">Don</a> Antonio Santos, who, disguised like a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a>, his body naked, and his skin stained of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, and speaking fluently the several Indian dialects, penetrated from the mouth of the Rio Caronis to the Lake of Parime and the Amazons. The range of mountains sinks lower, and contracts its breadth to 200 miles, where it assumes the name of Serrania de Quineroa and Pacaraima. A few degrees farther eastwards, it spreads out again, and bends south to the Cano Pirara along the Mao, near whose banks appears the Cerro or hill of Ucucuano, consisting entirely of a very shining and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> mica slate, which has therefore procured from the curiosity of early travellers the magnificent appellation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DORADO\">Dorado</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-GOLDEN\">Golden</a> Mountain. East from the river Esquibo, this Cordillera stretches to meet the granitic or gneiss mountains of Dutch and French Guyana, inhabited by confederated bands of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol7.html#article-NEGROES\">Negroes</a> and Caribs, but giving birth to the commercial streams of Berbice, Surinam, and Marony.\n\nThe chain of the cataracts of Orinoco, has only a mean height of about 4000 feet above the level of the sea. The greatest elevation occurs where the mountain of Duida rears its enormous mass from the midst of a luxuriant plain, clothed with the tropical productions of Palms and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANANAS\">Ananas</a>, and discharges from its steep sides, about the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of the rainy season, volumes of incessant flames. No one has yet had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> or perseverance to climb through the tangling and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAMPANT\">rampant</a> bushes to its peak, which, measured trigonometrically, gives an altitude of 8465 feet above the sea. The whole mountain-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUP\">group</a> which forms this Cordillera, is distinguished by the abrupt descent of its south <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLANK\">flank</a>; nor is it less remarkable for containing no rock of secondary formation, or exhibiting any vestige of petrifications and organic remains. It contains only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANITE\">granite</a>, gneiss, mica slate, and hornblende, without any casing or admixture of sandstone or calcareous matter.\n\nThe third great branch sent out from the trunk of the Andes, is that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIQUITOS\">Chiquitos</a>; which province it traverses, making a sort of semicircular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SWEEP\">sweep</a> between the parallels of 15 and 20 degrees south latitude, and appearing to connect the colossal heights of Peru and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHILI\">Chili</a>, with the mountains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRAZIL\">Brazil</a> and Paraguay. It supplies the rivers that feed the Maranon on the one side, and the Plata on the other. The structure and disposition, however, of the Cordillera of the Chiquitos still remain almost unknown.\n\nThese <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> chains of mountains divide the southern Continent of America, from the latitude of 19 to that of 52 degrees, into three immense plains, which on the west side are shut up by the enormous ridge of the Andes, but are all open on the east, and towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATLANTIC_OCEAN\">Atlantic <a cl</a>ass=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCEAN\">Ocean</a>. The most northern is the valley of the Orinoco, consisting of savannahs or level tracts covered with reedy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERBAGE\">herbage</a> and scattered Palms. The next is the plain of the Maranon, which is entirely covered with dense impenetrable forests. The third and southmost valley is the Pampas; a dead flat of most prodigious expanse, clothed, like that of the Orinoco, with a coarse rank herbage, and abandoned to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCCUPATION\">occupation</a> of countless herds of wild cattle.\n\nOf these immense plains, the subsoil resembles the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of the neighbouring mountains. In the valley of the Orinoco, the primitive rock is generally wrapt in a coat of sandstone with calcareous cement, or covered with calcareous concretions, which betray the vestiges of recent organic remains, but show none of the older impressions, such as the belemnites and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMMONITES\">ammonites</a> so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> in Europe. The woody plain of Maranon is distinguished by the thinness of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, and the total absence of any calcareous ingredients, the granite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a> close to the surface, which is in some places left quite bare over an extent of many furlongs. But the Pampas of Buenos Ayres are covered to a great depth with beds of alluvial deposits, in which the powers of vegetation, fomented by the rays of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> sun, luxuriate in wanton profusion.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a> of Werner traces with delight, in the majestic features of the American Continent, the same order and succession of rocks which the sagacity of that illustrious Geologist had discovered in the mountains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAXONY\">Saxony</a>. Granite appears still the oldest material of our globe: To it succeeds the laminated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>, or gneiss; then mica slate containing garnets; next primitive slate, with beds of native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALUM\">alum</a>; now slate mixed with hornblende; above this, greenstone, or primitive trap, followed by\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol2.html#article-AMYGDALOID\">amygdaloid</a>; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a>, porphyry slate. Resting or flanked against those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIMARY\">primary</a> rocks, beds of the older limestone begin to appear, followed by a suite of minerals, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> indications of organic remains\u2014mica slate, hornblende, gypsum, and calcareous sandstone. The only formations which Humboldt did not meet with in his extensive travels, were those of chalk, roestone, gray-wacke, topaz rock, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERPENTINE\">serpentine</a> with granular limestone which occurs in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINOR\">Minor</a>. The grand ridge of the Andes is everywhere covered with porphyry, basalt, phonolite, and greenstone; which being often broken into columns, appear at a distance like ruined castles, and produce a very striking effect. Near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> of that enormous chain, two different sorts of limestone occur\u2014one with a silicious base, enclosing sometimes cinnabar and coal\u2014and another mostly calcareous, and cementing the secondary rocks. These formations are of enormous thickness and elevation. \"Beds of coal are found in the neighbourhood of Santa F\u00e9, 8650 feet above the level of the sea; and even at the height of 14,700 near Huancos in Peru. The plains of Bugota, although elevated 9000 feet, are covered with gypsum, sandstone, shell-limestone, and even in some parts with rock salt. Fossil shells, which, in the old Continent, have not been discovered higher than the summits of the Pyrenees, or 11,700 feet above the sea, were observed in Peru, near Micupampa, at the height of 12,800 feet; and again at that of 14,120, beside Huancavelica, where sandstone also appears. The basalt of Pichincha, near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Quito, has an elevation of 15,500 feet; while the top of the Schneekoppe in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SILESIA\">Silesia</a> is only 4925 feet above the sea: the highest point in Germany where that species of rock occurs. On the other hand, granite, which in Europe crowns the loftiest mountains, is not found in the American Continent above the height of 11,500 feet. It is scarcely known at all in the provinces of Quito and Peru. The frozen summits of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIMBORAZO\">Chimborazo</a>, Cayamb\u00e9, and Antisana, consist entirely of porphyry, which, on the flanks of the Andes, forms a mass of 10,000 or 12,000 feet in depth. The sandstone near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUENCA\">Cuenca</a>, has a thickness of 5000 feet; and the stupendous mass of pure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTZ\">quartz</a>, on the west of Caxamarca, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> perpendicularly 9600 feet. It is likewise a remarkable fact, that the porphyry of those mountains very frequently contains hornblende, but never quartz, and seldom mica.\"\n\n\"The central Andes are rich beyond <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> in all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-METALS\">metals</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> only excepted. One of the most curious ones in the bowels of those mountains is the paco, a compound of clay, oxyd of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, and the muriate of silver with native silver. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> of Mexico and Peru, so long the objects of envy and admiration, far from being yet exhausted, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a>, under a liberal and improved system, to become more productive than ever. But nature has blended with those hidden treasures the active elements of destruction. The whole chain of the Andes is subject to the most terrible earthquakes. From Cotopaxi to the South Sea, no fewer than forty volcanos are constantly burning; some of them, especially the lower ones, ejecting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAVA\">lava</a>, and others discharging the muriate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol2.html#article-AMMONIA\">ammonia</a>, scorified basalt, and porphyry, enormous quantities of water, and especially moya, or clay mixed with sulphur and carbonaceous matter. Eternal snow invests their sides, and forms a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARRIER\">barrier</a> to the animal and vegetable kingdoms. Near that confine, the torpor of vegetation is marked by dreary wastes.\" (Edin. Review, Vol. XV. p. 233.)\n\nWe may subjoin, that, near Quito, the liquid mud ejected by the volcanos often involves myriads of small dead fish. In some parts, the mountains, like the fabled cave of Eothis, seem at times to let out their imprisoned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, and produce such furious gusts of wind as to sweep everything before them to a vast distance. In other districts, the efforts of the contending elements are betrayed, especially during the rainy season, by a doleful moaning noise, or hollow and portentous groans, enough to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> a darker shade on the gloom of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a>, and to fill the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> of the remotest settler with secret awe and dread.\n\nA person who, for the first time, climbs the mountains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SWITZERLAND\">Switzerland</a>, is astonished to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WITNESS\">witness</a>, in the space perhaps of a few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a>, so rapid a change of climate, and such a wide range of vegetable productions. He may begin his ascent from the midst of warm vineyards, and pass through a succession of Chestnuts, Oaks, and Beeches, till he gains the elevation of the hardy Pines and stunted Birches, or treeds on Alpine pastures, extending to the border of perpetual snow. But within the tropics everything is formed on a grander <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a>. The boundary of permanent congelation is 7500 feet higher at the equator than at the mean latitude of 45 degrees. Under a burning sun, Ananas and Plantains grow profusely near the shore; Oranges and Limes occur a little higher; then succeed fields of maize and luxuriant wheat; and the traveler has actually reached the high plain of Mexico, or the still loftier vale of Quito, before he finds a climate analogous to that of Bordeaux or of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GENEVA\">Geneva</a>. Now only commences the series of plants which inhabit the central parts of Europe.\n\nBut the very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a> of the Andes appears to have the effect of diminishing the impressions of awe and wonder, which the sight of them so powerfully excites. The country on which they rest, is heaved to such a vast altitude above the sea, that the relative elevation of their summits becomes diminished in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> with that of the surrounding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMPHITHEATRE\">amphitheatre</a>. The majestic forms of Chimborazo, Cotopaxi, and Antisana, though 6000 feet higher than Montblanc, and clothed, like it, with eternal snow, seem to a traveller scarcely more sublime from the plains of Riobamba and Quito, than this celebrated mountain when viewed from the vale of Chamouni. It requires some time for his imagination to expand itself to the new scale of grandeur.\n\nThe central Andes, with all their magnificence, want a feature which, in the higher latitudes, contributes so much to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> and sublimity of the Alpine scenery. They have no vestige whatever of Glaciers, those icy belts dropping from the limits of congelation, and spreading in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONCRETE\">concrete</a> sheets, or hanging in disjointed columns fantastically thrown, which occur alike in the heart of Switzerland and on the northern shores of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-NORWAY\">Norway</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAPLAND\">Lapland</a>. This defect is evidently owing to the almost uniform temperature which prevails near the equator. In\nthose torrid regions, the days are constantly of the same length, and the sun shines through the whole year with very nearly equal force. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIMIT\">limit</a> of perpetual congelation is hence marked on the sides of the mountains of Quito with singular precision. The temperature decreases regularly in proportion as one ascends them, till at a certain altitude it comes to the point of freezing, where the permanent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a> of snow begins to appear, defined with an almost unvarying border. But in the higher latitudes, the sun remains, during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, so long above the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZON\">horizon</a>, and shines with such augmented force, that the heat of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>, and consequently of the surface of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>, suffers a wide <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> in the different seasons. To the general investure of snow, is therefore annexed every winter, a zone of considerable breadth, which again softens and partly melts away during the continuance of the summer months. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> thawing and freezing, occasions the production of glaciers, by converting successively the lower detached masses of snow in the precipitous flanks of the mountains, into a collection of broken and intermingled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PILLARS\">pillars</a> of translucent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ICE\">ice</a>.\n\nFor the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> the Andes, though torn by flaming volcanos, and convulsed by frequent and terrible earthquakes, are exempt from those avalanches and boulders which, in Switzerland and other mountainous parts of Europe, often <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURY\">bury</a> the helpless traveller in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TORRENT\">torrent</a> of snow, and batter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> whole villages by the sudden discharge of a shower of rocks. Under the equator, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> of temperature throughout the year is so small, as not to disturb the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOLIDITY\">solidity</a> of the vast collections of snow. But on the flanks of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ALPS\">Alps</a> or Pyrenees, as the heat of the summer increases, portions of the upper field of snow become loosened, and, sliding down, put other masses likewise in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, till spreading wider, and gaining accelerated force, the whole tide precipitates itself to the plain, sweeping all before it. Such is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCIDENT\">accident</a> of an avalanche; but the occurrence of an embolism, though less frequent, is more tremendous. When the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERNATION\">alternation</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FROST\">frost</a> and thaw detaches a mass of rock, it rolls down the side of the mountain with irresistible fury, shivering into fragments and tearing everything opposed to it, overwhelming men, cattle, and houses, in one common heap of ruins.\n\nBut the Andes are distinguished from the chains of the European mountains, by frightful quebradas or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> rents, which form very narrow vales of immense depth, whose terrific walls, fringed below with luxuriant trees and shrubs, seem to lift their naked and barren heads to the distant skies. The noted crevices of Chota and Cutaco are nearly a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> deep, the former measuring 4950, and the latter 4300 feet, in a vertical descent. The task of crossing such tremendous gullies, is often a work of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFINITE\">infinite</a> toil and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> danger. In those mountainous countries, travellers are accustomed to perform their journeys sitting in chairs fastened to the backs of men, called cargueros or carriers. These porters are Mulattos, and sometimes Whites, of great bodily strength and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, who will climb along the face of precipices, bearing loads of twelve and fourteen, or even eighteen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>. These cargueros lead a vagabond life, exposed to incredible fatigue, but recommended to them by its irregular course. Often those wretched men toil over mountains for the space of eight or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> hours every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, till, like beasts of burthen, they have their backs chafed, and made quite raw with the load. In this deplorable condition, they are not unfrequently abandoned by unfeeling travellers, and left alone to sicken, pine, or die in the forests. Yet their earnings would appear inadequate to such violent and overpowering exertions, since they receive scarcely three guineas for performing the journey from Ibague to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARTHAGENA\">Carthagena</a>, which requires fifteen, and perhaps twenty-five or thirty days.\n\nThe Icononzo, remarkable for its natural bridges, is a small quebrada or cleft of the mountains, through which flows the river of the Summa Paz, descending from the highest upland desert. The rocks consist of two different kinds of sandstone, the one extremely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a>, and the other of a slaty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEXTURE\">texture</a>, divided into their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRATA\">strata</a>. The rent was probably caused by an earthquake, which the harder portion of the stony mass had resisted, and now connects the upper part of the chasm. This natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> is 50 feet long, 40 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, and 8 feet thick at the middle. Its height is about 300 feet above the surface of the torrent, which has a medium depth of twenty feet. About 60 feet below the natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a>, another smaller arch occurs, composed of three slanting blocks of stone wedged together, which had probably fallen from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a> at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INSTANT\">instant</a> of time, and struck against the sides of the crevice in their descent.\n\nThe natural bridge of Icononzo has perhaps no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTER\">counter</a>-part in the old world; but the writer of this article had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> of seeing, in early life, a similar phenomenon, scarcely inferior to it, in the United <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">States</a> of America. We allude to the famous arch, described by Mr. Jefferson, which crosses the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CEDAR\">Cedar</a> Creek in Rockbridge county, about an hundred miles beyond the Blue Ridge, in the higher district of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGINIA\">Virginia</a>. The divided rock is a pure limestone, leaving a chasm about 90 feet wide, of which the walls are 250 feet high, sprinkled with verdant bushes, and enamelled with gay flowers, among which the aquilegia is conspicuous. This bridge, viewed from a little distance below, has all the appearance of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOTHIC\">Gothic</a> arch; and is of such solidity, that loaded waggons used formerly to pass along it, till a more convenient line of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> was formed.\n\nIn some places, the natives of Peru connect the clefts of their mountains by pendulous bridges thrown fearlessly across, and suspended from both sides of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GAP\">gap</a>. They are formed of ropes made of the tough fibres of the agave, hanging in a gentle parallel curve, and covered with reeds or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CANES\">canes</a>, with occasionally a narrow border of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BASKET\">basket</a>-work. The intrepid Indian, regardless of the horrors of the untamed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABYSS\">abyss</a> which yawns from below, commits himself to his frail and floating arch, and swiftly glides along its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENDING\">bending</a> curvature, till he gains the opposite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a>.\n\nThe Andes likewise give rise to waterfalls of immense height and amazing force. The cataract of Tequendama, considered in all its circumstances, exceeds any other in the known world. The basin\nwhich feeds its streams is the vast plain of Bogota, 7465 feet above the level of the sea, encircled completely with lofty mountains, except where the water, aided probably by the concussion of an earthquake, has cut for itself a narrow passage. The river Fumcha, swelled by numerous feeders, gradually contracts its channel to the breadth of about 40 feet, and then gathering augmented force, dashes at two bounds from a perpendicular height of near 600 feet, into a dark gulf. Owing to the excessive rapidity and depth of its current, it must discharge a prodigious volume of water, which quite stuns the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-EAR\">ear</a> by the roar of its crash; while it raises enormous clouds of thick spray and vapour, that continually bedew, and perhaps quicken the vegetation of the adjacent grounds. Everything conspires to exalt the beauty and grandeur of the scenery. \"Independent of the height and mass of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> of water,\" says Humboldt, \"the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANDSCAPE\">landscape</a>, and the aspect of the rocks, it is the luxuriant form of the trees and herbaceous plants, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a> into thickets, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTRAST\">contrast</a> of those craggy precipices, and the freshness of vegetation, which stamp a peculiar character on these great scenes of nature.\" The transition from a temperate to a warm climate is rapid and surprising. The plain of Bogota bears rich crops of wheat, then succeed Oaks and Elms, intermingled with Aralias, Bogonias, and the Yellow-bark trees; but, immediately below the cataract, a few Palms appear, as if it were to mark the advance to a sultry soil.\n\nA lively idea of the character and grand features of the Andes may be conceived from the account which the celebrated Humboldt has given of his journey across that majestic chain. Our readers will be glad to peruse it in the author's own words:\n\n\"The mountain of Quindiu, in the latitude of 4\u00b0 36', is considered as the most difficult passage in the Cordilleras of the Andes. It is a thick uninhabited forest, which, in the finest season, cannot be traversed in less than ten or twelve days. Not even a hut is to be seen, nor can any means of subsistence be found. Travellers, at all times of the year, furnish themselves with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>'s provision, since it often happens, that, by the melting of the snows, and the sudden swell of the torrents, they find themselves so circumstanced, that they can descend neither on the side of Carthago, nor that of Ibague. The highest point of the road, the Garito del Paramo, is 11,500 feet above the level of the sea. As the foot of the mountain, towards the banks of the Cauca, is only 3150 feet, the climate there is generally mild and temperate. The pathway, which forms the passage of the Cordilleras, is only 12 or 15 inches in breadth, and has the appearance, in several places, of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GALLERY\">gallery</a> dug, and left open to the sky. In this part of the Andes, as almost in every other, the rock is covered with a thick stratum of clay. The streamlets which flow down the mountains have hollowed out gullies about 20 feet deep. Along these crevices, which are full of mud, the traveller is forced to grope his passage; the darkness of which is increased by the thick vegetation that covers the opening above. The oxen, which are the beasts of burden commonly used in this country, can scarcely force their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> through these galleries, some of which are more than a mile in length; and if, perchance, the traveller meets them in one of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a>, he finds no means of avoiding them, but by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> back, and climbing the earthen wall which borders the crevice, and keeping himself suspended, by laying hold of the roots which penetrate to this depth from the surface of the ground.\"\n\n\"We traversed the mountain of Quindiu in the month of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OCTOBER\">October</a> 1801, on foot, followed by twelve oxen, which carried our collections and instruments, amidst a deluge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a>, to which we were exposed during the last three or four days, in our descent on the western side of the Cordilleras. The road passes through a country full of bogs, and covered with Bamboos. Our shoes were so torn by the prickles which shoot out from the roots of these gigantic graminia, that we were forced, like all other travellers who dislike being carried on men's backs, to go barefooted. This circumstance, the continual humidity, the length of the passage, the muscular force required to tread in a thick and muddy clay, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of fording deep torrents of icy water, render this journey extremely fatiguing; but however painful, it is accompanied by none of those dangers with which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-CREDULITY\">credulity</a> of the people <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALARM\">alarm</a> travellers. The road is narrow, but the places where it skirts the precipices are very rare.\"\n\n\"When travellers reach Ibague, and prepare to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> the forests of Quindiu, they pluck in the neighbouring mountains, several hundred leaves of the Vijao, a plant of the family of the Bananans, which forms a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENUS\">genus</a> approaching to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THALIA\">Thalia</a>, and which must not be confounded with the Heliconia Bibei. These leaves, which are membranous and silky, like those of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSA\">Musa</a>, are of an oval form, two feet long and 16 inches broad. Their lower surface is a silvery <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>, and covered with a farinaceous substance which falls off in scales. This peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VARNISH\">varnish</a> enables them to resist the rain during a long time. In gathering these leaves, an incision is made in the middle rib, which is the continuation of the foot-stalk; and this serves as a hook to suspend them, when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOVEABLE\">moveable</a> roof is formed. On taking it down, they are spread out, and carefully rolled up in a cylindrical bundle. It requires about a hundred <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of leaves to cover a hut large enough to hold six or eight persons. When the travellers reach a spot in the midst of the forests where the ground is dry, and where they propose to pass the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>, the cargueros lop a few branches from the trees, with which they make a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TENT\">tent</a>. In a few minutes, this slight timber work is divided into squares, by the stalks of some climbing plant, or the threads of the agave placed in parallel lines, 12 or 13 inches from each other. The Vijao leaves meanwhile have been unrolled, and are now spread over the above work, so as to cover it like the tiles of a house. These huts, thus hastily built, are cool and commodious. If, during the night, the traveller feels the rain, he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> out the spot where it enters, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a> is sufficient to obviate the inconvenience. We passed several days in the valley of Boquila, under one of those leafy tents, which was perfectly dry, amidst violent and incessant rains.\"\nFor farther information relative to the structure of the Andes, see the various sketches given by Humboldt, and particularly an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> of his Geological Observations inserted in the Journal de Physique, Vol. LIII. for 1801.\n\nAndrews (James Pettit), a late English historian and miscellaneous writer, was the younger son of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a> Andrews, Esq. of Shaw-house, near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEWBURY\">Newbury</a>, Berks, where he was born in the year 1737. He was educated privately, and is said to have discovered an early taste for literature and the fine arts. He joined the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BERKSHIRE\">Berkshire</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITIA\">militia</a> when they were first called out, being then about 18 or 19; and held the rank of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">lieutenant</a> in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGIMENT\">regiment</a>, until it was disbanded. On the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> of the new system of London <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-POLICE\">Police</a>, he was appointed one of the Commissioners for the district of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">Square</a> and St Margaret's, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WESTMINSTER\">Westminster</a>, and discharged the duties of that office, with great industry and integrity, until his death, which took <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> at his house in London, on the 6th of August 1797, in the 60th year of his age. He married Miss <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANNE\">Anne</a> Penrose, daughter of the Reverend Mr Penrose, late <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECTOR\">rector</a> of Newbury, by whom he had two sons and a daughter. He seems to have possessed a cheerful and social disposition, and enjoyed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVERSATION\">conversation</a> of a large circle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LITERARY\">literary</a> acquaintance, who frequently met at his house and experienced his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITALITY\">hospitality</a>.\n\nMr Andrews appears to have devoted a considerable portion of his time to literary pursuits; and he is the author of several works which are not undeserving of notice. The first publication upon which we find him employed, is an edition of the poems of his friend and relation, Penrose, in 1781; to which he prefixed an introduction, containing a short account of the life and character of the author. His first original production, so far as we have been able to ascertain, was a pamphlet in behalf of the chimney-sweepers' apprentices, in 1788; which is said to have led to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of Parliament, passed not long afterwards, for the purpose of ameliorating the condition of that unfortunate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a> of beings. In 1789, he published Anecdotes, ancient and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a>, 8vo; a work of pleasantry, in the composition of which, he acknowledged having received assistance from the late Laureat, Mr Pye, the facetious antiquary, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> Grose, and others. To this volume he added a supplement, in 1790.\n\nThe most extensive work undertaken by Mr Andrews, was his History of Great Britain, connected with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHRONOLOGY\">Chronology</a> of Europe; with Notes, &c. The first volume, which commences with Caesar's invasion, and ends with the deposition and death of Richard II., was published in 1794, in 4to. A second volume, in which the history is continued from the deposition and death of Richard II. to the accession of Edward VI., appeared in 1795. The plan of this work is new, and in some respects singular; a certain portion of the history of England is given on one page, and a corresponding portion of the contemporaneous history of Europe on the one opposite. The notes consist of a variety of curious and amusing particulars, not immediately connected with the main story. Appendixes are also added, at proper intervals, containing an account of the state of literature, science, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, government, manners, &c. at different periods. The author, however, did not live to complete this curious and extensive work; no more of it having appeared than the two volumes above mentioned. In 1796, he published a continuation of Henry's History of Britain, in one volume 4to, and two volumes 8vo.\n\nThe other productions of this author are, An Account of Saxon Coins found in Kintbury <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">Church</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-YARD\">yard</a>, Berks, printed in the 7th volume of the Archaeologia; the Account of Shaw, in Mr More's Berkshire collections; The Savages of Europe, a popular French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVEL\">novel</a>, which he translated, and illustrated by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINTS\">prints</a> from his own designs. Mr Andrews was also a frequent contributor to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol10.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">Gentleman</a>'s Magazine. See the Gen. Biog. Dict. by Chalmers; Introduction to \"Poems by the Rev. Thomas Penrose,\" 1781; Gentl. Mag. for 1797 and 1801; and Lysons Supplement to Environs of London, 1811.","sp":620,"ep":630},{"h":"ANEMOMETER","t":"ANEMOSCOPE. See these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol8.html#article-ARTICLES\">Articles</a> in the Encyclopaedia, and Wind-gage in this Supplement.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGLE\">ANGLE</a>. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> is, owing to the poverty of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, employed to signify very different things. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLANE\">Plane</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">Geometry</a>, it means the opening <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> separation of two straight lines which meet in a point; but in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">Solid</a> Geometry, it variously denotes the deviation of a straight line from a plane, the divergencies of one plane from another at their line of junction, or even a cluster of plane <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> terminating in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> summit. This diversified <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> of the same word is not likely, however, among mathematicians, to occasion any misconception. But it would be more perspicuous, and certainly more philosophical, to imitate the practice of naturalists in framing a set of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol7.html#article-COGNATE\">cognate</a> words to express the several transitions of meaning.\n\nThe word angle was drawn from common discourse into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOCABULARY\">vocabulary</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>. Its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIMITIVE\">primitive</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> in all the languages in which it can be traced, is merely a nook or corner; but it has acquired a more precise and extensive application in its transfer to geometry. In its simplest form, it now denotes generally the divergence or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> between two concurring straight lines. Yet a learner still experiences some difficulty in seizing the correct idea of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, which has always baffled the attempts of authors to reduce to the terms of a strict <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a>. Apollonius, at once the most elegant and inventive of the Greek geometers, was satisfied with representing an angle as a collection of space about a point; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> which is not only extremely loose, but which intimates quite a different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a>. Euclid, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> compiler of the Elements, has defined an angle to be the zvavos, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> inclination of two straight lines that meet. But, in strict language, this definition should apply only to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACUTE\">acute</a> angle, in which one of the sides leans towards the other, and deflects from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a>. Without an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of the meaning of the term inclination, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not include the obtuse angle, and far less comprehend angles in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a>; which, since they are capable of repeated additions, must evidently, as much as lines themselves, be susceptible of all degrees of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a>.\nIt is indeed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a>, by any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of words, to express completely and accurately, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIMARY\">primary</a> notions which form the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> of geometrical science. The more profitable task is to trace the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> by which the mind, refining <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>, comes to acquire such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a>.\n\nWe seem to get the idea of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> or of linear extension, by viewing progressive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>; and the enlarged conception of angles or of angular magnitude is easily attained, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a> of revolving motion. In opening, for instance, the legs of a pair of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPASSES\">compasses</a>, we perceive that their difference in direction gradually increases, keeping <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PACE\">pace</a> with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of this opening properly constitutes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of an angle; and an entire revolution, which brings the moving side of the angle back to its first position, furnishes a standard of reference. The revolution bisected, marks the divergence of a directly opposite position, or that of two segments of a straight line at their point of separation; and the half of this again, or the divergence of a line proceeding from the same point, and turned equally aside from both segments, is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> angle, which, therefore, being constant, serves to measure all the rest.\n\nSuppose an inflexible straight line AB to turn from right to left, about the point or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERTEX\">vertex</a> A. It first comes to the position AC, then to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AD\">AD</a>, next to AE, now it reaches AF, and lastly it gains its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> site AB.\n\nThe angles thus formed at the point A, arise from the combination of successive openings. The angle BAD is composed of BAC and CAD, the angle BAE, or that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> opposition, is compounded of BAC, CAD, and DAE, and the entire circuit is made up of the accumulated angle BAC, CAD, DAE, EAF, and FAB. This circuit being quartered by the straight lines BE and DF, is divided at the vertex A into four right angles. By <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a>, therefore, the angle BAC is acute, and CAE obtuse.\n\nBut the side AB can attain the direction AC, either by moving onwards, or by turning backwards through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> F, E, and D. The angle compounded of the openings BAF, FAE, EAD, and DHC, may hence be termed appropriately the reverse of BAC. The defect of an angle from a right angle is called its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPLEMENT\">complement</a>, the defect from two right angles its supplement, and the defect from four right angles or the entire circuit, might be conveniently named its explement. Thus, CAD is the complement of the angle BAC, CAE is its supplement, and the reverse angle BAC its explement.\n\nIf we consider attentively the formation of angles about a point, we shall be convinced that two concurring straight lines do not contain merely a single angle, but involve an indefinite multitude of angles; in short, that they comprehend all the revolutions and parts of a revolution by which the one line would successively attain the direction of the other. Hence AB will, after describing repeated revolutions, always return into the same position AC. Thus, if A represent the measure of an angle, and C that of a whole circuit or four right angles; then the primary angle will include likewise A+C, A+2C, A+3C, A+4C <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> for ever. Of those successive angles, A, A+C, A+2C, A+3C, A+4C, &c. &c., the sines, tangents, and secants, are severally the same; and so are the versed sines, the cosines, cotangents and cosecants. This extension of the doctrine of angles, is of the greatest importance in the higher branches of geometry, in the application of trigonometrical formulae, and in algebraical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a>.\n\nEuclid, in the course of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a>, has frequent occasion to combine angles together; and yet he never ventures beyond the consideration of those angles which are less than two right angles. Had he composed his Elements after the science of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIGONOMETRY\">trigonometry</a> came to be cultivated, he could not have failed to take more enlarged views of angular magnitude. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of his narrow conception of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of angles, the Greek geometer is not a little cramped sometimes, and obliged to adopt a circuitous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a>. For instance, in the 20th prop. of his third book\u2014that \"the angles at the circumference are the halves of those at the centre standing on the same arc,\"\u2014he quite overlooks the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of obtuse angles at the circumference. But, in the annexed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, the angle ABC is clearly the half of the reverse angle AOC at the centre, which is subtended by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> arc AEC. It hence follows that the obtuse angles ABC and ADC contained in the same segment must be equal, since they are both of them halves of the reverse angle AOC. Yet, in demonstrating this very obvious corollary, Euclid is constrained to divide the obtuse angles into portions which are shown to be the halves of corresponding angles at the centre. For the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a>, he finds it necessary to give a distinct demonstration of the celebrated proposition that \"the angle contained in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEMICIRCLE\">semicircle</a> is a right angle.\" But this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> ought likewise to be considered as a simple corollary, for if radii OA and OC were supposed to extend in one straight line, and thus form the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a> of the circle, their angle AOC would become equal to two right angles, and consequently ABC its half would be one right angle.\n\nSee Leslie's Geometry.\n\nANGLE (TRISECTION OF). The attempts of the Greek mathematicians to Double a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUBE\">Cube</a> and to Trisect an Angle, were their first steps beyond the limits\nTrisection of Elementary Geometry. They soon perceived that such problems cannot be solved by any combination of mere straight lines or circles. To this conclusion they were led directly by the application of Geometrical Analysis, a beautiful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> of discovery which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a> had recently invented or improved. Their investigations pointed at some curves of a higher order than the circle, and opened to them a wide and interesting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a> of research.\n\nThe analysis of the trisection of an angle, conducted in two different ways, terminates in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONCHOID\">Conchoid</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPLEX\">complex</a> curve which was first proposed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NICOMEDES\">Nicomedes</a>. As the subject is very curious, and throws great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of angular magnitude, we shall here not only give both the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> methods of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>, but subjoin a third which is due to the sagacity of Newton.\n\n1. Let it be required to trisect the angle BAC or the arc BC. Suppose the thing already done, and the angle BAD to be the third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the given angle. From the point CE draw CE <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to AD, meeting the extended diameter in E, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> the circumference of the circle in the point F; join FD and FA. It is obvious, that the angle BAD is the half of DAC, the remaining part of the whole angle, and therefore, equal to the angle DFC at the circumference. But AD and EC being parallel, the angle BAD is equal to AEF, which is hence equal to DFC; and consequently FD is parallel to EB. Wherefore, the arc BD is equal to GF, and the angle BAD equal to GAF. The angle AEF is thus equal to EAF, and hence the side EF is equal to AF, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RADIUS\">radius</a> of the circle.\n\nTo solve the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a>, therefore, it would be requisite to inflect from C a straight line CFE, such that the portion FE, intercepted between the circumference and the diameter or its extension, should be equal to the radius of the circle. The radius AD, drawn parallel to this inflected line, CE would cut off an angle BAD, which is the third part of the given angle BAC.\n\nBut it is clear, that Elementary Geometry will not furnish the means of inflicting CE, according to the required conditions. This must be done either tentatively, that is, by repeated trials, or by the application of a curve, so constituted, that every straight line drawn from the pole C, to the directrix BG, shall have the portion EF, intercepted by the curve equal to AB. This curve is, from its general shape or resemblance to a couch or shell, named the Conchoid; consists of two branches, one above the directrix called the interior conchoid, and the other below it, called the exterior conchoid. The conchoid Trisecting being described, will, by its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERSECTION\">intersection</a> with the circumference of the circle, give the point F, and consequently the position of trisecting line AD'. But such a complex curve must cut the circumference in more points than one, and consequently the problem of angular trisection, viewed in its generality, admits of several answers. In fact, there are always three distinct positions of the inflected line CE, which will fulfil the conditions of the problem.\n\nIt is curious to examine these different positions of the inflected line. Draw AD' parallel to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> position CE', and join D'E', AD', and AF'. Because AF' is equal to E'F', the angle E'AF' is equal to AE'T'; and, consequently, the exterior angle AFC is the double of either of these. But CAF' being an isosceles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a>, AFC is equal to ACF', which again is equal to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> angle CAD'; wherefore, CAD' is the double of the angle AE'T'; and being likewise the double of CF'D' at the circumference, the angles CF'D' and AE'T' are equal; and, consequently, FD' and EA parallel. Now the angle CAD' being double of E'AF' or D'AG, and the angle CAD double of DAB, the arc DCD' is double of the arcs D'G and DB, which serve to complete the semicircumference; wherefore, this arc DCD' is two-third parts of the semicircumference, or one-third of the whole circumference.\n\nIn the third position AD\" of the trisecting line, draw CE\" parallel to it, and join AF\" and D\"F\". The isosceles triangles D\"AF\" and AF\"E\" have equal vertical angles; and, consequently, the angles at their base are likewise equal; wherefore, AF\"D\" is equal to the alternate angle F\"AE\", and the chord D\"F\" parallel to the diameter BG. But the reverse angle CAD\", standing on the arc CD\"D\", is double of the angle CF\"D\" at the circumference, and, therefore, double of BE\"F\" or of BAD\"; and the angle CAD being, by the first construction, likewise double of BAD, the reverse angle CAD\", together with CAD, must be double of BAD\" and BAD, or the arc CD\"GD\" is double of DBD\", which completes the circumference. Hence the arc DD\"D\" is two-thirds of the circumference.\n\nIt thus appears that the construction of the problem assumes three different aspects, and that the trisecting lines, to which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> conducts us, mutually divide the whole circuit into equal portions. These results are perfectly conformable with the theory of angular magnitude. For if A denote the arc BC; and C the whole circumference, this arc\nTrisection will be generally expressed by \\( A, A + C, A + 2C \\), etc.; consequently, the third part will be expressed by \\( \\frac{1}{3}A, \\frac{1}{3}A + \\frac{1}{3}C, \\frac{1}{3}A + \\frac{2}{3}C \\), etc., which evidently correspond to BD, BD', and BD''. But any farther extension of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROGRESSION\">progression</a> only brings the trisecting line back into its former positions.\n\nTo solve completely, therefore, the problem of the trisection of an angle, from the pole C, on either side of the directrix BG, with a measure equal to the radius of the circle, describe the exterior and the interior or nodated conchoid; draw CF, CF' and CF'' to the three points of intersection with the circumference, and the radii AD, AD', and AD'', parallel to these will mark the triple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> of the angle BAC.\n\nIt may be perceived that the exterior branch of the conchoid cuts the under semicircle in another point besides F. This occurs in the extension of the radius CA, or where the diameter, passing through C, the extremity of the original arc, meets the opposite circumference; the portion of the inflected line, intercepted below BG by the conchoid, being evidently equal to the radius. The fourth intersection, however, affords no real solution, but only exhibits the amount of repeated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a>, as completing the arc itself.\n\n2. But another analysis leads to a similar result. Let the angle BAD as before be third part of BAC; draw BC perpendicular to AB and CE parallel to it, meeting AD produced in E. The right angle DCE would be contained in a semicircle having DE for its diameter; join C with the centre H, and the triangle CHE being isosceles, the exterior angle CHA is double of CEH, or of the alternate angle BAD; and, therefore, equal to the remaining portion CAD of the divided angle BAC. Whence the triangle ACH is isosceles, and the side CH equal to HC, or the diameter DE must be double of AC.\n\nThe construction of the problem is thus reduced to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> from the vertex to the given angle, a straight line, ADE, such that the part DE intercepted between the perpendiculars BC and CE, shall be equal to the double of AC. This can only be done by describing a conchoid from the pole A to the directrix BC, and with the double of AC as the measure; the intersection of the curve with the perpendicular CE, will determine the position of the trisecting line ADE. The exterior branch of the conchoid will cut the perpendicular in the point E, and the interior or nodated branch will meet and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> it at the two points E' and E''. The radiating lines AE, AE', and AE'', or its extension Ae'', will indicate the complete trisection of the angle BAC. These lines will be found, as in the first construction, to make angles with each other that are equal to the thirds of an entire circuit. It may be worth while to examine the several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>.\n\nIn the second position D'AE' of the trisecting line, draw CH' to the middle point. Because the triangle E'H'C is isosceles, its exterior angle CH'A is double of CE'H', or of the angle BAD'; but H'CA being also an isosceles triangle, CH'A is equal to CAH, and consequently double of BAD. Add CAD, which is double of BAD, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> angle DAE' is double of DAD', which would complete two right angles; whence DAE' is two-thirds of two right angles, or one-third of a whole circuit.\n\nIn the third position, AE''D'' of the trisecting line, or rather its extension Ae'', draw CH'' to bisect E'D''. The triangles CH''D and ACH'' are then isosceles, and consequently the angle CAD'' or CH''A is double of CD''A; but CAE is likewise double of CEA, and therefore the combined angle D''HE is double of the angles CD''A and CEA. Now this angle D''HE, together with the two angles CD''A and CEH, is evidently equal to the exterior angle DC'E or a right angle. Whence D''AE is two-thirds of a right angle, or one-third of two right angles, and therefore the adjacent angle DAE'' is two-thirds of two right angles, or one-third of a whole circuit.\n\n3. The simplest and most elegant solution of the trisection of an arc is due to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> science, and first appeared in Newton's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">Universal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ARITHMETIC\">Arithmetic</a>.\nThe problem is there reduced to the combination of the circle with a certain kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPERBOLA\">hyperbola</a>. But the general property of the directrix, which belongs to all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONIC_SECTIONS\">conic sections</a>, or the lines of the second order, affords the readiest mode of investigation. Let the arc BD be the third part of BDC. Complete the circle, and draw the chords BD, BC, and CD. The arc CD is evidently double of BD, and therefore, the angle CBD is double of BCD. Bisect the angle CKD, by the straight line BH, let <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> the extended perpendicular, and draw the parallel DK. The triangle CHB is evidently isosceles, and HI bisects the base CB. But the triangle HBD having its vertical angle at B bisected, the side CB is to BD, as the segment CH of the base to HD, that is, since the triangles CHI and DHK are similar as CI to KD; wherefore CB being the double of CI, BD is likewise double of DK. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a> of the distances BD and DK is thus given, while the point B is given, and the straight line IH given in position. Whence, from the theory of Lines of the Second Order, the locus of the point of section D is an hyperbola, of which B is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FOCUS\">focus</a>, and IH a directrix, with the determining ratio of two to one. Let this construction be made, and the arc CDB, is trisected in D. For since BD is, from the property of the curve, double of DK, it is evident that BC is to CI as BD to DK; and the triangles CHI and KBH being similar, and CI to CH, as DK to DH, it follows that BC is to CH as BD to DH, or alternately BC is to BD as CH to DK. Wherefore the vertical angle CBD is bisected by BH, or the angle CBD is double of CBH or of BCD; and consequently the arc CD is double of BD, or BD itself is the third part of the whole arc CDB.\n\nBut the opposite branch of the hyperbola, which passes through C, also comes into play; and the intersection of these two branches with the circle, assigns three different positions of the point D, separated from each other by intervals equal to the third of the whole circumference. Thus, in the second position D', produce the perpendicular DK' to the opposite circumference L; and since BD' is double of D'K, it must be equal to the chord DL, and consequently the arc BD'CD' is equal to D'MD'. Wherefore the double of BD'CD', together with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> BL or CD, is equal to the whole circumference; that is, the double of DCD' with the double of BD and CB' is equal to the whole circumference; and since the double of BD is DC, the triple of the arc DCD' must complete the circumference. In the third position D\", produce the perpendicular DK\" as before; the double of this or the chord BD\" is hence equal to D\"M, and the arc BLD\" equal to DM. Consequently the double of BLD\", with the compound arc, BDCM completes the circumference; but D\"M, being parallel to BC, the arc BLD\" is equal to CD'M, and therefore three times the arc BLD\" with the arc BDC, or the triple of BD will fill up the circumference, or the arc BD\"D\" is a third part of it.\n\nThe trisection of innumerable arcs described on the same chord is rendered very conspicuous, by combining the separate branches of two hyperbolas that have the determining ratio of two to one, and their foci situate in the extremities of the given line. Thus, let the chord BC be trisected at the points N and O, and from B and C, as distinct foci, and in the determining ratio of two to one, describe branches of independent hyperbolas. All the arcs erected on BC, are each of them divided by those curves into three equal portions. These arcs, as they flatten, approach to the trisected chord CNOB, on the one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>; and as they become enlarged, they constantly tend, on the other, to the complete circumference which the asymptotes of the hyperbola, making angles on each side of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol3.html#article-AXIS\">axis</a> equal to two-thirds of a right angle, would themselves trisect.\n\nIt may be observed in general, that the section of an arc or angle admits of as many different answers as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of divisions proposed. Thus, the quadrisection would give four distinct results, and a quinsection would involve no fewer than five separate products. Nay, the bisection itself of an arc, though within the limits of the most elementary geometry, yet brings out a double result. Thus, the arc CDB is bisected by perpendicular or diameter DID', which not only gives BD for the half of that arc, but also BD'CD', or the same half arc augmented by a semicircumference.\n\nThese conclusions agree with the results derived from the general theory of functions. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> for the sine of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MULTIPLE\">multiple</a> arc, is always an equation of corresponding dimensions; which therefore admits of as many distinct roots as the index contains units.","sp":630,"ep":634},{"h":"ANGLESEY","t":"the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONA\">Mona</a> of Tacitus, and Tir-mon of the Welsh, is of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> form; and indented <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> three of its sides with numerous small bays and creeks; its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> from Carnets point to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANGOR\">Bangor</a> ferry is 20 miles, and its greatest breadth from Llanddwyn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABBEY\">Abbey</a> to Penmon Priory, 17 miles: its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol2.html#article-AREA\">area</a>, by the most recent and accurate survey, comprises 173,000 acres.

There is undoubted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> of the encroachment of the sea on the shore of this Island: the Lavan sands, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BAY\">bay</a> of Beaumaris, formed a habitable Hundred in the sixth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, when they were suddenly overwhelmed by the sea. There are five ferries across the Menai Straits, of which Port-hamel, or the Gloomy ferry (so called from the dense woods which in former times overshadowed its banks), is celebrated as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, where Suetonius landed, when he exterminated the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRUIDS\">Druids</a>. Off the eastern point is the steep, rocky islet of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIEST\">Priest</a>-holme, or Puffin's island: it is a noted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a>, during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, of various birds of passage; the Puffin, whence it derives one of its appellations, breeds there in immense numbers. At the northern point of Anglesey, is the isle of Seals; its sides are frequented by vast shoals of fish, and Seals which prey upon them.\n\nAnglesey is rich in minerals, particularly in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>. Of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> of this metal in the Parys mountain, a particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> is given in the body of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, on the authority of Mr Pennant; since that account was written, the produce of these mines has declined considerably; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of men employed having been reduced, from 1500 to 600.

Hitherto, coal has not been wrought with any profit, though the depth of coal, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to the whole depth sunk, appears favourable, being $3\\frac{1}{2}$ feet in 77 feet. An uncommon appearance in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of this fossil is met with in Anglesey, viz. podicles of loose coal of several tons <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>. This Island is celebrated for the variety of its shell-fish; Bingley, in his tour, gives a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of thirty-eight of the principal of these productions; the oysters in particular are highly Anglesey esteemed. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTANY\">botany</a> of Anglesey presents nothing very peculiar or remarkable.\n\nOf the 173,000 acres contained in Anglesey, it is computed that there are 12,600 acres of waste land; and that no more than the eleventh part of the remainder is under tillage, in the following proportions: oats 7953 acres; barley 6107; wheat 520; rye 2. In the *Encyclopedia*, apparently on the authority of the anonymous author of the supplement to Rowland's *Mona Antiqua*, it is stated, that in 1770, upwards of 90,000 bushels of corn were exported, exclusive of wheat. This must be incorrect, as the whole produce of the Island, in the year 1795, taken by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> survey, did not exceed 59,770 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>: viz. oats 35,485; barley 22,700; wheat 1578; and rye 7 quarters. The Cattle of Anglesey are of a good breed; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> is paid to them; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> annual export is about 8000 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, from one to four years old. The Anglesey breed of sheep is the largest in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">North</a> Wales; averaging about 15 lbs. the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>, and yielding from $1\\frac{1}{2}$ to $2\\frac{1}{2}$ lbs. of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a>: the annual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPORTATION\">exportation</a> of sheep varies from 5000 to 7000; nearly the same number of hogs are exported.\n\nThe inhabitants of Anglesey manufacture deep-coloured blue cloth, flannels, blankets, &c. for home use, but none for exportation. In Newborough there is a manufacture of mats and ropes, made of the sea <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REED\">reed</a>-grass, which binds together the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a> hills on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a>.\n\nThe antiquities of this Island are sufficiently illustrated in the body of the work. A rural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIPE\">pipe</a>, used by the Shepherd, called the Pibgorn, is said to be almost peculiar to it; it derives its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> from its extremities being tipped with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HORN\">horn</a>; it has seven holes, besides the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APERTURE\">aperture</a> in which the reed is concealed; and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TONE\">tone</a> is between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLUTE\">flute</a> and the clarionet.\n\nFrom the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> returns of 1801, it appears that there were then in Anglesey 6679 houses, inhabited by 7058 families; and 127 uninhabited houses: 9776 persons chiefly employed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>: 2614 in manufactures and trade; and 19,228 not comprised in these two classes: the number of males was 15,775; and of females 18,031. By the returns in 1811, there were 7183 houses, inhabited by 7706 families; 72 houses <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>; 108 uninhabited; 5376 families chiefly employed in agriculture; 1453 in manufactures; and 877 not comprised in these two classes: the number of males was 17,444; and of females 19,601. It <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be remarked, that, according to both returns, the number of females exceeds that of males; this disproportion is not, however, peculiar to Anglesey, but extends over all Wales.\n\nThe reader, who is desirous of farther <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a>, in regard to this Island, may consult Davie's *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">General</a> View of the Agriculture of North Wales*\u2014Bingley's *Tour in North Wales*\u2014Aiken's *Tour in Wales*.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANNEALING\">ANNEALING</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> and use of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> in Glass-making, has been already explained in\nAnnealing the body of the work; it remains to add some details in regard to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-METALS\">metals</a>. In the manufactures, in which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALLEABLE\">malleable</a> metals are employed, annealing is used to soften a metal after it has been rendered hard by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAMMER\">hammer</a>, and also to soften <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, which is rendered very hard and brittle by rapid cooling.\n\nIn the manufacture of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a> goods, which are first formed by the hammer, and require to be filed or otherwise treated, and in which softness and flexibility are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> to the change, annealing is absolutely necessary. This is particularly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> in making files and scissors; that the metal may be left sufficiently soft for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>, and for filing off those parts which cannot be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>. Annealing is not less necessary in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> of wire, whether iron, copper, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a>, silver, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>. The operation of drawing soon gives the wire a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTICITY\">elasticity</a>, which, if not removed from time to time by annealing, would prevent the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of the wire, and render it extremely brittle. The same operation is also necessary in rolling or flattening those metals which are in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> state, such as brass, silver, gold, &c. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRAZIER\">Brazier</a> who forms vessels of copper and brass by the hammer, can work upon it only for a little time, before he is obliged to anneal it.\n\nThe common methods employed for annealing iron and steel are very injudicious, and materially injure the latter, when it is used for making cutting instruments. After they have been formed by the hammer, they are generally piled up in an open fire, slowly raised to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, and then allowed to gradually cool. By this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a>, the surface of the steel will be found considerably scaled, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OXYGEN\">oxygen</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>. When it is remembered, that steel consists of iron joined to carbon, it will be evident, that the steel immediately under the scaly oxid will be deprived of its carbon, which has been carried off by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> of the oxygen; and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, will lose the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>, of acquiring that degree of hardness necessary to a cutting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a>.\n\nNothing, therefore, can be more obvious, than that steel particularly should be annealed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> vessels, to prevent that effect. For this purpose, the goods should be placed in a trough or recess made of fire-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, or fire-brick, and stratified with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASHES\">ashes</a>, or clean <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>, and finally covered with a thick stratum of the same; but if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> of the vessel be small, it may have a cover of its own materials. This oven or trough must now be heated by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FURNACE\">furnace</a> passing under and round it till the whole is of a red heat. It must then be suffered to cool, without letting in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>. The goods so treated, will be much softer than by the common method. The surface, instead of becoming scaled, will have acquired a metallic whiteness, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a> of a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of carbonaceous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> contained in the ashes in which they were imbedded. They will become so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEXIBLE\">flexible</a> also, as to allow them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BEND\">bend</a> considerably without breaking, which is very far from being the case before the operation. The fracture, before annealing, will be smooth and short; but afterwards it will be rough, exhibiting bright parts of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-CRYSTALLINE\">crystalline</a> appearance. Wire, especially that of iron and steel, should be treated in a similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>, when it is annealed. The wire used for some purposes, requires to be soft, and is sold in that state. If the wire after finishing, when it is bright and clean, were to be annealed in contact with oxygen, it would not only lose all its lustre and smoothness, but much of its tenacity. The process above-mentioned will therefore be particularly necessary in annealing finished wire, as well as in softening it from time to time during the drawing.\n\nCopper and brass suffer much less than iron and steel from annealing in the open air, and do not require to be heated above a low red heat. If, however, the lustre is to be preserved, a close vessel would be desirable. The latter metals, after annealing, although much discoloured by the oxygen of the atmosphere, may be cleansed, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMMERSION\">immersion</a> in a hot liquor composed of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> and a small quantity of sulphuric or nitric acid. Very small brass or copper wire is frequently annealed, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> it to the flame of hay or straw. In casting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> pieces of pig-iron, which is generally done in wet sand, the metal possesses the property of steel to such a degree, as to assume, by the rapid cooling, a degree of hardness equal to hardened steel; at the same time, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol8.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> are so brittle as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> by falling on the ground. When, however, these goods are treated in the way above directed, they acquire a degree of softness which renders them penetrable by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FILE\">file</a>, and at the same time capable of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENDING\">bending</a>. In this state, they are much less tenacious than steel, but still so much so, as to have been sold in the form of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUTLERY\">cutlery</a> for steel.\n\nThe change which metals undergo by annealing, is not yet thoroughly understood. Most of the malleable metals are susceptible of two distinct forms, one called the crystalline form, which they assume by slow cooling; and the other, the fibrous, which is acquired by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAMMERING\">hammering</a> or rolling. When this, however, is carried beyond a certain point, the metal becomes so hard, that it is not capable of being bent far without breaking. All the malleable metals in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INGOT\">ingot</a> or in their cast state are brittle, and exhibit a crystalline fracture. By hammering or rolling, they become more tenacious, and break with difficulty, exhibiting what is called a fibrous fracture. At the same time, they become stiffer and more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a>. They lose the latter properties by annealing, but become more malleable. If the annealing, however, be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>, the malleability diminishes, and they again have a crystalline fracture. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZINC\">Zinc</a> by wire-drawing becomes very flexible, and possesses a degree of tenacity not inferior to that of copper. But, if it be kept in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> water for a length of time, it will resume its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> brittleness, and show a crystalline appearance when broken. This proves that the particles of metals can change their arrangement, without losing their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> form\u2014which is still more strongly confirmed by the fact, that brass wire loses its tenacity by exposure to the fumes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a>, and even by the presence of a damp atmosphere.

The earliest mathematical publication <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> Probabilities, the little tract of Huygens, De ratiociniis in ludo aleae, appeared in 1658; and in 1671, his celebrated countryman, John De Witt, published a treatise on Life-annuities, in Dutch. (Montucla, Hist. des Math. Tom. III. p. 407.) This, however, appears to have been very little-known, or read, and to have had no sensible influence on the subsequent progress of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>; the origin of which may be properly dated from the publication of Dr Halley's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> on the subject, in the Philosophical Transactions for the year 1693 (No. 196.) That celebrated Mathematician there first gave a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> of mortality, which he had constructed from observations made at Breslaw, and showed how the probabilities of life and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, and the values of annuities and assurances on lives, might be determined by such tables; which, he informs us, had, till then, been only done by an imaginary valuation. Besides his algebraical reasonings, he illustrated the subject by the properties of parallelograms, and parallelopipeds; there are, perhaps, no other mathematical inquiries, in the prosecution of which, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALGEBRA\">algebra</a> is entitled to so decided a preference to the elementary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">geometry</a> as in these, and this example of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> of geometry has not been followed by any of the succeeding writers.\n\nIn the year 1724, Mr De Moivre published the first edition of his tract, entitled, Annuities on Lives. In order to shorten the calculation of the values of such annuities, he assumed the annual decrements of life to be equal; that is, that out of a given <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of persons living at any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, an equal number dies every year until they are all extinct; and, upon that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>, he gave a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEOREM\">theorem</a>, by which the values of annuities on single lives might be easily determined: this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROXIMATION\">approximation</a>, when the utmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIMIT\">limit</a> of life was supposed to be 86 years, agreed very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> with the true values between 30 and 70 years of age, as deduced from Dr Halley's table, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> was of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> use at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>; as no tables of the true values of annuities had then been calculated, except a very contracted one inserted by Dr Halley in the paper mentioned above. But, upon the whole, this hypothesis of De Moivre has probably contributed to retard the progress of the science, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> the attention of Mathematicians from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> of the true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of mortality, and the best methods of constructing tables of the real values of annuities.\n\nThe same distinguished Analyst also endeavoured to approximate the values of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> lives; but it has since been found, that the formulae he gave for that purpose are too incorrect for use. Mr Thomas Simpson published his Doctrine of Annuities and Reversions in the year 1742, in which the subject is treated in a manner much more general and perspicuous than it had been previously; his formulae are adapted to any table of mortality, and, in the 7th corollary to his first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a>, he gave the theorem demonstrated in the 149th number of this article, to which we owe all the best tables of the values of life-annuities that have since been published.\n\nIn the same work, he also gave a table of mortality deduced from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> observations, and four others calculated from it, of the values of annuities on lives, each at three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATES\">rates</a> of interest; the first for single lives, the three others for two and three equal joint lives, and for the longest of two or of three lives.\n\nThese were the first tables of the values of joint lives that had been calculated; for although Dr Halley had shown, half a century before, how such tables might be computed, and had taken considerable pains to facilitate the work; the necessary calculations, by the known methods, previous to the publication of Mr Simpson's Treatise, were so very labo-\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a>, rious, that no one had had the courage to undertake them. And, unfortunately, the mortality, according to the London table, was so much above the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a>, that the values of annuities in Mr Simpson's tables were much too small for general use.\n\nIn the year 1746, M. Deparcieux published his Essai sur les probabilit\u00e9s de la dur\u00e9e de la vie humaine, in which he gave several valuable tables of mortality deduced from the mortuary registers of different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> houses, and from the lists of the Nominees in the French Tontines; also a table of the values of annuities on single lives, at three rates of interest, calculated from his table of mortality for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TONTINE\">tontine</a> annuitants. These tables were a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACQUISITION\">acquisition</a> to the science, as, before their publication, there were only two extant that gave tolerably exact representations of the true law of mortality:\u2014Dr Halley's for Breslaw, and one constructed but a short time before by M. Kerseboom, principally from registers of Dutch annuitants. Those of M. Deparcieux for the Monks and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol16.html#article-NUNS\">Nuns</a>, were the first ever constructed for the two sexes separately; and by them, the greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONGEVITY\">longevity</a> of females was made evident.\n\nThe work commences with an algebraical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of Annuities-certain; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSAY\">essay</a>, On the Probabilities of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">Duration</a> of Human Life, is perfectly intelligible to those who have not studied Mathematics; it is written with great judgment and perspicuity, but contains very little more than the explanation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of his tables, some of which relate to Tontines; and he did not avail himself to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> he might have done, of the excellent tract of Thomas Simpson.\n\nThis work, however, appears to have been more read upon the Continent, and to have contributed more to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFUSION\">diffusion</a> of this kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> there, than all the other writings on the subject. The article Rentes viag\u00e8res in the Encyclop\u00e9die, is acknowledged to have been taken entirely from it, as was also the article Vie, dur\u00e9e de la; and these are proofs, among many others that might be produced, how little M. D'Alembert and the principal Mathematicians, his contemporaries, attended to the subject.\n\nIn the year 1752, Mr. Simpson published, in his Select Exercises, a supplement to his Doctrine of Annuities; wherein he gave new tables of the values of annuities on two joint lives, and on the survivor of two lives, much more copious than those he had inserted in the principal work; but these also were calculated from his London table of mortality.\n\nThe celebrated Euler, in a paper inserted in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> Academy of Sciences at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BERLIN\">Berlin</a> for the year 1760, gave a formula by which the value of an annuity on a single life of any age, may be derived from that of an annuity on a life one year older; which formula was included in that given by Mr Simpson eighteen years before, for effecting the same purpose in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of any number of joint lives; and by this compendious method, M. Euler calculated a table of the values of single lives from M. Kerseboom's table of mortality.\n\nThe first edition of Dr Price's Observations on Reversionary Payments was published in 1769; and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> was, to give information to persons desirous of forming themselves into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a> for the purpose of making provision for themselves in old age, or for their widows. When tables of the values of single lives, and of two joint lives are given, the methods of determining the terms on which such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> can be made with safety to all the parties concerned, are very simple, and were, at that time, well understood in theory, by the Mathematicians who had studied the subject; but, for want of the requisite tables, the algebraical formul\u00e6 had, till then, been of little practical utility.\n\nIn the prosecution of this laudable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>, Dr Price was obliged to have recourse to approximations. He informs us, that by following M. De Moivre too implicitly in his rules for determining the value of two joint lives, he was led into difficulties which convinced him that they were not only useless, but dangerous; he therefore calculated a table of these values upon M. De Moivre's hypothesis of the decrements of life being equal, and its utmost limit 86 years, from a correct formula given by Mr Simpson in his Doctrine of Annuities (Cor. 5, Prob. I); by this, and a table of the values of single lives, calculated by Mr Dodson on M. De Moivre's hypothesis, he was enabled to give answers tolerably near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, to some of the most interesting questions of this kind, and to show that the plans of several of the societies then recently established, were quite inadequate; and instead of the benefits they promised, could only, in the end, produce disappointment and distress, unless they either dissolved or reformed themselves.\n\nThe work also contained instructive dissertations on the probabilities and expectations of life, and on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> duration of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> and of widowhood; besides accounts of some of the principal societies which had then been formed for the benefit of old age, and of widows; with observations on the method of forming tables of mortality for towns, and two new tables of that kind, constructed from registers kept at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORWICH\">Norwich</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTHAMPTON\">Northampton</a>. Mr Morgan's Doctrine of Annuities and Assurances was published in 1779, containing tables of the values of single lives, of two equal joint lives, and of two lives differing in age by 60 years, calculated from the Northampton table of mortality. And in the same year, M. De Saint-Cyran published his Calcul des Rentes viag\u00e8res sur une et sur plusieurs t\u00eates, wherein the valuation of annuities on lives is treated algebraically, but in a manner much inferior in all respects to that of Mr Simpson; and six tables are given of the values of annuities,\u2014on single lives, on the survivor of two lives, and on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> survivor of three, calculated from M. Kerseboom's table of mortality. Although the values in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> of two, and of three lives, were only determined by approximation, these tables were, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> then, a valuable acquisition to the science; but their use was entirely superseded only four years after, by the publication of others much more valuable.\n\nThe fourth edition of Dr Price's Observations on Reversionary Payments appeared in 1783. One of the best effects of the preceding editions on the pro-\ngress of the science, had been, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> the public attention to these inquiries, by showing their important uses in the affairs of life; and to procure the requisite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATA\">data</a> for forming tables of mortality, that should illustrate the laws according to which human life wastes under different circumstances, by exciting the curiosity of intelligent men who had the necessary leisure and means of information. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> author had, accordingly, been furnished with the necessary abstracts of mortuary registers which had been kept with these views, by Dr Haygarth at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHESTER\">Chester</a>, Dr Aikin at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WARRINGTON\">Warrington</a>, and the Rev. Mr Gor- such at Holy-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CROSS\">Cross</a>, near Shrewsbury, since the publication of the first edition; also by Mr Wargentin, with the mean numbers both of the living, and the annual deaths in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINLAND\">Finland</a>, for twenty-one successive years, in all of which the sexes were distinguished; and from these data, he constructed tables of mortality that threw great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> on the subject. He also inserted in this edition, an improved table of mortality for Northampton; and, what had been so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> wanted, a complete set of tables of the values of annuities on single lives, at six rates of interest, and on two joint lives at four, all calculated from the new Northampton table. The combinations of joint lives were sufficiently numerous to admit of all the values not included being easily interpolated. Besides these, he also gave tables of the values of annuities on single lives from the Swedish observations, both with and without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> of the sexes, and on two joint lives without that distinction.\n\nThe values given in these tables are too low for the general average of lives, at all ages under 60; but in the treatise of Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARON\">Baron</a> Masceres on the Principles of the Doctrine of Life-Annuities, which was published in the same year (1783), others were given, calculated from the table of mortality which M. Deparcieux constructed from the lists of the Nomines in the French Tontines. The tables for single lives are calculated at twelve different rates of interest from 2 to 10 per cent.; but those for joint lives, only at 3\u00bd and 4\u00bd per cent.; and the combinations they include are only those of ages that are equal, or that differ by 5 or 10 years, and the multiples of 10.\n\nThere is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> to believe that the values in these tables, at all ages under 75 or 80 years, are nearer the truth, for the average of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, than any others then extant; but certainly for the average of lives on which annuities and reversions depend. After that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of life, however, they are too small; and, in most cases, it is difficult to derive the values of joint lives from them with sufficient accuracy, on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of the contracted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a> they have been calculated upon.\n\nIt was not Dr Price's object to deliver the elements of the science systematically; but he treated most parts of it with great judgment, enriched it with a vast collection of valuable facts and observations, and corrected several errors into which some of the most eminent writers upon it had fallen. The mathematical demonstrations (which are given in the notes) are much inferior to the rest of the work.\n\nThe values of reversionary sums and annuities, which depend upon some of the lives involved failing according to assigned orders of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRECEDENCE\">precedence</a>, had been approximated by Mr Simpson in his Select Exercises; and by Mr Morgan in his Doctrine of Annuities; but the latter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol10.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> first gave accurate solutions of problems of this kind, in the Philosophical Transactions for the years 1788, 1789, 1791, 1794, and 1800.\n\nExcept by the solution of these problems, the science had not been materially advanced, during a period of more than thirty years that had elapsed since the appearance of the fourth edition of Dr Price's work, when Mr Milne published his Treatise on the Valuation of Annuities and Assurances, on Lives and Survivorships, in the beginning of last year (1815).\n\nThe work consists of two volumes; the first is mathematical, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> entirely popular, except the notes, and a few of the tables. The algebraical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of this article is merely a short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> of the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a>, and may serve as a specimen of the manner in which the subject has been treated there; but the construction of tables of mortality, which forms the subject of the third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a>, has not been noticed here; neither is the valuation of reversionary sums or annuities depending upon assigned orders of survivorship, treated in the present article; and these are parts of the work, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not be found the least interesting to mathematicians.\n\nThe second volume contains upwards of fifty new tables, with a few others that had been published before, but have been reprinted either on account of their value, or scarcity, or both. Four of the new ones are tables of mortality constructed by the author, from registers kept at Carlisle and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONTPELLIER\">Montpellier</a>, and in all Sweden and Finland; since the period of the observations Dr Price made use of; the sexes are distinguished in the tables for Sweden and Montpellier, but not in that for Carlisle. This last is the only table, besides those for Sweden and Finland, that has been formed from the necessary data,\u2014enumerations of the living, as well as registers of the deaths in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> of age.\n\nTwenty-one of these tables, being the seventeenth to the thirty-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEVENTH\">seventh</a> inclusive, in the collection at the end of the work, render it easy to apply the algebraical formulae to practical purposes, and numerous examples of such applications are given. They have all been calculated from the Carlisle table of mortality; those of the values of life-annuities on the same extensive scale, with those which Dr Price derived from the Northampton table. It is the author's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> that the values of interests dependent upon the continuance or the failure of life, may be derived from them more correctly than from any others extant; and he has taken considerable pains to assist his readers in judging of this for themselves.\n\nBesides the tables, the principal contents of the second volume, are explanations of their construction and uses; many of them relate to the progress of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a>,\u2014the comparative mortality of different diseases\u2014of different seasons,\u2014and of the two sexes at every age\u2014the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> of the sexes at birth\u2014and that of the born alive to the still-born of each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEX\">sex</a>.\nIt will be found that the author has been furnished with facts and observations of great value, and that he has endeavoured to present the information they afford, in the forms best calculated for the further prosecution of these inquiries.\n\nIn treating of annuities, we think that it may be useful in a work of this kind, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> ourselves as well to those readers who have not, as to those who have, an acquaintance with Algebra; and we shall, accordingly, divide what follows into two Parts, corresponding to these two views of the subject.\n\nPART I.\n\nWe shall, in this Part, demonstrate all that is most useful and important in the doctrine of Annuities and Assurances on lives, without using Algebra, or introducing the idea of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>; but the reader is, of course, supposed to understand common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ARITHMETIC\">Arithmetic</a>. In the first 30 numbers of this Part, Compound Interest and Annuities-certain are treated of; from the 31st to the 76th, the doctrine of Annuities on Lives is delivered; and that of Assurances on Lives, from thence to the 108th, where the popular view terminates.\n\nWhat is demonstrated in this Part, will be sufficient to give the reader clear and scientific views of the subjects treated; and, with the assistance of the necessary tables, will enable him to solve the more common and simple problems respecting the values of Annuities and Assurances. He will also understand clearly the general principles on which problems of greater difficulty are resolved; but these he cannot undertake with propriety, when the object is, to make a fair valuation of any claims or interests, with a view to an equitable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>, unless he has studied the subject carefully, with the assistance of Algebra; for intricate problems of this kind can hardly be solved without it; and those who are not much exercised in such inquiries, often think they have arrived at a complete solution, when they have overlooked some circumstance or event, or some possible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of events or circumstances, which materially affect the value sought. Eminent Mathematicians have, in this way, fallen into considerable errors, and it can hardly be doubted, that those who are not mathematicians, must (ceteris paribus) be more liable to them.\n\nI. ON ANNUITIES-CERTAIN.\n\nNo. 1. When the rate is 5 per cent., L.1 improved at simple interest during one year, will amount to L.1\u00b705; which, improved in the same manner during the second year, will be augmented in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a> of 1 to 1\u00b705; the amount then, will therefore be $1 \\times 1\\cdot05$, or $(1\\cdot05)^2 = 1\\cdot1025$.\n\nIn the same manner it appears, that this last amount, improved at interest during the third year, will be increased to $(1\\cdot05)^3 = 1\\cdot157625$; at the end of the fourth year, it will be $(1\\cdot05)^4$; at the end of the fifth $(1\\cdot05)^5$, and so on; the amount at the end of any number of years being always determined, by raising the number which expresses the amount at the end of the first year, to the power of which the exponent is the number of years. So that when the rate of interest is 5 per cent., L.1 improved at compound interest, will, in seven years, amount to $(1\\cdot05)^7$, and in 21 years, to $(1\\cdot05)^{21}$.\n\nBut if the rate of interest were only 3 per cent., these amounts would only be $(1\\cdot03)^7$, and $(1\\cdot03)^{21}$ respectively.\n\n2. The present value of L.1 to be received certainly at the end of any assigned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a>, is such a less sum, as, being improved at compound interest during the term, will just amount to one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POUND\">pound</a>. It must therefore be less than L.1, in the same ratio as L.1 is less than its amount in that time; but in three years, at 5 per cent., L.1 will amount to $(1\\cdot05)^3$.\n\nAnd $(1\\cdot05)^3 : 1 :: 1 : \\frac{1}{(1\\cdot05)^3}$, so that $\\frac{1}{(1\\cdot05)^3} = \\frac{1}{1\\cdot157625} = 0\\cdot863838$ is the present value of L.1 to be received at the expiration of three years.\n\nIn the same manner it appears that, at 4 per cent. interest, the present value of L.1 to be received at the end of a year, is $\\frac{1}{1\\cdot04} = 0\\cdot961538$; and if it were not to be received until the expiration of 21 years, its present value would be $\\frac{1}{(1\\cdot04)^{21}} = (0\\cdot961538)^{21} = 0\\cdot438834$.\n\nHence it appears, that if unity be divided by the amount of L.1, improved at compound interest during any number of years, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUOTIENT\">quotient</a> will be the present value of L.1 to be received at the expiration of the term: which may also be obtained by raising the number which expresses the present value of L.1 receivable at the expiration of a year, to the power of which the exponent is the number of years in the term.\n\n3. When a certain sum of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> is receivable annually, it is called an Annuity, and its quantum is expressed by saying it is an annuity of so much; thus, according as the annual payment is L.1, L.10, or L.100; it is called an annuity of L.1, of L.10, or of L.100.\n\n4. When the annual payment does not depend upon any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINGENT\">contingent</a> event, but is to be made certainly, either in perpetuity or during an assigned term, it is called an Annuity-certain.\n\n5. In calculating the value of an annuity, the first payment is always considered to be made at the end of the first year from the time of the valuation, unless the contrary be expressly stated.\n\n6. The whole number, and part or parts of one annual payment of an annuity, which all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> payments are worth in present money, is called the number of years purchase the annuity is worth; and,\nbeing the sum of the present values of all the future payments, is also the sum which, being put out and improved at compound interest, will just suffice for the payment of the annuity (2).\n\n7. Hence it follows, that when the annuity is L.1, the number of years purchase and parts of a year, is the same as the number of pounds and parts of a pound in its present value.\n\nAnd throughout this article, whenever the quantum of an annuity is not mentioned, it is to be understood to be L.1.\n\n8. The sum of which the simple interest for one year is L.1, is evidently that which, being put out at interest, will just suffice for the payment of L.1 at the end of every year, without any augmentation or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIMINUTION\">diminution</a> of the principal; and, being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> to L.1 per annum for ever, is called the value of the perpetuity, or the number of years purchase the perpetuity is worth.\n\nBut, while the rate remains the same, the annual interests produced by any two sums, are to each other as the principals which produce them; therefore, since $5 : 1 :: 100 : \\frac{100}{5} = 20$, when the rate of interest is 5 per cent., the value of the perpetuity is 20 years purchase. In the same manner it appears, that according as the rate may be 3 or 6 per cent., the value of the perpetuity will be $\\frac{100}{3} = 33\\frac{1}{3}$, or $\\frac{100}{6} = 16\\frac{2}{3}$ years purchase; and may be found in every case, by dividing any sum by its interest for a year.\n\n9. All the most common and useful questions in the doctrines of compound interest and annuities certain, may be easily resolved by means of the first four tables at the end of this article. Their construction may be explained by the following specimen, rate of interest 5 per cent.\n\n| Table IV | Table III | Table I | Table II |\n|----------|-----------|---------|---------|\n| Amount of L.1 per annum | Amount of L.1 | Present value of L.1 per annum, received until | Present value of L.1 per annum, received until |\n| Term | until the expiration of the Term | Term | |\n\n10. The calculation must begin with Table III., the first number in which should evidently be 1.05, the amount of L.1 improved at interest during one year; which, being multiplied by 1.05, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRODUCT\">product</a> is 1.05\u00b2, the second number; this second number being multiplied by 1.05, the product is 1.05\u00b3, the amount at the end of three years. And so the calculation proceeds throughout the whole of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a>; each number after the first, being the product of the multiplication of the preceding number, by the amount of L.1 in a year (1).\n\n11. The number against any year in Table I. is found by dividing unity by the number against the same year in Table III. (2); thus, the number against the term of six years in Table I. is $\\frac{1}{1.340096} = 0.746215$. All the numbers in that table after the first, may also be found, by multiplying that first number continually into itself (3).\n\n12. The number against any year in Table II. being the sum of the numbers against that and all the preceding years in Table I.; is found by adding the number against that year in Table I. to the number against the preceding year in Table II.; thus, the number against 4 years in Table II., being\n\nthe sum of 0.822702 and 2.723248\n\nis 3.545950.\n\n13. If each payment of an annuity of L.1 be put out as it becomes due, and improved at compound interest during the remainder of the term, it is evident that at the expiration of the term, the payment then due will be but L.1, having received no improvement at interest. That received one year before will be augmented to the amount of L.1 in a-year; that received two years before will be augmented to the amount of L.1 in two years; that received three years before to the amount of L.1 in three years, and so on until the first payment, which will be augmented to the amount of L.1 in a term one year less than that of the annuity.\n\nHence, it is manifest, that the number against any year in Table IV. will be unity added to the sum of all those against the preceding years in Table III.\n\nAnd, therefore, that the number against any year in Table IV. is the sum of those in Tables III. and IV. against the next preceding year.\n\nThus, the number against seven years in Table IV., being\n\nthe sum of 1.340096 and 6.801913\n\nis 8.142009.\n\n14. The method of construction is obviously the same at any other rate of interest.\n\n15. All the amounts and values which are the objects of this inquiry, evidently depend upon the improvement of money at compound interest; it is, therefore, that the first, second, and fourth tables, all depend upon the third.\n\nBut every pound, and every part of a pound, when put out at interest, is improved in the same manner as any single pound considered separately. Whence, it is obvious, that while the term and the rate of interest remain the same, both the amount and the present value, either of any sum, or of any annuity, will be the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MULTIPLE\">multiple</a>, and part or parts of the amount or the present value found against the same term, and under the same rate of interest in these tables, as the sum or the annuity proposed is of L.1.\n\nSo that to find the amount or the present value of\nany sum or annuity for a given term and rate of interest, we have only to multiply the corresponding tabular value by the sum or the annuity proposed; the product will be the amount or the value sought, according as the case may be.\n\n16. Example 1. To what sum will L. 100 amount, when improved at compound interest during 20 years? the rate of interest being 4 per cent. per annum.\n\nBy Table III., it appears, that L. 1 so improved, would, at the expiration of the term, amount to L. 2\u00b7191123, therefore L. 100 would amount to 100 times as much, that is, to L. 219\u00b71123, or L. 219, 2s. 3d.\n\n17. Ex. 2. What is the present value of L. 400, which is not to be received until the expiration of 14 years, when the rate of interest is 5 per cent.?\n\nThe present value of L. 1 to be received then, will be found by Table I. to be L. 0\u00b7505068 : L. 400 to be received at the same time, will therefore be worth, in present money, 400 times as much, or L. 202\u00b70272, that is, L. 202, 0s. 6\u00bdd.\n\n18. Ex. 3. Required the present value of an annuity of L. 50 for 21 years, when the rate of interest is 5 per cent.\n\nTable II. shows the value of an annuity of L. 1 for the same term to be L. 12\u00b78212 ; the required value must therefore be 50 times as much, or L. 641\u00b706, that is, L. 641, 1s. 2\u00bdd.\n\n19. Ex. 4. What will an annuity of L. 10, 10s. or L. 10\u00b75, for thirty years, amount to, when each payment is put out as it becomes due, and improved at compound interest until the end of the term? The rate of interest being 4 per cent.\n\nThe amount of an annuity of L. 1 so improved, would be L. 560\u00b784938, as appears by Table IV., the amount required will therefore be 10\u00b75 times this, or L. 588\u00b789185, that is, L. 588, 17s. 10d.\n\n20. When the interval between the time of the purchase of an annuity and the first payment thereof, exceeds that which is interposed between each two immediately successive payments; such annuity is said to be deferred for a time equal to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a>, and to be entered upon at the expiration of that time.\n\n21. If two persons, A and B, purchase an annuity between them, which A is to enter upon immediately, and to enjoy during a certain part of the term, and B, or his heirs, or assigns, for the remainder of it; the present value of B's interest will evidently be, the excess of the value of the annuity for the whole of the term from this time, above the value of the interest of A.\n\nSo that when the entrance on an annuity is deferred for a certain term, its present value will be the excess of the value of the annuity for the term of delay and continuance together, above the value of an equal annuity for the term of delay only.\n\n22. Example 1. Required the value of a perpetual annuity of L. 120, which is not to be entered upon until the expiration of 14 years from this time, reckoning interest at 3 per cent.\n\nThe perpetuity, with immediate possession, would be worth 33\u00bd years' purchase (8); and an annuity for the term of delay is worth 11\u00b72961 (Table II).\n\nFrom 33\u00b73333 subtract 11\u00b72961, and multiply the remainder 22\u00b70372 by 120\n\nthe product 2644\u00b7464 = L. 2644, 9s. 3\u00bdd.\n\nis the required value.\n\n23. Ex. 2. Allowing interest at 5 per cent. what sum should be paid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> now for the renewal of 14 years lapsed, in a lease for 21 years of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESTATE\">estate</a> producing L. 300 per annum, clear of all deductions?\n\nThis is the price of an annuity for 14 years, to be entered upon 7 years hence; the term of delay, therefore, is 7 years, and that of the delay and continuance together 21 years.\n\nBy Table II. it appears, that the present value of an annuity for 21 years, is 12\u00b78212 ; for 7 years, 5\u00b77864 ; years' purchase.\n\nValue of the deferred annuity, 7\u00b70348 Multiply by 300\n\nThe product L. 2110\u00b744, or L. 2110, 8s. 9\u00bdd. is the price required.\n\n24. Hitherto we have proceeded upon the supposition of the annuity being payable, and the interest convertible into principal, which shall reproduce interest, only once a-year.\n\nBut annuities are generally payable half-yearly, and sometimes quarterly; and the same circumstances that render it desirable for an annuitant to receive his annual sum in equal half-yearly or quarterly portions, also give occasion to the interest of money being paid in the same manner.\n\nBut whatever has been advanced above, concerning the present value or the amount of an annuity, when both that and the interest of money were only payable once a-year, will evidently be true when applied to half the annuity, and half the interest paid twice as often, on the supposition of half-yearly payments; or to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of the annuity, and a quarter of the interest, paid four times as often, when the payments are made quarterly.\n\n25. Half-yearly payments are, however, by far the most common, and these four tables will also enable us to answer the most useful questions concerning them.\n\nFor we have only to extract the present value, or the amount, from the table, against twice the number of years in the term, at half the annual rate of interest, and, in the case of an annuity, to multiply the number so extracted, by half the annuity proposed.\n\n26. Ex. 1. To what sum will L. 100 amount in 20 years, when the interest at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum, is convertible into principal half-yearly?\n\nThis being the amount in 40 half years at 2 per cent. interest for every half year, will be the same as the amount in 40 years at 2 per cent. per annum, which, by Table III. will be found to be 220\u00b7804, or L. 220, 16s. 1d.; and is only L. 1, 13s. 10d. more than it would amount to if the interest were not convertible more than once a-year (16).\n27. Ex. 2. What is the present value of an annuity of L. 50 for 21 years, receivable in equal half-yearly payments, when money yields an interest of 2\u00bd per cent. every half year?\n\nBy Table II. it appears, that an annuity of L. 1 for 42 years, when the interest of money is 2\u00bd per cent. per annum, will be worth L. 25:8206 (25); 25 times this sum, or L. 645, 10s. 3\u00bdd. is therefore, the required value, and exceeds the value when the interest and the annuity are only payable once a-year by L. 4, 9s. 1d. (18).\n\n28. The excess of an annuity-certain above the interest of the purchase-money, is the sum which, being put out at the time of each payment becoming due, and improved at compound interest until the expiration of the term, will just amount to the purchase-money originally paid.\n\nBut, while everything else remains the same, the longer the term of the annuity is, the less must its excess above the interest of the purchase-money be, because a less annuity will suffice for raising the same sum within the term. Therefore, the proportion of that excess to the annual interest of the purchase-money, continually diminishes as the term is extended; and when the annuity is a perpetuity, there is no such excess (8).\n\n29. The reason why the value of an annuity is increased by that and the interest being both payable more than once in the year, is, that the grantor loses, and the purchaser gains, the interest produced by that part of each payment, which is in excess above the interest then due upon the purchase-money, from the time of such payment being made, until the expiration of the year.\n\nHence it is obvious, that the less this excess is, that is, the longer the term of the annuity is (28), the less must the increase of value be.\n\nAnd when the annuity is a perpetuity, its value will be the same, whether it and the interest of money be both payable several times in the year, or once only.\n\n30. When the annuity is not payable at the same intervals at which the interest is convertible into principal, its value will depend upon the frequencies both of payment and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVERSION\">conversion</a>; but its investigation without algebra, would be too long, and of too little use, to be worth prosecuting here.\n\nII. OF ANNUITIES ON LIVES.\n\n31. When the payment of an annuity depends upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> of some life or lives, it is called a Life-annuity.\n\n32. The values of such annuities are calculated by means of tables of mortality, which show, out of a considerable number of individuals born, how many upon an average have lived to complete each year of their age; and, consequently, what proportion of those who attained to any one age, have survived any greater age.\n\nThe fifth Table at the end of this article is one of that kind, which has been taken from Mr Milne's Treatise on Annuities, and was constructed from accurate observations made at Carlisle by Dr Heysham, during a period of 9 years, ending with 1787.\n\n33. By this table it appears, that during the period in which these observations were made; out of 10,000 children born, 3203 died under 5 years of age, and the remaining 6797 completed their fifth year. Also, that out of 6797 children who attained to 5 years of age, 6460 survived their 10th year.\n\nBut the mortality under 10 years of age, has been greatly reduced since then, by the practice of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-VACCINATION\">vaccination</a>.\n\nThis table also shows, that of 6460 individuals who attained to 10 years of age, 6047 survived 21. And that of 5075 who attained to 40, only 3643 survived their 60th year.\n\n34. There is good reason to believe (as has been shown in another place), that the general law of mortality, that is, the average proportion of persons attaining to any one age, who survive any greater age, remains much the same now among the entire <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of the people throughout England, as it was found to be at Carlisle during the period of these observations; except among children under 10 years of age, as was noticed above (33).\n\nIf this be so, it will follow, that of 6460 children now 10 years of age, just 6047 will attain to 21; or rather, that if any great number be taken in several instances, this \\( \\frac{6047}{6460} \\) will be the average proportion of them that will survive the period.\n\nAnd if 6460 children were to be taken indiscriminately from the general mass of the population at 10 years of age, and an office or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> were to engage to pay L. 1, eleven years hence, for each of them that might then be living; this engagement would be equivalent to that which should bind them to pay L. 6047 certainly, at the expiration of the term.\n\nTherefore, the office, in order that it might neither <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> nor lose by the engagement, should, upon entering into it, be paid for the whole, the present value of L. 6047; to be received at the expiration of 11 years; and for each life, the \\( \\frac{1}{6460} \\)th part of it; that is, the \\( \\frac{6047}{6460} \\)th part of the present value of L. 1 to be received then.\n\nBut when the rate of interest is 5 per cent. the present value of L. 1, to be received at the expiration of 11 years, is L. 0:584679; therefore, at that rate of interest, there should be paid for each life \\( \\frac{6047 \\times 0:584679}{6460} = L. 0:5473 \\).\n\nAnd the present value of L. 100, to be received upon a life now 10 years of age attaining to 21, will be L. 54:73, or L. 54, 18s. 7d.\n\nIn the same manner it will be found, that reckoning interest at 4 per cent. the value would be L. 60, 16s. 1d.\n\n35. This is the method of calculating the present values of endowments for children of given ages; and the values of annuities on lives may be computed in the same manner.\n\nFor, from the above <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> it is manifest, that if the present value of L. 1, to be received certainly at the expiration of a given term, be multiplied by the number in the table of mortality against the\nage, greater than that of any proposed life by the number of years in the term, and the product be divided by the number in the same table, against the present age of that life; the quotient will be the present value of L.1, to be received at the expiration of the term, provided that the life survive it.\n\nAnd if, in this manner, the value be determined of L.1, to be received upon any proposed life, surviving each of the years in its greatest possible continuance, according to the table of mortality adapted to it; that is, according to the Carlisle table, upon its surviving every age greater than its present, to that of 104 years inclusive; then, the sum of all these values will evidently be the present value of an annuity on the proposed life.\n\n36. If 5642 lives at 30 years of age be proposed, and 5075 at the age of 40; since each of the 5642 younger lives may be combined with every one of the 5075 that are 10 years older, the number of different pairs, or different combinations of two lives differing in age by 10 years, that may be formed out of the proposed lives, is 5642 times 5075.\n\nBut at the expiration of 15 years, the survivors of the lives now 30 and 40 years of age, being then of the respective ages of 45 and 55, will be reduced to the numbers of 4727 and 4073 respectively; and the number of pairs, or combinations of two, differing in age by 10 years, that can be formed out of them, will be reduced from 5642 X 5075 to 4727 X 4073.\n\nSo that L.1 to be paid at the expiration of 15 years for each of these 5642 X 5075 pairs or combinations of two, now existing, which may survive the term, will be of the same value in present money, as 4727 times L.4073, to be received certainly at the same time.\n\nNow let A be any one of these lives of 30 years of age, and B any one of those aged 40; and from what has been advanced it will be evident, that the present value of L.1 to be received upon the two lives in this particular combination jointly surviving the term, will be the same as that of the sum L.4727 X 4073 to be then received certainly.\n\nBut, when the rate of interest is 5 per cent, L.1 to be received certainly at the expiration of 15 years, is equivalent to L.0.481017 in present money (Table I).\n\nTherefore, at that rate of interest, and according to the Carlisle table of mortality; the present value of L.1 to be received upon A and B now aged 30 and 40 years respectively, jointly surviving the term of 15 years, will be\n\n\\[ \\frac{4727 \\times 4073 \\times L.0.481017}{5642 \\times 5075} \\]\n\n37. Hence it is sufficiently evident, how the present value of L.1 to be received upon the same two lives jointly surviving any other year may be found. And if that value for each year from this time until the eldest life attain to the limit of the table of mortality be calculated, the sum of all these will be the present value of an annuity of L.1 dependent upon their joint continuance.\n\nIn this manner, it is obvious that the value of an annuity on the joint continuance of any other two lives might be determined.\n\n38. If, besides the 5642 lives at 30 years of age, and the 5075 at 40 (mentioned in No. 36), there be also proposed 3643 at 60 years of age; each of these 3643 at 60, may be combined with every one of the 5642 X 5075 different combinations of a life of 30, with one of 40 years of age; and, therefore, out of these three classes of lives 5642 X 5075 X 3643 different combinations may be formed; each containing a life of 30 years of age; another of 40, and a third of 60.\n\nBut at the expiration of 15 years, the numbers of lives in these three classes will, according to the table of mortality, be reduced to 4727, 4073, and 1675 respectively; the respective ages of the survivors in the several classes being then 45, 55, and 75 years; and the number of different combinations of three lives (each of a different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a> from either of the other two), that can be formed out of them, will be reduced to 4727 X 4073 X 1675.\n\nHence, by reasoning as in No. 36, it will be found, that if A, B, and C be three such lives, now aged 30, 40, and 60 years, the present value of L.1 to be received upon these three jointly surviving the term of 15 years from this time, will be\n\n\\[ \\frac{4727 \\times 4073 \\times 1675}{5642 \\times 5075 \\times 3643} \\times L.0.481017 \\]\n\ninterest being reckoned at 5 per cent.\n\nThus it is shown, how the present value of an annuity dependent upon the joint continuance of these three lives might be calculated, that being the sum of the present values thus determined, of the rents for all the years which, according to the table of mortality, the eldest life can survive.\n\n39. But it is easy to see, that the same method of reasoning may be used in the case of four, five, or six lives, and so on without limit. Whence, this inference is obvious.\n\nThe present value of L.1, to be received at the expiration of a given term, provided that any given number of lives all survive it, may be found by multiplying the present value of L.1 to be received certainly at the end of the term, by the continual product of the numbers in the table of mortality against the ages greater respectively by the number of years in the term, than the ages of the lives proposed; and dividing the last result of these operations, by the continual product of the numbers in the table of mortality against the present ages of the proposed lives.\n\nAnd by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of similar operations, the present value of an annuity on the joint continuance of all these lives might be determined.\n\nBut it should be observed, that, in calculating the value of a life-annuity in this way, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DENOMINATOR\">denominator</a> of the fractions expressing the values of the several years rents, that is, the divisor used in each of the operations, remains always the same; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> should, therefore, be left till the sum of the numerators is determined, and one operation of that kind will suffice.\n\n40. Enough has been said to show that these methods of constructing tables of the values of annuities on lives are practicable, though excessively laborious, and, in fact, all the early tables of this kind were constructed in that manner. We proceed now\nto show how such tables may be calculated with much greater facility.\n\n41. By the method of No. 34, it will be found that, reckoning interest at 5 per cent., the present value of L. 1 to be received at the expiration of a year, provided that a life, now 89 years of age, survived till then, is \\( \\frac{142 \\times 0.952381}{181} \\). But the age of that life will then be 90 years, and the proprietor of an annuity of L. 1 now depending upon it, will, in that event, receive his annual payment of L. 1 then due; therefore, if the value then of all the subsequent payments, that is, the value of an annuity on a life of 90 be 2:339 years' purchase, the present value of what the title to this annuity may produce to the proprietor, at the end of the year, will be the same as that of L. 3:339, to be received then, if the life be still subsisting, or \\( \\frac{142 \\times 0.952381}{181} \\times L. 3:339 = L. 2:495 \\); which, therefore, will be the present value of an annuity of L. 1 on a life of 89 years of age. That is to say, an annuity on that life will now be worth 2:495 years' purchase (7).\n\n42. In the same manner it appears generally, that, if unity be added to the number of years' purchase that an annuity on any life is worth, and the sum be multiplied by the present value of L. 1, to be received at the end of a year, provided that a life one year younger survive till then, the product will be the number of years' purchase an annuity on that younger life is worth in present money.\n\n43. But according to the table of mortality, an annuity on the eldest life in it is worth nothing; therefore, the present value of L. 1 to be received at the end of a year, provided that the eldest life but one in the table survive till then, is the total present value of an annuity of L. 1 on that life. Which, being obtained, the value of an annuity on a life one year younger than it may be found by the preceding number; and so on for every younger life successively.\n\n**EXEMPLIFICATION.**\n\n| Age of Life | Value of an Annuity on that Life, increased by Unity. | Which, being multiplied by 0.952381, and the Product by |\n|-------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| 104         | 1:000                                                | \\( \\frac{1 \\times 40}{3 \\times 54} \\)                |\n| 103         | 1:317                                                | \\( \\frac{3 \\times 54}{5 \\times 75} \\)                |\n| 102         | 1:753                                                | \\( \\frac{5 \\times 75}{7 \\times 105} \\)               |\n| 101         | 2:192                                                | \\( \\frac{7 \\times 105}{9 \\times 142} \\)              |\n| 100         | 2:624                                                | \\( \\frac{9 \\times 142}{11 \\times 181} \\)             |\n| 99          | 3:045                                                | \\( \\frac{11 \\times 181}{14 \\times 232} \\)            |\n| 98          | 3:478                                                |                                                     |\n| 97          | 3:828                                                |                                                     |\n| 96          | 3:555                                                |                                                     |\n| 95          | 3:996                                                |                                                     |\n\n44. Proceeding as in No. 36, it will be found, that at 5 per cent. interest, and according to the Carlisle table of mortality, the present value of L. 1 to be received at the expiration of a year, provided that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> now 89 years of age, and another now 99, be then living, is \\( \\frac{142 \\times 9 \\times L. 0.952381}{181 \\times 11} \\); therefore, if the present value of an annuity of L. 1 on the joint continuance of two lives, now aged 90 and 100 years respectively, be L. 0.950; by reasoning as in No. 41, it will be found that the present value of an annuity on the joint continuance of two lives, of the respective ages of 89 and 99 years, will be worth \\( \\frac{142 \\times 9 \\times 0.952381}{181 \\times 11} \\times 1.950 = 1.192 \\) years' purchase.\n\n45. In this manner, commencing with the two oldest lives in the table that differ in age by ten years, and proceeding according to No. 43, the values of annuities on all the other combinations of two lives of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of age, may be determined.\n\nThe method is exemplified in the following specimen:\n\n| Ages of two Lives | Value of an Annuity on their joint continuance, increased by Unity. | Which, being multiplied by 0.952381, and the Product by | Produces the value of an Annuity on the two joint Lives one year younger respectively, |\n|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 94 & 104         | 1:000                                                              | \\( \\frac{1 \\times 40}{3 \\times 54} \\)                | 0:235                                                                            |\n| 93 & 103         | 1:235                                                              | \\( \\frac{3 \\times 54}{5 \\times 75} \\)                | 0:508                                                                            |\n| 92 & 102         | 1:508                                                              | \\( \\frac{5 \\times 75}{7 \\times 105} \\)               | 0:733                                                                            |\n| 91 & 101         | 1:733                                                              | \\( \\frac{7 \\times 105}{9 \\times 142} \\)              | 0:950                                                                            |\n| 90 & 100         | 1:950                                                              | \\( \\frac{9 \\times 142}{11 \\times 181} \\)             | 1:192                                                                            |\n| 89 & 99          | 2:192                                                              | \\( \\frac{11 \\times 181}{14 \\times 232} \\)            | 1:280                                                                            |\n\n46. Hence, and by what has been advanced in the 39th number of this article, it is sufficiently evident, how a table may be computed of the values of annuities on the joint continuance of the lives in every combination of three, or any greater number; the differences between the ages of the lives in each combination remaining always the same in the same series of operations, while the calculation proceeds back from the combination in which the oldest life is the oldest in the table, to that in which the youngest is a child just born.\n\n47. But, when there are more than two lives in each combination, the calculations are so very laborious, on account, principally, of the great number...\nof combinations, that no tables of that kind have yet been published, except three or four for three lives.\n\nAnd, in the books that contain tables of the values of two joint lives, methods are given of approximating towards the values of such combinations of two and of three lives, as have not yet been calculated.\n\nTherefore, assuming the values of annuities on single lives, and on the joint continuance of two or of three lives, to be given; we have next to show how the most useful problems respecting the values of any interests that depend upon the continuance or the failure of life, may be resolved by them.\n\n48. Proposition 1. The value of an annuity on the survivor of two lives, A and B, is equal to the excess of the sum of the values of annuities on the two single lives, above the value of an annuity on their joint continuance.\n\n49. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">Demonstration</a>. If annuities on each of the two lives were granted to P, during their joint continuance, he would have two annuities; but if P were only to receive these upon condition that, during the joint lives of A and B, he should pay one annuity to Q; then, there would only remain one to be enjoyed by him, or his heirs or assigns, until the lives both of A and B were extinct; whence the truth of the proposition is manifest.\n\n50. Prop. 2. The value of an annuity on the joint continuance of the two last survivors out of three lives, A, B, and C, is equal to the excess of the sum of the values of annuities on the three combinations of two lives (A with B, A with C, and B with C) that can be formed out of them, above twice the value of an annuity on the joint continuance of all the three lives.\n\n51. Demon. If one annuity were granted to P on the joint continuance of the two lives A and B, another on the joint continuance of A and C, and a third, on the joint continuance of B and C; during the joint continuance of all the lives he would have three annuities.\n\nBut if he were only to receive these upon condition that he should pay two annuities to Q, during the joint continuance of all the three lives; then, there would only remain to himself one annuity during the joint existence of the last two survivors out of the three lives. And the truth of the proposition is manifest.\n\n52. Prop. 3. The value of an annuity on the last survivor of three lives, A, B, and C, is equal to the excess of the sum of the values of annuities on each of the three single lives, together with the value of an annuity on the joint continuance of all the three, above the sum of the values of three other annuities; the first dependent upon the joint continuance of A and B, the second, on that of A and C, and the third, on B and C.\n\n53. Demon. If annuities on each of the three single lives were granted to R; during the joint continuance of all the three, he would have three annuities, and from the time of the extinction of the first life that failed, till the extinction of the second, he would have two.\n\nSo that he would have two annuities during the joint existence of the two last survivors out of the three lives; and besides these, a third annuity during the joint continuance of all the three.\n\nTherefore, if out of these, R were to pay one annuity to P during the joint continuance of the last two survivors out of the three lives, and another to Q during the joint continuance of all the three; he would only have left one annuity, which would be receivable during the life of the last survivor of the three.\n\nBut in the demonstration of the last proposition (51) it was shown, that the value of what he paid to P, would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> short of the sum of the values of annuities dependent respectively on the joint continuance of A and B, of A and C, and of B and C, by two annuities on the joint continuance of all the three lives. Whence it is evident, that the value of the annuities he paid both to P and Q, would fall short of the sum of these three values of joint lives, only by the value of one annuity on the joint continuance of all the three lives.\n\nWherefore, if from the sum of the values of all the three single lives, the sum of the values of the three combinations of two that can be formed out of them were taken; there would remain less than the value of an annuity on the last survivor, by that of an annuity on the joint continuance of the three lives.\n\nBut if, to the sum of the values of the three single lives A, B, and C, there be added that of an annuity on the joint continuance of the three, and from the sum of these four values, the sum of the values of the three combinations, A with B, A with C, and B with C be subtracted; then, the remainder will be the value of an annuity on the last survivor of the three lives. Which was to be demonstrated.\n\n54. Prop. 4. Problem. The law of mortality and the values of single lives at all ages being given; to determine the present value of an annuity on any proposed life, deferred for any assigned term.\n\n55. Solution. Find the present value of an annuity on a life older than the proposed, by the number of years during which the other annuity is deferred; multiply this by the present value of L.1 to be received upon the proposed life surviving the term, and the product will be the value sought.\n\n56. Demon. Upon the proposed life surviving the term, the annuity dependent upon it will be worth the same sum, that an annuity on a life so much older is now worth; therefore, it is evident, that the deferred annuity is of the same present value as that sum to be received at the expiration of the term, provided the life survive it.\n\n57. Corollary. In the same manner it appears, that the present value of an annuity on the joint continuance of any number of lives, deferred for a given term, may be found by multiplying the present value of an annuity on the joint continuance of the same number of lives, older respectively than the proposed, by the number of years in the term; by the present value of L.1 to be received, upon the proposed lives all surviving it.\n\n58. A Temporary Annuity on any single life, or on the joint continuance of any number of lives, that is, an annuity which is to be paid during a certain term, provided that the single life or the other lives jointly subsist so long; together with an annuity on the same life or lives deferred for the same term, are evidently equivalent to an annuity on the whole duration of the same life or lives.\nSo that the value of an annuity on any life or on the joint continuance of any number of lives for an assigned term, is equal to the excess of the value of an annuity on their whole duration, with immediate possession, above the value of an annuity on them deferred for the term.\n\n59. Whatever has been advanced from No. 48. to 53. inclusive, respecting the values of annuities for the whole duration of the lives wherein they depend, will apply equally to those which are either deferred or temporary; and, therefore, to determine the value of any deferred or temporary annuity, dependent upon the last survivor of two or of three lives; or, upon the joint continuance of the last two survivors out of three lives; we have only to substitute temporary or deferred annuities, as the case may require, for annuities on the whole duration of the lives; and the result will, accordingly, be the value of a temporary or deferred annuity on the life of the last survivor, or on the joint lives of the two last survivors.\n\n60. Prop. 5. A and B being any two proposed lives now in existence, the present value of an annuity to be payable only while A survives B, is equal to the excess of the value of an annuity on the life of A, above that of an annuity on the joint existence of both the lives.\n\n61. Demons. If an annuity on the life of A, and to be entered upon immediately, were now granted to P, upon condition that he should pay it to B during the joint lives of A and B; it is evident that there would only remain to P, an annuity on the life of A after the decease of B: whence the truth of the proposition is manifest.\n\n62. When any thing is affirmed or demonstrated of any life or lives, it is to be understood as applying equally to any proposed single life, or to the joint continuance of the whole of any number of lives that may be proposed together, or to that of any assigned number of the last survivors of them, or to the last surviving life of the whole.\n\n63. Prop. 6. The present value of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVERSION\">reversion</a> of a perpetual annuity after the failure of any life or lives, is equal to the excess of the present value of the perpetuity with immediate possession, above the present value of an annuity on the same life or lives.\n\n64. Demons. If a perpetual annuity with immediate possession were granted to P, upon condition that he should pay the annual produce to another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a>, during the existence of the life or lives proposed; it is evident that there would only remain to P, the reversion after the failure of such life or lives; and the present value of that reversion would manifestly be as stated above.\n\n65. The 6th, 7th, and 8th tables at the end of this article, which have been extracted from the 19th, 21st, and 22d, respectively, in Mr Milne's Treatise on Annuities, will serve to illustrate the application of these propositions to the solution of questions in numbers.\n\nIn all the following examples, we suppose the lives to be such, as the general average of those the Carlisle table of mortality was constructed from, and the rate of interest to be 5 per cent.\n\n66. Ex. 1. What is the present value of an annuity on the joint lives, and the life of the survivor of two persons now aged 40 and 50 years respectively?\n\nAccording to No. 48, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> is as follows:\n\nValue of a single life of \\( \\{ \\begin{<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol2.html#article-ARRAY\">array</a>}{c} 40 \\\\ 50 \\end{array} \\} \\) by Table VI.\n\nSubtract the value of their joint lives,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{sum} & = 25.050 \\\\\n\\text{remains} & = 15.066 \\text{ years' purchase},\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nthe required value.\n\nAnd if the annuity be L. 200, its present value will be L. 3013.2, or L. 3013.4s.\n\n67. Ex. 2. The lives A, B, and C, being now aged 50, 55, and 60 years respectively, an annuity on the joint continuance of all the three, is worth 6.289 years purchase: What is the value of an annuity on the joint existence of the last two survivors of them?\n\nAccording to No. 50, the process is thus:\n\n| Ages | Values |\n|------|--------|\n| 50 & 55 | 8.528 |\n| 55 & 60 | 7.106 |\n| 50 & 60 | 7.601 |\n\nTable VII.\n\nTable VIII.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{sum} & = 23.235 \\\\\n\\text{Subtract} & = 2 \\times 6.289 = 12.578 \\\\\n\\text{remains} & = 10.657 \\text{ years' purchase, the required value}.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, if the annuity were L. 300, it would be worth L. 3197.2s. in present money.\n\n68. Ex. 3. Required the value of an annuity on the last survivor of the three lives in the last example.\n\nProceeding according to No. 52, we have\n\n| Ages | Values |\n|------|--------|\n| 50   | 11.660 |\n| 55   | 10.347 |\n| 60   | 8.940 |\n| 50, 55, & 60 | 6.289 |\n\nTab. VI.\n\n(No. 67).\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{sum} & = 37.236 \\\\\n\\text{Subtract the sum of the values of annuities on the three combinations of two lives,} & = 23.235 \\\\\n\\text{remains} & = 14.001 \\text{ years' purchase, the required value}.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nAnd if the annuity were L. 300, it would now be worth L. 4200.6s.\n\n69. Ex. 4. What is the present value of an annuity on a life now 45 years of age, which is not to be entered upon until the expiration of ten years; the first payment thereof being to be made at the expiration of eleven years from this time, if the life survive till then?\n\nSolution.\n\nThe present value of an annuity on a life of 55 is 10.347 (Table VI.), and the present value of L. 1 to be received upon the proposed life attaining to the\nage of 55, is \\( \\frac{4073}{4727} \\times 0.613913 \\); therefore, by No. 55, the required value is \\( \\frac{4073 \\times 0.613913 \\times 10.347}{4727} = 5.473 \\) years purchase; so that if the annuity were L. 200, its present value would be L. 1094, 12s.\n\n70. Ex. 5. Required the present value of an annuity to be received for the next ten years, provided that a person now 45 years of age, shall so long live.\n\nSolution.\n\nThe present value of an annuity on a life of 45, to be entered upon immediately, is 12.648 (Table VI). Subtract that of an annuity on the same life deferred 10 years,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\text{the remainder, } \\\\\n&\\quad 7.175 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nis the required number of years purchase. And, if the annuity were L. 200, its present value would be L. 1435.\n\n71. Ex. 6. An annuity on a life of 45, deferred 10 years, was shown in No. 69, to be worth 5.473 years purchase in present money; let it be required to determine the equivalent annual payment for the same, to be made at the end of each of the next 10 years, but subject to failure upon the life failing in the term.\n\nSolution.\n\nThe present value of L. 1 per annum on the proposed life for the next 10 years, has just been shown to be L. 7.175, and this, multiplied by the required annual payment, must produce L. 5.473; that payment must, therefore, be \\( \\frac{5.473}{7.175} = 0.76279 \\). And, since the annual payment for the deferred annuity of L. 1 per annum would be L. 0.76279, that for an annuity of L. 200 must be L. 152, 11s. 2d.\n\n72. Ex. 7. Let the present value be required of an annuity on a life now 40 years of age, to be payable only while that life survives another now of the age of 50 years.\n\nFrom the present value of a life of 40,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\text{Subtract that of the two joint lives, } \\\\\n&\\quad 9.984 \\text{(Table VIII.)} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nthe remainder,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\text{years purchase is the required value (60).} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, if the annuity were L. 100, it would be worth L. 340, 12s. in present money.\n\n73. If the annuity in the last example were to be paid for by a constant annual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREMIUM\">premium</a> at the end of each year while both the lives survived; by reasoning as in No. 71, it will be found, that such annual premium for an annuity of L. 1 should be\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\text{L. 0.341146; for an annuity of L. 100 it should therefore be L. 34, 2s. 3\u00bdd.} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n74. But if one of the equal premiums for this annuity is to be paid down now, and another at the end of each year while both the lives survive: the number of years purchase the whole of these premiums are worth, will evidently be increased by unity, on account of the payment made now, it will, therefore, be 10.984; and each premium for an annuity of L. 1 must, in this case, be\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\text{L. 0.3410087; for an annuity of L. 100 it should, therefore, be L. 31, 0s. 2d.} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n75.

Let it be required to determine the present value of the reversion of a perpetual annuity after the failure of a life now 50 years of age.\n\nSolution.\n\nThe value of the perpetuity is 20 years purchase (8.)\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\text{Subtract that of an annuity on the life of 50, } \\\\\n&\\quad 11.660 \\text{(Table VI.)} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nRemains 8.334 years purchase, the required value of the reversion (63.)\n\nSo that if the annuity were L. 300, its present value would be L. 2502.\n\n76. In the same manner it will be found, by the 68th number and those referred to in the last example, that the reversion of a perpetuity, after the failure of the last survivor of three lives, now aged 50, 55, and 60 years respectively, is worth 5.999 years purchase in present money; therefore, if it were L. 100 per annum, its present value would be L. 599, 18s.\n\nIII. OF ASSURANCES ON LIVES.\n\n77. An assurance upon a life, or lives, is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> by which the Office or Underwriter, in consideration of a stipulated premium, engages to pay a certain sum upon such life or lives failing within the term for which the assurance is effected.\n\n78. If the term of the assurance be the whole duration of the life or lives assured, the sum must necessarily be paid whenever the failure happens; and, in what follows, that payment is always supposed to be made at the end of the year in which the event assured against takes place. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANNIVERSARY\">anniversary</a> of the assurance, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a> of the policy, being accounted the beginning of each year.\n\n79. At the end of the year in which any proposed life or lives may fail, the proprietor of the reversion of a perpetual annuity of L. 1 after their failure, will receive the pound then due, and will, at the same time, enter upon the perpetuity; therefore, the present value of the reversion is the same as that of L. 1 added to the money a perpetual annuity of L. 1 would cost, supposing this sum not to be receivable until the expiration of the year in which the failure of the life or lives might happen.\n\n80. Hence we have this proportion. As the value of a perpetuity increased by unity is to L. 1, so is the present value of the reversion of a perpetual annuity of L. 1, after the failure of any life or lives, to the present value of L. 1, receivable at the end of the year in which such failure shall take place.\n\n81. Therefore, if the value of an annuity of one pound on any life or lives, be subtracted from that of the perpetuity, and the remainder be divided by the value of the perpetuity increased by unity; the quo-\ntient will be the value, in present money, of the assurance of one pound on the same life or lives.\n\n82. Ex. 1. What is the present value of L. 1, to be received at the end of the year, in which a life now 50 years of age may fail?\n\nThe rate of interest being 5 per cent., the value of the perpetuity is 20 years purchase, and that of the life 11\u00b766; the answer therefore is \\( \\frac{20 - 11\\cdot66}{20 + 1} = \\frac{8\\cdot34}{21} = L.0\\cdot397143 \\). And if the sum assured were L.1000, the present value of the assurance would be L.397, 2s. 10d.\n\n83. When the term of a life assurance exceeds one year, its whole value is hardly ever paid down at the time that the contract is entered into, but, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> (called a Policy) whereby the assurance is effected, an equivalent annual premium is stipulated for, payable at the commencement of each year during the term, but subject to failure with the life or lives assured.\n\n84. But by reasoning as in No. 74, it will be found, that an annual premium payable at the commencement of each year in the whole duration of the life or lives assured, will be worth one year's purchase more, than an annuity on them payable at the end of each year; and, consequently, that if the value in present money of an assurance on any life or lives, be divided by the number of years purchase an annuity on the same life or lives is worth, increased by unity, the quotient will be the equivalent annual premium for the same assurance.\n\n85. Ex. 2. Required the annual premium for the assurance of L.1, on a life of 50 years of age.\n\nIn No. 82, the single premium for that assurance was shown to be 0\u00b7397143, and the value of an annuity on the life is 11\u00b766, therefore, by the preceding number, the required annual premium will be\n\n\\[ \\frac{0\\cdot397143}{12\\cdot66} = 0\\cdot313699 \\text{ for the assurance of L.1;} \\]\n\nand for the assurance of L.1000, it will be L.31, 7s. 5d.\n\n86. Ex. 3. Let both the single payment in present money, and the equivalent annual premium be required for the assurance of L.1, on the joint continuance of two lives of the respective ages of 45 and 50 years.\n\nThe value of an annuity of L.1 on the joint continuance of these two lives, appears by Table VII. to be L.9\u00b7737, therefore\n\n\\[ \\frac{20 - 9\\cdot737}{20 + 1} = \\frac{10\\cdot263}{21} = L.0\\cdot488714 \\text{ is the single premium, and } \\frac{0\\cdot488714}{10\\cdot737} = L.0\\cdot0455168, \\text{ the equivalent annual one for the assurance of L.1 to be paid at the end of the year, in which that life becomes extinct which may happen to fail the first of the two.} \\]\n\nTherefore, if the sum assured were L.500, the total present value of the assurance would be L.244, 7s. 2d. and the equivalent annual premium L.22, 15s. 2d.\n\n87. Ex. 4. Let both the single and the equivalent annual premium be required for the assurance of L.1, on the life of the survivor of two persons now aged 40 and 50 years respectively.\n\nThe value of an annuity on the survivor of these two lives was shown in No. 66, to be 15\u00b7066; therefore, by No. 81, the single premium will be\n\n\\[ \\frac{20 - 15\\cdot066}{20 + 1} = \\frac{4\\cdot934}{21} = L.0\\cdot234952; \\text{ and by No. 84, the annual one will be } \\frac{L.0\\cdot234952}{16\\cdot066} = L.0\\cdot0146942. \\]\n\nThat is, for the assurance of L.1 to be received at the end of the year, in which the last surviving life of the two becomes extinct.\n\nTherefore, for the assurance of L.5000, the single premium will be L.1174, 15s. 2d. the equivalent annual one L.73, 2s. 5d.\n\n88. Ex. 5. What should the single and equivalent annual premiums be for an assurance on the last survivor of three lives, of the respective ages of 50, 55, and 60 years.\n\nThe value of an annuity on the last survivor of them, was shown in No. 68, to be 14\u00b7001, the single premium should therefore be\n\n\\[ \\frac{20 - 14\\cdot001}{20 + 1} = \\frac{5\\cdot999}{21} = L.0\\cdot285666, \\text{ and the annual } \\frac{L.0\\cdot285666}{15\\cdot001} = L.0\\cdot0190431, \\text{ for the assurance of L.1, to be received at the end of the year, in which the last surviving life of the three may fail.} \\]\n\nFor the assurance of L.2000, the single premium would therefore be L.571, 6s. 8d. the annual one L.38, 1s. 9d.\n\n89. Lemma. If an annuity be payable at the commencement of each year, which some assigned life or lives may enter upon in a given term; the number of years purchase in its present value, will exceed by unity the number of years purchase, in the present value of an annuity on the same life or lives for one year less than the given term, but payable as annuities generally are, at the end of each year.\n\nDemonstration. Since the proposed life or lives can only enter upon any year after the first, by surviving the year that precedes it; the receipt of each of the payments after the first, that are to be made at the commencement of the year, will take place at the same time, and upon the same conditions as that of the rent for the year then expired of the life-annuity, for a term one year less than the term proposed: this last mentioned annuity, will therefore, be worth in present money, just the same number of years' purchase as all the payments subsequent to the first, which may be made at the commencements of the several years.\n\nAnd, since the first of these is to be made immediately, the present value of the whole of them, will evidently exceed the number of years purchase last mentioned, by unity, which was to be demonstrated.\n\n90. If, while the rest remains the same, the payment of the annuity which depends upon the assigned life or lives entering upon any year, is not to be made until the end of that year; as the condition upon which every payment is to be made, will remain the same, but each of them will be one year later; the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> in the value of the whole, will arise from this increase in the remoteness of payment, by which it will be reduced in the ratio of L.1, to the present value of L.1, receivable at the end of a year (2).\n91. When the value of an annuity on any proposed life or lives for an assigned term is given, it is evident that the value of an annuity on the same life or lives for one year less may be found, by subtracting from the given value, the present value, of the rent to be received upon the proposed life or lives surviving the term assigned.\n\n92. Proposition. The present value of an assurance on any proposed life or lives for a given term, is equal to the excess of the value of an annuity to be paid at the end of each year, which the life or lives proposed may enter upon in the term, above the value of an annuity on them for the same term, but dependent, as usual, upon their surviving each year.\n\nDemonstration. If an annuity payable at the end of each year, which the proposed life or lives may enter upon during the given term, be granted to P, upon condition that he shall pay over what he receives to Q, at the end of each year which the same life or lives may survive; it is manifest that there will only remain to P, the rent for the year in which the proposed life or lives may fail; that is, the assurance of that sum thereon for the given term (77). Which was to be demonstrated.\n\n93. From the last four numbers (89\u201492) we derive the following\n\nRule for determining the present value of an assurance on any life or lives for a given term.\n\nAdd unity to the value of an annuity on the proposed life or lives, for the given term, and from the sum subtract the present value of one pound, to be received upon the same life or lives surviving the term; multiply the remainder by the present value of L.1, to be received certainly at the end of a year, and from the product subtract the present value of an annuity on the proposed life or lives for the term.\n\nThis last remainder will be the value in present money of the assurance of L.1 during the same term, on the life or lives proposed.\n\n94. It has been shown above (34\u201439), how the present value of L.1, receivable upon any single or joint lives surviving an assigned term, may be found. And all that was demonstrated from No. 48. to 53. inclusive, respecting annuities on the last survivor of two, or of three lives, or on the joint continuance of the two last survivors out of three lives, is equally true of any particular year\u2019s rent of those annuities. Hence it is evident, how the present value of L.1, to be received upon the last survivor of two, or of three lives, or upon the last two survivors out of three lives, surviving any assigned term, may be found.\n\n95. Example. Required the present value of L.1, to be received at the end of the year, in which a life, now forty-five years of age, may fail, provided that such failure happens before the expiration of ten years.\n\nHere the present value of L.1, to be received upon the life surviving the term, will be found to be L.0\u00b7528976, and the value of an annuity on the proposed life for the term, is 7\u00b7175 (70.)\n\nFrom 8\u00b7175\nsubtract 0\u00b7528976\nthe remainder 7\u00b7646024\nbeing multiplied by 0\u00b7952381\nproduces 7\u00b728193\nfrom this subtract 7\u00b717500\nremains L.0\u00b710693, the required value of the assurance; and if the sum assured were L.3000, the value of the assurance in present money would be L.320, 15s. 7d.\n\n96. By numbers 89, 91, and 95, it appears, that an annuity, payable at the commencement of each of the next ten years that a life of 45 enters upon, is worth 7\u00b7646 years purchase: therefore, \\( \\frac{0\u00b710693}{7\u00b7646} = \\)\n\nL.0\u00b7013985 will be the annual premium for the assurance of L.1 for ten years on that life. For the assurance of L.3000, it will therefore be L.41, 19s. 1d.\n\n97. When the term of the assurance is the whole duration of the life or lives assured, L.1 to be received upon their surviving the term is worth nothing; and an annuity on the lives for the term, is also for their whole duration.\n\nTherefore, from No. 93. we derive the following\n\nRule for determining the present value of an assurance on any life or lives.\n\nAdd unity to the value of an annuity on the proposed life or lives; multiply the sum by the present value of L.1, to be received certainly at the end of a year; and from the product, subtract the value of an annuity on the same life or lives.\n\nThe remainder will be the value of the assurance in present money.\n\n98. Example. Required the present value of L.1, to be received at the end of the year, in which the survivor of two lives may fail, their ages now being 40 and 50 years respectively.\n\nThe value of an annuity on these lives was shown in No. 66. to be 1\u00b75066.\n\nMultiply 1\u00b75066 by 0\u00b7952381, from the product 1\u00b743009, subtract 1\u00b75066, the remainder L.0\u00b72349 is the required value, agreeably to No. 87.\n\nAnd, in all other cases, the values determined by the rule in the preceding number, will be found to agree with those obtained by the method of No. 81.\n\n99. When an assurance on any life or lives has been effected at a constant annual premium, and kept up for some time, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> payment of that premium; the annual premium required for a new assurance of the same sum on the same life or lives, will, on account of the increase of age, be greater than that at which the first assurance was effected: Therefore, the present value of all these greater annual premiums, that is, the total present value of the new assurance, will exceed the present value of all the premiums that may hereafter be received under the existing policy. And the excess\nwill evidently be the value of the policy, supposing the life or lives to be still insurable; that being the only advantage that can now be derived from the premiums already paid.\n\nSo that, if the present value of all the future annual premiums to be paid under an existing policy for the assurance of a certain sum upon any life or lives, be subtracted from the present value of the assurance of the same sum on the same life or lives; the remainder will be the value of the policy.\n\n100. Example. L1000 has been assured some years, on a life now 50 years of age, for its whole duration, at the annual premium of L20, one of which has just now been paid: What is the value of the policy?\n\nThe present value of the assurance of L1000 on that life, has been shown in No. 82. to be L397, 2s. 10d.; and an annuity on the life, being worth 11'66 years purchase (Table VI.), the present value of all the premiums to be paid in future under the existing policy, is 11'66 \u00d7 L20 = L233, 4s. 0d.; the value of the policy, therefore, is L163, 18s. 10d.\n\nImmediately before the payment of the premium, the value of the policy would evidently have been less by the premium then due.\n\n101. In our investigations of the values of annuities on lives, we have hitherto assumed, that no part of the rent is to be received for the year in which the life wherewith the annuity may terminate fails.\n\nBut if a part of the annuity is to be received at the end of that year, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to the part of the year which may have elapsed at the time of such failure; as, in a great number of such cases, some of the lives wherewith the annuity terminates will fail in every part of the year, and as many, or very nearly so, in any one part of it as in any other: we may assume, that, upon an average, half a year's rent will be received at the end of the year in which such failure happens; and, therefore, that by the title to what may be received after the failure of the life or lives whereon the annuity depends, the present value of that annuity will be increased by the present value of the assurance of half a year's rent on the same life or lives.\n\n102. Thus, for example: the present value of the assurance of L1 on a life of 50 years of age, having in No. 82. been shown to be L0'397143, the value of an annuity of L1 on that life, when payable, till the last moment of its existence, will exceed L11'66, its value, if only payable, until the expiration of the last year it survives, by \\( \\frac{L_0'397143}{2} = L_0'199 \\); it will therefore be L11'859.\n\n103. If, at the end of the year in which an assigned life A may fail, Q or his heirs are to receive L1; and are, at the same time, to enter upon an annuity of L1, to be enjoyed during another life P, to be then fixed upon: the present value of Q's interest will evidently be the same as that of the assurance on the life of A, of a number of pounds, exceeding by unity the number of years purchase in the value of an annuity on the life of P, at the time of nomination.\n\n104. What is the present value of the next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol17.html#article-PRESENTATION\">presentation</a> to a living of the clear annual value of L500; A, the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCUMBENT\">incumbent</a>, being now 50 years of age; supposing the age of the clerk presented to be 25, at the end of the year in which the present incumbent dies; also, that he takes the whole produce of the living for that year?\n\nBy Table VI., it will be found, that the value of an annuity of L1 on a life of 25, is L15'303; and in No. 82. it has been shown, that the present value of the assurance of L1 on a life of 50, is L0'397143. Hence, and by the last number, it appears, that if the annual produce of the living were but L1, the present value of the next presentation would be L15'303 \u00d7 L0'397143 = L6'47467. The required value, therefore, is L3237, 6s. 9d.\n\n105. If, to the value of the succeeding life, determined according to No. 103, the value of the present be added, the sum of these will evidently be the present value of both the lives in succession; and, in the case of the preceding number, will be 6'575 + 11'66 = 18'135 years' purchase.\n\n106. In No. 103, we proceeded upon the supposition that the annuity on the present life is only payable up to the expiration of the last year it survives; and, consequently, that the succeeding life takes the whole rent for the year in which the present fails.\n\nBut, if the succeeding life is only to take a part of that rent, in the same proportion to the whole, as the portion of the year which intervenes between the failure of the present life and the end of the year, is to the whole year; then, by reasoning as in No. 101, it will be found, that the portion of that rent which the succeeding life will receive, may be properly assumed to be one half. And, instead of increasing the number of years' purchase the annuity on the succeeding life will be worth at the end of the year in which the other fails, by unity, we must only add one half to that number, in order that the present value of the assurance of the sum on the existing life, may be the number of years' purchase, which all that may be received during the succeeding life, is now worth.\n\n107. The value of the succeeding life, in the case of No. 104, will, upon this hypothesis, be 15'803 \u00d7 0'397143 = 6'27605 years' purchase.\n\nAnd this appears to be the most correct way of calculating the value of an annuity on a succeeding life; although that of No. 103, proceeds upon the principle on which life interests are generally valued.\n\n108. But the value of two lives in succession, will be the same on both hypotheses. The rent for the year in which the first may fail, being, in the one case, given entirely to the successor; and, in the other, divided equally between the two.\n\nThis is also true of any greater number of successive lives.","sp":636,"ep":651},{"h":"ANNUITIES","t":"Algebraical living | dead | the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> is\n---|---|---\nABC | none | \\( \\frac{(abc)}{abc} \\)\n\n\\( AB \\) | \\( C \\) | \\( (ab) \\cdot (1 - c) = (ab) - (abc) \\)\n\\( AC \\) | \\( B \\) | \\( (ac) \\cdot (1 - b) = (ac) - (abc) \\)\n\\( BC \\) | \\( A \\) | \\( (bc) \\cdot (1 - a) = (bc) - (abc) \\)\n\nAnd the sum of these four \\( n(ab) + n(ac) + n(bc) - 2(abc) \\), is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of the probability that some two at the least, out of these three lives, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> survive the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a>.\n\nIII.

Given \\( (ABC, \\) &c.), the value of an annuity on any number of joint lives, to determine \\( ABC, \\) &c. that of an annuity on the same number of joint lives respectively one year younger than them.\n\nSolution.\n\nIf it were certain that the lives \\( ABC, \\) &c. would all survive one year, the proprietor of an annuity of L.1, dependent upon their joint continuance, would, at the expiration of a year, be in possession of L.1, (the first year's rent,) and an annuity on the same number of lives, one year older respectively than \\( ABC, \\) &c. therefore, in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, the required present value of the annuity would be \\( v[1 + (ABC, \\) &c.)], (146.)\n\nBut the probability of the lives \\( A, B, C, \\) &c. jointly surviving one year, is less than certainty, in the ratio of \\( (abc &c.) \\) to unity; therefore \\( ABC &c. = (abc &c.)v[1 + (ABC &c.)]. \\)\n\n150. Corol. 1. When there are but three lives, \\( A, B, \\) and \\( C, \\) this becomes \\( ABC = (abc)v[1 + (ABC)]. \\)\n\n151. Corol. 2. When there are only two, \\( A \\) and \\( B, \\) \\( AB = (ab)v[1 + (AB)]. \\)\n\n152. Corol. 3. And for a single life \\( A, \\) it appears, in the same manner, that \\( A = av(1 + 'A). \\)\n\n153. Hence, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOGARITHMS\">logarithms</a>, we have these equations,","sp":655,"ep":656},{"h":"ANNUITIES","t":"Upon which it may be observed, that \\( \\lambda v + \\lambda a \\), the sum of the first two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOGARITHMS\">logarithms</a> that are employed in determining \\( \\lambda \\) from \\( \\lambda a \\), also enters the operation whereby \\( \\lambda b \\) is determined from \\( \\lambda (ab) \\). And that \\( \\lambda v + \\lambda a + \\lambda b \\), the sum of the first three logarithms that serve to determine \\( \\lambda b \\) from \\( \\lambda (ab) \\), is also required to determine \\( \\lambda c \\) from \\( \\lambda (abc) \\); which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> may be extended in a similar manner to any greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> lives.\n\n154. By these means it is easy to complete a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> of the values of annuities <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> single lives of all ages; beginning with the oldest in the table, and proceeding regularly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> by age to the youngest.\n\nAlso a table of the values of any number of joint lives, the lives in each succeeding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a>, in any one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of operations, (according to the retrograde order of the ages in which they are computed), being one year younger respectively than those in the preceding combination.\n\nAnd, if a table of single lives be computed first, then of two joint lives, next of three joint lives, and so on; the calculations made for the preceding tables <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> use for the succeeding.\n\n155. Having shown how to compute tables of the values of annuities on single and joint lives, we shall, in what follows, always suppose those values to be given.\n\n156. Let the value of an annuity on the joint continuance of any number of lives, \\( A, B, C, \\ldots \\) that is not to be entered upon until the expiration of \\( t \\) years be denoted by \\( t(ABC \\&c.) \\).\n\nThen, if it were certain that all the lives would survive the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a>, since the value of the annuity at the expiration of the term would be \\( t(ABC \\&c.) \\), its present value would be \\( v^t \\cdot t(ABC \\&c.) \\).\n\nBut the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> that all the lives will survive the term is \\( t(abc \\&c.) \\), therefore\n\n\\[ t(ABC \\&c.) = t(abc \\&c.) \\cdot v^t \\cdot t(ABC \\&c.). \\]\n\nIn the same manner, it appears, that for a single life \\( A \\),\n\n\\[ t(A) = av^t \\cdot t(A). \\]\n\n157. Let an annuity for the term of \\( t \\) years only, dependent upon the joint continuance of any number of lives, \\( A, B, C, \\ldots \\) be denoted by \\( t(ABC \\&c.) \\); and, since this temporary annuity, together with an annuity on the joint continuance of the same lives deferred for the same term, will evidently be of the same value as an annuity to be entered upon immediately, and enjoyed during their whole joint continuance, we have \\( t(ABC \\&c.) + t(ABC \\&c.) = ABC \\&c.; \\) whence,\n\n\\[ t(ABC \\&c.) = ABC \\&c.; \\] and for a single life \\( A \\),\n\n\\[ t(A) = A - t(A). \\]\n\nPROB. II.\n\n158. To determine the present value of an annuity on the survivor of the two lives \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), (155), which we designate thus, \\( AB \\).\n\nSolution.\n\nThe probability that the survivor of these two lives will outlive the term of \\( n \\) years, was shown in No. 141, to be \\( a + b - ab \\); therefore, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> as in No. 146, it will be found, that the present value of the \\( n \\)th year's rent of this annuity is\n\n\\[ \\left[ a + b - ab \\<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>]^n v^n, \\] and the value of all the rents thereof will be \\( S \\left[ a + b - ab \\right]^n v^n \\), <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> \\( S_{av}^n + S_{bv}^n - S_{abv}^n \\); so that \\( AB = A + B - AB \\) (147), agreeably to No. 48.\n\nPROB. III.\n\n159. To determine the present value of an annuity on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> survivor of three lives, \\( A, B, \\) and \\( C \\), (155); which we denote thus, \\( ABC \\).\n\nSolution.\n\nThe present value of the \\( n \\)th year's rent is\n\n\\[ \\left[ a + b + c - ab - ac - bc + abc \\right]^n \\] (142 and 146); whence, it appears, as in the preceding number, that \\( ABC = A + B + C - AB - AC - BC + ABC \\), agreeably to No. 52.\n\nPROB. IV.\n\n160. To determine the present value of an annuity on the joint <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> of the last two survivors out of three lives, \\( A, B, C \\), (155); which we denote thus, \\( ABC \\).\n\nSolution.\n\nThe present value of the \\( n \\)th year's rent is\n\n\\[ \\left[ ab + ac + bc - 2abc \\right]^n \\] (143 and 146); whence, reasoning as in the two preceding numbers, we infer, that \\( ABC = AB + AC + BC - 2ABC \\), as was demonstrated otherwise in No. 51.\n\n161. Since the solutions of the last three problems were all obtained by showing each year's rent (as for instance the \\( n \\)th) of the annuity in question, to be of the same value with the aggregate of the rents for the same year, of all the annuities (taken with their proper signs) on the single and joint lives exhibited in the resulting formula: if any term of years be assigned, it is manifest that the value of such annuity for the term, must be the same as that of the aggregate of the annuities above mentioned, each for the same term.\n\nPROB. V.\n\n162. \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) being any two proposed lives now both existing, to determine the present value of an annuity receivable only while \\( A \\) survives \\( B \\).\nA rent of this annuity will only be payable at the end of the \\( n \\)th year, provided that \\( B \\) be then dead, and \\( A \\) living; but the probability of \\( B \\) being then dead is \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\), and that of \\( A \\) being then living \\( a \\), and these two events are independent; therefore, the probability of their both happening, or that of the rent being received, is \\( (1 - \\frac{b}{n})a = \\frac{a}{n}(ab) \\); the present value of that rent is, therefore, \\( \\left[ \\frac{a}{n}(ab) \\right]e^n \\); whence, it follows, that the required value of the annuity on the life of \\( A \\) after that of \\( B \\), is \\( A - AB \\), agreeably to No. 60.\n\n163. If the payment for the annuity which was the subject of the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a>, is not to be made in present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, but by a constant annual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREMIUM\">premium</a> \\( p \\) at the end of each year, while both the lives survive; since \\( AB \\) is the number of years purchase (6) that an annuity on the joint continuance of those lives is worth, the value of \\( p \\) will be determined by this equation, \\( p \\cdot AB = A - AB \\), whence we have \\( p = \\frac{A}{AB} - 1 \\).\n\n164. But if one premium \\( p \\) is to be paid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> now, and an equal premium at the end of each year while both the lives survive, we shall have \\( p \\cdot (1 + AB) = A - AB \\), and \\( p = \\frac{A - AB}{1 + AB} \\).\n\n165. For <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMERICAL\">numerical</a> examples illustrative of the formulae given from No. 158 to the present; see Nos. 66\u201474.\n\n**Prob. vi.**\n\n166. \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are in possession of an annuity on the life of the survivor of them, which, if either of them die before a third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> \\( C \\), is then to be divided equally between \\( C \\) and the survivor during their joint lives; to determine the value of \\( C \\)'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>.\n\nSolution.\n\nThat at the end of the \\( n \\)th year there will be\n\n| dead | living |\n|------|--------|\n| \\( A \\) | \\( BC \\) |\n| \\( B \\) | \\( AC \\) |\n\nThe probability, multiplied by \\( C \\)'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> of the annuity in that circumstance, is\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{(1-a)}{n}(bc) + \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{(bc)}{n}(abc) \\right] \\right)\n\\]\n\nand the sum of these being \\( \\frac{1}{2}(ac) + \\frac{1}{2}(bc) - \\frac{1}{2}(abc) \\), the value of \\( C \\)'s interest is \\( \\frac{1}{2}AC + \\frac{1}{2}BC - ABC \\).\n\n**Prob. vii.**\n\n167.

As soon as any two of the three lives, \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\), are extinct, \\( D \\) or his heirs are to enter upon an annuity; which they are to enjoy during the remainder of the survivor's life; to determine the value of \\( D \\)'s interest therein.\n\nSolution.\n\nThat at the end of \\( n \\) years there will be\n\n| dead | living |\n|------|--------|\n| \\( AB \\) | \\( C \\) |\n| \\( AC \\) | \\( B \\) |\n| \\( BC \\) | \\( A \\) |\n\nThe probability is\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{(1-a)}{n}(bc) + \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{(bc)}{n}(abc) \\right] \\right)\n\\]\n\nand the sum of all these being \\( \\frac{1}{2}(ab) + \\frac{1}{2}(ac) + \\frac{1}{2}(abc) \\), the value of \\( D \\)'s interest is\n\n\\[\nA + B + C - 2AB - 2AC - 2BC + 3ABC.\n\\]\n\n170. The last four may be sufficient to show the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of proceeding with any similar problems.\n\n171. Let \\( \\frac{m}{(abc, \\&c.)} \\) denote the probability that the\nAlgebraical last \\( m \\) survivors out of \\( m + \\mu \\) lives \\( A, B, C, \\ldots \\) will jointly survive the term of \\( t \\) years.

Then, if \\( \\mu \\) be equal to 0, it will be \\( ABC, \\ldots \\) the value of an annuity on the joint continuance of all the lives; when \\( m = 1 \\), it will be \\( ABC, \\ldots \\) the value of an annuity on the last survivor of them. The values of annuities on the last survivor of two and of three lives, will be denoted as in Nos. 158 and 159 respectively; and that of an annuity on the joint continuance of the last two survivors out of three lives, as in No. 160.\n\nThe value of an annuity on the last \\( m \\) survivors out of these \\( m + \\mu \\) lives, according as it is limited to the term of \\( t \\) years, or deferred during that term, will also be denoted by \\( \\frac{m}{ABC, \\ldots} \\) or \\( \\frac{m}{ABC, \\ldots} \\) (156 and 157.)\n\n**Prob.

An annuity certain for the term of \\( t + r \\) years, is to be enjoyed by \\( P \\) and his heirs during the joint existence of the last \\( m \\) survivors out of \\( m + \\mu \\) lives, \\( A, B, C, \\ldots \\); and if that joint existence fail before the expiration of \\( t \\) years, the annuity is to go to \\( Q \\) and his heirs, for the remainder of the term; to determine the value of \\( Q \\)'s interest in that annuity.\n\n**Solution.**\n\n\\( Q \\)'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a> may be distinguished into two parts:\n\n1st, That of enjoying the annuity during the term of \\( t \\) years.\n2d, That of enjoying it after the expiration of that term.\n\nThe sum of the present values of the interests of \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\), together in the annuity for the term of \\( t \\) years, is manifestly equal to the whole present value of the annuity certain for that term; that is, equal to \\( \\frac{1-v^t}{r} \\) (113 and 146); and the value of \\( P \\)'s interest for the term of \\( t \\) years, is \\( \\frac{m}{ABC, \\ldots} \\) (171); therefore the value of \\( Q \\)'s interest for the same term is \\( \\frac{1-v^t}{r} - \\frac{m}{ABC, \\ldots} \\).\n\nThe present value of the annuity certain for \\( r \\) years after \\( t \\) years is \\( \\frac{v^t(1-v^r)}{r} \\) (114 and 146); and \\( Q \\) and his heirs will receive this annuity, if the joint continuance of the last \\( m \\) survivors above mentioned fail before the expiration of \\( t \\) years; but the probability of their joint continuance failing in the term, is \\( \\frac{1}{(abc, \\ldots)} \\); therefore, the value of \\( Q \\)'s interest in the annuity to be received after \\( t \\) years, is\n\n\\[ \\left[1-\\frac{1}{(abc, \\ldots)}\\right] \\frac{v^t(1-v^r)}{r}; \\]\n\nand the whole value of \\( Q \\)'s interest, is \\( \\frac{1}{r} \\left[1-v^t - v^r(1-v^r)\\right] \\frac{m}{ABC, \\ldots} \\)\n\n\\[ = \\frac{m}{ABC, \\ldots} \\]\n\n173.

Corol. 2. When the term \\( t \\) is not less than the greatest joint continuance of any \\( m \\) of the proposed lives, according to the tables of mortality adapted to them, \\( (abc, \\ldots) = 0 \\), and \\( \\frac{m}{ABC, \\ldots} = ABC, \\ldots \\); therefore, in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> formula of No. 172 becomes \\( \\frac{1-v^t}{r} \\frac{m}{ABC, \\ldots} \\); that is, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a> of the value of an annuity certain for the whole term \\( r + t \\), above that of an annuity on the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> of joint continuance of the last \\( m \\) surviving lives.\n\n175.

And if the annual produce of the estate, clear of all deductions, were L. 100, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> to the reversion would now be worth L. 599, 18s., agreeably to No. 76.\n\n177. Ex. 2.

An annuity for the term of 70 years certain from this time, is to revert to Q and his heirs at the extinction of the survivor of two lives, A and B, now aged 40 and 50 years respectively; the interest of money being 5 per cent., it is required to determine the value of Q's interest in this annuity.\n\nThe algebraical expression of the value is,\n\n\\[ \\frac{1-v^{70}}{r} - AB \\] (174 and 171).\n\nBut by the last example\n\n\\[ \\frac{1-v^{70}}{r} = 19.34268 \\]\n\nand by No. 66. \\( AB = 15.06600 \\)\n\nSo that the required value is 4.27668 years' purchase; and if the annuity be L. 1000, the present value of the reversion will be L. 4276, 13s. 7d.\n\nIV. OF ASSURANCES ON LIVES.\n\n179. Let the present value of the assurance (77 and 78) of L. 1 on the life of A be denoted by the Old English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> \\( \\mathcal{A} \\), and that of an assurance on the joint continuance of any number of lives A, B, C, &c. by \\( \\mathcal{ABC} \\), &c. Also, let the value of an assurance on the joint continuance of any m of them, out of the whole number \\( m + \\mu \\) be denoted by \\( \\mathcal{ABC} \\), &c.\n\n180. And, in every case, let us designate the annual premium (83) for an assurance, by prefixing the character \\( \\circ \\) to the symbol for the single premium; so that \\( \\circ \\mathcal{A} \\) may denote the annual premium for an assurance on the life of A; \\( \\circ \\mathcal{ABC} \\), &c. the same for an assurance on the joint continuance of all the lives, A, B, C, &c.; and \\( \\circ \\mathcal{ABC} \\), &c. the annual premium for an assurance on the joint continuance of the last m survivors out of the whole number \\( m + \\mu \\) of those lives.\n\n181. Then will \\( \\circ \\mathcal{A} \\) and \\( \\circ \\mathcal{A} \\), \\( \\circ \\mathcal{ABC} \\), &c. and \\( \\circ \\mathcal{ABC} \\), &c., \\( \\circ \\mathcal{ABC} \\), &c. and \\( \\circ \\mathcal{ABC} \\), &c. designate the single and annual premiums for assurances on the same life or lives for the term of t years only.\n\n182. To determine \\( \\left( \\frac{m}{t} \\mathcal{ABC} \\right) \\) the present value of an assurance on the last m survivors out of \\( m + \\mu \\) lives A, B, C, &c. for the term of t years only; that is, the present value of L. 1, to be received upon the joint continuance of these last m survivors failing in the term.\n\nSolution.\n\nBy reasoning as in No. 79, it will be found, that a perpetuity, the first payment of which is to be made at the end of the year in which the last m survivors out of these \\( m + \\mu \\) lives may fail in the term, will be of the same present value as \\( \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{r} \\right) \\frac{1}{1-v} \\) pounds to be received in the same event (112 and 146); but, in No. 173, the value of the reversion of such a perpetuity in that event, was shown to be\n\n\\[ \\frac{v}{1-v} \\left[ 1 - \\frac{m}{t} \\mathcal{ABC} \\right] = \\frac{m}{t} \\mathcal{ABC} \\], &c.; whence it is manifest, that \\( \\frac{m}{t} \\mathcal{ABC} \\), &c.\n\n\\[ = \\frac{v}{1-v} \\left[ 1 - \\frac{m}{t} \\mathcal{ABC} \\right] - \\frac{m}{t} \\mathcal{ABC} \\], &c.\n\n183. Since the annual premium for this assurance must be paid at the commencement of every year in the term, while the last m surviving lives all subsist (83); besides the premium paid down now, one must be paid at the expiration of every year in the term except the last, provided that these last m survivors all outlive it; but the present value of L. 1 to be received upon their surviving that last year is\n\n\\[ \\frac{m}{t} \\mathcal{ABC} \\], &c., therefore all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> premiums are now worth \\( \\frac{m}{t} \\mathcal{ABC} \\), &c. \\( \\frac{m}{t} \\mathcal{ABC} \\), &c. \\( \\frac{m}{t} \\mathcal{ABC} \\), &c. \\( \\frac{m}{t} \\mathcal{ABC} \\), &c.\n\n\\[ v \\left[ 1 - \\frac{m}{t} \\mathcal{ABC} \\right] - \\frac{m}{t} \\mathcal{ABC} \\], &c. = 1 - \\frac{m}{t} \\mathcal{ABC} \\), &c.\n\n\\[ - (1-v) \\left[ 1 - \\frac{m}{t} \\mathcal{ABC} \\right] + \\frac{m}{t} \\mathcal{ABC} \\], &c., whence we have\n\n\\[ \\circ \\mathcal{ABC} \\], &c. = \\frac{1}{1-v} \\left[ 1 - \\frac{m}{t} \\mathcal{ABC} \\right] + \\frac{m}{t} \\mathcal{ABC} \\], &c.\n\n\\[ v = 1. \\]\n\n184.

In these Supplemental volumes, we propose to introduce all the recent discoveries in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZOOLOGY\">Zoology</a>, and also to avail ourselves of the opportunity thus afforded, of describing the various classes of animals under an arrangement more accordant to the improved views of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">Science</a>, and to the Order of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">Nature</a>. We shall have occasion fully to explain the principles upon which our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> is founded, in the article ZOOLOGY. At present, it is only necessary to mention, that all the different branches of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> department of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">Natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> will be treated of under these heads: viz. ANNULOSA, CIRRHIPEDAE, INSECTA, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOLLUSCA\">MOLLUSCA</a>, RADIATA, and VERTEBROSA. From these heads, references will be made to the zoological articles in the body of the work, and also from the older names to the corresponding appellations in the arrangement adopted in these volumes.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> ANNULOSA (from Annulus, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol18.html#article-RING\">ring</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> segment), is applied to animals whose bodies are more or less divided transversely into segments.\n\n**<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLASS\">Class</a> I.\u2014<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CRUSTACEA\">CRUSTACEA</a>.**\n\n**History.**\n\nAll the Crustacea, as their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> imports, are enveloped in a crust or shell (crusta). Many of the larger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> were known to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Naturalists. They were named Crustacea by the Latins, Malacostracoi (\u039c\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9) by the Greeks. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a> has dedicated a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> to the species known to him; Athen\u00e6us enumerates those used as food; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HIPPOCRATES\">Hippocrates</a> has made mention of such species as were considered useful in medicine.\n\nTo the observations of Aristotle, very little was added by Pliny; and from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> until that of Rondeletius, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BELON\">Belon</a>, Gesner, Aldrovandus, and Johnson, who placed the Crustacea between the Fishes and Mollusca, little or nothing was done that tends in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> to elucidate the natural history or structure of these animals.\n\nBy the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> reformer Linn\u00e9, they were arranged under the genera Monoculus, Cancer, and Oniscus, along with apterous insects; but the most prejudiced of his followers now admit that they have characters sufficient to establish them as a distinct class.\n\nThis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYPE\">type</a> of animals was proposed in one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">General</a> Arrangements of the Annales de Mus\u00e9um, by M. G. Cuvier. It comprehends five classes, the classification of which will form the subject of the present article.\n\nAs the leading characters of the classes are very obvious, we shall, in the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, lay them before our readers through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDIUM\">medium</a> of a table, and shall then detail them more fully.\n\n- **Class 1. CRUSTACEA.** Branchiae or gills for respiration. Legs \u2020 for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>.\n- **Class 2. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MYRIAPODA\">MYRIAPODA</a>.** Trache\u00e6 or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>-tubes for respiration. Legs more than eight. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">Head</a> distinct from the thorax. Antenn\u00e6 two.\n- **Class 3. ARACHNIDES.** Trache\u00e6 for respiration. Legs eight or six. Head not distinct from the thorax. Antenn\u00e6 none.\n- **Class 4. INSECTA.** Trache\u00e6 for respiration. Legs six. Head distinct from the thorax. Antenn\u00e6 two.\n- **Class 5. VERMES.** Trache\u00e6 for respiration. Legs none. Antenn\u00e6 none.\n\nJ. C. Fabricius, a pupil of Linn\u00e9, divided the Crustacea from insects, and formed several distinct classes for their reception; but as he has altered his system in his different works, it seems necessary only to state the last, which is given in the Supplement to his Entomologia Systematica. In this work is the following arrangement:\n\n- **Class POLYGONATA.** Many maxill\u00e6 within the lip.\n  Gen. 1. Oniscus, 2. Ligia, 3. Idotea, 4. Cymothoa, 5. Monoculus.\n- **Class KLEISTAGNATHA.** Many maxill\u00e6, closing the mouth. Lip none.\n  Gen. 1. Cancer, 2. Calappa, 3. Ocypode, 4. Leucosia, 5. Parthenope, 6. Inachus, 7. Dromia, 8. Dorippe, 9. Orithya, 10. Portunus, 11. Matutin, 12. Hippa, 13. Symethis, 14. Limulus.\n- **Class EXOCHINATA.** Many maxill\u00e6 outside the lip, covered by the palpi.\n  Gen. 1. Albunea, 2. Scyllarus, 3. Pallinurus, 4. Palaeemon, 5. Alpheus, 6. Astacus, 7. Penaeus, 8. Cran-gon, 9. Pagurus, 10. Galathea, 11. Squilla, 12. Podsydon, 14.

In the present article, we propose to give the characters and economy of the Genera, and an example of one Species of each, with the exception of INSECTA, which will be treated of under that head in a separate article.\n\n\u2021 By this term, we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> those organs which actually perform the functions of legs.

Cuvier, the Crustacea were considered as forming a class, which he placed between the Vermes and Insecta. This indefatigable observer discovered, that the Crustacea breathed by branchiae or gills, and he disposed them into three great sections, viz.\n\nI. Monoculus, including the genera, 1. Limulus, 2. Caligus, 3. Cyclops, 4. Apus, 5. Polyphemus of M\u00fcller.\n\nII. Cancer, comprehending the genera, 6. Cancer, 7. Inachus, 8.

Cymothoa of Fabricius.\n\nLamarck, in his Syst\u00e8me des Animaux sans Vertebres, has disposed the Crustacea into the two following orders, viz.\n\nOrd. I. Crustace's pediociques, including the genera, *1. Cancer, 2. Calappa, 3. Ocypode, 4. Grapsus, 5. Dorippe, 6. Portunus, 7. Podophthalmus, 8. Matuta, 9. Maja, 10. Porcellana, 11. Leucosia, 12.

Crust. et Insect. i. 140.\n\nInhabits France and England.\n\nFamily III. Araneide\u00e6.\n\nThe animals composing this most natural family, are familiarly denominated spiders, and, as we have before mentioned, were included by Linna, Fabricius, and other authors, in one genus, which they called Aranea; but as the species are very numerous, they were obliged to divide them into sections, which they distinguished by the situation of their eyes. These organs are immoveable, and consist each of a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENS\">lens</a>, which deprives them of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> of seeing in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>.\n\nThe Araneide\u00e6 are by far the most interesting animals of that class of which they form the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYPE\">type</a>; and consequently their habits and structure excited the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of naturalists at a very early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a> and Pliny were acquainted with those species that have the power of darting out long threads. Vide Aristotelis Historia Animalium, lib. ix. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>. 89, and Plini Hist. Naturalis, lib. xii. cap. 74.\n\nSpiders frequently change their skins, and their skins are often found in their webs, being dry and transparent, with their mandibles attached to them. When about to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> their covering, they suspend themselves in some corner, and creep out of a crack which takes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> on their back, gradually withdrawing their legs from the skin, as if from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLOVE\">glove</a>. They have likewise the power of reproducing their legs; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> in which this takes place, was made known to us by Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a> Banks, and which we shall relate as nearly as possible in the words of that accurate observer of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>.\n\nAs he was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> one evening in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a>, one of the web-spinning spiders, of more than the middle size, passed over some papers on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>, holding a fly in its mouth. Much surprised to see a spider of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> walking about with its prey, and being struck with somewhat unusual in its gait, he caught it and placed it within a glass for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>; when instead of eight, he perceived that it had but three legs, which accounted for the inability of the creature to spin its web; but the curious circumstance of its having changed its usual economy, and having become a hunting instead of a spinning spider, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as a wish to learn whether its legs would be renewed, induced him to keep the animal in the glass, from whence it could not escape, and to observe its conduct.\n\nOn the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> the animal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATE\">ate</a> two flies, given to it, by sucking out the juices, but left the carcasses entire. Two or three days afterwards, it devoured the body and head of a fly, leaving only the wings and legs. After this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, it sometimes sucked and sometimes ate the fly given to it. At first it consumed two flies in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, but afterwards not more than one in two days. Its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXCREMENT\">excrement</a>, which it voided, was at first of a milky-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, but afterwards the white had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> spot in the centre, of a more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> appearance than the surrounding fluid.\n\nSoon after its confinement, it attempted to form a web on the side of the vessel, but performed the business very slowly and clumsily, from the want of the proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of legs. In about a fortnight it had completed a small web, upon which it generally sat.\n\nA <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> after having been caught, it shed its skin, leaving the slough on the web. After this change five new legs appeared, not half as long as the other three legs, and of very little use to the animal in walking. These new members, however, extended themselves a little in three days, and became half as long as the old ones. The web was now increased, and the animal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> immoveably sitting on it in the daytime, unless drawn from it, or attracted by a fly thrown to it as its usual provision.\n\nTwenty-nine days afterwards, it again lost its skin, leaving the slough hanging in the web, opposite to a hollow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CELL\">cell</a> it had woven, so as to prevent it from\nArachnides being completely seen when lodged in it. The legs were now larger than before the change of skin, and they grew somewhat longer still in three or four days, but did not attain the size of the old legs.\n\nThe animal now increased its web, and being put into a small bowl, as a more commodious residence, soon renewed a better web than the first. In this state it was left on the first of November. No farther observations have yet been made on the subject.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> use of the Araneidea; in the economy of nature, seems to be that of preventing the too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> increase of insects.\n\nThe palpi of the different sexes should be carefully described, as they seem to afford some most excellent subsidiary generic characters.\n\n**Stirps 1.**\n\nGen. 15. **Mygale.

Tab. des Aran.* 49.\n\nInhabits houses in Europe; spinning its web in a place where there is a cavity, such as the corner of a room. The mode of constructing the web is curious. Having chosen a convenient situation, she fixes one end of her thread to the wall, and passes on to the other side, dragging the thread along with her till she arrive at the other side, where she fixes the other end of it. Thus she passes and repasses until she has made as many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> threads as are necessary; she then crosses these by other threads. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">net</a> is intended for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTURE\">capture</a> of her prey, and, in addition to it, the animal prepares a cell for herself, where she remains concealed, and on the watch. Between the cell and the net, the spider builds a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a> of threads, which, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> with the threads of the large net, both gives her intelligence when any thing touches the web, and enables her to pass quickly in order to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> it.\n\nGen. 25. *Agelena*.

This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> was applied to these animals by the Latins; by the Greeks they were named Entoma (insecta), from in, into; and \u1f10\u03c1\u03c5\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1, to cut. Insects were so named, because their bodies are composed of many joints or segments, on which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> several of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> and older naturalists placed them with the classes Crustacea, Myriapoda, Arachnides, and Vermes.\n\nInsects constitute the most considerable portion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANIMATED\">animated</a> nature, on which account they become interesting; and very worthy of philosophic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>; and consequently, from the earliest period, of which any authentic records remain, the study of them has obtained a very great portion of attention.\n\nThe oldest records on this subject are to be found in the sacred writings, where mention is made of locusts, flies, and caterpillars; and it is probable that Moses had acquired some knowledge of insects from the Egyptian sages, as his writings abound with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> relating to insects.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HIPPOCRATES\">Hippocrates</a>, as we are told by Pliny, wrote on insects, and the writings of the earlier Greek and Latin philosophers quoted by Pliny, afford extracts of his labours.\n\nAristotle, in his History of Animals, has devoted a very considerable portion of his attention to insects, which he called \u1f10\u03c1\u03c5\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1, and has described their general external structure with great accuracy; but we cannot enter into a detail of what was done by this great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, who has laid the foundation of the modern systems; and we must also pass over in silence, the little that has been observed by \u00c6lian, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEMOCRITUS\">Democritus</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARISTARCHUS\">Aristarchus</a>, and others of less note, and state generally that Pliny, in the eleventh book of his Historia Naturalis, treats of insects; but his observations are copies chiefly from the works of Aristotle. From the time of this author, until the overthrow of the Roman empire, the study seems to have been totally disregarded.\n\nSorry as we feel at being under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of omitting to trace the rise of this interesting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>, yet we shall give a sketch of the systems of every writer, that the rise of the systematic part may be rendered clear to everyone interested with that branch of the science, which is the foundation on which the natural history is built.\n\nAldrovandus in 1602, published a very voluminous work, De Animalibus Insectis, in which he divides insects into Terrestrial and Aquatic.\n\nIn 1612, Wolfgang Frenzius published Historia Animalium Sacra, which contains some new observations, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a> of insects into Aerial, Aquatic, and Terrestrial.\n\nSwammerdam, who published his Historia Insectorum Generalis in 1669, divided genuine insects into, 1st, Those which, after leaving the egg, appear under the form of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> insect, but have no wings, which parts are afterwards produced; 2dly, Those insects which appear, when hatched from the egg, under the form of a larva (caterpillar), which, when full grown, changes into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHRYSALIS\">chrysalis</a>, where it remains until its parts are fit to be developed; 3dly, Those who, having attained the pupa (chrysalis or nympha) state, do not divest themselves of their skin. His other division refers to animals of the classes Arachnides, Crustacea, and Myriapoda, and the whole of his work contains much valuable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> on the structure and economy of these animals.\n\nIn 1735, Linne published the first edition of his Systema Naturae, sive Regna tria Naturae Systematice disposita per classes, ordines, genera, et species, in which work insects are distributed into four orders, according to the number and form of their wings.\n\n1. Coleoptera.\n2. Angioptera.\n3. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-HEMIPTERA\">Hemiptera</a>.\n4. Aptera.\n\nWith the last order he included Crustacea, Arachnides, Myriapoda, Vermes, and certain Zoophytes; but in subsequent editions of this work, he separated the Vermes, as Aristotle had done before him, and established them as a class distinct from insects.\n\nSchaeffer in 1741 published a valuable work, under the title Icones Insectorum circa Ratisbonam Indigenorum. The classification proposed by this author differs entirely from that of Linne, and approaches in some respects that proposed by Geoffroy; yet it is so far distinct, that, being a system of considerable repute, it may not be amiss to give an outline of it in this place. He divides insects into seven Orders, which he terms Classes.\n\nI. Coleoptero-macroptera. Insects with long crustaceous elytra.\nII. Coleoptero-microptera. Insects with short crustaceous elytra.\nIII. Coleoptero-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYMENOPTERA\">hymenoptera</a>. Insects with half crustaceous elytra.\nIV. Hymeno-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEPIDOPTERA\">lepidoptera</a>. Insects with transparent wings.\nV. Hymeno-gymnoptera. Insects with naked membranaceous wings.\nVI. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-DIPTERA\">Diptera</a>. Insects with two wings.\nVII. Aptera. Insects without wings, amongst which spiders, &c., were comprehended.\n\nIn 1764, Geoffroy published his most valuable system of insects, under the title, Histoire Abr\u00e9g\u00e9e des Insectes, &c., in which these animals are arranged into six sections:\n\nI. Coleoptera. Wings covered with elytra; mouth with jaws.\nII. Hemiptera. Upper wings resembling elytra; mouth bent under the thorax.\nIII. Tetraptera alis farinaceis. Wings four, covered by little scales.\nIV. Tetraptera alis nudis. Wings four, naked, membranaceous.\nV. Diptera. Wings two. Haltares or balancers, under the origin of the wings.\nVI. Aptera. Wings none.\n\nLike his predecessors, Geoffroy included Crustacea, &c., under the title Aptera.\n\nIn 1789, Linn\u00e9 produced the twelfth edition of his Systema Naturae; and, as this was the last systematic work of that illustrious naturalist, we shall state his entomological arrangement. He divides insects into seven orders, deducing the characters from the wings, but he still retained the Crustacea, Myriapoda, and Arachnides, amongst the apterous insects.\n\nOrder I. Coleoptera (from \u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2, a sheath, and \u1f00\u03c0\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, a wing), including those insects having crustaceous shells or elytra, which shut together and form a longitudinal suture down the back. In many, the abdomen is wholly covered by these elytra; in others partially.\n\nOrder II. Hemiptera (from \u1f21\u03bc\u03af\u03c2, half, and \u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd). These animals have their elytra half crustaceous, and half membranaceous, or of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> intermediate between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a> and membrane.\n\nOrder III. Lepidoptera (from \u03bb\u03b5\u03c0\u03af\u03c2, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a>, and \u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd). Insects with four wings <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMBRICATED\">imbricated</a> with scales.\n\nOrder IV. Neuroptera (from \u03bd\u03b5\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd, a nerve, and \u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd). Insects with four transparent wings, reticulated with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NERVES\">nerves</a>.\n\nOrder V. Hymenoptera (from \u1f51\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, a membrane, and \u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd). Insects with four naked membranaceous wings.\n\nOrder VI. Diptera (from \u03b4\u03cd\u03bf, two, and \u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd). Insects with two wings.\n\nOrder VII. Aptera (from \u1f00, without, and \u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd). Insects destitute of wings.\n\nIn 1776, J. C. Fabricius, a pupil of Linn\u00e9, published a new system of entomology, under the title Systema Entomologiae, in which the principles of a new mode of classification, founded on the organs of deglutition and mastication, is for the first time developed. This system, which has undergone several modifications, is named the Cibarian System, of which we shall say more, when speaking of the most improved form in which it has been given to the world.\n\nScopoli, in 1777, published his Introductio <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AD\">ad</a> Historiam Naturalem, in which work he divides insects into five tribes, under the singular appellations of:\n\n1. Swammerdamia-lucifuga, 2. Geoffroy-gymnoptera, 3. Roeselii-lepidoptera, 4. Reaumurii-probosidea, 5. Frischii-Coleoptera; identifying each tribe by the name of that author who has, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, been most successful in the explanation of that to which his name is attached.\n\nThe Lucifuga includes the lice; Gymnoptera, his halterata, aculeata and caudata; Lepidoptera, the moths and butterflies; Proboscidea, he has divided into terrestrial and aquatic, and the Coleoptera he divides into those inhabiting water, and those the land.\n\nIn 1793, P. A. Latreille published his Precis du Caract\u00e8res des Genres, in which he divided insects into, 1. Coleoptera, 2. Orthoptera, 3. Hemiptera, 4. Neuroptera, 5. Lepidoptera, 6. Suctoria, 7. Thysanura, 8. Parasita; and under the further terms, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol2.html#article-ACEPHALA\">Acephala</a>, Entomostraca, Crustacea, and Myriapoda, he has comprehended the Crustacea, Myriapoda, and Insects, Arachnides.\n\nIn 1798, J. C. Fabricius produced his last general systematic work, his Supplementum Entomologiae Systematice, which presents an outline of his system in its latest state; and which, being the result of much knowledge, demands a considerable portion of attention. In this work he divides genuine insects into the following Orders, which he named Classes. The omitted classes are referable to Crustacea, Myriapoda, and Insecta, as already shown.\n\nClass I. Eleuterata. Maxillae naked, free, bearing palpi.\n\nClass II. Ulonata. Maxillae covered by an obtuse galea, or mouth-piece.\n\nClass III. Synistata. Maxillae elbowed at their base, and connected with the labium.\n\nClass IV. Piezata. Maxillae corneous, compressed, often elongate.\n\nClass V. Odonata. Maxillae corneous, dentated. Palpi two.\n\nClass XI. Glossata. Mouth with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRAL\">spiral</a> tongue reflexed between the palpi.\n\nClass XII. Ryngota. Mouth with a rostrum and articulated sheath.\n\nClass XIII. Antliata. Mouth with an inarticulate haustellum.\n\nIn the \"Entomologie Helvetique,\" a work published in 1798, Clairville, its author, has arranged insects in the following manner:\n\n* PTEROPHORA; MANDIBULATA. With wings and jaws.\n\nSection 1. Elytroptera. Wings crustaceous.\n\n2. Deratoptera. Wings coriaceous.\n\n3. Dictyoptera. Wings reticulated.\n\n4. Phlebotoptera. Wings veined.\n\n** PTEROPHORA; HAUSTELLATA. With wings and an haustellum.\n\n5. Halteriptera. Wings with poisers.\n\n6. Lepidoptera. Wings with powder.\n\n7. Hemimeroptera. Wings partly obscure, partly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIAPHANOUS\">diaphanous</a>.\n\n*** APTERA; HAUSTELLATA. Without wings; with a sucker.\n\n8. Rophoptera. Sucker sharp.\n\n**** APTERA; MANDIBULATA. Without wings; with jaws.\n\n9. Pododunera. Legs formed for running.\n\nIn 1800, Cuvier, with the assistance of Dum\u00e9ril, published his Anatomie Compar\u00e9e, in which the organization of insects is treated of at great length.\n\nIn 1801, J. B. Lamarck produced his Syst\u00e8me des Animaux sans Vert\u00e8bres, in which work he has separated the Crustacea from Insects, and proposed the Arachnides as a separate and distinct class. Some of the animals which we conceive to be genuine insects, he has placed with the Arachnides, the rest he distributes into the following Orders:\n\n* With mandibles and jaws.\n\nOrder I. Coleoptera. Two wings, folded transversely, and covered by coriaceous elytra.\n\nOrder II. Orthoptera. Two strait wings, folded longitudinally, and covered by submembranaceous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, or elytra.\nOrder III. Neuroptera. Four naked, reticulated, membranaceous wings.\n\n** With mandibles and with a kind of proboscis.\n\nOrder IV. Hymenoptera.\n\n*** No mandibles. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a> or sucker.\n\nOrder V. Lepidoptera. Four membranaceous wings covered with fine powder-like scales; tongue spiral.\n\nOrder VI. Hemiptera. Two wings, covered by semimembranaceous elytra.\n\nOrder VII. Diptera. Two naked wings, with balancers at their base.\n\nOrder VIII. Aptera. No wings. Mouth with an articulated trunk.\n\nIn the same year, in 1806, P. A. Latreille published his Genera Crustaceorum et Insectorum, in which he has denominated the true insects Insecta Pterodicea; and has arranged them in the following manner:\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">Century</a> I. Elythroptera.\n\nElytra two, covering the wings entirely.\n\nCohors I. Odontota.\n\nMouth with mandibles, maxillae, and lip. Wings folded.\n\nOrder I. Coleoptera. Wings transversely folded. Elytra crustaceous.\n\nOrder II. Orthoptera. Wings longitudinally folded. Elytra coriaceous.\n\nCohors II. Siphonostoma.\n\nOrder III. Hemiptera. Mouth with an articulated beak, sheathing the haustellum, formed of three setae. Wings extended; elytra generally semicoraceous or semimembranaceous, one decussating the other.\n\nCentury II. Gymnoptera.\n\nWings naked.\n\nCohors I. Odontota.\n\nMouth with mandibles, maxillae, and lip. Wings four.\n\nOrder IV. Neuroptera. Wings reticulated, most generally equal. Maxillae not sheathing the sides of the lip.\n\nOrder V. Hymenoptera. Wings veined, hinder ones smallest. Maxillae sheathing the sides of the lip.\n\nCohors II. Siphonostoma.\n\nMouth tubular, formed for sucking.\n\nOrder VI. Lepidoptera. Wings four, imbricated with scales. Mouth with a spiral tongue, formed of two lacini\u00e6; haustellum none.\n\nOrder VII. Diptera. Wings two, with haltares or balancers at their base. Mouth with a proboscis, including an haustellum that is composed of one part, or at least only geniculated at its base.\n\nOrder VIII. Suctoria. Wings and balancers none. Body formed of a series of rings. Thorax not distinct from the base of the abdomen. Mouth with a rostrum articulated from its origin, with two external valves at the base.\n\nLatreille has retained the same general arrangement in his last work, Considerations G\u00e9n\u00e9rales sur l'Ordre Naturelle, &c. but he has rejected the divisions into legions, centuries, and cohortes.\n\nDum\u00e9ril, in his Zoologie Analytique, arranges insects into eight orders, the last of which also comprehends the classes Arachnides and Myriapoda.\n\nIn 1812, De Lamarck published a little work, entitled Extrait de Cours de Zoologie du Mus\u00e9um d'Histoire Naturelle, in which he has continued the general arrangement published by him in 1801.\n\nIn 1815, Vol. IX. of the Edinburgh Encyclopedia was published, in which Dr Leach has given the following arrangement of insects into orders, and has added to them the Parasita and Thysanura, which Latreille placed with the Arachnides.","sp":699,"ep":717},{"h":"ANQUETIL","t":"a French historian, was born at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the 21st of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1723.

His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a> is censurable in many respects, and he appears to have been almost entirely destitute of the critical discernment and philosophical sagacity, which are requisite to form the character of a good historian.

Having distinguished himself as a student at the university of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, and acquired a considerable knowledge of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEBREW\">Hebrew</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, he was invited to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUXERRE\">Auxerre</a> by M. de Caylus, then the Bishop of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIOCESE\">diocese</a>. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRELATE\">prelate</a> made him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEOLOGY\">theology</a>, first at the academy of his diocese, and afterwards at that of Amersfort, near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UTRECHT\">Utrecht</a>; but Anquetil had no desire to embrace the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> vocation, and devoted himself with ardour to the study of the different dialects of the Hebrew, and of the Arabic and Persian. Neither the solicitations of M. de Caylus, nor the hopes of rapid preferment, had the power to detain him at Amersfort, after he thought he had acquired every thing that was to be learnt there. He returned to Paris, where his diligent attendance at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> Library, and his ardour in the prosecution of his favourite studies, attracted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of the Abb\u00e9 Sallier, keeper of the manuscripts, who introduced him to the acquaintance of his associates and friends, whose united exertions procured for him a small salary, as student of the oriental languages. He had scarcely received this appointment, when, having accidentally laid his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> on some manuscripts in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZEND\">Zend</a>, he formed the project of a voyage to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>, with the view of discovering the works of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-ZOROASTER\">Zoroaster</a>. At this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, an expedition was preparing at the port of L'Orient, which was destined for India. M. du Perron, however, applied in vain, through his protectors, for a passage; and seeing no other means of accomplishing his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>, he enlisted as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> soldier, and set out from Paris, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KNAPSACK\">knapsack</a> on his back, on the 7th of November 1754. His friends procured his discharge; and the minister, affected by this romantic zeal for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>, granted him a free passage, a seat at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">captain</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>, and a salary, the amount of which was to be fixed by the governor of the French settlements in India. After a passage of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> months, Anquetil landed, on the 10th of August 1755, at Pondicherry. Here he remained no longer than was necessary to make himself <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> Persian, and then hastened to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHANDERNAGORE\">Chandernagore</a>, where he thought to acquire the Sanscrit. But in this he was deceived; and he was on the point of returning, when a serious complaint threatened his life. He had scarcely escaped from this danger, when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-WAR\">war</a> was declared between France and England; Chandernagore was taken; and Anquetil resolved to return to Pondicherry by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a>. After a journey of one hundred days, in the course of which, he encountered many adventures, and suffered many hardships, he arrived at Pondicherry. Here he found one of his brothers who had arrived from France, and embarked with him for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SURAT\">Surat</a>; but, with the view of exploring the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, he landed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAHE\">Mahe</a>, and proceeded on foot. It was at Surat that he succeeded, by perseverance and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> in his intercourse with the native Priests, in acquiring a sufficient knowledge of the languages, to enable him to translate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DICTIONARY\">Dictionary</a>.\ncalled the *Vedidad-Sade*, and some other works.\n\nFrom thence he proposed going to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENARES\">Benares</a>, to study the languages, antiquities, and sacred laws of the Hindoos; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTURE\">capture</a> of Pondicherry obliged him to return to France. He accordingly embarked on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOARD\">board</a> an English vessel, and landed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PORTSMOUTH\">Portsmouth</a>, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of November 1761. After spending some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, and visiting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a>, he set out for Paris, where he arrived on the 4th of May 1762, without fortune, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> the desire of acquiring any; but esteeming himself rich in the possession of an hundred and eighty oriental manuscripts, besides other curiosities. The Abb\u00e9 Barth\u00e9lemy, and his other friends, procured for him a pension, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> and appointments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERPRETER\">Interpreter</a> for the oriental languages at the royal library. In 1763, the Academy of the *Belles Lettres* received him among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of its associates; and from that period, he devoted himself to the arrangement and publication of the materials he had collected during his eastern travels. In 1771, he published a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> in three volumes 4to, under the title of *Zend-Avesta*, containing collections from the sacred writings of the Persians, among which are fragments of works ascribed to Zoroaster; and he accompanied this work with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of the life of that sage. This publication must be considered as constituting a very important accession to our stores of oriental literature. A recent historian, and very competent judge, refers to the *Zend-Avesta*, as certainly the most authentic source from which we can derive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> regarding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> and institutions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> Persian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEGISLATOR\">legislator</a>. (Sir John Malcolm's *Hist. of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a>*, Vol. I. p. 193, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTE\">Note</a>.) To the *Zend-Avesta* M. Du Perron prefixed a discourse, in which he treated the University of Oxford, and some of its learned members, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIDICULE\">ridicule</a> and disrespect. Mr (afterwards Sir William) Jones replied to these invectives in an anonymous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a>, addressed to the author, written in French, with uncommon force and correctness of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a>, but at the same time, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of asperity which could only be justified by the petulance of M. Du Perron. In 1778, he published his *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEGISLATION\">Legislation</a> Orientale*, in 4to; a work in which he controverts the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of Montesquieu, and endeavours to prove, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of oriental despotism has been misrepresented by most authors; that in the empires of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TURKEY\">Turkey</a>, Persia, and Hindostan, there are codes of written <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, which equally bind the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> and subject; and that, in these three empires, the inhabitants possess both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOVEABLE\">moveable</a> and immovable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>, which they enjoy with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> security. His *Recherches Historiques et Geographiques sur l'Inde*, appeared in 1786, and formed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of Thieffenhaler's *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">Geography</a> of India*. They were followed, in 1789, by his treatise *De la Dignit\u00e9 du <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMERCE\">Commerce</a> et de l'Etat du Commer\u00e7ant*. The Revolution seems to have greatly affected him. During that period, he abandoned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>, shut himself up in his study, and devoted himself entirely to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LITERARY\">literary</a> seclusion. In 1798, he published *L'Inde en Rapport avec l'<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>*, &c., in 2 vols. 8vo; a work which is more remarkable for its virulent invectives against the English, and for its numerous misrepresentations, than for the information which it contains, or the soundness of the reflections which it conveys. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of the work, indeed, may be ascertained from the summary of its contents, stated in the title-page, in which the author professes to give a detailed, accurate, and terrific <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> of the English Machiavelism in India; and he addresses his work, in a ranting, bombastic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEDICATION\">dedication</a>, to the *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANES\">Manes</a>* of Duplexix and Labourdonnais. In 1804, he published a Latin translation from the Persian of the *Oupnek'hat*, or *Upanischada*, i.e. \"Secrets which must not be revealed,\" in 2 vols. 4to. On the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RE\">re</a>-organization of the Institute, M. Anquetil was elected a member, but soon afterwards gave in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol16.html#article-RESIGNATION\">resignation</a>. He died at Paris on the 17th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1805.\n\nBesides the works we have already enumerated, M. Anquetil read to the Academy several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEMOIRS\">memoirs</a> on subjects connected with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> and antiquities of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EAST\">East</a>. At the time of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, he was engaged in revising a translation of the *Travels of Father Paulin de St Barth\u00e9lemy in India*; which work was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> by M. Silvestre de Sacy, and published in 1808, in 3 vols. 8vo. He also left behind him a great number of manuscripts, among which, his biographers particularly notice the translation of a Latin treatise on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">Church</a>, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOCTOR\">Doctor</a> Legros, in 4 vols. 4to.\n\nFrom the preceding narrative, our readers <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be enabled to form some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> of the character of Anquetil Du Perron. Among his countrymen, he is regarded as one of the most learned men of the eighteenth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>. He certainly distinguished himself by a very ardent and disinterested zeal in the prosecution of those studies to which he dedicated the labours of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> life; but the lustre of his literary character was obscured by a very absurd vanity, and the most inveterate prejudices. In a Discourse addressed to the Asiatic Society at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CALCUTTA\">Calcutta</a>, in 1789, Sir William Jones speaks of him, as \"having had the merit of undertaking a voyage to India, in his earliest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YOUTH\">youth</a>, with no other view than to recover the writings of Zaratust (Zoroaster), and who would have acquired a brilliant reputation in France, if he had not sullied it by his immoderate vanity and virulence of temper, which alienated the good-will even of his own countrymen.\" In the same Discourse, he affirms, that M. Anquetil most certainly had no knowledge of the Sanscrit.\u2014See *Biographie Universelle*. Monthly Rev. Vol. LXI., <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Teignmouth's *Life of Sir William Jones*.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANT\">ANT</a>. The history of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> of insects so long celebrated for their industry and frugality, and for the display of that sagacity which characterizes some of the higher orders of animals, is peculiarly calculated to occupy the attention of modern naturalists. The ancients, indeed, had often noticed the habits and economy of the ant; but their accounts, at all times deficient in accuracy from the want of precise definitions and logical arrangement of the objects they describe, are, in this instance, so mixed up with fanciful notions, and chimerical doctrines, and so coloured by the vivid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-CREDULITY\">credulity</a> of the narrators, as to have retarded rather than advanced the progress of real knowledge. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a> and Pliny report, for instance, that the labours of ants are in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> regulated by the phases...\nof the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>; and the latter mentions a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> found in the northern parts of India, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> was said to equal that of the wolves of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> was the same as that of a cat, and whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCCUPATION\">occupation</a> in winter consisted in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGGING\">digging</a> up <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> from the bowels of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>; while the inhabitants in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, robbed them of their treasures, after having decoyed them, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STRATAGEM\">stratagem</a>, from their nests. Great mistakes have prevailed, even in later times, from the circumstance of the larva of ants <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> a resemblance to grains of corn, which it was supposed these insects hoarded up as a provision for winter consumption. The form of the eggs and of the larva, and the attention paid to them by the ants, were described by Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">King</a> in the 23rd Number of the Philosophical Transactions; but Leuwenhoeck was the first who distinguished, with precision, the different forms which the insect assumes in the several stages of its growth. He traced the successive changes from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGG\">egg</a> to the larva, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NYMPH\">nymph</a>, and the perfect insect. Swammerdam pursued his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCRUTINY\">scrutiny</a> into these successive developments with greater minuteness; and, unrivalled in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of microscopic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISSECTION\">dissection</a>, discovered the wonderful encasement of all the parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> ant, at every preceding stage; and showed that it appears under such different forms only from the nature of its envelopes, each of which, at the proper period, is in its turn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> off. Linnaeus (Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Sciences at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STOCKHOLM\">Stockholm</a>, Vol. II.) ascertained some of the leading facts with regard to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> between the sexes, and determined that the ants which are furnished with wings, are the only individuals that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> the sexual functions. Several particulars, with regard to the economy of ants, were published by Mr Gould, in a book entitled \"An account of English Ants,\" of which an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> is given in the Philosophical Transactions for 1747, by the Rev. Dr Miles. The facts are there stated with tolerable correctness; but some errors have been committed by following too closely the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> with bees. Geoffroy (Histoire des Insectes qui se trouvent aux environs de Paris), though a good naturalist on other topics, is a bad authority on the subject of ants. The most complete <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of observations on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> history of these insects, is that for which we are indebted to the celebrated Swedish entomologist De Geer (M\u00e9moires pour servir \u00e0 l'Histoire des Insectes), an observer on whose fidelity the most implicit reliance may be placed.\n\nIn the Encyclop\u00e9die M\u00e9thodique, under the article Fourmi, Olivier has drawn up an able statement of all the material facts that had been established by preceding naturalists, without, however, adding any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> observations of his own, excepting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of five or six undescribed species. A full account of the habits of those ants, which for a long period infested the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">Island</a> of Martinique, is contained in some of the earlier numbers of the Journal de Physique, (Vols. IX. and X.) The author of these memoirs, M. Barboteau, has given many curious details on this subject, and has cited a number of facts on various authorities; and the account might now be swelled by the reports of subsequent travellers in different parts of the world; but these statements are often made upon slender authority, and are too much tinged with the marvellous to admit of much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> being attached to them. The narrative given to us by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BONNET\">Bonnet</a>, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of his Observations sur les Insectes, of the proceedings of a colony of ants, which had established itself in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> thistle, and which he transported into his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, is highly interesting; but it elucidates only a few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of their economy, and leaves us to regret that so patient and indefatigable an observer had not bestowed more of his attention to the study of this tribe of insects. In the Philosophical Transactions for 1790, we find an interesting memoir on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SUGAR\">Sugar</a> Ant, a species which, for a period of ten years, committed dreadful ravages in the sugar plantations throughout the whole Island of Grenada. The most methodical account of this tribe of insects that has yet appeared, is that of Latreille, in his Histoire Naturelle des Fourmis, published at Paris in 1802; a work which alone would have secured the reputation of the author as an able and scientific naturalist. His merit is particularly conspicuous in the clearness and accuracy of his descriptions of each species, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUMINOUS\">luminous</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of arrangement which he has adopted in their classification. He gives an account of one hundred species, which he had himself observed, and of twenty-four which he has described from the reports of others; these he distributes into nine natural families, according to the situation and structure of the antennae, and the form of the abdominal scales. But the work which contains the most copious collection of facts relative to the habits and economy of ants, is that of Mr P. Huber, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GENEVA\">Geneva</a>, entitled Trait\u00e9 des m\u0153urs des Fourmis Indig\u00e8nes, published in 1810. By means of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a>, which he contrived so as to admit of his obtaining a view, whenever he pleased, of the inmost recesses of their habitation, he was enabled to observe what was going on in the interior of the nest, and to investigate, with success, some of the most important and interesting features of their history. The results of his researches, as they are reported in his work, are highly curious and instructive, and open a wide <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a> of speculation and inquiry to the philosophical entomologist. They have not only elucidated many obscure points with regard to one tribe of insects, but have disclosed some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> views of the instincts and faculties of this order of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a>, which are totally new, and must tend, in a considerable degree, to exalt our conceptions of the inexhaustible powers and resources of nature.\n\nHaving thus pointed out the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> sources of information in this department of entomology; we shall proceed to give an outline of the leading facts of Ants that have been ascertained relative to the economy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> policy of these remarkable insects.\n\nIn common with many tribes of hymenopterous Functions insects, ants present the remarkable peculiarity of the New a threefold distinction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEX\">sex</a> among the individuals of the same species; a circumstance which is met with in no other order of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANIMAL_KINGDOM\">animal <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>, and which appears, as far as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> has extended, to be totally excluded from the plan of the vegetable\nBesides males and females, there exists an apparently intermediate order of neuters, which are also denominated labouring or working ants. The neuters, thus exempted from every sexual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a>, exercise, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, all the other offices necessary for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> and welfare of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a> to which they belong; it is they who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLECT\">collect</a> supplies of food, who explore the country for this purpose, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> upon every animal substance, whether living or dead, which they can lay hold of, and transport to their nest. It is they who construct every part of their dwelling-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, who attend to the hatching of the eggs, to the feeding of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol11.html#article-LARVAE\">larvae</a>, and to their removal, as occasion may require, to different situations favourable to their growth and development; and who, both as aggressors and as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEFENDERS\">defenders</a>, fight all the battles of the commonwealth, and provide for the safety of their weaker and more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSIVE\">passive</a> companions. Thus all the laborious and perilous duties of the state are performed solely by this description of ants, who act the part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HELOTS\">Helots</a> in these singularly constituted republics of insects. We find, however, on closer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>, that, in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>, this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANOMALY\">anomaly</a> in point of sex is more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> than real; and that, however different in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONFORMATION\">conformation</a> to the productive females, they nevertheless originally and essentially belong to the same sex. There is every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> to believe that the development of the sexual organs in the former is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> in the circumstances in which the larva is placed during its growth. That such is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> with bees, is now perfectly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> established; and the analogy of bees with ants, in many points of physiology, must be admitted as a strong argument in corroboration of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a>. In all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> features of internal structure, the supposed neuters agree with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a>, and differ from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> of the same species. In all hymenopterous insects, which are armed with stings, a difference exists in the two sexes, as to the number of articulations composing the antennae; those of the female consisting of fewer pieces than those of the male. The accurate observations of Mr. Kirby (Monographia Apum), have determined that in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEE\">bee</a> the antennae of the male have fifteen articulations, while those of the female and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEUTER\">neuter</a> have only fourteen. In the ant, likewise, we find thirteen articulations in the male, and twelve only in the female; and likewise only twelve in the neuter. In the male ant the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ABDOMEN\">abdomen</a> has seven rings, in the female and neuter only six. In the two latter classes the head is broader, and the mandibles very large and powerful, compared with those of the male, and are furnished with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERRATED\">serrated</a> edges, and a sharp and often hooked point. The external sexual organs of the female and of the neuter are so nearly similar in appearance, that Latreille declares he was unable to perceive the least difference between them. On the other hand, it is to be observed, that, in the neuter, the principal deviation from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> of the female consists in the absence of wings; a circumstance which, as it regards the organs of locomotion only, is one of subordinate importance in the economy; and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a> may, without difficulty, be conceived to be connected with a certain condition of the sexual organs, as are the horns of the deer, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEARD\">beard</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> species. But although of so little consequence in a physiological point of view, it is a circumstance materially affecting their external condition. It dooms them to severe toil and exertion in traversing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>, and in climbing up the steep paths that may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> in their route; while their more luxurious and favoured associates are fluttering in the spacious realms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a> in search of amusement, and waited to the objects of their gratification on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> breezes of the summer.\n\nAnts appear to be endowed with a greater share of muscular strength than almost any other insect of Powers of the same size. Of this we have sufficient proofs in Ants, the vivacity of their movements, the incessant toil which many undergo, the great loads which they are seen to carry, often exceeding ten or twelve times their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGILITY\">agility</a> which they exert in making their escape from danger. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRRITABILITY\">irritability</a> is conjoined, apparently, with a corresponding share of the power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a>; a power which is manifested in their susceptibility to a variety of impressions capable of affecting the organs of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>. They have a quick perception of all changes of temperature, as well as of other conditions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>; and are readily, and disagreeably, affected by moisture. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a> of the sense of sight they seem to be nearly on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> with other insects; and the males and females are provided with both the descriptions of eyes peculiar to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a>, namely, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-COMPOSITE\">composite</a> and the simple eyes. The labouring ants, indeed, who never fly, are frequently destitute of the latter kind: a circumstance which appears to confirm the suspicion that has often been entertained, that the simple eyes are chiefly instrumental in the vision of distant objects. Latreille describes two species of ants, in which he could not discover the least appearance whatsoever of eyes, although he employed a high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNIFYING\">magnifying</a> power in examining them. One of these (the Formica caeca) is a foreign species, inhabiting the forests of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUIANA\">Guiana</a>, and of which the history is therefore little known. The other (the Formica contracta) is met with in the vicinity of Paris. It always conceals itself during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, or in obscure recesses, where no light can penetrate; and emerges from its retreat only during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>. It is much less social in its habits than other ants, collecting in groups only of about a dozen individuals, and appears to be far inferior in sagacity to the rest of the tribe.\n\nAnts possess a considerable acuteness of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a>, a sense which appears to be useful not only in directing them to their food, but also, as Bonnet first remarked, in enabling them to follow by the scent the tract of their companions. If the end of the finger be passed two or three times across the line of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-MARCH\">march</a>, so as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRUSH\">brush</a> off the odorous particles with which the ants who had already passed that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> may have impregnated the track; those who follow immediately stop on arriving at the place where the experiment has been made, and afterwards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> their course irregularly, till they have passed over the space touched by the finger, when they soon find the path, and proceed with the same confidence as before.\nBonnet repeated this experiment frequently, and always with the same result. Latreille has endeavoured to discover the seat of smell, which had long been suspected to reside in the antennae. He, with this view, deprived several labouring ants of these organs, and replaced them near their nests. When thus mutilated, they wandered to and fro in all directions, as if they were delirious, and utterly unconscious of where they were going. Some of their companions were seen to notice their distress, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a> them with apparent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPASSION\">compassion</a>, applied their tongues to the bleeding wounds of the sufferers, and anointed them with a liquor, which they caused to flow from their own mouths. This trait of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a> was repeatedly witnessed by Latreille, while he was observing their actions with a magnifying <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENS\">lens</a>.\n\nIt is indeed evident that, in all insects, the antennae are organs of the greatest utility in conveying impressions from external objects. But in the ant, independently of their importance as organs of touch, they appear to be of still greater consequence to the welfare of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a>, and of the community to which it belongs, by being the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> instruments which enable them to communicate to one another intelligence in which they are mutually interested, and on which they are called upon immediately to act. Mr Huber, to whom we are indebted for a variety of curious observations on this subject, has given the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of Language Antennal to this species of intercourse. The situation of the antennae, which are placed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> of the head, their great mobility, their peculiar mechanism, which presents a series of phalanges having great freedom of play, and endowed with exquisite sensibility, conspire to fit them admirably for the function which he assigns to them,\u2014that of producing a variety of different impressions, when applied in different ways to the antennae, or other parts of those ants, with which they come in contact. Thus the signal of danger, which consists in the ant which gives the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALARM\">alarm</a> striking its head against the corselet of the other, is propagated from ant to ant with astonishing quickness, throughout the whole society. For a few minutes a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERMENT\">ferment</a> prevails, as if they were deliberating what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> to pursue; but their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> is soon formed, and they are ready to rush in a body against the enemy. Any small animal that is discovered to have insolently invaded their repose, is certain of falling a victim to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESENTMENT\">resentment</a>; unless he can make a precipitate retreat, which he seldom effects without being covered with the bites of these furious insects. They are not, however, equally jealous of the intrusion of every kind of insect, for woodlice are often found in the interior of the nest, to whom, according to Latreille, they offer no molestation. Ants appear to be incapable of emitting sounds, so as to communicate with one another at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a>: and there is, indeed, no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> that they possess the sense of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEARING\">hearing</a>.\n\nThe consideration of the sense of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> naturally comprehends that of their food, to which we shall therefore next proceed.\n\nTheir Food. Very erroneous opinions were prevalent with regard to the food of ants, which have often been supposed to consume corn, and to do great injury to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> by devouring their roots or stems. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> is, that they are chiefly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARNIVOROUS\">carnivorous</a> insects, preying indiscriminately on all the softer parts of animals, and especially the viscera of other insects. These, indeed, they will often attack when alive, and overpower by dint of numbers; either devouring their victim on the spot, or dragging it a prisoner into the interior of the nest. If, however, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAME\">game</a> should be too bulky to be easily transported, they make a plentiful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAL\">meal</a>, and exert, like the bee, a power of disgorging a portion, and of imparting it to their companions at home: and it appears that they are even able to retain at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> the nutritious juices unchanged for a considerable time. The rapidity with which they consume, and in fact anatomize the carcases of any small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BIRD\">bird</a> or quadruped that happens to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> in their way, is well known; and furnishes an easy method of obtaining natural skeletons of these animals, by placing their dead bodies in the vicinity of a populous ant hill. In hot climates, where they multiply to an amazing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, their voracity and boldness increase with their numbers. Bosman, in his description of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUINEA\">Guinea</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> that, in one night, they will devour a sheep, leaving it a fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SKELETON\">skeleton</a>; while a fowl is for them only the amusement of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>. In these situations, they will venture to attack even living animals of considerable size. Rats and mice often become their victims. The sugar ants of Grenada cleared every plantation which they visited of rats and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VERMIN\">vermin</a>, which they probably effected by attacking their young. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POULTRY\">Poultry</a>, or other small stock, could not be raised without the greatest difficulty; and the eyes, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOSE\">nose</a>, and other emunctories of the bodies of dying or dead animals, were instantly covered with them. They generally, indeed, begin their attacks on the most sensible parts, which have the finest cuticle; and accumulating in great numbers about the nostrils, destroy the animal by interrupting respiration. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol7.html#article-NEGROES\">Negroes</a> with sores had difficulty in keeping the ants from assailing them. Their power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a> keeping <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PACE\">pace</a> with their increase of numbers, it is hardly possible to assign limits to either; and the united hosts of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIMINUTIVE\">diminutive</a> insect have often become formidable to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> himself. A story is related by Pr\u00e9vost, in his Histoire G\u00e9n\u00e9ral des Voyages, of an Italian missionary, resident in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONGO\">Congo</a>, who was awaked by his negroes in great alarm at the house being invaded by an immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> of ants, which poured in like a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TORRENT\">torrent</a>, and before he could rise, had already mounted upon his legs. They covered the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a>, forming a stratum of considerable depth. Nothing but fire was capable of arresting their progress. He states that cows have been known to be devoured in their stalls by these daring devastators. Smith, in his Voyages to Guinea, reports that at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol4.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> Corse the castle was attacked by legions of ants, who were preceded by thirty or forty, apparently acting as guides. It was at day <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> when they made this incursion, entering first by a chapel, on the floor of which some negro servants were lying. Assailed by this new enemy, they fled with precipitation, and gave the alarm to their master, who, on awaking, could hardly recover from his astonishment at beholding the advancing multitude, which extended for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> before him. There was not much\ntime for deliberation; and a happy expedient was adopted of putting a long train of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a> across the line of their march, and extending it to their flanks, which had already began to deploy, and, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SETTING\">setting</a> fire to the whole, millions were destroyed at one blow, which so intimidated the rest, that the whole army retreated in disorder, and did not renew the attack.\n\nDescriptions of ant hills of immense size abound in books of travellers who have visited tropical regions. Mr Campbell (Account of Travels in South <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>, published in 1815) observed in the district of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALBANY\">Albany</a>, at the Cape, an ant hill, five feet high, and twelve in circumference. In the forests of Guiana, according to M. Malouet, they attain the height of from fifteen to twenty feet; and, when viewed from a distance on these widely extended savannahs, resemble the rude huts of savages: but they contain a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> more ferocious than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> or the tiger himself, and cannot be approached by men without the utmost danger of being devoured. When new settlers, who are clearing the country, meet with any of these in their progress, they must immediately desist from their task, and even abandon the neighbourhood, unless they can speedily destroy the enemy in the very heart of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITADEL\">citadel</a> which protects him, and from which he is able to pour an overwhelming number of combatants. The only method of accomplishing this, is to dig a trench all round the ant hills, and, after having filled it with dry wood, and set fire to it on every side by lighting it quickly in different places, so as to cut off all retreat to the ants, to batter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the edifice with cannon. The ants, thus scattered, soon perish in the flames.\n\nThe chief, if not the only vegetable substance which is at all alluring to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPETITE\">appetite</a> is sugar. They not only eat it in substance, but are fond of all fluids that contain it in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a>,\u2014such as the secretions which exude from many trees, and compose what has been termed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DEW\">dew</a>; and the saccharine juice, which is excreted from the bodies of many of the insects belonging to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENUS\">genus</a> Aphis. This latter species of food they appear to relish above all others; it resembles honey in its qualities, and is sucked with avidity from the insect which yields it, and which appears in no respect to suffer from the operation. Boissier de Sauvages was the first who noticed this singular fact; and Mr P. Huber has ascertained a number of curious circumstances attending it. He conceives that the liquor is given out voluntarily by the aphis, at the solicitation of the ant, who, for this purpose, strikes it gently and repeatedly with its antennae, using the same motions as it does when caressing its young; and remarks that the aphis retains this liquor for a longer time, where the ants are not at hand to receive it. A single aphis may often be seen surrounded by three or four ants, who are feeding on the honey, and deriving from it a plentiful meal. It does not appear that the aphis uses any exertion to avoid the ants, who are thus dependent on its bounty; for those provided with wings, which would easily enable them to escape, are quite as passive under these circumstances as the rest.\n\nThe cultivation of the sugar-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CANE\">cane</a> in the West <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> islands, has often been severely checked by the ravages of ants; but the injury they occasion arises altogether from their undermining the roots, in order to establish their nests where they can be protected from heavy rains, and secured against <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGITATION\">agitation</a> from violent winds; advantages which the sugar-cane affords them in a very great degree. No part of the plant constitutes their food; and the same is true of those trees among the roots of which they burrow, and of which they speedily occasion the destruction, by preventing the access of moisture.\n\nRipe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> are often attacked by ants, probably on account of the sugar they contain; and, for the same reason, the buds of trees are infested with these insects, and often injured by their depredations. There is no evidence, that they, at any time, feed upon corn, or other vegetable seed. This point has been well established by Mr Gould; and Bonnet, who kept a colony of ants prisoners in his study, observed, that, however long they had been kept without food, still they never touched the corn that he put before them. Honey and sweetmeats have strong attractions for ants, who, if they once discover their way to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGAZINE\">magazine</a> of these dainties, will immediately communicate the tidings to the rest of the society, and, leading them to the spot, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> path will soon be established, which will continue to be crowded with a train of depredators, so long as any thing remains to be pilfered. It is, however, certain, notwithstanding the assertion of Bomare, who compares them to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MISER\">miser</a>, whose chief pleasure consists in contemplating the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a> he has amassed in his coffers, that ants are not in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of hoarding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> for future consumption. They grow torpid when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> exceeds 27\u00b0 of Fahrenheit, and in that state require no food, and the aphis affords them sufficient nourishment at other periods of the winter.\n\nIn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> their nests, each species of ant follows their nests, its own peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a>, and employs different materials for this purpose. Many form them of clay, and particularly the smaller species; one set building up a regular series of apartments in successive stories, often forty in number, with materials which are furnished to them by another set of workers, who are excavating the ground below. The ceilings are supported throughout by small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PILLARS\">pillars</a> in some parts, and by vertical walls in others; while <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a> are in other places raised, in order to protect larger spaces, and to admit of lengthened passages of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> throughout a long extent of apartments. These ants can proceed in the building only at such times as the earth has been softened by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> or dew, and the atmosphere is at the same time sufficiently moist to allow of the materials cohering firmly before they dry. Such are probably the ants, which Pliny mentions as working by moonlight. On one occasion, when the ants, under the inspection of Mr Huber, had discontinued their labours on account of too great dryness in the atmosphere, he succeeded in getting them to renew their operations by sprinkling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> upon them with a wet brush, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of a natural shower. They care-\nfully <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> the doors of their habitations every night, in order to prevent the intrusion of other insects; and a few remain on the outside during the night, as sentinels, to give the alarm in case of danger. Some species of ants collect fragments of leaves, of bark, or of straw, with which they construct more permanent and artificially constructed nests than the former. Others employ nothing but the fine powder which they collect from decayed wood. Some establish themselves for greater security under a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, or in the crevices of decayed buildings. Several tribes, on the other hand, penetrate into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> substance of wood, which they scoop out into numerous cells, leaving only intermediate partitions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> tenacity, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> of the strength sufficient to enable the whole fabric to support itself; while it crumbles into powder when pressed between the fingers.\n\nWe shall now take a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIEF\">brief</a> review of the principal circumstances relating to the fecundation of the ant, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVOLUTION\">evolution</a> and growth of the young. The former is effected very generally during the flight of the females, in which they are accompanied by the males; both appearing to be provided with wings chiefly for this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>. A certain number of the females that are impregnated, are also, by the assistance of their wings, enabled to reach distant situations, where they become respectively the founders of new colonies. The males, on the other hand, having fulfilled the office for which nature had destined them, are left to perish on the spot where they descend, being removed from those who formerly administered to them food, and being destitute of the means of procuring subsistence for themselves. Immense swarms of ants are occasionally met with; and some have been recorded of such prodigious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol7.html#article-DENSITY\">density</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a> as to darken the air like a thick cloud, and to cover the ground to a considerable extent where they settled. Mr Gleditsch describes, in the History of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BERLIN\">Berlin</a> Academy, for 1749, shoals of a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> ant, which appeared in Germany, and formed high columns in the air, rising to a vast height, and agitated with a curious intestine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, somewhat resembling the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AURORA_BOREALIS\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol3.html#article-AURORA\">Aurora</a> Borealis. A similar flight of ants is spoken of by Mr Acolutte, a clergyman of Breslaw, which resembled columns of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a>, and which fell on the churches and the tops of the houses, where the ants could be gathered by handfuls. In the German Ephemerides, Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol6.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> Rayger gives an account of a large swarm, which passed over the town of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POSEN\">Posen</a>, and was directing its course towards the Danube. The whole town was strewed with ants, so that it was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to walk without trampling on thirty or forty at every step. And more recently, Mr Dorthes, in the Journal de Physique, for 1790, relates the appearance of a similar phenomenon at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONTPELLIER\">Montpellier</a>. The shoals moved about in different directions, having a singular intestine motion in each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a>, and also a general motion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROTATION\">rotation</a>. About sunset they all fell to the ground; and, on examining the ants, they were found to belong to the Formica nigra of Linn\u00e6us.\n\nThe swarming of ants does not appear to be at all analogous to that of bees; its object seems to be confined to the propagation of the species, and is not the result of any co-operation of numbers, who associate together in search of a new habitation, in which an already populous assemblage may establish themselves. It would appear that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANT\">infant</a> colonies consist of very small numbers, and are perhaps wholly the offspring of a common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a>, who has migrated alone, or with but a few companions. The greater number of impregnated females alighting in the neighbourhood of the nest, are laid hold of by the labouring ants, who immediately deprive them of their wings, and drag them to the nest, where they keep them prisoners, till they are ready to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEPOSIT\">deposit</a> their eggs. Each female is, at this period, attended by a numerous retinue of labourers, who treat her with the greatest deference, and are solicitous to anticipate all her wants. Contrary to what happens among bees, many females inhabit the same nest, and live together in the utmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a>. The eggs, when first deposited, are very small, but become considerably larger before the larva is excluded; being apparently nourished by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSORPTION\">absorption</a>; for the ants, to whose care they are confided, are perpetually licking them with their tongues\u2014a fact, which, however curious, is by no means a solitary one in the history of insects. The larva comes forth at the end of a fortnight, and appears in the form of a transparent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGGOT\">maggot</a>, with a head and wings, but without any external organs of motion. They are in this state fed by their nurses, with a fluid disgorged from their stomachs; and in the course of their transformation to the state of nympha, and of perfect insect, are still dependent upon their assistance. These affectionate guardians help them to extricate themselves from the web of the cocoon, to unfold the duplicatures of their wings, and supply them with food, till they are capable of procuring it for themselves. The young ant is an exceedingly tender and delicate animal, easily destroyed by any considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> of temperature, or by excessive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HUMIDITY\">humidity</a>; and great care and attention appear to be required to bring it to maturity: it appears to be the constant business of the ants which remain at home to convey them to different parts of the nest, where the temperature is suited to them; and, whenever danger threatens, they show the utmost solicitude to remove them to situations of security.\n\nVery different degrees of sagacity belong to different tribes of ants. Many traits in the history of the city, larger kinds, as related by Huber, are of so singular a character, as to be scarcely credible, if we had received them from a less reputable authority; and, if we were not already prepared to admit them, from our knowledge of many equally curious circumstances in the economy of bees, which have been established by the concurrent testimony of the most scrupulous observers. Some tribes of ants, according to this naturalist, who are peculiarly fond of the honey which exudes from the aphis, convey many of these insects into their own nests, lodging them near the vegetables on which they feed, but keeping them prisoners within their habitations, and assigning to them distinct apartments in the subterranean recesses of their dwellings. As if conscious of the future advantages they may derive from these insects, they\ncollect their eggs, and superintend their hatching with the same care which they bestow on the eggs of their own species. The aphid lives in perfect harmony with its keepers, who, so far from molesting it, defends it with courage against ants belonging to other nests, who frequently attempt to get possession of them. Occasionally, they are lodged by the ants in fortified buildings, which they construct at a distance from the nest, in situations where they are most secure from invasion. The aphid is not the only genus of insect which furnishes this kind of provision to the ant; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KERMES\">kermes</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GALL\">gall</a>-insect are employed occasionally for the same purpose; and are found domesticated in the nests of ants, at the same time that they contain several species of aphid, and from all of which they collect nutriment.\n\nThis picture of domestic harmony is strongly contrasted with the scenes of ferocious contention, which are occasionally exhibited between the inhabitants of neighbouring nests: nature appearing to have instilled, together with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of social order, the same passions of rivalry, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-AMBITION\">ambition</a>, and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a>, of which we deplore the operation among beings of a higher order. War, the scourge of the human species, exerts its desolating power among the tribes of gregarious insects, and tends to check their otherwise excessive increase of number. The battles which take place between rival colonies of ants, are often on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a> of prodigious magnitude: millions of combatants engage on either side, with a fury and pertinacity that is truly astonishing. Their weapons of offence are the jaws, which are capable of inflicting a deep bite, and of instilling into the wound a highly acrid liquor; and also, in many species, a sting resembling in situation and structure that of the bee, and likewise containing a venomous juice. This liquor is well known to possess acid properties, and though long supposed by chemists to contain a peculiar acid, which was denominated the Formic, has been satisfactorily shown by Fourcroy and Vauquelin, to consist of the acetic and malic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a>, combined with a portion of acid animal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, to which it owes its peculiar taste and smell. It is extremely volatile and pungent, and is capable of being thrown out by the ant, when irritated, in considerable quantities. Roux, in the Journal de M\u00e9decine for 1762, reports a number of experiments which were made by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> animals to its influence. Frogs were killed by the vapour from an ant's nest in less than five minutes; and persons breathing it, when of a certain intensity, were nearly suffocated, or were seized with fever, followed by an extensive cutaneous eruption, which terminated in desquamation of the cuticle.\n\nSome of the most daring and courageous species, such as that which M. Huber calls the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMAZON\">Amazon</a>-ant, make it the business of their lives to attack the nests of the weaker species, and succeed, after a desperate conflict, in plundering them of their eggs and larvae, which they convey to their own nests. These are hatched and reared by ants of the same species as themselves, who may be considered as auxiliaries to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMAZONS\">Amazons</a>, and who had themselves, at some former period, been kidnapped from their parent nest by the Amazons. Thus, a society is formed among different species of insects, to which no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> exists but in the human race. The Amazons live without labour: they are attended, fed, and cherished by the ants which they have procured by this kind of slave trade, and who take as much care of their offspring, as they do of those of their own species. Perfect order is preserved, and the natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INSTINCT\">instinct</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSTILITY\">hostility</a>, which in another condition of the society exists between the two tribes, seems in the auxiliaries completely extinguished, by their being educated with the race of their original oppressors.\n\nAnts have numerous enemies among <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRUPEDS\">quadrupeds</a> and birds; and some, as the ant-eater, dasypus, and manis, or pangolin, together with the tribe of woodpeckers, devour a very large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a>. The Formica leonis, or myrmelion, feeds almost wholly on these insects. The bees at the Cape, according to Mr Campbell, frequently drive out the ants from their nests, of which they take possession themselves. Ants are also infested by lice, which, as may well be imagined, are so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> as to be invisible without the assistance of a very high magnifying power. They are stated by Redi, who discovered them, to resemble in shape those of the fowl and the dove.\n\nThe most effectual mode of destroying ants is to pour <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> water into their nests, which destroys at once both the perfect insects, and their eggs and larvae; so that those who, being from home, had escaped the general catastrophe, finding it impossible to repair the loss, abandon the spot, and disperse. The addition of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-URINE\">urine</a>, or of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SOOT\">soot</a>, or still better of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-TOBACCO\">tobacco</a>, which may be infused in the water, will render it much more efficacious. A decoction of walnut-leaves, or lime-water, will also generally answer. The night is the best time for applying these remedies, as the ants are then all collected in the nest. Arsenic is exceedingly destructive to ants, and affords another ready mode of getting rid of those that intrude into cupboards or pantries; it may, for this purpose, be mixed with sugar, or kneaded with any kind of provision, and placed in the paths they are observed to frequent. Corrosive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUBLIMATE\">sublimate</a> is also highly poisonous to them, and myriads of the sugar-ants at Grenada were destroyed by means of it; and it is stated to have had the effect of rendering the ants so outrageous that they destroyed each other, as could be seen by a magnifying-glass, and even, though less distinctly, by the naked eye. It appears also that this effect was produced even when they only came in contact with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POISON\">poison</a>. The whole island, however, was so overrun with these ants, that the numbers that could be destroyed by these means bore no sensible proportion to the whole; and recourse was had to fire as more applicable to destruction on a larger scale. It was observed that when wood, burnt to the state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CHARCOAL\">charcoal</a>, without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a>, and immediately taken from the fire, was laid in their way, they crowded to it in such amazing numbers as soon to extinguish it, though thousands perished by so doing. Holes were therefore dug at proper distances in a cane-piece, and fire made in each of them. Prodigious quantities perished in this way; for those fires, when extinguished, appeared in the shape of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol7.html#article-MOLE\">mole</a>-hills, from the numbers of dead that were heaped upon them. But as none of the females, or young brood, were destroyed by this ex-\npedient, the ants soon reappeared in as great numbers as before; and the island would probably have continued subject to this scourge, had it not been for the occurrence of the great hurricane of 1780, which at once cleared all the islands of this dreadful pest, by which the sugar-cane plantations had been threatened with total ruin.","sp":736,"ep":744},{"h":"ANTRIM","t":"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MARITIME\">maritime</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTY\">County</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ULSTER\">Ulster</a>, situate in the northern extremity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">Island</a>.

To the south-west it has the same County, which, running to a point, meets Lough Neagh at Shanport. The winding shores of Lough Neagh and Lough Beg form its boundaries on the west, as far as the point where it meets the river <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANN\">Bann</a>; whence this river, taking a northern course, inclining to the west, separates Antrim from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-LONDONDERRY\">Londonderry</a>.\n\nThis County lies between $54^\\circ 26'$, and $55^\\circ 12'$ north <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LATITUDE\">latitude</a>. Its greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> from Bangorhead north, to Spencer's Bridge south, is about 56 English miles; and its greatest breadth, from the Gobbins east, to Island Reagh Toome west, about 30 miles. Its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol2.html#article-AREA\">area</a> comprises 972 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> miles, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> 622,059 English acres. It contains eight Baronies,\u2014Dunbra, Carey, Killconeray, Glenarm, Toome, Antrim, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELFAST\">Belfast</a>, Massarene. All of these, except Killconeray and Carey, are subdivided into half Baronies, called upper and lower. There are also smaller divisions into Constablewicks and Town-lands. As nearly all the names of the Town-lands are Irish, and expressive of the qualities of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, or of some other local circumstance, it is probable that this subdivision is of very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a>. Ploughlands were instituted in the reign of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>, but this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> is now quite laid aside. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of parishes is seventy-seven. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> towns in this County are Antrim, Belfast, Carrickfergus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LISBURN\">Lisburn</a>, Ballimena, and Ballimoney. It returns five members to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a>, viz. two for the Shire, and one for each of the three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> towns, Belfast, Carrickfergus, and Lisburn. The assizes, elections, &c., are held at Carrickfergus, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>-sessions at Antrim. The Bishopric of Connor comprehends the whole County, except the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> of Aghalee or Soldierstown, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BARONY\">Barony</a> of Massarene, which is in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIOCESE\">Diocese</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DROMORE\">Dromore</a>, and the parish or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANGE\">grange</a> of Ballicullen, which belongs to the Diocese of Derry.\n\nThe interior of the County, on the eastern side, is mountainous, destitute of plantations, and abounding in bogs. This character also, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, applies to the northern side. The Baronies of Belfast and Massarene are the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> and fruitful. That remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANGE\">range</a> of basaltic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PILLARS\">pillars</a>, called the Giant's Causeway, on the northern coast of Antrim, is described in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> Giant's Causeway. The principal mountains are Devis, near Belfast; Slenish, towards the middle; and Knocklayd, in the northern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the County.\n\nBesides basalt, limestone, gypsum, coals, fossil-wood, or woodcoal, sandstone, &c. are found. The Antrim fossil-wood, or woodcoal, in most places, is covered with columns of basalt, and is curious, as explanatory of the origin of coal. Notwithstanding the compressed state in which it is found, the bark and knots are quite distinct, and the rings, denoting the annual growth of the wood, may be counted. In some instances, the roots of the trees may be traced. Of the only two coal-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> which are wrought in the province of Ulster, there is one in Antrim, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BALLYCASTLE\">Ballycastle</a>. The coals are bituminous, and of a bad <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>; a great part of them are exported.\n\nThe rivers of this County are very numerous, but Rivers in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> small. The most considerable are the lower Bann, which discharges the waters of Lough Neagh into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>; and the Lagan, which falls into the ocean near Belfast. Lough Neagh, belonging more properly to the County of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMAGH\">Armagh</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be described under that article. It may be proper, however, to notice in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, that of the two Islands in this expanse of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, Ram Island, from its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTIGUITY\">contiguity</a> to Antrim, is considered as belonging to that County.\n\nRathlin Island lies off the northern coast of this Rathlin County, opposite to Ballycastle. It is about five Island miles in length, and about three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> in breadth. The number of its inhabitants is about 12,000. It is celebrated as having afforded a place of refuge to Robert Bruce.\n\nNo <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> and accurate accounts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> Climate of Antrim have been kept, except at Belfast; and from these it appears, that less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> falls here than is generally supposed; the annual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> of rain, on an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> of six complete years, being only 24,700 inches. The prevalent wind is the south-west. The greatest height of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAROMETER\">barometer</a> between the years 1796 and 1809, was 31 inches; the lowest 28 inches. The greatest height of the thermometer, during that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, was 78\u00b0.80; the lowest 25. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> temperature of the northern coast of Antrim, near the town of Ballycastle, in latitude $55.12'$, as observed in the year 1788, by means of copious springs flowing from limestone <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, was 48\u00b0.\n\nThe estates in Antrim are in general freehold, being either immediate grants from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CROWN\">Crown</a>, or held landed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">Property</a> under those grants. The exceptions are the properties under the See of Connor. Some of the estates are very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARQUIS\">Marquis</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERTFORD\">Hertford</a>, and the Antrim <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, possess the fee of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJOR\">major</a> part of the County. The former has 64,000 green acres, that is, land capable of tillage, independently of bog and mountain. Most of the Antrim <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESTATE\">estate</a> is let on perpetuity, in farms worth \u00a32,000 or \u00a33,000 per annum. The other great proprietors are the Marquis of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DONEGAL\">Donegal</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Templeton, and Lord O'Neil. The estate of Lord Templeton, however, is only leasehold under the Marquis of Donegal, who lets his land for 61 years and a life, but renewes at the end of a few years for a fine. By a return to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUSE\">House</a> of Commons, 7th of February 1816, the number of persons who have registered freeholds in this county, between the 20th February 1807 and the 21st of February 1815, of the value of forty shillings, was 8074; of the value of \u00a320, 152; and of the value of \u00a350, 227.\n\nThe farms in Antrim are in general very small; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">Agriculture</a>\nthe average of the rent of the green land is estimated at between 30s. and 25s. the Irish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACRE\">acre</a>. The principal feature in the tillage <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of a great part of Antrim, is the potatoe fallow. The small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> of the farms, and, in some places, the rockiness of the soil, precludes the use of the ordinary means of culture, and therefore a part of the land is dug with the spade. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of potatoe-land is regulated by the quantity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANURE\">manure</a> that can be collected. After potatoes, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAX\">flax</a> is sown, and the quantity of flax <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> is regulated by the ability to purchase the seed. A crop of oats finishes the regular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROTATION\">rotation</a>. When the ground is exhausted, it is turned to rest, that is, it is suffered to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> till it is covered with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> grass. Such is the most general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of husbandry pursued in Antrim. In those parts where the farms are too large for the spade culture, the land is ploughed by three or four neighbours uniting their strength; one supplying the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLOUGH\">plough</a>, and the others bringing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>, bullock, or even a milch cow. Wheat is a plant of very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> introduction in Antrim, and very little of it is sown. The quantity of seed sown to the Irish acre, varies from 224 to 171 lbs. avoirdupois; and the produce from 2272 to 2135. Bear or bigg is grown only in the colder and higher parts of the County; the seed used is 203 lbs.; the produce 3500. The quantity of barley used as seed varies from 203 to 209; and the produce from 2982 to 2646. Of oats, the seed varies from 333 to 291, and the produce from 3636 to 3227. Of potatoes, the seed varies from 2392 to 1383, and the produce from 22,243 to 15,183.\n\nThe most important crop in Antrim is flax. The total number of acres supposed to be sown with flax in the year 1809, was 11,000; and the total number of bushels of flax-seed, supposed to have been saved out of the crops, was 3100. The annual average of flax-seed imported into Belfast is 5000 hogsheads, of about seven bushels each. The quantity of seed generally used for an acre is 30 gallons; the produce of seed averages 785 gallons; the average produce of flax is 30 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> per acre.\n\nThe cattle in Antrim consist chiefly of milch cows belonging to small occupiers, of a small stunted breed. Sheep are very little attended to; and the few that are kept are of a very inferior kind. Goats are numerous in the mountainous parts of the County. Pigs also are kept in great numbers. During the salting season of 1811, not fewer than 70,000 pigs, weighing at least 200 lb. each, were brought to Belfast for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPORTATION\">exportation</a>.","sp":744,"ep":745},{"h":"ANVIL","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMITHERY\">Smithery</a>, and other manufactures of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALLEABLE\">malleable</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-METALS\">metals</a>, is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> which substances are laid for the purpose of being hammered.\n\nFor some purposes, anvils are made of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>; but, when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of the anvil is required to possess <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> a bright surface, it is made of wrought-iron, and faced with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a>.

The body of the anvil is formed by welding a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of smaller masses together under the forge-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAMMER\">hammer</a>. These are rude blocks of different sizes, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> of the anvil. Smaller masses are also furnished in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>, which the anvil-maker occasionally welds to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> blocks, for giving to the anvil any particular form.\n\nThe fire-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> or hearth of the anvil-maker's forge is similar to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> smith's forge. His bellows are not double, like the latter. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol10.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a> is cork, which produces a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, without much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a>. Adjacent to the hearth is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CRANE\">crane</a>, which, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> upon a pivot, brings the heated masses of iron from the fire to the anvil. The latter is a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of cast metal, about eighteen inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> on the face, and about a foot from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>. When the core of the anvil to be formed is heated, the first thing is to make three square holes, one in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a>, and one at each end of the anvil. These holes are about 1 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, 1 inch <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, and about 2 inches deep. They are for the purpose of receiving a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> of iron, which is connected with the crane by which the anvil is held in the fire, and by which it is turned and guided while forming with the hammers.\n\nThe common smith's anvil is generally made of seven pieces, namely, the core or body; the four corners, for the purpose of enlarging its base; the projecting end, which contains a square hole, for the reception of a set, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHISEL\">chisel</a>, to cut off pieces of iron; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEVENTH\">seventh</a> piece is the beak, or conical end, used for turning pieces of iron into a circular form, welding hoops, &c. These pieces are each separately welded to the core, and hammered so as to form a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> surface with the whole. When large pieces are required to be welded to the core, one fire is not sufficient to heat both at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> two hearths are employed. The core and the piece are both raised to a welding heat. The piece being put into its place, is hammered by a quick succession of blows, till it adheres. The whole is again heated and hammered till the due form is obtained. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAMMERING\">hammering</a> is performed by a number of men at the same time, each using a large swing-hammer. The blows follow each other in regular succession; great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> and care being required to prevent the hammers from coming in contact with each other.\n\nWhen the anvil has received its due form, it now requires to be faced with steel. This is performed by first preparing the steel face to the size of the anvil. The anvil is then heated to a strong welding heat in one fire, while the steel facing is heated in another, but not so hot as the iron. The anvil is now brought out, and placed in a proper position, and the facing is brought to it. The surfaces, which are to be brought together, are brushed, and the facing is then laid on, and hammered as rapidly as possible, till it is closely united. The whole is finished by repeated heating and hammering.\n\nThe next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> is that of hardening the anvil. This consists in heating the face, in particular, to a full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> heat, and quenching it in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>. When a stream of water can be employed it is better. Where this cannot be had, the mass of water should be great, and the anvil moved about as quick as possible. The facing should be laid on as thin as it can be firmly welded. When it is too thick it is apt to crack in the hardening.\n\nAfter hardening, the face is ground till it is perfectly even, and the edges made sharp, or round, as may be required. When the anvil is required for planishing metals, it is polished with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMERY\">emery</a>, and afterwards with crocus.\n\nThe smith's anvil is generally placed loose upon a wooden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLOCK\">block</a>, the root-end of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OAK\">oak</a> tree being preferred. The anvils used in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUTLERY\">cutlery</a>, and for files, are fastened into a large block of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, which is doubtless better than having the anvil loose upon a small block. The more firmly the anvil is connected with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, and the substance it stands upon, the greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be the effect of the blow of the hammer.","sp":746,"ep":746},{"h":"ANVILLE","t":"a French Geographer of the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMINENCE\">eminence</a>, and perhaps the most celebrated in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> times. He was born at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the 11th July 1697. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> for geographical research <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> itself from his earliest years. At the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of 12, while <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> the Latin authors at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">College</a>, he amused himself with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> maps of the countries which they described. While he was thus busily employing himself one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a>, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> observed, and was about to punish him; but, upon casting his eye upon the performance, he immediately judged him to be rather deserving of encouragement. D'Anville from this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> devoted himself entirely to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">geography</a>, particularly that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> world; and, at the age of 22, he began to delineate maps, which attracted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of the most eminent Geographers.\n\nThere are two modes by which problems in geography may be solved; one mathematically, by astronomical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> geometrical measurement; the other historically, by the distances of places inferred from the narrative of historians and travellers. The former is certainly the most satisfactory, and would supersede every other, could it be extended over the whole surface of the Globe. But, notwithstanding the splendid progress made since the era of D'Anville, it is still far from such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of per-\nD'Anville, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">section</a>. In all countries, the bulk of the positions must be filled up, and, in some, the whole must be constructed, from mere historical materials. Perhaps there is no department of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>, which requires greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of knowledge, and accuracy of judgment. The variety of sources, out of which the materials must be drawn, is almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFINITE\">infinite</a>; and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> is equally nice and difficult. It must be regulated by a complete acquaintance with all the modes of measurement used by all nations; by a careful notice of those errors and contradictions which naturally arise from a partial and limited observation; and by the marking of certain delicate processes in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> mind, by which space and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> are sometimes diminished, and more frequently exaggerated. In the skilful Geographer, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> judgment, enlightened by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, creates, as it were, a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, which enables him to see consistency amid a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LABYRINTH\">labyrinth</a> of contradictions, and to elicit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> from a multitude of statements that are all erroneous. This art may be said to have originated with D'Anville, and to have been brought by him to its highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a>.\n\nThe course of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> on which D'Anville entered was truly immense. Works professedly geographical formed the least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of it; those of all the ancient and modern historians, travellers, narrators of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>, were assiduously examined. He studied, but only for the sake of the occasional geographical lights which they afforded, the philosophers, orators, and poets; for it was remarked, that, in perusing these masterpieces of human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a>, he was totally indifferent to everything which did not tend to fix a geographical position. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of this immense labour was to effect a complete <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REFORM\">reform</a> in the science of geography; to banish the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of copying blindly from preceding maps, and never to fix a single position without a careful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of all the authorities upon which it rested. By this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a>, he detected many and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> errors in the works of his most celebrated predecessors; while his own accuracy was soon attested on all sides, by the travellers and mariners, who had taken his works as their guide. His principles led him also to another innovation, which was, that of omitting every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a>, for which there existed no sufficient authority. The public was at first amazed at seeing vast spaces, which had before been covered with Countries and Cities, suddenly reduced to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> blank; but they soon recognised, that this was the only accurate course, and that the defect lay in the science, not in the geographer.\n\nD'Anville was at first employed in the humbler task of illustrating by maps the works of different travellers, such as Marchais, Charlevoix, Labat, and Duhalde. The question respecting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARTH\">Earth</a> coming to be much agitated, he published in 1735, and 1736, two treatises, with a view to illustrate it. But this attempt to solve a geometrical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a> by historical materials, was eminently unsuccessful. Maupertuis having gone to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> a degree within the polar circle, the result was found directly opposite to our Geographer's prediction. This, however, was considered by the intelligent public, rather as fixing limits to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>, than as implying any want of diligence and ability in its employment.\n\nAny loss of reputation which this failure might occasion, was completely retrieved by his map of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, published in 1743. It was marked by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of investigation, often employed by D'Anville with peculiar success. This consisted in the application of ancient materials to correct the existing geography. By the diligent study of the Latin authors, he was enabled to trace numerous errors which had crept into the delineation of this interesting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRIGONOMETRICAL_SURVEY\">trigonometrical survey</a> which Pope Benedict XIV. almost immediately after caused to be made in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">Ecclesiastical</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">States</a>, confirmed, in a surprising degree, all these alterations. On this occasion, he first set the example, which cannot be too much applauded, of accompanying the map with a memoir, exhibiting a view of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATA\">data</a> on which it had been constructed.\n\nHe now applied himself to ancient geography, always his favourite department, and the aspect of which, under his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, was soon completely changed. He illustrated successively, by maps, all the countries known to the ancients, among which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a> attracted his peculiar attention. To render these labours more extensively useful, he published in 1768, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol2.html#article-ABRIDGMENT\">Abridgment</a> of Ancient Geography. His attention was finally turned to the middle ages, which were illustrated by his States formed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> of the Western empire; and by some other works equally learned. Entirely devoted to geographical inquiries, the appearance of his successive publications formed the only events by which his life was diversified. From causes which are not explained, he was late of being admitted into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LITERARY\">Literary</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">Societies</a>. In 1754, at the age of sixty, he became a member of the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles Lettres, whose Transactions he enriched with many papers. In 1775, he received the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in the Academy of Sciences which is allotted to geography; and in the same year he was appointed, without solicitation, first Geographer to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">King</a>. But these honours came too late to illustrate a life, which was now drawing to its utmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERGE\">verge</a>. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> employment consisted in arranging his collection of maps, plans, and geographical materials. It was the most extensive in Europe, and had been purchased by the King, who, however, left him the use of it during his life. This task performed, he sunk into a total <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMBECILITY\">imbecility</a>, both of mind and body, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> for two years, and ended only with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1782, when he had reached the great age of 85.\n\nD'Anville, with the qualities which form the great Geographer, united all the essentials of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> and worthy character. The advancement of the science to which he had devoted himself, formed almost the sole passion of his life; and mingling little with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>, he contracted peculiarities, which solitary study is but too apt to engender. He talked with little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> on any subject except geography. This topic necessarily led to that of his own discoveries, on which he was never weary of expatiating. He boasted without any reserve of the services which he had rendered to that science, using, not unfrequently, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> of Augustus, \"I found it of brick, and left it of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>.\" He, however, did full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> to the\nD'Anville, merit of those who excelled in other branches of knowledge; and to such as furnished him with materials for his researches, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> was unbounded.\n\nWe shall subjoin a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of the numerous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEMOIRS\">memoirs</a> and dissertations composed by D'Anville, of which some were published separately, and others in the Transactions of the Academies.

The first volume was to be published in that year, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> was to consist of 6 volumes 4to, with a Folio <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-ATLAS\">Atlas</a>. (n.)\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APIARY\">APIARY</a>. Under the article <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEE\">Bee</a>, in the Encyclopaedia, directions have been given at considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> as to the management of an apiary; and various methods are there detailed of procuring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a> and wax from the hive, without destroying the bees themselves. The most economic mode of attaining these ends, deserves more attention as a national object, than it has in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> received in this country. It appears, from the returns of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">Custom</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUSE\">House</a>, that England pays annually to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">North</a> of Germany from L40,000 to L50,000 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">Sterling</a>, for the wax and honey which are imported from thence, and which might very easily be raised by a more extended and judicious cultivation of bees at home. Greater attention to this useful appendage to the Cottage, would not only be productive of commercial advantage, but would tend to improve the condition of the lower order of Peasantry. It is not generally known, indeed, what profitable returns may be obtained, at a trifling expense of time and labour, by very simple processes. Mr Huish, who has lately published a valuable practical treatise on the management of bees, has made a calculation, from which he infers, that even supposing the first cost of a swarm to be one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUINEA\">guinea</a>, which is the price in the places where they are sold the dearest, the Cottager is almost certain, by proper care and management, of clearing, in five years, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">net</a> produce of nearly L60; and of having besides, at the end of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, ten good stocks of bees in his garden.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> objects to be attained in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> and management of an apiary, are to secure the prosperity and multiplication of the colonies\u2014to increase the amount of their productive labour;\u2014and to obtain their products with facility, and with the least possible detriment to the stock. The apiary should afford to the bees the best shelter against moisture and the extremes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, and especially against sudden vicissitudes of temperature; it should protect them against their numerous enemies; it should afford them every facility of constructing their combs, and of rearing their young; it should allow of every part of the combs being occasionally inspected, and being capable of removal when requisite; and, while due attention is paid to economy, it should be made of materials that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> ensure its durability. Much ingenuity has been displayed by different Apiarians in the construction of hives, which should unite in the greatest possible degree all these advantages. Although it be in vain to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">hope</a> that every one of these objects can at once be perfectly attained; yet there is still great room for improvement on the hives that are at present in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> use; and we shall point out, in this Supplementary article, such modes of construction as have been recommended since the publication of the article Bee, above referred to.\n\nWhile some Cultivators of bees have been chiefly anxious to promote their multiplication, and to prevent the escape of the swarms in the natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>, by procuring what they have termed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> swarms\u2014which they effected by separating a populous hive, previous to its swarming, into two parts, and allowing to each greater room for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of their works; others have contemplated only the abundance of the products which they yielded, and the facility of extracting them from the hive, without showing any particular solicitude as to the preservation of the bees themselves. Another class of Apiarians have, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, had it more particularly in view to facilitate the prosecution of researches in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\">natural <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> and economy of bees. The hive invented by Mr Huber is peculiarly calculated for the last of these objects, and its Hive construction is founded on an accurate knowledge of the habits of these insects. He has given it the name of Ruche-en-livre ou en fen\u00ealles, from its opening and shutting somewhat in the manner of the leaves of a book. This book or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a> hive is composed of from eight to twelve <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> wooden frames, placed vertically, and joined together sideways like the hoops of a cask. Each frame consists of two uprights, one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a> in thickness, a foot in height, and an inch and a third in width, connected by an upper and lower <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a>, ten inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, and of the same breadth and thickness as the former; so that all the frames may be joined together, without leaving any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a>. The two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> frames are closed each by a pane of glass, which is covered by a shutter on the outside; and the whole is properly secured in its place, and further protected by an external cover. An <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APERTURE\">aperture</a> must of course be left in the lower part of one of the frames to serve as a door. In order to determine the bees to construct their combs in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> of each leaf, a small piece of honey-comb is fixed, by means of pegs, to the top of each in the proper position; as it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> known, that bees always complete their work in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> in which they find it begun, unless they meet with some insurmountable obstacle. A proper distance is thus preserved between the lateral surfaces of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> combs; and the external ones, being only three or four lines distant from the glass panes, may be easily inspected by opening the shutters; and also, by opening in succession the different divisions of the hive, both surfaces of every comb may at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> be fully brought into view. No difficulty is experienced in introducing swarms into hives of this construction; and after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAPSE\">lapse</a> of a few days, when the colony is fully established, the bees will very patiently submit to be daily inspected.\n\nMr Huber's hive is exceedingly well calculated for producing artificial swarms on the principle of Seibach's discovery, of which a full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> will be given in the Article Bee in this Supplement. It allows us to judge by inspection, whether the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> is sufficient to admit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a>,\u2014if the brood is of the proper age,\u2014and if males exist, or are ready to be produced, for impregnating the young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a>; all\nwhich circumstances are of material <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> to the success of the operation. It is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a>, that some of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol11.html#article-LARVAE\">larvae</a> should not have been hatched above three days before this attempt is made. The frames must then be gently separated at the middle of the hive, and two empty frames be introduced in the interval between the former; each of these new frames having a partition which closes them completely, so as to enable the two portions to be entirely separated without leaving any opening. The door of that portion, in which the queen happens to be at this time, may remain open; but the one belonging to the other part must be closed, so as to retain the bees that have no queen, prisoners for four-and-twenty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a>, allowing still, however, sufficient circulation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>. After this interval of time, they appear to have forgotten their queen; at least they are no longer anxious to seek for her, but bestow all their solicitude in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> of the larvae, so as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of them into queens to supply the loss they have sustained. This they accomplish in ten days or a fortnight after the operation. The two colonies are now perfectly distinct, and are never found afterwards to intermix.\n\nAnother advantage attending a hive of this construction consists in its enabling us to force the bees to produce a much greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of wax than they would naturally do. The interval which separates the combs, when the bees have not been disturbed in their operations, is constantly the same, namely, about four times. Were they too distant, it is evident that the bees would be much dispersed, and unable to communicate their heat reciprocally, and the brood would not be preserved in a sufficient degree of warmth. Were the combs too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a>, on the contrary, the bees could not freely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRAVERSE\">traverse</a> the intervals, and the work of the hive would suffer. It is evident that we may avail ourselves of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INSTINCT\">instinct</a>, and by separating farther asunder the combs that are already built, induce the bees either to extend the breadth of those they had begun, or to build others in the interval, if sufficient space be allowed them for this purpose. Thus, by interposing three empty frames, one between every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> interval of the combs in a hive containing six combs, three additional combs, if the proper season be chosen, will be obtained at the end of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>; and if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> continue favourable, the operation may be repeated, and the same number of additional combs procured the week after.\n\nThe principal obstacles to the general employment of M. Huber's hives are the expense of constructing them, and the greater degree of attention which they perhaps require from the Cultivator. It has also been objected that the flatness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a> was prejudicial, by allowing the moisture which exhales from the bees to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLECT\">collect</a> at the top, and to fall in drops at different parts, to the great injury of the subjacent contents of the hive. F\u00e9vrier proposes therefore the employment of frames in the form of a trapezium, so that the roof shall be considerably inclined to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZON\">horizon</a>. He borrows this shape from Bosc, whose hive consists, however, only of two boxes joined together sideways, and separable in order to form artificial swarms. This was an improvement upon Gelieu's hive, which was formed of two square boxes united laterally. Delator had recommended a still more simple form than that of Bosc, though less convenient, namely, that of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a> resting on its base. Mr Ravenel's hive consists of three square boxes instead of two; Mr Scram's is also made up of three boxes; but they are low and of great length, and are joined endwise; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> being established between them by apertures made in the divisions which separate the boxes. It is now, however, well established, that partitions of any kind are detrimental to the prosperity of the colony. The same objection applies, though perhaps in an inferior degree, to the system of storied hives, or those which are divided into stories one above another. A great variety of the latter description, however, have been recommended by different Cultivators. In France they are known by the name of ruches en hausses. Mr Thorley's improved hive, of which there is an account in the article Bee, is of this class, and Mr Lombard's ruche villageoise may also be referred to the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, although it be of much simpler construction than any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> hive. Mr Lombard's hive is composed of two parts, a body, and a cover, forming together an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELEVATION\">elevation</a> of from seventeen to twenty inches, on a uniform <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a> of one foot; excepting the upper part, which ought to be convex. The body is formed of bands of straw, similar to that of the cottages in this country. At the top and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> of the body is placed an exterior band, which forms a projecting border, on each end; the lower one giving the hive a firm station on its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEDESTAL\">pedestal</a>; the upper one contributing to secure the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> of the cover, or allowing of another similar body being placed above the first, if such an addition should be deemed necessary. At the top of the body, and even with the upper band, is placed a flooring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOARD\">board</a>, made of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> plank, ten inches in breadth in all directions; and the four corners of which are sawed off in such a manner that the breadth along the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIAGONAL\">diagonal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> one foot. This board is fixed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAILS\">nails</a> inserted in the upper double band, and entering a little into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONT\">front</a>. The four openings that are left on the sides are necessary for the passage of the bees, and for the escape of the vapours which are exhaled from them in winter. A flat rod traverses the hive immediately under the board; and projecting from the two sides about an inch and a half, affords handles for lifting the hive, and facilitates the fastening of the cover, which has also a projecting rod, corresponding with that of the hive. At the bottom is an opening, two inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> lines in height, for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INGRESS\">ingress</a> and egress of the bees. The cover is formed in the shape of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOME\">dome</a>, with a vertical handle at the top, and a cross bar at the lower part, by the projecting ends of which it may be tied to the ends of the bar in the body; and which serves also as a support to the combs that are constructed in the cover. For the latter purpose, also, two other bars are placed crosswise, one above the other. All the hives, and all the bases of the covers, are to be made of one uniform diameter, in order that...\nthe hives may, if occasion require it, be placed upon each other, and the covers be adapted to any of the hives that may happen to be at the top.\n\nThe pyramidal hive of M. Ducoud\u00e9lie, which the inventor extols in his book, entitled, *La Ruche Pyramidale, avec l'art d'\u00e9tablir et d'utiliser les ruches*, &c., as leaving nothing more to be wished for as to the cultivation of bees, differs but little from that of Mr Thorley. A common straw hive is taken, containing a swarm, which is allowed to remain till the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> of the following year; it is then placed on the top of a square box, with which it is made to communicate by a round aperture at the top of the box. In this state, it is termed by the French *la ruche \u00c9cosaise*, or, *ruche de M. de la Bourdonnaye*. On the following spring, a second box is placed under the first, and the whole now assumes the name of *la ruche pyramidale*. The bees are still allowed no other ingress or egress, but by a single hole made in the lowest story. The upper stories may then be removed in succession, while further room is allowed below by the addition of fresh boxes. It is stated by M. Ducoud\u00e9lie, that the bees in his pyramidal hive never perish by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUNGER\">hunger</a> or by cold; for they always abound in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>, and are too numerous to be affected by the most rigorous winter. When the bees are in groups, they maintain the necessary warmth in the hive, and the brood, on the return of spring, is hatched one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> sooner than in any other hive. Mr Huish has, however, made it clearly appear, that these pretended advantages are much exaggerated, while its inconveniences are passed over in silence. It is difficult, if not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a>, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> the hives in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a> of the swarms, or to the energy with which they labour. The honey being taken from the oldest cells, is deteriorated by an admixture of pollen, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> to it a degree of bitterness, of which it is difficult to deprive it; and is less abundant in consequence of the diminished <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a> of the cells, in which the cocoons of successive bees in their state of nymphs have accumulated. From their being divided into different stories, the bees are obliged to live, as it were, in different families; while their own preservation, and that of the brood, requires them to live in the strictest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNION\">union</a>. The heat is also lessened by the division of the bees into different groups. The upper part of these hives, being all necessarily flat (except the first or straw hive), occasions a serious inconvenience, by allowing moisture to collect and drop <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> into the middle of the hive, instead of trickling down the sides. The injury which this does to the combs, and to the bees themselves, who are constantly exposed to its influence, is, according to Mr Huish, the most common cause of the loss of the hives during the winter. The bees, he observes, always begin their work in the most elevated point of the hive, and seek for that purpose the central part of the roof. If the top be flat, and especially if it be as spacious as in the hives called pyramidal, the bees will not find this centre; they will work one year in one part, and the following year in another. This is, without doubt, one of the causes which obliges a proprietor to wait three or four years before any honey can be gathered from these hives.\n\nThe hive recommended by Mr Huish, as affording sufficient facility for examining any of the combs, and performing on them any operation at pleasure, is very similar in form to that described in the *Encyclop\u00e9die* (See Bee) as being used in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>; and of which a figure has been given. The body of the hive is a straw <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BASKET\">basket</a> in the shape of a flower-pot, that is, of a broader diameter above than below. Eight pieces of well seasoned wood, about eight inches broad, and half an inch thick, are laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to one another, at equal distances, over the top of the basket, and fastened to an outer projecting band; they are then covered with net-work, over which is placed a circular board, or what is better, a convex cover of straw extending over the whole of the top of the hive. This net-work obliges the bees to fasten their combs to the transverse boards; by means of which, each comb can easily be lifted up, without interfering with any other part of the hive, or occasioning the loss of a single bee; and the whole of the interior of the hive is thus open to inspection, and we are enabled to trace the devastations of the moth, or to ascertain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a> of any other enemy.\u2014See the article Bee in this Supplement.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPRENTICE\">APPRENTICE</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> and object of the engagement contracted between the apprentice and his master, has been sufficiently explained in the body of this work. As, however, numerous laws have been passed, particularly in England, for the purpose, not only of guaranteeing the performance of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a>, but of regulating also the terms upon which it should be entered into by the respective parties, and of defining the relative duties of each, it will be necessary shortly to state the most important of these regulations.\n\nIn that country, the 5th Eliz. continued for a long period to be the leading statute on this subject; but its regulations were at length found to be fraught with such numerous inconveniences, and to be so ill adapted to the present improved state of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> trades, that, by the 54th Geo. III. several of its most material provisions were repealed. By the 5th Eliz. it was required, in order to give validity to the contract of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPRENTICESHIP\">apprenticeship</a>, that the apprentice should be bound by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> deed; and, by the custom of some places, it was necessary that the deed or indenture should be enrolled. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> the custom is, that all indentures be enrolled, within a year, before the Chamberlain; and, if this form shall have been neglected, it is enacted that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRIT\">writ</a> of *scire facias* shall <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> upon the petition of the Mayor and Aldermen, to show cause why it was not enrolled. If it shall be found that this omission proceeded from the fault of the master, the apprentice may sue out his indentures, and be discharged; and, if otherwise, the contract ceases to be binding on the master. The 5th Eliz. c. 4, \u00a7 25, also provided, that no apprenticeship could be constituted except by indenture; and it was found, that, under a different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a>, a master could not maintain an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> against a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> for enticing away and detaining his apprentice. The same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> provided, that no agreement to execute indentures of apprenticeship should constitute a suffi-\nApprentice binding, although a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> of seven years might have been duly performed under it. To give validity to the indenture, it was not only necessary to comply strictly with the provisions of the 5th Eliz.; but every person who engaged apprentices against the terms of that act, was made liable to a penalty of L.10.\n\nBy the common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, every person is left at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> to follow whatever trade or employment may be agreeable to him. But, as it was supposed that great injury would result to the public if unqualified persons were to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> the various crafts and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MYSTERIES\">mysteries</a> connected with the mechanical trades, it was specially provided, by the 5th Eliz., that no person should exercise any art or craft, unless he had previously qualified himself for it by a regular apprenticeship, under a penalty of L.400 for every month. Considerable doubts were always entertained as to the trades to which this statute applied; and, as the Courts of law do not seem generally to have favoured the principle of the statute, their decisions tended rather to confine than to extend the restriction. It was at length agreed that the law was only applicable to such trades as existed at the time of passing the act, and to such, also, as implied some mystery or craft. The operations of the statute was also held to be limited to market-towns; it being supposed necessary for the convenience of the inhabitants of country villages, that the same person should exercise different trades, even though he had not been regularly bred by a seven years' apprenticeship to each. These various limitations of the statute gave rise to many very absurd distinctions, which plainly shewed how very unsuitable this antiquated law was to the present advanced state of the mechanical trades. It was found, for example, that a coachmaker could neither himself make, nor employ journeymen to make his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COACH\">coach</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHEELS\">wheels</a>, but that he behoved to buy them of a master wheelwright, this last trade having been exercised in England before the 5th Eliz. But a wheelwright, though he has never served an apprenticeship to a coachmaker, might either himself make, or employ journeymen, to make coaches, the trade of a coachmaker not having been prohibited by the statute, as not being exercised in England at the time it was passed. All the great manufactures which, in modern times, have arisen throughout England, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANCHESTER\">Manchester</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BIRMINGHAM\">Birmingham</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SHEFFIELD\">Sheffield</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WOLVERHAMPTON\">Wolverhampton</a>, were, on this account, exempted from the restrictive operation of this law, and the perfection to which they have arrived, seems a practical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of its inutility for the encouragement of trade.\n\nThe effects of those restrictions imposed by the 5th Eliz. were at length <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> to be so injurious, that, in the year 1813, petitions were presented to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a>, from various manufacturing towns, for a repeal of certain parts of this exceptionable statute; and the 54th Geo. III. was accordingly passed, by which all the penalties and prohibitions imposed by the 5th Eliz. on those who should exercise any trade or mystery, unless qualified by six or seven years' apprenticeship, were repealed. That part of the statute was also repealed, which enacted that no person should become an apprentice except in strict <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONFORMITY\">conformity</a> to the provisions of the 5th Eliz., and which rendered all indentures contrary to this act null and void. In opposition to this, it was provided, that all indentures, or covenants, which would otherwise be valid, should now be valid, anything in the 5th Eliz. to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\nIn the incorporated trades, bye-laws have generally been enacted, for the purpose of restraining each master to a certain number of apprentices, and those bye-laws have, in many cases, been confirmed by the public laws of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>. In Sheffield, it is a standing rule in the corporation of cutlers, that no master cutler can have more than one apprentice at a time. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORFOLK\">Norfolk</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORWICH\">Norwich</a>, no master weaver can have more than two apprentices, under a penalty of paying L.5 per month to the King. The 5th Eliz. c.4, \u00a733, enumerates various trades in which the master is obliged, under a penalty of L.10, to keep one journeyman for every three apprentices. No master hatter can have more than two apprentices anywhere in England, or in the English plantations, under a penalty of L.5 per month. Most of these statutes, however, are now so ill adapted to the state of trade and manufactures, that in practice they are very generally evaded.\n\nThe engagement contracted between the master and apprentice is entirely of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> nature, arising from the confidence they mutually place in each other; the master engaging to instruct the apprentice in his business, and to take care of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> and morals, while the latter engages, in like manner, for a return of faithful and diligent service. The transaction thus rests on the personal qualities of the two parties, and indentures are, therefore, not transferable to third persons. By the death of the master the contract is annulled, and a new engagement, with another master, can only be entered into by the consent of the apprentice. A different custom, however, prevails in London, where one freeman can transfer his apprentices to another freeman, without any injury to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> engagement. Where the maintenance of an apprentice forms one of the conditions of his service, the death of the master does not dissolve this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBLIGATION\">obligation</a>, his executors being bound to discharge it in so far as it can be done out of the effects left by the deceased. By the 32d Geo. III. (c.57, \u00a75,) <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> apprentices may, with the consent of two justices, be assigned over, by indorsement of their indentures, to third parties; and the person declaring his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCEPTANCE\">acceptance</a> of the assignment, shall be bound to perform all the duties of a master to the apprentice, for the residue of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a>. Where the master of a parish apprentice dies, upon whose binding no larger a sum than L.5 has been paid, it is provided, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COVENANT\">covenant</a> for maintenance of the apprentice shall not remain longer in force than three months.\n\nA master is entitled by law to use moderate chastisement in the event of any misbehaviour on the part of the apprentice. But he has no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to treat him with any unnecessary harshness; and in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, by the 20th Geo. II. c.19, \u00a73, he may, on the complaint of any parish apprentice, or of any other apprentice, on whose binding there is no larger a sum than L.5, be summoned before any two justices, and,\nAPPRENTICESHIP. The Encyclop\u00e6dia contains an account of the rules by which apprenticeships are regulated in different countries, together with a view of the objections urged by Dr Smith against the utility of the engagement concluded between the apprentice and his master.\n\nDr Smith considers the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> of apprenticeships as a device, by which trading corporations endeavour to confine to as few hands as possible the mystery of their craft, and by which, keeping the market always understocked with their particular sort of labour, they expect to regulate according to their discretion the price of such manufactures as they bring to market. He accordingly condemns all those laws which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIMIT\">limit</a> the number of apprentices, to be taken by each master in particular trades, or which prescribe to apprentices a certain term of service before they are permitted to work as journeymen. The tendency of such laws, he observes, is to restrain the competition to a much smaller number than might otherwise be disposed to enter into the trade; the limitations of the number of apprentices restraining it directly, and a long apprenticeship restraining it indirectly, but as effectually, by increasing the expense of education. Long apprenticeships, or indeed any apprenticeship, for however short a term, Dr Smith considers quite unnecessary, as the nicest mechanical arts, such as the making of clocks and watches, contain, according to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a>, no such mystery as to require a long course of instruction. A few weeks, he calculates, or even a few days, would be sufficient to enable a mechanic to set to work in any of those trades; and if he were paid the full price for his work, he paying of course for such materials as he might spoil through awkwardness and inexperience, he imagines that he would learn his business more effectually, and be more apt to acquire habits of attention and industry, than when he works under a master who has a right to share in the produce of his labour.\n\nIt may be generally remarked, however, that, in his reasonings on these subjects, Dr Smith seems uniformly disposed to overrate the practical effect of those expedients by which corporations have been always endeavouring to secure special advantages for particular trades; and that his theory respecting apprenticeships is only a part of that more general theory, by which he endeavours to show that the policy of Europe has always been to encourage the industry of the towns at the expense of that of the country; and that the effect of this policy has been to enable the merchants and manufacturers of the town, in bartering their produce for that of the country, to levy, for several centuries, an unjust and oppressive tax on the agricultural classes of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a>. We know, however, that, according to the nature of human society, as it is so admirably explained in Dr Smith's work, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONOPOLY\">monopoly</a> can never succeed on so great a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a>; and, on the same principle, we may rationally question if the contract between the apprentice and his master were merely the device of corporations, whether it ever could have come into such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> use throughout Europe. The engagement by which the apprentice is bound to his master, is his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUNTARY\">voluntary</a> act. He agrees to bind himself to work to his master at an inferior rate, on condition...\nApprentice of receiving from his master the necessary instruction in his business. This instruction, Dr Smith asserts, may be given him in the course of a few days or weeks. It is well known, however, to every practical tradesman, or to anyone acquainted with the nature of mechanical employments, that the instruction of three days or weeks would scarcely teach an apprentice the name of his tools, and that almost all the mechanical trades require, throughout their various operations, such nicety and exactness, that the necessary habits are not formed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TRAINING\">training</a> of years, in place of weeks or days. It is for the troublesome superintendence of the apprentice during this period that the master exacts <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPENSATION\">compensation</a>, without which he would employ none but finished workmen. But he puts up with the awkwardness of his apprentice, because he expects to be benefited by his labour after he shall be better instructed in his business; on the same principle that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">farmer</a> lays out his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> on the improvement of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> increase of produce.\n\nThe contract of apprenticeship is thus a voluntary agreement between two parties for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> benefit, the result neither of law nor of the usages of petty corporations, but of circumstances. The law, indeed, takes cognizance of the contract, and enforces its fulfilment; and it may also have encumbered it with absurd regulations. But the contract itself stands independent both of law and usage, having its origin in the plainest principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECIPROCAL\">reciprocal</a> expediency. There seems no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> therefore to class it with those artificial expedients which originate in the exclusive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of trading corporations.\n\nDr Smith appears also to have greatly overrated the effects of those laws, the object of which is to limit the number of apprentices which shall be reared to particular trades. No law of any corporation will ever be found in practice to impose any limitation on the number of apprentices which will be trained to a business. It will depend on the state of the business, whether it is advancing, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a>, or declining, what number of apprentices will be bred to it; and if, while a flourishing trade called for a continual supply of new hands, any corporation were to enact a law, limiting the masters to such a number of apprentices as would barely keep up their present stock, a scarcity of hands would soon be felt, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol21.html#article-WAGES\">wages</a> would rise, and the masters would soon be induced, by regard to their own interest, to rescind the law which imposed so great an inconvenience on themselves. But if the law is thus modified and accommodated to the state of the trade, it is a mere form. It imposes in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a> no restraint, since it is always in the power of the masters to alter it whenever they feel that it interferes with their arrangements.\n\nBut though the law were even rigidly persisted in, it is evident that it would not permanently diminish the number of apprentices, which would be bred to a business, since the consequence would be, that the workmen would turn masters, and each taking the full allowance of apprentices which the law permits, would soon train up an ample supply of hands. All those petty contrivances of corporations, therefore, though they may originate in the lowest mercantile <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JEALOUSY\">jealousy</a>, and though they may be exceedingly absurd, cannot materially disturb the general progress of things; and, though they may harass individuals, their effect on the industry of a great country hardly deserves notice; their bad effects being corrected by those general causes on which society depends for completing its arrangements, in spite of the obstacles arising from the mistaken policy of legislators.\u2014See Smith's Wealth of Nations, with Notes, and an additional volume of Dissertations, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAVID\">David</a> Buchanan.","sp":746,"ep":754},{"h":"AQUA TOFANA","t":"called also <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AQUA\">Aqua</a> della Toffanina, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Aqua della Tofa, from its supposed inventress,\u2014Aqua del petesino,*\u2014Aquetta di Napoli, or simply Aquetta,\u2014a poisonous liquor which was used to a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPLES\">Naples</a> and Rome during the latter half of the seventeenth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>.

This he learnt from the Emperor himself, to whom the whole criminal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> instituted against her was transmitted.\n\nIt is to be regretted, that Garelli, who had such an authentic source of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a>, has not given us some details of the infamous Tofana or Tofania; as the little that we know of her rests upon the authority of travelers, and is evidently exaggerated, and sometimes irreconcilable with established facts. She was a Sicilian by birth, and resided first at Palermo, and then at Naples. When she began to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> her horrible profession, is nowhere stated; but it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> presently appear, that it must have been at a very early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, and before 1659. She was extremely liberal of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a>, chiefly it is said, to ladies tired of their husbands; and the better to conceal the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of her gift, it was put up in small flat phials, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSCRIBED\">inscribed</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANNA\">Manna</a> of St Nicholas of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARI\">Bari</a>, ornamented <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> one side with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGE\">image</a> of the Saint, that it might pass for a liquid said to drop from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOMB\">tomb</a> at Bari, which was in great request on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of the medicinal virtues ascribed to it.

It was long before she was secured, as she was extremely cautious, and often changed her abode or retired into Convents. At <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> she was betrayed, and, although in a Convent, was seized and carried to the Castel del Uovo, where she was examined. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARDINAL\">Cardinal</a> Pignatelli, then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">Archbishop</a> of Naples, indignant at the violation of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> sanctuary, threatened to excommunicate\n\n---\n\n* Lanzoni <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPERA\">Opera</a>, 4to.

But the sagacious Viceroy caused a report to be spread, that she and her accomplices had determined upon the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, to poison all the springs in the city, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> brought to market, and the public granaries. The manoeuvre succeeded. The credulous people were now clamorous for her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> with satisfaction the persons whom she accused of having purchased her Aquetta, taken from the Churches and Monasteries. Some of inferior birth were executed publicly; those of higher <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> secretly in prison; and the whole city resounded with the praises of the Viceroy, whose energy had saved it from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a>. A kind of compromise was entered into with the Cardinal; in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of which, after being strangled, her body was thrown at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a> into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of the Convent, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> of testifying some respect for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">Church</a>. But the reverend traveller must have either been misinformed as to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> execution of this Medea, or she must have been resuscitated; for Garelli expressly says that she was alive in prison at Naples, when he wrote to Hoffmann, not long before 1718; and Keysler, who visited Naples in 1730, likewise asserts, that she was then living in prison, and that few strangers left the city without going to see her. He describes her as a little and very old woman.\n\nThe Roman ladies very quickly availed themselves of Tofania's discovery; for it was remarked in 1659, that many husbands died when they became disagreeable to their wives; and several of the clergy also gave information, that, for some time past, various persons had confessed themselves guilty of poisoning. This led to the detection of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> of young married women (who had, for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-PRESIDENT\">president</a>, an old woman of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of Hieronyma <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPARTA\">Sparta</a>, a pretended fortune-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TELLER\">teller</a>), as the perpetrators of these murders. On being put to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TORTURE\">torture</a> they all confessed except Sparta, who seemed to rely upon the protection of powerful individuals whom she had formerly served. But she was left to her fate, and was hanged along with her assistant, one Gratiosa. Others were afterwards hanged, or whipt and banished. Sparta, who was a Sicilian, had acquired her knowledge from Tofania at Palermo.\n\nPope Alexander VII., immediately on the discovery and punishment of those who dealt in poison in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a>, published an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EDICT\">edict</a> forbidding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTILLATION\">distillation</a> of aquafortis, or the purchase of any of its ingredients, without the permission of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">Government</a>; which Gmelin considers as an artifice to mislead the people as to the real <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of the poison, or as originating in the absurd <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOMENCLATURE\">nomenclature</a> of the Chemists of former times, who called arsenic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONCRETE\">concrete</a> aquafortis. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a> of the Pope was rendered fruitless; for we are informed by Gayot di Pitaval (Causes C\u00e9l\u00e8bres, Vol. I. Amsterd. 1774, p. 317.), on what authority he does not state, that Tofania's fatal secret was disclosed by the indiscretion of the judges at Naples, to whom she had made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONFESSION\">confession</a> of her crime. The whole city soon knew that she employed in its composition a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERB\">herb</a>, and that its preparation was otherwise easy; and in this way the art of poisoning became very common in Naples, where, Keysler says, it was still secretly practised when he visited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>; and Archenholz, who was there in 1780, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, that Aqua Tofana was then in use, although its composition was only known to a few; but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a> Frank, who was long Professor in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PAVIA\">Pavia</a>, and has written a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> on toxicology (Handbuch der Toxicologie, Wien, 1803, p. 168.), regards this as an unfounded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CALUMNY\">calumny</a>, and asserts that it no longer exists or is heard of.\n\nAqua Tofana is described as being as limpid as rock <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, and without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, and hence it could be administered without exciting suspicion. The Abb\u00e9 Gagliani adds, that there was not a lady in Naples, who had not some of it lying openly on her toilet among her perfumes, in a phial known only to herself.\n\nIt was generally believed, that the effect of this poison was certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>; and that it could be so tempered or managed, as to prove fatal in any determinate time, from a few days to a year or upwards. Four or six drops were reckoned a sufficient dose, and they were said to produce no violent symptoms, no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOMITING\">vomiting</a>, or but very seldom, no pains, convulsions, inflammation, or fever; but only a feeling of indisposition, without any very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEFINITE\">definite</a> symptoms, except sometimes inextinguishable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THIRST\">thirst</a>; the victim, however, sunk into a languid state, and his weakness increased daily. Disgust at all kinds of food, and weariness of life, succeeded; the nobler organs were then attacked, the lungs were wasted by suppuration, and death closed the miserable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a>. This termination was the more certain, that the true cause of these symptoms was not at first suspected, and the remedies commonly prescribed rather aggravated the evil. Indeed, even when known, no treatment was of any avail, although a Dr. Brancaletti, according to Keysler, wrote a book on its remedies, until it was discovered by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCIDENT\">accident</a> that lemon-juice, when very early administered in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> doses, sometimes proved effectual (Bertholimus), after which, Keysler tells us, that the poison fell into some disrepute.\n\nVarious accounts of the composition of this detestable liquor have been given.

Erndtel, * but without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>, has conjectured that the chief ingredient was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>: <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HALLE\">Halle</a> (Die deutenen Giftpflanzen, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BERLIN\">Berlin</a>, 1783) believes, that it was prepared from the frothy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALIVA\">saliva</a> gathered round the mouth of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> tortured to death. Garelli, on the contrary, positively asserts it to have been nothing but a solution of crystallized arsenic in a large quantity of water, with the addition, for some unknown <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a>, of a very innocent herb, the Antirrhinum cymbalaria. The same account is given by Bertholinus, Lobell (Der freymuthige Heilkunstler, Berlin, 1786), Plenk (Toxicologia, p. 335), Haller, + Molitor (Commerc. Lit. Noric. 1737, p. 182), and M\u00f6hsen, \u2020 and is received by the most judicious systematic writers, as Gmelin and Hahnemann. (Ueber die Arsenikevergiftung, 8vo, Leipzig, 1786, p. 35.) Wildberg, \u2021 however, considers its composition to be unknown.\n\nFrom Italy this poison seems to have found its way to Paris. In 1672 Godin de Sainte Croix, an adventurer, who lived in a scandalous intimacy with the Marchioness <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol5.html#article-BRINVILLIERS\">Brinvilliers</a>, was suddenly killed by suffocation, as it is said, in consequence of the falling off of a mask of glass, which he wore to protect him from the fumes of certain chemical operations about which he was employed. As he had no known relations, his effects were examined by a public officer, and among them was found a casket, containing many packets of poisonous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol8.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a>, sealed up in a mysterious manner, together with a kind of last will, directing the whole to be delivered to the Marchioness, and, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of her having predeceased him, to be burnt unopened. This led to the discovery of his having been instructed in the art of preparing poison, by an Italian, called Exili, with whom he had become acquainted, when confined in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BASTILLE\">Bastille</a>; and of his having furnished the Marchioness with the means of poisoning her father and her two brothers, besides others on whom she tried the effect of her preparations. One of these afterwards was called from her by the name Eau de Brinvilliers. She is also said to have employed a powder called Poudre de Succession. \u00a7 La Chauss\u00e9e, who had been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-VALET\">valet</a> to Sainte Croix, was convicted of being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCESSORY\">accessory</a> to these murders, and was broken alive on the wheel. The Marchioness herself, who had escaped to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIEGE\">Liege</a>, was also seized, and her execution, which took <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> on the 17th of July 1676, is described with revolting levity by Mad. de Sevign\u00e9 in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a>.\n\nThe practice of poisoning, however, did not seem to terminate with the death of this infamous woman; and a particular court called Chambre des Poisons, or Chambre Ardente, was established in 1679, to endeavour to put an end to it. In consequence of the investigations which took place in it, many persons, some of the highest rank, especially the Duc de Luxembourg, were implicated. More than forty persons were at one time confined in the Bastille; but it was ascertained, that almost all of them had been guilty of no crime, but were merely the dupes of a few impostors, who pretended to raise spirits, foretell <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> events, and to possess many secrets of a similar nature. Two women, La Vigoureux and La Voisin, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> of the former, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a> called Le Sage, \u00b6 pretended fortune-tellers, were convicted of being dealers in poison, and burnt alive, on the 22d Feb. 1680; some others were hanged, and others acquitted. This closed the proceedings of this inquisitorial court, which has been accused of being a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> engine, contrived to serve the purposes of Louvois and the Marchioness de Montespan. Voltaire, however, admits that the crime of poisoning infected Paris from 1670 to 1680.\n\nConcerning the effects of the Eau de Brinvilliers, Pitaval tells us (p. 271,) that the Marchioness's father experienced violent effects from the poison,\u2014<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> vomiting, insupportable pain at stomach, and great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> in the bowels. He died soon after his return from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>-seat to Paris. The brothers, and five other persons, were all taken ill, and affected with vomiting, after partaking of a tart at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DINNER\">dinner</a>. On their return from the country to Paris, the brothers had the appearance of persons who had been long ill; and after suffering, the one for two, and the other for three months, from nausea and vomiting, they died extremely emaciated, and as it were dried up, without fever, though experiencing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a> in the stomach. On opening the bodies, the stomach and duodenum were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> and tender, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LIVER\">liver</a> gangrenous and burnt. Mad. Sevign\u00e9 relates, that the Marchioness often poisoned her husband, that she might marry Sainte Croix, but that the gallant, having no desire for a wife of her disposition, as often gave the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> husband an antidote. She is also said to have attempted to poison her sister; but did not succeed; and that she was in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of trying the effects of her poisons on the\n\n---\n\n* Dissert. de Veneno salutem sistens, Lipsiae, 1701, \u00a7 21.\n\u2020 Vorlesungen \u00fcber die gerichtliche Arzneikunde, 2ter Band, p. 190.\n\u2021 Beschreibung einer Berlinischen Medallien-sammlung, 1.

But Voltaire positively denies this horrible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPUTATION\">imputation</a>, and says, that she never attempted the life of her husband, who overlooked a connection, of which he was the cause.\n\nThe information concerning the nature of the Eau de Brinvilliers, derived from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of Sainte Croix's famous casket, is not satisfactory. It contained poisons enough to have killed a whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a>; besides opium, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUNAR\">lunar</a> caustic, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTIMONY\">antimony</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VITRIOL\">vitriol</a>, more than 75 lbs. of corrosive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUBLIMATE\">sublimate</a>, and two bottles of a liquid, like water, with a sediment in one. The clear liquid was probably his real poison; as none of the other substances could have been given so as to produce death, without instantly being detected, by their abominable taste; but what this liquid was, we can now only conjecture, for its examination, as reported by Pitaval, shows that the physicians, at that time, had not the slightest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of detecting arsenic even in substance, much less in solution; and accordingly, although both the liquor and powder killed the animals to which they were given, it is candidly admitted, that the poison of Sainte Croix surpassed the art and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a> of the physicians, and that it baffled all their experiments to discover its composition. We have, however, no doubt, that arsenic was the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> ingredient of all these pretended secret poisons; as it is the only substance capable of explaining all the credible circumstances related of them. From the mode of administering them in small, but repeated and perhaps increased doses, there was some foundation for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> that they could be given so as to kill in any determinate time, while their failing in any instance to produce death, was easily accounted for by supposing antidotes to have been administered. But although the progress of knowledge has proved, that there is no such thing as such antidotes, it has on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, by rendering the detection of poison easy and certain, put a stop forever to the trade of poisoners; and what is perhaps of equal importance, to the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALARM\">alarm</a> and cruel punishment of individuals which have often resulted from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> deaths being ascribed to poison. It is not because we know less, but because we know a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> more than our forefathers, that the art of secret poisoning seems to be lost.\u2014See Forensic Medicine in this Supplement.\n\nARACHNIDES.

The name does not occur in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> authors; hydroscopium and baryllium being the ancient names of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a>. This instrument was known in the civilized <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the Roman empire, about the year 400, as appears from the fifteenth epistle of Synesius, addressed to Hypatia, daughter of Theon; and to Hypatia some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> writers have erroneously ascribed its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>. The instrument is also described in some verses annexed to Priscian; and the principles on which its operation is founded, are to be seen in the treatise of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHIMEDES\">Archimedes</a> on floating bodies (De Humido In-\n\nsidentibus). The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a>, as used by writers on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\">natural <a class=\"</a>xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, is chiefly applied to instruments which are made to float, so as to indicate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIFIC\">specific</a> gravity of the liquids in which they are placed: the p\u00e8se liqueur, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HYDROMETER\">hydrometer</a>, in common use for measuring the specific gravity of vinous spirits, are instruments of this kind.\n\nA floating body displaces a portion of the liquid, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of which is equal to its own weight, the liquid acting upwards with a force equal to this weight, and the weight of the body acting downwards with the same force, equilibrium takes place. If the body be afterwards placed in a liquid of less density, the part of the body immersed, will be greater than when the body was in the more dense liquid, because it requires a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of this less dense liquid to equal the weight of the floating body. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> weights of two bodies being the same, their specific gravities are in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERSE\">inverse</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a> of their volumes \\( \\frac{G}{g} = \\frac{v}{V} \\), when \\( G \\) is put for the specific gravity of the first body, \\( g \\) for that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>; \\( V \\) for the volume of the first, and \\( v \\) for the volume of the second. On this principle the common hydrometer is constructed; the instrument described by Synesius, is also of this kind. In order that a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> in the volume immersed may be sensible, the part which is intersected by the surface of the fluid is in the form of a very slender <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a>, the great bulk of the instrument being always immersed in the liquid. At the inferior part is a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a>, containing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a> or small lead <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a>, which serves as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALLAST\">ballast</a>, bringing the centre of gravity low, so that the instrument may float erect, and without much lateral oscillation. The common hydrometers are made of glass, and sometimes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a>, or tin or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PEWTER\">pewter</a>, and some have been made of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMBER\">amber</a> as objects of curiosity: when made of glass, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a>, inscribed upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, is inserted in the cylindrical stalk; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of the scale at which the surface of any liquid intersects the stalk, denotes the specific gravity of that liquid. The divisions of the scale should be formed by immersing the instrument in liquids of known specific gravity, and marking a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> corresponding to that specific gravity opposite to each division. The specific gravities of water and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALCOHOL\">alcohol</a> mixed in various proportions, have been accurately ascertained by Mr Gilpin (see his Tables, and Dr Blagden's paper in the Philosophical Transactions); on immersing the instrument in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> of known proportions of these two liquids, the point at which the surface intersects the stalk, is to be marked with the number expressing the specific gravity of the mixture taken from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>. Some hydrometers, such as that constructed by the French chemist Beaum\u00e9, and which is much used in France under the name of Ar\u00e9ometre de Beaum\u00e9, have the\nAr\u00e6meter scale divided into equal parts, so that the divisions do not correspond as they ought to do with the numbers which express specific gravities.\n\nIn the ar\u00e6meter of Fahrenheit, the uncertainty arising from the erroneous division of the scale is obviated, no division being required. The form of the instrument is the same as that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> described, only at the top there is a small cup, into which weights are put, so as to bring the surface of the denser liquid to a fixed mark on the stalk; when the instrument is placed in a liquid of less density, some of the weights are taken out till the mark again comes to the surface.\n\nSuppose the weight of the instrument and of the weights in the cup together equal to 1000, when sunk to the mark in distilled water at a certain temperature; the instrument is now taken out of the water and immersed in a liquid, where 10 must be taken out of the cup in order to bring the mark to the surface; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMMERSION\">immersion</a> in water indicates that a volume of water weighs 1000; the immersion in the second liquid, shows that an equal volume of this liquid weighs 990; when the volumes of bodies are equal, the specific gravities are directly as the absolute weights \\( \\frac{G}{g} = \\frac{W}{w} \\); consequently the specific gravity of the second liquid is 990, that of water being 1000. To <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol16.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> computation, it is convenient that the whole weight of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a>, when in distilled water, at a certain temperature, should be represented by 1000; for this purpose, the instrument-maker divides the weight of the apparatus into 1000 parts, and forms small weights consisting of one, two, three, &c. of these thousandth parts, the relation of which to the ounce or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POUND\">pound</a>, does not require to be known; the weights thus formed are to be used with the instrument.\n\nThe ar\u00e6meter of Nicholson is like that of Fahrenheit, with the addition of an immersed cup, whereby it is rendered proper for ascertaining the specific gravity of solids. Suppose that it requires 400 grains in the exterior cup to sink the instrument to the mark in distilled water, at 60 degrees of Fahrenheit's thermometer:\n\n1st, The body under examination is put into the exterior cup, and weights (say 300 grains) are taken out till the mark again stands at the surface; this gives the absolute weight of the body 300 grains.\n\n2dly, The body is then put into the immersed cup S, taking care to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRUSH\">brush</a> off any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>-bubbles with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a>, and in order to bring the mark to the surface, a Ar\u00e6meter weight (say 100 grains) must be put into the exterior cup, that is, the weight of a volume of water equal to the body, is 100 grains. The first part of the process gave the absolute weight of the body 300 grains, and the volumes being equal, the specific gravities are as the absolute weights, consequently the specific gravity of the body is 300, that of water being 100. This ar\u00e6meter may be used to find the specific gravity of liquids; the process, in that case, is the same as that described above in speaking of the ar\u00e6meter of Fahrenheit. The ar\u00e6meter of Nicholson is useful to the mineralogist for ascertaining the specific gravity of minerals; the specific gravity being a convenient character for distinguishing one kind of mineral from another. It is sometimes made of tinned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, but where more accuracy is required, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a> is the material employed. When put together, it does not exceed a foot in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>, and therefore is suited to form a part of the travelling mineralogist's apparatus.\n\nSome ar\u00e6meters have been constructed with the exterior cup C placed underneath, and supported by a stirrup, whose upper part is fixed to the stalk of the ar\u00e6meter, as represented on the margin; this is done in order to place the centre of gravity low, that the ar\u00e6meter may thereby float more steadily. The ar\u00e6meter floats in a cylindrical vessel fitted to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> of the stirrup, and this vessel is supported on a stand so formed as not to interfere with the free <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of the stirrup.\n\nThe ar\u00e6meter of Deparcieux is like the common hydrometer, only the ball is much more voluminous; this renders it capable of indicating the small difference which exists in the specific gravity of the water of different springs, for which purpose Deparcieux proposed it. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DILATATION\">dilatation</a> of the large glass <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BULB\">bulb</a> by heat, has a considerable effect on the operation of this instrument, and this dilatation being different in different instruments, renders the results inaccurate. The different ar\u00e6meters above-mentioned, have the advantages of being easily made and easily carried about; but where the specific gravity of a body is required with the greatest accuracy, recourse must be had to the hydrostatic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a>, which ought to be constructed with the utmost care by the most skilful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol3.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a>.\n\nThe following algebraic expressions may serve to elucidate some of the properties of the ar\u00e6meters hitherto spoken of:\n\n\\( g \\) is the specific gravity of water, which is 1000 ounces when the ounce and foot are taken as units, 1000 ounces avoirdupois being the weight of a cubic foot of water.\n\n\\( z \\) is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a> of the wire-stalk of the ar\u00e6meter.\n\n\\( \\pi \\) is 3.1415, &c., the number expressing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIPHERY\">periphery</a> of a circle whose diameter is 1.\nWhen the small weight, the density of the liquid, and the length of that part of the stalk which is submerged on adding the small weight, are known, then this equation will give the diameter of the stalk in known quantities \\( z = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\frac{w}{v + \\frac{1}{3}x^2}}} \\).\n\nWhen the weight of the whole araeometer is known in ounces, &c., and the specific gravity of one of two liquids (water for instance) is known, the difference of specific gravity between that liquid and another liquid may be had in known quantities.\n\n\\( g \\) is the specific gravity of water.\n\n\\( g' \\) is the specific gravity of the second liquid, which is here supposed more dense.\n\n\\( w \\) is the weight of the volume of water displaced by the araeometer.\n\n\\( s \\) is a small additional weight placed on the exterior cup to keep the araeometer, when placed in the denser liquid, at the same point of immersion as when it floated in water.\n\n\\( w + s \\) is the whole weight of the apparatus when floating in the denser liquid.\n\nThe equation \\( g' = \\frac{w + s}{v + \\frac{1}{3}x^2} \\) is obtained by substituting \\( g' \\) for \\( g \\), and \\( w + s \\) for \\( w \\) in the equation, \\( g = \\frac{w}{v + \\frac{1}{3}x^2} \\), which was given above. Divide by \\( g = \\frac{w}{v + \\frac{1}{3}x^2} \\) and there results \\( \\frac{g'}{g} = \\frac{w + s}{w} \\), which gives the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> of the density of the second liquid to the density of water. By <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUBTRACTION\">subtraction</a> there results \\( \\frac{g' - g}{g} = \\frac{s}{w} \\) and \\( g' - g = \\frac{s}{w} \\), that is, the difference between the density of the second liquid, and the density of water is found by multiplying the small weight by 1000 ounces, and dividing this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRODUCT\">product</a> by the number of ounces, &c., which denote the weight of the araeometer unchanged.\n\nSmall bodies, whose specific gravities are known, serve to indicate the specific gravity of a liquid in Ar\u00e6ometer, which they just remain suspended. In this way, beads of glass, three or four tenths of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a> in diameter, are employed, each of which remains suspended in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of a certain specific gravity. The density of each of these beads, or rather bubbles, is regulated by the proportion between the quantity of glass and the cavity which the glass incloses. A piece of bees-wax, whose specific gravity, by the addition of lead, is such, that the body is just suspended in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRINE\">brine</a> of a known density, is used as an araeometer in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> works.

It is employed in finding the specific gravity of liquids in the following way: 1st, The phial is filled with distilled water, and then weighed in a balance; 2dly, The phial is emptied, and again filled with the liquid, whose specific gravity is sought, and weighed in a balance, the proportion of the weight of the contents of the phial in the second process to the weight of its contents in the first, is the specific gra-\nThe pressure of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a> supports columns of different fluids, whose height is inversely as the densities of the fluids. An arrometer has been constructed on this principle. It is a curved tube, one leg of which has its extremity immersed in water, and the other in the spirit whose density is to be tried. On rarifying the air in the tube, by means of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PUMP\">pump</a> fixed at the upper part of the tube, the water ascends in one leg, and the spirit in the other; the height of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> of each liquid being measured by a scale of equal parts applied to each branch of the tube.

Ploughs.\n\nOf ploughs there are a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> many different sorts; and, besides the variety of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> occasioned by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of soils, and the different purposes for which they are employed even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, there is a considerable diversity in the form, in districts where both the soil and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of culture are nearly alike. The most obvious general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> among ploughs is, their being constructed with or without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHEELS\">wheels</a>; and each of these kinds may be again distinguished by other circumstances\u2014such as the form of the mould-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOARD\">board</a> and share; their operation in making one or more furrows at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>; their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIZE\">size</a>; and the depth at which they are calculated to work, as in trench-ploughing. It would neither be of much utility, nor at all consistent with our limits, to describe all the numerous varieties of form. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the operation to be performed, and the rules for constructing ploughs that shall be adapted to the different purposes of the cultivator, have been already pointed out in the body of the work; and, therefore, all that is necessary here is to mention those ploughs that are in most general use, in the best cultivated districts.\n\nThe Swing-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLOUGH\">Plough</a>, with a feathered sock or share, and a curved mould-board, is almost the only one used in Scotland, and throughout a considerable part of England. The old Scotch plough mentioned in our former article has been laid aside, except in a few of the least improved counties, where it is still found useful, when the soil is encumbered by roots or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>. The swing-plough is drawn with less power than wheel ploughs, the friction not being so great; and it probably admits of greater variations in regard to the breadth and depth of the furrow slice. It is usually drawn by two horses <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABREAST\">abreast</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> tillage; but for ploughing between the rows of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRILL\">drill</a> culture, a smaller one, drawn by one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>, is commonly employed. A plough of this kind, having a mould-board on each side, is also used both in forming narrow ridges for turnips and potatoes, and in laying up the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> to the roots of the plants, after the intervals have been cleaned and pulverized by the horse and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> hoe. This plough is sometimes made in such a manner, that the mould-board may be shifted from one side to the other when working on hilly grounds; by which means the furrows are all laid in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>\u2014a mode of construction as old as the days of Fitzherbert, who wrote before the middle of the sixteenth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>. This is called a turn-west plough.\n\nSwing-ploughs, similar to the present, have been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> known in England. In Blythe's Improver Improved, (Edit. 1652,) we have engravings of several ploughs; and what he calls the \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> plough\" does not seem to differ much in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> parts from the one now in use. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMOS\">Amos</a>, in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> on Agricultural Machines, says that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> named Lunnus (whom he is mistaken in calling a Scotchman, see Maxwell's Practical Husbandman, p. 191.) first attempted its construction upon mathematical principles which he learned in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>; but having obtained a patent for the making and vending of this plough, he withheld the knowledge of these principles from the public. However, one Pashley, plough-wright to Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol6.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> Turner of Kirkleatham, having a knowledge of those principles, constructed upon them a vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of ploughs. Afterwards his son established a manufactory for the making of them at Rotherham. Hence they obtained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of the Rotherham plough; but in Scotland they were called the Dutch or patent plough.\"\u2014\"At <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> the Americans, having obtained a knowledge of those principles, either from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> or Holland, claimed the priority of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>; in consequence of which, Mr Jefferson, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-PRESIDENT\">President</a> of the United <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">States</a>, presented the principles for the construction of a mould-board, first to the Institute of France, and next to the Board of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">Agriculture</a> in England, as a wonderful discovery in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol1.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a>.\" (Communications to the Board of Agriculture, Vol. VI. p. 487.)\n\nAccording to another writer, the Rotherham plough was first constructed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-YORKSHIRE\">Yorkshire</a> in 1720, about ten years before Lunnus's improvements. (Survey of the West Riding of Yorkshire.)\n\nBut the present improved swing-plough was little known in Scotland till about the year 1764, when Small's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of constructing it began to excite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>.* This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> mechanic formed the mould-board upon distinct and intelligible principles, and afterwards made it of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>. His appendage of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a> has been since laid aside. It has been disputed, whether he took the Rotherham or the old Scotch plough for the basis of his improvements. The swing plough has been since varied a little, in some parts of Scotland, from Small's form, for the purpose of adapting it more completely to particular situations and circumstances. Of late this plough has been made entirely of iron. See Plate I.\n\nWheel-Ploughs, used in many parts of England, Wheel-are also constructed in a great variety of forms. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> recommendation is, that they require less skill in the ploughman; but it is admitted, that the friction caused by the wheels adds to the resistance, and that they are more expensive, and more liable to\n\n* Small's Treatise on Ploughs and Wheel Carriages, 1784; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Kames's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol10.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">Gentleman</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">Farmer</a>.","sp":337,"ep":338},{"h":"ARAUCANIA","t":"a territory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the western <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of South <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>, extending 186 miles in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>, between the rivers Biobio and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol21.html#article-VALDIVIA\">Valdivia</a>, and penetrating 420 miles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INLAND\">inland</a> to the foot of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ANDES\">Andes</a>.

Originally, Araucania was of smaller dimensions, not reaching above 300 miles from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>-shore; but it received a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> accession by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNION\">union</a> of another territory belonging to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> Puelches, in the course of the seventeenth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>.\n\nThis is a pleasant and fertile <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, partly consisting of wide and extensive plains, partly mountainous, with spacious valleys interposed. It contains two considerable lakes, Laquen, called Villarica by the Spaniards, 72 miles in circuit, with a conical islet in the centre; and Nahuelguapi, 80 miles in circuit, which also has an islet towards one side covered with trees. The latter is the source of a river of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a>, which, after a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> course, falls into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCEAN\">ocean</a>, near the Straits of Magellan; and the Talton, which discharges itself farther north into the sea, rises from the latter. A great volcanic mountain, fourteen miles in circumference at the base, and visible at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> of 150, stands near the lake Villarica. Its eruptions are not violent, though it is always in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> state. The summit is covered with snow, but lower <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>, perpetual verdure is intermixed with woods, and besides mineral springs, several streams flow from it. Sulphur and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">Salt</a> are plentiful on Araucania, the eastern confines; and quantities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMBER\">Amber</a>-grease are thrown up on the coast. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINES\">Mines</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">Gold</a>, formerly yielding immense revenues, are said to exist in the southern parts, but ever since the natives expelled their Spanish invaders, they have prohibited resorting to them under pain of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. Possibly all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-REMEMBRANCE\">remembrance</a> of their site is lost, and the Araucanians are sufficiently prudent to avoid awakening the cupidity of neighbouring nations by discovering it. This precious metal is not rare beyond their confines. We are acquainted with the vegetable productions of this territory, only in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> with those of the surrounding country; they are numerous, useful, and afford a copious supply for the sustenance of mankind. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> and utility of a tree called the Pehuen, probably a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>-fruit, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> of some analogous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>, is particularly celebrated, as uniting the properties of the Pine, Chestnut and Frankincense. It is of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPONTANEOUS\">spontaneous</a> growth, requiring no culture, and rises 80 feet in height, by about 8 in circumference; the whole tree at full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> being of a pyramidal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>. The flowers are conical, and its fruit, which is as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, is divided into cells, containing kernels resembling chestnuts. These are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATE\">ate</a> in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>, or sometimes reduced to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLOUR\">flour</a>, and preserved by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a>. A yellowish odoriferous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUM\">gum</a> exudes through the bark. The sea abounds in fishes, and various ph\u0153ne frequent the shores. Of these the sea Elephant is the largest, often being 22 feet in length, and 15 around the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>; it produces more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> than the rest; and is so fat, that undulations under the skin are perceptible during its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>. Furious combats ensue among the males for possession of the females, which latter always retire until their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a>; and that for the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> is in the death of one or other of them. Their skins are generally covered with scars; yet notwithstanding the great size of the animal, and its warfare among its own species, a smart blow near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOSE\">nose</a> is invariably fatal. A species of Hippopotamus is said to inhabit some of the lakes and rivers of Araucania, different from that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>, but its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> is not sufficiently authenticated. However, it is only of late years that Naturalists have become acquainted with the real Hippopotamus, whose figure and habits were long considered to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FABULOUS\">fabulous</a>. One of the most useful animals in this country is the Chililhueque, a species of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIMINUTIVE\">diminutive</a> camel, greatly resembling the sheep, about 4 feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>, of various colours, grey, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> very soft <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a>, which is employed solely in manufacturing the finest cloths. Formerly, it was used as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BEAST\">beast</a> of burden; now it is highly prized by the inhabitants, by whom it is never killed except at festivals, or on occasion of solemn sacrifices.\n\nThe natives of the country now described, are called Inhabitants Araucans or Araucanians from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of Arauco, which forms a small portion of it. They denominate themselves Ara, which signifies free, or unsubdued, though some European authors have affirmed, that both Auca and Araucanian originated with the Spaniards, as a name of reproach, signifying rebel or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANDITTI\">banditti</a>; and others, such as Falkner, says, that they denominate themselves generally moluches or warriors. Whatever may be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, they are a\nThe Araucanians do not differ from the ordinary stature of mankind; their persons are handsome; they are of a strong muscular form and martial appearance; their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a> is of a reddish brown, clearer than that of the other Americans; they have round faces, small expressive eyes, and small flat feet. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEFORMITY\">Deformity</a> among them is very rare. The women are of a fine delicate figure, and many, especially of one of their tribes called Boromees, are beautiful. The Araucanians possess uncommon vigour of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>, which is probably augmented by their free and uncontrolled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of life. Inhabiting a delightful country, and unaccustomed to that variability of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> which generates lasting distempers, they rarely become grey before attaining sixty or seventy years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>; many are to be seen who have reached an hundred; and to the latest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> and mental faculties remain equally entire.\n\nThese people are said to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> high in moral character; they are intrepid and patient of labour, enthusiastic admirers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, which has gained them the name of invincible from their enemies; courteous, and hospitable. But these good qualities are sullied, if not altogether obscured, by numerous vices. They are prone to all kinds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRUNKENNESS\">drunkenness</a> and debauchery: they are haughty and presumptuous, entertaining a profound contempt for other nations, and considering <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-WAR\">war</a> the only genuine source of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>; sentiments which powerfully conspire to keep barbarians barbarous. Not content with exercising their prowess against their neighbours, they practise invasions of each others <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>, and carry off quantities of spoil. But notwithstanding their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> violence, these private dissensions are generally confined to pilage, without bloodshed, for deadly weapons are seldom resorted to. Their animosity towards the Spaniards being originally roused by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> provocation, has remained for centuries unabated; and, in their incursions into their settlements, they have sometimes put all the men to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>, while the women were spared, and carried into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTIVITY\">captivity</a>. They have been called faithless and treacherous by that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>; but most probably more from resisting oppression, than from truly meriting such reproaches.\n\nThe Araucanians being a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> people, have adopted a suitable costume, consisting in clothes fitted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> to the body, and a mantle or cloth, called poncho, with an opening in the middle, to admit the head. Some of these are of so fine and elegant a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEXTURE\">texture</a>, as to sell for an hundred, or an hundred and fifty dollars. The head is begirt by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WREATH\">wreath</a> of embroidered wool, and ornamented with beautiful plumes, during warfare. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODESTY\">Modesty</a> and simplicity equally distinguish the dress of the women, which is entirely of woollen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STUFF\">stuff</a>, and consists of a piece descending to the feet, a girdle, and a cloak, called ichella; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> floats gracefully in tresses over their shoulders, and their heads are decorated with a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSE\">false</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMERALD\">emerald</a>, that is held in great estimation. Necklaces and bracelets are also wore for ornament, and rings on every finger. The national <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> for all the apparel of both sexes, especially among the lower classes, is greenish blue.\n\nThe Araucanians never inhabit towns: their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of independence has deterred them from living in places surrounded by walls, which they consider a mark of servitude: hence they dwell in cottages or hamlets scattered on the banks of rivers, or on plains: and, as their local attachments are strong, each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> prefers occupying the same bounds which have served for the subsistence of its forefathers. The houses are simple, kept remarkably clean and neat, and proportioned to the size of the family. They are surrounded by trees, under which they partake of their meals, in the open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a> during <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>; and the wealthy are then fond of displaying their plate. These people are much less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARNIVOROUS\">carnivorous</a> than most uncivilized tribes, neither do they esteem fish grateful food, and they live chiefly on what is prepared from different kinds of grain. At their feasts, however, or marriages, funerals, and such public occasions, remarkable profusion prevails: three hundred individuals are then sometimes present; the feast lasts two or three days, and as much provision is consumed as would maintain an ordinary family during two years. Fermented liquors form a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> ingredient of the entertainment, and the guests testify great dissatisfaction, should they be at all sparingly supplied with it, whatever may be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>. Every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of property being anxious to entertain his friends, Bacchanalian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REVELS\">revels</a> succeed each other, almost without interruption; and they are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCCUPATION\">occupation</a> of the Araucanians, when free of warfare.\n\nCelibacy is thought reproachful here. Both sexes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">Marriage</a>, in that state are exposed to contemptuous expressions, and polygamy is practised to an unbounded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>. A man marries as many wives as he can afford to purchase, for the father of each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> receives a price on her being transferred to a husband. Marriage is attended with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> violence. The husband, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONCERT\">concert</a> with the father of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIDE\">bride</a>, accompanied by some friends, lies in wait near a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, where she knows she is to pass. Notwithstanding her shrieks, and affected resistance, she is placed behind him on horseback, and is conducted with much clamour to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, where her relations receive the covenanted presents, after having partaken of a feast. The expense on such occasions is so considerable, that none except the rich can afford to marry many wives; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> are generally content with one or two. The first, however, is alone respected as the real or legitimate spouse; all the others are held in a secondary view; and she has the whole arrangement and regulation of the internal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> concerns. But it is no easy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> for the husband to repress the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JEALOUSY\">jealousy</a> and rivalry excited by the jarring inclinations of his different wives. Each must daily present him with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISH\">dish</a> of some food prepared by herself, in her own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KITCHEN\">kitchen</a> or fireplace; for which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a>, the Araucanians have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of fires in their houses equal to that of the women inhabiting them, and the most polite way of inquiring of any one how many wives he has, is asking \"how many fires he keeps?\" Each wife must, besides, supply her husband with a poncho or cloak yearly. They entertain great respect for their husbands; and in addition to their domestic duties,\nAraucanians, they have to perform all the most laborious operations. Both sexes practise several daily ablutions, in the course of which they become expert swimmers and divers, and they are able to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> the largest rivers with great facility.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">Reading</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> are no part of the accomplishments of the Araucanians, nor can they be induced to acquire either; but they hold oratory in high estimation. Children are accustomed from an early period to speak in public, and are carried by their parents to the national assemblies, where the best Orators of the country display their eloquence; therefore much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> is paid to speaking correctly, and preserving their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> pure. So great is their precaution to avoid the introduction of any foreign expressions, that if a stranger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> in their territory, he is compelled to abandon his own name, and assume one in the Araucanian language. The Missionaries who preach in the national language with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of making converts, are frequently interrupted by the audience when an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> escapes them. The speeches of the Araucanian Orators are said to be highly figurative, allegorical, and elevated; they contain all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHETORIC\">rhetoric</a>, and are constructed by its rules. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a> is impressive, and seems capable of being directed to the passions. They are fond of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a>, which is expressed in blank <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSE\">verse</a>, not in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RHYME\">rhyme</a>, and, like that of all barbarous nations, is employed on warlike exploits. Its images are bold, lively, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANIMATED\">animated</a>; for it has been truly observed, that unrestrained enthusiasm is the chief characteristic of the poetry of the uncivilized. Their learning, however, is very limited, and certainly the cultivation of poetry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not readily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> to its improvement. In physic, the Araucanians <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> in simples, or the practice of ceremonies; and their leading <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> ascribes the origin of all diseases to insects or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WITCHCRAFT\">witchcraft</a>. Ordinary remedies are resorted to for destroying the former; but for the latter, a different course is followed. The physician having lighted up the patient's room, desires the women to sing a doleful tune, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCOMPANIMENT\">accompaniment</a> of drums, while he fumigates the patient; and a sheep, about to be sacrificed, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-TOBACCO\">tobacco</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a>. Having killed the animal, and sucked some blood from its heart, he approaches the patient, pretending to inspect his belly for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POISON\">poison</a> which has been administered by some sorcerer, and then falls into a pretended swoon, accompanied by frightful contortions. While the sick <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a>'s relations question him concerning the cause of the evil, he answers in a manner the most suitable to the occasion, or fixes an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCUSATION\">accusation</a> on some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a>, which frequently leads to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> of the innocent in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a> of the supposed injury. Their physicians, however, are capable of reducing dislocated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SETTING\">setting</a> fractured <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BONES\">bones</a>; they can even perform wonderful cures of wounds, and have a slight skill in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISSECTION\">dissection</a>.\n\nThe Araucanians divide the year into twelve months, the names of which are characterized by their properties, as Avuin-cuyen, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>; Cogi-cuyen, the month of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARVEST\">harvest</a>; Huin-cuyen, the unpleasant month; Hacul-cuyen, the first month of winds; thus somewhat resembling the Prairial, Floreal, Nivose, in the revolutionary language of the French. They divide the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> into twelve parts, each Araucanian equal to two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a> with us in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>. The stars are classed in constellations; they are acquainted with the planets; and some among them even entertain speculations of their being other inhabited worlds. Comets are supposed to originate in terrestrial exhalations united in the higher regions; and they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CALL\">call</a> eclipses the death of the sun or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>. Few generations can avail themselves of the knowledge of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>, or preserve their own to posterity, where writing is not practised.\n\nThey have little acquaintance with the arts, and are ignorant of the principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>; chiefly employed in warfare, they are accustomed to constant privations, and thence abstain from those luxuries which are the offspring of a state of peace and the arts. Their principal manufacture consists of ponchos or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> cloaks, which some years ago they were wont to dispose of to the extent of 4000 annually, either to the neighbouring tribes or to the Spaniards: their other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol8.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of traffic are cattle, horses, feathers, and baskets of curious workmanship. They have the character of strict integrity in commercial transactions, which are conducted entirely by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BARTER\">barter</a>. They have no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, and for their own commodities receive wine, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, and hardware.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of the Araucanians bears some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> to the feudal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a>, but it does not appear, that, as in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, their lands are held by military <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TENURE\">tenure</a>. The whole territory is divided into four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> districts called Uthal-mapus, being the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MARITIME\">maritime</a> country, the plains, the country at the foot of the Andes, and that which is occupied by part of these mountains. Each district is subdivided into five provinces, and each province contains <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> counties; therefore their total possessions are partitioned into an hundred and eighty parts. Each Uthal-mapu is governed by a chief, styled Toqui or commander, subordinate to whom are the Apo-Ulmenes, and on these, in so far as respects military affairs, are dependent, the Ulmenes, under whose immediate jurisdiction the counties are placed. All these orders have badges of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a>; the Toqui a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HATCHET\">hatchet</a>, the Apo-Ulmen a silver-headed baton, encircled by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol18.html#article-RING\">ring</a> on the middle, the Ulmen a baton simply with a silver head, and their dignities are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a>. The whole combine in a great national <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> usually held in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, where the pleasures of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> usually divide their attention with state affairs. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> council is vested with the power of declaring war; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a> of a military commander in chief, immediately follows a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> to that effect. Should none of the Toguis be themselves qualified for so important a station, any other person whatever may be chosen, even one of low rank: and on his appointment he assumes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of Toqui, bears the stone hatchet, which is laid aside by the rest, who now take an oath of fealty to him. He regulates the number of soldiers to be furnished by each portion of the state, and nominates the higher officers, who have the choice of their own subalterns. Meantime ex-warfare presses are secretly dispatched to all the allies of the nation, announcing the approach of hostilities: which are intimated by investing the envoy with a bundle of\nAraucan\u00eda. Arrows tied together with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> string; but if they have actually commenced, the finger of a slain enemy is added to the arrows. The armies consist of five or six thousand men, cavalry and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANTRY\">infantry</a>, though some authors who have written on this subject, deny that the whole country can produce such a force: the infantry is divided into regiments, of 1000 each, containing ten companies of 100 men: the cavalry is divided in the same manner, but the numbers are not always alike: their arms are swords and lances; those of the infantry, pikes or clubs pointed with iron. The onset of these troops is terrible; they bear every thing before them, and always try to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COPE\">cope</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> to hand with their foes. Each soldier, as was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> of Europe in feudal times, carries his own provisions, which consist only of a small bag of parched <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAL\">meal</a>; and this diluted with a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, generally proves sufficient subsistence until reaching an enemy's country, where he can live at free <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>. Their conflicts are conducted with great desperation, though, at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, wonderful regularity and subordination are preserved; but as all pant after military glory, and as valour is the only path to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POST\">post</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> is eagerly courted, where rank after rank is successively destroyed before defeat or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VICTORY\">victory</a> can be declared. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> over, and the spoils of war divided by equal portions, according to numbers, not in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to rank, the next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a> is a horrible sacrifice of one of the unfortunate captives to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANES\">manes</a> of those who have fallen, called Prolancon, or the dance of the dead. Many barbarous nations, nay some emerging from the darkness of their savage state, have been accustomed to offer up human sacrifices; and all mankind have believed, at one period or other in their progress to civilization, that blood was grateful to their Deities, or that it was necessary for the repose of their deceased relatives. Some, less cruel and sanguinary, have been content with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a> of the lower animals; but others, more atrocious, have shed the blood of their own species. This deliberate murder has been of three distinct descriptions: first, to propitiate Divinities, or to avert their wrath; secondly, that the victims might be useful to deceased persons passing to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> state; and thirdly, that the manes of those who had fallen in war might be appeased. The Prolancon, nevertheless, is seldom resorted to; but, when determined on, it is conducted with great formality. The miserable prisoner is seated on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>, deprived of its ears and tail, with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a> turned towards his own country, and ignominiously conducted amidst a circle of the Araucanians and their chiefs. There he is obliged to dig a hole in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>, wherein a number of rods are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> in succession; and while he repeats the names of the warriors of his nation, the surrounding soldiers accompany his words with contempt and execrations. He is next ordered to cover the hole, as if to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURY\">bury</a> the reputation and value of his fellow warriors, whom he has just named. Then the Togui, or one of his bravest companions, ambitious of the honour, dashes out the brains of the unfortunate victim with a club. But the solemnity is not yet completed; for, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CANNIBAL\">cannibal</a>-like ferocity, his heart is instantly torn out, and presented to the Chief, who, sucking a little of the blood, transmits it to his officers, to follow his Araucan\u00eda example. Should the skull of the prisoner not have been fractured by the violence of the blow, a cup is made of it, which, as is told of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Scythians, is used at the succeeding banquets. Meanwhile the soldiers strip the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> from off the bones, in order to procure them for flutes; and, having cut off the head, carry it on a pike around their circle, stamping a measured <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-MARCH\">march</a>, and vociferating the war <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SONG\">song</a> of Savages. In the next place, the head of a sheep is applied to the mangled corpse, and the whole ceremony closes with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of riot and intoxication. Should a truce follow victory or defeat, and both, or either side be weary of the contest, the parties meet in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONGRESS\">congress</a>, and an Araucanian Orator makes a speech on the evils of war, the advantages of peace, and the most eligible means of mutually preserving it. A branch of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-CINNAMON\">cinnamon</a>-tree is here a pacific <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMBLEM\">emblem</a>, as that of the olive is elsewhere. If the enemies are Spaniards, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-PRESIDENT\">President</a> or leader makes an answer adapted to the circumstances of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a>; and articles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a> having been agreed upon, several chiliqueques are sacrificed for its permanence. The Chiefs of each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PARTY\">party</a> then participate of a meal together, and presents are distributed to those of the Araucanians. It is affirmed, that, as the latter suffer least from warfare, and conduct it without much difficulty, they never sue for peace, and thence that the first overtures always proceed from the Spaniards, with whom they have incessantly been engaged in bloody and destructive contests. But it is rather to be inferred, from the best authorities, that they have not invariably <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> equal confidence; and that their numbers, at the end of a war, have been so greatly diminished, as to make them as desirous as their foes of pacification. A congress must frequently be repeated, as without it, the Araucanians, a haughty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>, would consider themselves neglected and despised, and go to war for no other reason.\n\nThe civil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CODE\">code</a> of these people is very limited, and, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as their criminal laws, rest entirely on consuetudinary principles, none being written. The latter chiefly respect the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> of murder, robbery, witchcraft, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADULTERY\">adultery</a>, and treachery, which are all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> offences. The murderer, however, can escape by a pecuniary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> with the relatives of the deceased; and husbands and fathers are not subject to any punishment for putting their wives or children to death, because they are judged to be the natural masters of their lives. Persons accused of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SORCERY\">sorcery</a> are first tortured by fire, on purpose to obtain a discovery of their accomplices, and then stabbed with daggers. Execution immediately follows the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> is sometimes administered in a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> and tumultuous manner. Impatient of delay, the Araucanians often <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of retaliation in lesser offences, which leads to the subversion of all public order, and is the source of many enormities in their turn becoming the objects of this kind of retributive justice.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> of the Araucanians is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> of absurdity invented by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGNING\">designing</a> or superstitious, and imposed on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a> and credulous whom they found ready to receive it; but, amidst that absurdity, containing some principles which have generally\nAraucania, been admitted by the more reflecting part of mankind. They are said to believe in a Supreme Being, who has subordinate Deities, like their own subaltern officers. One of these is the god of war, another a benevolent, and a third a malevolent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a>, who is called Guecubu. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> is the most active <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a> of all others, and the source of every misfortune. If a horse dies, it is because the Guecubu has rode him; if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> trembles, it is because the Guecubu has given it a shock; nor does a person ever die, who is not suffocated by the Guecubu. Such is the language of the Missionaries, from whom alone our principal knowledge of the Araucanians is derived. However, these Divinities receive no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADORATION\">adoration</a>; they have no temples, and only on occasion of some severe calamity, or the conclusion of a peace, are sacrifices offered to them. Then the Araucanians immolate animals, and burn tobacco, which is esteemed the most grateful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCENSE\">incense</a>. The Supreme Being, and the benevolent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEITY\">Deity</a>, are invoked on urgent occasions,\u2014those which most naturally induce mankind to seek the protection of superior powers. Christianity has never made any progress among this nation; and although the Missionaries are well treated, respected, and allowed ample liberty to preach their doctrines, they are utterly unsuccessful in making converts. The Araucanians are extremely superstitious; they have implicit confidence in omens and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVINATION\">divination</a>, particularly such as may be gathered from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DREAMS\">dreams</a>, or the flight of birds; and he who has confronted death with intrepidness in battle, will tremble at the sight of an owl. They entertain uncommon apprehensions of pretended sorcerers, who they imagine keep under control a kind of beings partaking of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of men and animals, concealed in caverns by day, but let loose to transform themselves into nocturnal birds, that shoot invisible arrows at their enemies as they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRAVERSE\">traverse</a> the air. On all occasions they consult Soothsayers, who boast of their own powers, and give firm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> to their predictions. The immortality of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> is a principle admitted by the Araucanians; they maintain that the human frame is compounded of two substances essentially different, one destructible on death, the other incorruptible and incorporeal, which exists for ever. They have also wavering <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> about a place of future reward and punishment, situated to the west beyond the sea; but regarding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> state of the virtuous or the vicious, they are not agreed. Their funerals are ceremoniously conducted. The body of the deceased, clothed in his best attire, is laid on a high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BIER\">bier</a> or scaffold, where it remains during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> is passed by the relatives in weeping, or in eating with those who come to offer consolation. This meeting is called caricahuin, or the black entertainment. On <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a> the place of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERMENT\">interment</a>, a woman walks behind strewing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASHES\">ashes</a> on the way, to prevent the soul, it is supposed, from returning to its late abode; and the body being laid on the ground, is surrounded with arms and other instruments, and covered with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYRAMID\">pyramid</a> of earth or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>. Sometimes a horse is killed and inclosed among them. But no sooner do the relatives retire, than, according to their ideas, an old woman comes in the shape of a whale, to transport the deceased to the Elysian fields, though before his arrival, a toll is exacted by another Araucanian old woman guarding a very narrow passage, who malevolently deprives the passenger of an eye, in event of refusal. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELYSIUM\">Elysium</a> the same functions are exercised by the souls of the deceased as on earth; husbands have the same wives, but the latter have no children, because that region cannot be inhabited by any but the spirits of the departed. They may revisit their own country, still possessing the same properties as when united to the body; and the Araucanians conceive that the tempests of wind, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a> which they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WITNESS\">witness</a>, originate from their furious combats in the air. A storm never happens among the Andes, or on the ocean, which they do not ascribe to a battle between the souls of their deceased countrymen, and those of the Spaniards; the roaring of the wind is the trampling of their horses; thunder the rolling of drums; and lightning the flashes of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTILLERY\">artillery</a>. If the course of the storm travels towards the Spanish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONTIER\">frontier</a>, they believe that the spirits of their countrymen are victorious; if it approaches their own territory, they are overwhelmed with consternation, and encourage them to be firm and resist their enemies.\n\nThough the Araucanians wander about their own country, they are rarely seen out of it, unless while waging war; sometimes they cross to the eastern parts of South America, and, meeting with another tribe called Pampas, repair to Buenos-Ayres, there passing for the people of that nation.\n\nOur knowledge of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> is limited nearly to the period when the American Continent was visited by Europeans in the fifteenth century; and as they are themselves destitute of written records, it must be sought among the Spanish Chronologers. About the year 1450, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCA\">Inca</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-PERU\">Peru</a> attempted the conquest of the extensive region of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHILI\">Chili</a>, and consequently, of Araucania along with it; but his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> retired on being defeated in a sanguinary engagement. A century later the Spaniards having gained a firm establishment in America, resolved to extend their conquests, but were obstinately opposed by the Araucanians with a body of 4000 men, led beyond their own confines; and their conduct on this occasion, though they did not prove victorious, impressed their enemies with apprehensions which have never abated. The Spaniards were at length enabled to form settlements within their boundaries; and sometime after, Pedro de Valdivia, a celebrated officer, was defeated in a pitched battle, taken prisoner, and dispatched with the blow of a club, about the close of the year 1553. A period of bloody warfare followed, which cost the Araucanians the life of their favourite commander Lautaro, whose talents were held in the highest esteem. Though sufficiently exasperated before, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESENTMENT\">resentment</a> was inflamed still farther against the Spaniards for their barbarous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTILATION\">mutilation</a> of those unfortunate prisoners who fell into their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>. One of their bravest commanders Caupolic\u00e1n, being treacherously betrayed after a gallant resistance, was condemned to be impaled alive, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a> with arrows; but when brought to the place of punishment, and beholding the ignominy that awaited him, he hurled the executioner from the scaffold, exclaiming, \"Is there no sword,\"\nAraucanians, and some less cowardly hand to be found to put to death a man like myself? This has nothing of justice in it,\u2014it is base revenge.\" But the merciless Spaniards were deaf to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a>. Various successes and discomfits ensued, when, about the termination of the sixteenth century, the Araucanians besieged the enemy in the fortress of Puren. Unable to reduce the place so speedily as he desired, their chief presented himself before it, mounted on a fine horse recently taken from the governor, and challenged the Commander, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DON\">Don</a> Garcia Ramon, to single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMBAT\">combat</a> at the end of three days. The defiance being accepted, the Chieftains met, each accompanied by a small body of men who stood at a distance. Putting spurs to their horses, they advanced impetuously, but at the first encounter the Araucanian Toqui was pierced through the body by his adversary's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANCE\">lance</a>. Refusing to acknowledge himself vanquished, he endeavoured to remount his horse, but in doing so expired. These events were followed by the siege of Villarica, an rich and populous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> belonging to the Spaniards, which, after a resistance of two years and eleven months, fell into the hands of the Araucanians. A similar fate awaited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERIAL\">Imperial</a>' and Osorno, other cities of equal importance, and their inhabitants were led into captivity. Incessant wars, with very short intervals of repose, occupied almost the whole of the seventeenth century, and thousands after thousands fell in their prosecution. But the Araucanians received an important accession to their strength, in the union of a warlike tribe called Puelches, which was thenceforth incorporated under the same government. The eighteenth century did not open more auspiciously; for although a cessation of hostilities had prevailed some time, the Araucanians became sensible that it afforded opportunities for the Spaniards to form new and permanent establishments within their territories: the arrogance of those who resided among them, under pretence of protecting the missionaries, had also excited their indignation. Villumilla, a man of low origin but distinguished abilities, was appointed military Toqui, or commander in chief, and formed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> for expelling the Spaniards from the whole coast. But his attempt to raise his own and the neighbouring countries, in the year 1723, proved abortive, and the war was marked by nothing except some inconsiderable skirmishes. Peace having been restored, the Spanish governor conceived a scheme for the civilization of the Araucanians (regarded as chimerical by those best acquainted with their disposition), which was persuading them to live in cities. They agreed, however, to build a city, and were supplied with materials by the Spaniards, who also had assistants and superintendents on the spot, but suddenly seizing their arms, they killed their overseers, about the year 1753. Peace was once more interrupted by repeated encounters, and at length a bloody battle ensued in the year 1773. The Spaniards found themselves unable to retain any settlements within the Araucanians' territories, and the natives, in opposition to all the skill and force employed against them, have ever since been able to keep possession of their country.

He studied <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol1.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">Mathematics</a> with distinguished success under Clairaut the elder, and had for his fellow-student the celebrated Clairaut the son. He obtained a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> in the French army; and, in 1746, was embarked in the expedition which was intended to make a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> in Scotland. He was made prisoner, and was treated like other prisoners of war, no notice being taken of his having been born a British subject. He <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> attached to the House of Stuart during the whole of his life.\n\nIn 1760, he published his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTILLERY\">Artillery</a>. To estimate the force of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPLOSION\">explosion</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUN\">gun</a>-powder, he employed a cannon suspended, so that the arc of vibration described by it on its being fired, was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of the force of explosion. To measure the initial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a> of a projectile, he used Robins' machine. Robins showed, that when the velocity of a projectile is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a>, the resistance opposed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a> is not in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> of the velocity, as is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> when the velocity is small. D'Arcymade experiments with a view of ascertaining this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, but without success. His work contains an account of experiments made by him to determine the most advantageous length of cannon. He published a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> on hydraulic machines in 1754, where he treats of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MAXIMUM\">maximum</a> of effect of water-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHEELS\">wheels</a>. He also published a paper concerning the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> of the impression of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> on the retina. He found that the revolution of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUMINOUS\">luminous</a> point must be rapid, so as to be performed in \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> at the least, in order to produce the appearance of a continued luminous circle.\n\nHe was of a handsome <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, and passed much of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> in the gay world.

A little wheat is raised near Campbeltown, and in other parts of Kintyre; and a few patches of turnips are occasionally seen, but chiefly on the farms of proprietors. Clovers also, though more frequent, have not yet come into extensive culture, notwithstanding these, and other green crops, are better adapted, both to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> and the leading branches of the husbandry of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, than grain. The principal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> in the culture of bigg is the supply of the distilleries. The great body of the inhabitants live almost exclusively on oatmeal and potatoes; of the former of which they have been in the practice of importing about 20,000 bolls (of 140 lbs.) annually. Considerable progress, indeed, has been made of late in the improvement of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>, but this is necessarily limited by the small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> of land fit for profitable cultivation; there being only 125,000 acres arable out of 1,408,000 which this part of Argyreshire contains; as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> in which, till very lately, farms were held\u2014without leases\u2014and for performance of many vexatious services. Even, at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, we can recognise in Argyreshire the prominent features of the feudal ages\u2014a few great proprietors, and a numerous tenantry, indolent and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>.

Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> in 1798 was computed at upwards of 50,000, and they are understood to have increased since; for though they are now excluded from the more elevated tracts, which are more profitably occupied by sheep, the improved management of the lower grounds has, upon the whole, enlarged the means of their subsistence. These cattle are sent from the country in a store condition, commonly when about three years old, and fattened on the pastures of the south, the greater number for the consumption of England. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAIRY\">dairy</a> begins to be an object of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENINSULA\">peninsula</a> of Kintyre, where there is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> proportion of arable land, but cannot be extended to the inland and more mountainous districts of the county.\n\nUntil the middle of last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, the only sheep in Argyleshire (and their number was inconsiderable), were of the small native race, the same that are still to be found in the Hebrides, and in most parts of the Highlands of Scotland and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a>. About that period coarse woollen heath sheep were introduced into the higher and more barren districts; and as it was soon discovered that the scanty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERBAGE\">herbage</a> of these gloomy mountains, could be converted into a much greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of mutton than of beef, besides yielding a valuable article of manufacture,\u2014these hardy animals soon spread over extensive regions, upon which cattle could barely subsist in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> months; and the income of the landed proprietors, and of the public, was accordingly augmented in proportion. Notwithstanding the outcry of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a>, and the more mischievous speculations of mistaken philanthropy, the introduction of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of live stock, now increased to about 300,000, has not, as we shall see immediately, had the effect of diminishing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> of Argyleshire.\n\nIn this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of the County, there is a considerable extent of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> coppice woods; probably near 40,000 acres, which are cut periodically, commonly every 19 or 20 years, and are understood to return about 20s. per <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACRE\">acre</a> annually. Very extensive plantations have been formed by the Duke of Argyle and other proprietors. About 20 years ago, those of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRACE\">Grace</a> were reckoned to contain 2,000,000 of trees, then worth 4s. each, amounting to the enormous sum of L. 400,000.\n\nNext in importance to its agriculture, are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FISHERIES\">fisheries</a>, which, from the great extent of sea coast, and the form of the district, penetrated in almost every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> by arms of the sea, and traversed by extensive lakes, ought to furnish food and employment to the inhabitants, to an extent, perhaps, still greater than their barren territory and ungenial climate can supply. Some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> of their great importance may be formed, when we are told that the herrings caught in Lochfyne alone, in the years 1794 and 1795, were computed to be worth more than L. 80,000 (Smith's Survey, 1798). But the regulations of the revenue laws in regard to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> are universally complained of, as an intolerable grievance; forming an insuperable obstruction to the industry of the lower classes, who have not the means, nor even the knowledge, which a strict compliance with these regulations requires. Whole cargoes of herrings have been thrown into the sea in a putrid state, and others used as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANURE\">manure</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the inability of the fishermen to find surety for the requisite supply of salt, according to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a>.\n\nThe mainland of Argyleshire is principally composed of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIMITIVE\">primitive</a> rocks, which, in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>, are skirted and intermixed with those of the transition <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a>; while fl\u00f6tz rocks occur very sparingly. No volcanic rocks have hitherto been met with in the mainland of Argyleshire, but those of an alluvial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> abound everywhere. The primitive and transition rocks are stratified, and the general direction of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRATA\">strata</a> is from NE. to SW. The primitive rocks are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANITE\">granite</a>, gneiss, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MICA\">mica</a> slate, clay slate, limestone, porphyry, sienite, trap, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTZ\">quartz</a> rock. The transition rocks are greywacke, greywacke slate, clay slate, trap, and quartz; and the fl\u00f6tz rocks are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> sandstone, conglomerate, and rocks of the coal formation. The Islands off the coast of Argyleshire afford highly interesting examples of rocks of the different classes; Isla and Jura of the primitive and transition rocks; Mull of fl\u00f6tz and primitive rocks; Staffa, Rum, and Cannay, of fl\u00f6tz rocks; and Coll, Tyree, and Iona, of primitive rocks.\n\nCoal has been wrought for many years near Campbelltown in Kintyre, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> at Strontian in Sunart; and besides the slate quarries of Eisdale, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">Island</a> belonging to this County, others have been opened at Ballachelish in Appin.\n\nManufactures have made little progress in this district, and no attempts to establish them upon a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a> have yet been successful. Mr Dale endeavoured to extend to it some branches of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COTTON_MANUFACTURE\">cotton manufacture</a>, which failed, it is said, from want of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> carriage; but a number of weavers in Campbelltown and its neighbourhood, have been employed for some time in working cottons from Glasgow. The late Duke of Argyle, almost 40 years ago, set on foot a woollen manufactory near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERARY\">Inverary</a>, which, notwithstanding very uncommon encouragement given to it by his Grace and the other landed proprietors, has been long in rather a languishing state. There is a bleachfield in Kintyre; tanneries at Campbelltown and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBAN\">Oban</a>; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> works in Upper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol13.html#article-LORN\">Lorn</a> and at Loch-\nArgyleshire fine, below Inverary, belonging to English companies, who bring the ore thither, chiefly for the sake of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CHARCOAL\">charcoal</a> which the woods afford; and near Campbelltown, the formation of salt from sea water has been lately carried on to some extent. The manufacture of kelp from sea weed, to the extent of 600 tons annually, is none of the least profitable branches of industry; and that of their scanty crops of grain into ardent spirits, certainly the most pernicious.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMERCE\">Commerce</a>. The commerce of Argyleshire is also very limited, its exports consisting chiefly of raw produce; sheep and cattle, and fish, form at least two thirds of the whole: The imports are almost confined to the supply of necessaries, including only such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol8.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a>, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> has rendered scarcely less indispensable.\n\nBut, though such is the present state of this extensive territory, there is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> to anticipate a great increase of its wealth, of its industry, and of its population, as soon as a revisal of the revenue laws shall have removed the present obstacles to the prosecution of the fisheries. It is upon this species of industry, that the prosperity of the County must be founded; and it is only after wealth has flowed in from this source, that the inhabitants can be expected to succeed in manufactures or in commerce. To its natural advantages, a very important addition has been made by the Crinan Canal, cut across the peninsula of Kintyre, at an expense of L. 140,000; which shortens the voyage from the West Highland and Hebridean <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CAMPS\">Camps</a>, ports, to the river Clyde, about 200 miles. The Caledonian Canal, from the access it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> give the County to the German Ocean, and still more, from the frequent intercourse of which it will be the channel, must contribute, in an eminent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, to the prosperity of Argyleshire.\n\nThe population of the whole County, as taken under the Acts 1800 and 1811, will be seen from the following Tables:\n\n### 1800\n\n| DISTRICTS | HOUSES | OCCUPATIONS | PERSONS |\n|-----------|--------|-------------|---------|\n|           | Inhabited | By how many Families occupied | Uninhabited | Persons chiefly employed in Agriculture | Persons chiefly employed in Trade, Manufactures, or Handicraft | All other Persons not comprised in the two preceding classes | Males | Females | Total of Persons |\n| Argyle    | 2578    | 2827        | 4       | 3494 | 671 | 9087 | 6764 | 7984 | 14,148 |\n| Cowal     | 1259    | 1380        | 13      | 901  | 415 | 5268 | 3064 | 3470 | 6534  |\n| Islay     | 2370    | 2293        | 1       | 3309 | 754 | 6253 | 6045 | 6727 | 12,772 |\n| Kintyre   | 2884    | 3496        | 8       | 4252 | 1079| 11,105| 7706 | 9007 | 16,713 |\n| Lorn      | 2439    | 2581        | 4       | 5254 | 808 | 7020 | 6146 | 6936 | 13,082 |\n| Mull      | 1579    | 1601        | 2       | 1868 | 468 | 5151 | 4042 | 4568 | 8610  |\n\nTotal: 13,109 | 14,278 | 32 | 19,078 | 4195 | 43,884 | 33,767 | 38,099 | 71,859 |\n\n### 1811\n\n| DISTRICTS | HOUSES | OCCUPATIONS | PERSONS |\n|-----------|--------|-------------|---------|\n|           | Inhabited | By how many Families occupied | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">Building</a> and uninhabited | Families chiefly employed in Agriculture | Families chiefly employed in Trade, Manufactures, or Handicraft | All other Families not comprised in the two preceding classes | Males | Females | Total of Persons |\n| Argyle    | 2702    | 3720        | 76      | 1568 | 545 | 1607 | 7729 | 7908 | 15,637 |\n| Cowal     | 1212    | 1276        | 44      | 789  | 329 | 158  | 3318 | 3569 | 6887  |\n| Islay     | 2636    | 2687        | 1162    | 1284 | 615 | 788  | 6814 | 7348 | 14,162 |\n| Kintyre   | 2959    | 3733        | 62      | 1074 | 984 | 1735 | 8404 | 9882 | 18,286 |\n| Lorn      | 2721    | 2845        | 353     | 1064 | 752 | 1029 | 6462 | 7317 | 13,779 |\n| Mull      | 3010    | 3107        | 24      | 2642 | 254 | 211  | 7948 | 8886 | 16,884 |\n\nTotal: 15,240 | 17,368 | 1721 | 8421 | 3419 | 5528 | 40,675 | 44,910 | 85,585 |\n\n* No returns for Kilfinichen and Kilvicuen; population in 1791, Tyree, population in 1792, Rum, Cannay, and Muck, population in 1795.\n\nThe whole population in 1800 must therefore have amounted to 78,217.

The exposition of those principles in a simple form may proceed with ease, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> derive additional interest from the variety and importance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLATERAL\">collateral</a> discussions which it involves. We shall endeavour to elucidate the origin of numbers, to trace their early application, and to connect the progress of arithmetical computation with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of civil society. But to succeed in the performance of this task, it would require much patient and laborious research in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> which have hitherto remained almost unexplored. Where so many difficulties must be surmounted, the first attempt will need some portion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol12.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a>. We shall endeavour to maintain perspicuity, though at the risk of appearing tedious. But while intently pursuing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> object, we may sometimes fail in observing the due proportions in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a> of the subordinate parts of the discourse.\n\nArithmetic may be viewed under two very distinct forms, that would require separate appellations.\n\n1. Palpable Arithmetic, in which numbers are exhibited by counters, or abbreviated representatives of the objects themselves; and, 2. Figurate Arithmetic, in which numbers are denoted by help of certain symbols, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> characters, disposed after a particular order. The progress of Arithmetic is analogous to that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>, but it has followed the advances and transitions of this sublime art at a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a>. The numeration by counters, balls, or strokes, evidently resembles hieroglyphics or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a>-writing; while the invention of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALPHABET\">alphabet</a>, so happily contrived for the rapid transmission of thought, probably led the way to the subsequent discovery of the science of Figurate Arithmetic, founded nearly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> similar principles.

To ascertain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> and situation of the Sap-Vessels vessels of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a>, various means have been employed. The plant has been dissected both in its dry and recent state; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> qualities and movements of its fluids have been observed, and its vessels have been filled with coloured liquor, by causing it to vegetate in them. By the combined use of these several means, many important particulars have been ascertained; but it must be acknowledged, that the question is still beset with doubts and difficulties, and that, with relation to it, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> diversity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> continues to prevail. A concise statement of the facts ascertained, with respect to the movements of the vegetable fluids, may perhaps serve best to define the situation and kinds of the vessels that convey them.\n\n12. It has been proved that, early in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>\nElementary before the leaves appear, a watery fluid rises abundantly in the woody <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a> of trees, and continues visibly to ascend to the very extremity of the branches, until the leaves are developed; when, to appearance, it ceases to flow, and can no longer be collected by perforating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> tapping the tree. This fluid has been shewn to ascend through the wood, and to rise, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a>, most abundantly through its youngest or outmost circle: but in trees, whose vessels have not been obstructed from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> or other causes, it rises through every circle to the very pith, and, as far as can be judged, in all the vessels that compose those circles. At this early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of vegetation no fluid is found in the bark; nor between it and the wood; nor in the pith: but the vessels of the bark are perfectly dry. These facts are deducible from observations <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the natural flow of the fluids by Grew, Du Hannel, Walker, and others; and are supported by various experiments of M. De la Baisse, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BONNET\">Bonnet</a>, Reichel, and others, made by causing plants and parts of plants to grow in coloured liquors, in which the vessels of the wood alone became filled, but no tinge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> was communicated to those of the bark. To these vessels the several names of lympheducts, sap-vessels, ligneous tubes, ascending and adducent vessels, have been applied:\u2014we shall in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> denominate them sap-vessels.\n\n13. The vessels, which thus form the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of Sap-Vessels wood, have by some writers been distributed into different kinds, and supposed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> very different functions. At certain periods of vegetation they appear empty; and hence Malpighi supposed two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of vessels to exist in the wood, one destined to carry sap, and the other to convey <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>; and to these latter, from their supposed office, he gave the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of trache\u00e6, and from their structure called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRAL\">spiral</a> vessels. (Anatom. Plantar. Idea, p. 3.) Grew also believed these empty tubes to be air-vessels, but admitted that, at certain seasons, they carried sap. At an early period, however, Ray maintained that the vessels, thus supposed to convey air, were truly sap-vessels; and Du Hannel, in common with Grew, admitted that they carried sap in spring. Hill considered them altogether as sap-vessels, and Reichel, Hedwig, and others, by experiments with coloured fluids, proved that such was their true office. On the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, no experiments, says Ludwig, have yet shewn that there exist in vegetables, vessels destined to convey only air: and in this opinion, subsequent writers, with the exception of M. Kieser, have very generally acquiesced. We may therefore reject altogether the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> of air-vessels or trache\u00e6 in vegetables; and consider all the vessels of the wood, by whatever name they may be called, as destined to carry sap. It <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a>, however, be convenient to treat of their general nature and form under the distinct appellations of sap-vessels and spiral vessels, by which they are commonly known.\n\n14. By Grew and Malpighi the common sap-vessels were regarded as entire tubes, having no apertures but in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>. The former represents a single vessel as having the appearance exhibited in fig. 1. Plate XV., the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APERTURE\">aperture</a> or canal of which is not visible, unless highly magnified, as in fig. 2. According to Malpighi, these vessels send off numerous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CAPILLARY\">capillary</a> filaments to the cellular tissue, so that the cells are surrounded by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLEXUS\">plexus</a> of vessels, as is particularly seen in the pith of Elder and some others; and these ramifications, he adds, spring probably from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> vessels both in the bark and wood. (Anatom. Plantar. p. 29. Lugg. Bat. An. 1688.) These lateral ramifications were observed also by Leuwenhoeck in a piece of fir-wood, newly leaved. Of this wood, he procured a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONGITUDINAL\">longitudinal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> so extremely thin, that he could see distinctly the particles of fluid moving in the vessels, as represented in the upper portion of fig. 3. Plate XV.; while lower <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>, on many parts of these vessels, small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> or dots were visible, which he at length discovered to be round apertures: and as he did not see these apertures in any other parts than those in which he had separated the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> cellular tissue from the perpendicular vessels, he concluded that, at these points, these two organs were connected. He farther separated two of the vessels from the remainder, and through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MICROSCOPE\">microscope</a> they appeared as in fig. 4: but the \"engraver,\" he adds, \"said that he could not possibly draw all the jagged parts that he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a>, and we both of us perceived, in the broken membrane or coat of the tube, many excessively <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> vessels, which, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> of their smallness, he was unable to express in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a>.\" (Select Works of Leuwenhoeck, by Hoole, Vol. I. p. 12.) These opinions concerning a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> between the vessels and cells of plants, receive countenance from the experiments of De La Baisse and Reichel with coloured liquors; both of whom observed, in some instances, a tint of colour to be communicated from the vessels to the adjacent cells.\n\n15. It may however be said, that this communication between the vessels and cells, is maintained not by ramifications from the vessels, but through apertures or pores in their sides: and, accordingly, many appearances have been remarked as existing on the sides of the vessels, of which different authors have given very different representations, and which some have regarded as pores. Thus, on the vessels of the Fir, Malpighi observed certain dotted appearances, which he describes as roundish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TUBERCLES\">tubercles</a>, and which were so numerous that they appeared to cover the vessels. On the vessels of the Elm, the Beech, and the Willow, Leuwenhoeck saw similar particles which resembled small globules. (Select Works, Vol. II. p. 1.) Dr Hill, one of those conceited writers who of late profess to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> only nature herself, and affect an entire disregard of the labours of their predecessors, describes the vessels of the albumen, or newly formed wood of the Willow, as connected with each other by a flocculent interstitial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>. When, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MACERATION\">maceration</a>, this matter is detached, the vessels then exhibit a dotted appearance; and, if examined by a highly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNIFYING\">magnifying</a> power, these dots, according to him, are so many oval swellings, and each has, as it were, a mouth. Through these mouths, which he represents as innumerable, and existing on all parts of the vessels, he conceives the fluids to be discharged into the cellular tissue (On the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">Construction</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">Timber</a>, p. 18.) but he has omitted to show that the cells of the tissue possess any corresponding mouths to receive them. In fig. 5. Plate XV. is a repre-\nsentation of these vessels connected by flocculent matter, with their extremities collapsed from the escape of their juices, and their sides sprinkled with the little mouths which he mentions. These mouths, if they exist at all, are probably not pores in the sides of the vessels, but the little apertures seen by Leuwenhoek, and produced by the separation of the cellular tissue, while the parts are still young and tender. The same author, speaking of the vessels of the mature wood of the Pear, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> them to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> canals, as in fig. 6, with no lateral apertures in them.\n\n16. A still later writer, following closely in the track of Hill, and who sets out with observing, that \"the microscopical organization of plants is but little known, and that it is in vain to look for the true principles of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> in the works of Malpighi and Grew,\" declares, that not fewer than five species of vessels are to be found in the woody part of plants: These he denominates porous tubes, cleft tubes, tracheae, mixed tubes, and vessels en chapelet, from their supposed resemblance to a string of beads. Of these several species, we have given representations in figures 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12, Plate XV. The first species, or porous tubes, according to this writer, exist in every part of the plant, where the sap moves with freedom. Their sides are covered with small eminences or projections, in the centre of which is to be found a small pore. (Exposition de la Th\u00e9orie de l'Organisation V\u00e9g\u00e9tale, p. 107.) Improving a little on Hill, he represents these pores not as promiscuously placed, but as ranged in transverse lines (fig. 7); and through them he conceives the fluids of the plant to percolate; not however into the cells only, but out of one layer of tubes into another, in a lateral direction. In this manner, he conducts the fluids from the centre to the circumference of the wood, and at length, by a route not so easily followed, contrives to get them into the vessels of the bark, the sides of which he declares to be perfectly entire, and alike destitute of pores and clefts. (Ibid. p. 297.) Of such physiological notions it may truly be said, that they are every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> worthy of the fantastical anatomy on which they appear to be founded.\n\n17. Several German writers have attempted to verify the observations of M. Mirbel in regard to the existence of these pores. They all differ from one another, and, as might have been expected, are all at variance with M. Mirbel. Bernhardi, following Malpighi, deems the alleged pores to be elevations on the surface of the vessels; Rudolphi represents them as vesicles attached to their sides; Link regards them as globules contained within the vessels; and Kieser, as we shall afterwards see, knows not what to make of them. These very different opinions, formed on viewing the same objects, sufficiently manifest the difficulty and uncertainty of microscopical observations made with highly magnifying powers. The causes of this uncertainty were long ago pointed out by an experienced and most sagacious observer,\u2014the first who employed the microscope in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of the structure of plants. His statement may perhaps <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> for, though it should fail to reconcile, the differences in question. \"Of such minute objects,\" says Dr Hooke, \"there is much more difficulty to discover the true shape by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> than of those visible to the naked eye; the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> quite differing in one position to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, from what it really is, and may be discovered to be, in another: and therefore I never began to make any draughts, before, by many examinations in several lights, and in several positions to those lights, I had discovered the true form: For it is exceedingly difficult in some objects to distinguish between a promineney and a depression; between a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHADOW\">shadow</a> and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> stain, or a reflection and a whiteness in the colour. Besides, the transparency of most objects renders them yet much more difficult than if they were opaque. The eyes of a fly, in one kind of light, appear almost like a lattice drilled through with abundance of small holes; in the sunshine they look like a surface covered with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAILS\">nails</a>; in another posture, like a surface covered with pyramids; in another, with cones; and in other postures of quite other shapes.\" (Micrographia, Preface.)","sp":539,"ep":541},{"h":"ARTICLE II","t":"Of the Exhalent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYSTEM\">System</a>.\n\n77. But from their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> surface, and from the organs of the same parts as we have seen to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSORBENT\">absorbent</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a>, in certain circumstances, give off a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of fluid by transpiration; and the organs by which this function is performed, seem, from many considerations, to be the same as those by which, under other circumstances, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSORPTION\">absorption</a> is accomplish-\nThis function of transpiration is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> to all terrestrial plants, and all are more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> less furnished with pores; but it does not occur in aquatic plants, according to Decandolle, which are destitute of pores. Fleshy plants and the petals of flowers, which have but few pores, transpire little, and etiolated plants, which are destitute of pores, do not transpire at all. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">On</a> the contrary, herbaceous stems and plants, which have numerous pores, throw off most fluid by transpiration. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> agreement between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> of pores, and the exercise of the transpiratory function, leads to the presumption that they are the orifices through which the fluids are discharged; and if it be admitted that these pores are situated at the extremity of the fine ramifications that come off from the vessels, their fitness for such an office cannot be denied. Comparing these facts, regarding transpiration, with those previously stated concerning absorption, M. Decandolle is led to conclude that the pores on the surfaces of plants are the organs by which these functions are alternately carried on, according to the existing condition of dryness or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HUMIDITY\">humidity</a> in the surrounding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>.\n\n78. Repulsive as this conclusion may at first seem to our ordinary conceptions of organized bodies, yet there are many circumstances in the structure and habits of plants that give it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>; so much so, that we ourselves had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> since reached the same point by a route different from that pursued by M. Decandolle. It is highly probable, that the exhalents of the leaves are simple ramifications from the larger vessels, like the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CAPILLARY\">capillary</a> rootlets; and as they have no valves in their canal, there is no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> impediment to their exercising an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERTED\">inverted</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAP\">sap</a>-vessels themselves readily absorb, even coloured fluids, when inverted; and though their exhalent terminations are too fine to receive such fluids, yet why may they not, like the trunks from which they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>, be capable of taking up ordinary fluids in that manner? The fluids absorbed through the leaves must at once enter the sap-vessels, for there is no common reservoir to which they can first be carried; and it is extremely improbable, that, from the same parts of the same vessels, exhalants and absorbents, capable of exercising only opposite functions, should at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> arise. In the animal system, the exhalants spring from arteries, and the absorbents terminate in veins; but in the less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPLEX\">complex</a> structure of plants, it seems <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEMONSTRABLE\">demonstrable</a>, that both orders of vessels must at once communicate with the same sap-vessels. It is, therefore, more probable to suppose, that, instead of two distinct orders of vessels, as in animals, one only should be provided, capable, under different circumstances, of exercising different functions. This vicarious office of the organs, under consideration, leads to no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a> in its exercise; for the condition of the atmosphere, which favours transpiration, is that which removes from the leaves the power of absorption; and, on the contrary, absorption occurs only in a humid atmosphere, when, as Hales has shown, little or no transpiration takes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>.\n\n79. The view thus presented of the external absorbent and exhalant vessels, may probably be extended to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> vascular productions which seem everywhere to spring from the vessels internally. If secreting and absorbing vessels be held to exist in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the plant, they must every-sorbing where communicate with the vascular system; for it is from the vessels of this system that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of their secretions is primarily derived, and it is into the same vessels, that, in many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, these secretions are subsequently returned. Nor does the exercise of the two functions of secretion and absorption in plants present any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> obstacle to the supposition of their being performed, at different times, by the same organs. Thus, when nutrient matter is deposited in the cellular tissue of the seed, it is destined only for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> use, and the purpose of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> would be defeated, were an absorptive function to be, at the same time, employed for its removal. On the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, when this matter is again taken up, during the germination of the seed, no secreting function seems then to be exercised in that part; for the organ itself, in many seeds, gradually wastes, and no fresh matter is deposited in it. Even when the cotyledon, to a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, augments in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIZE\">size</a>, its nutrient matter is continually drawn off for the support of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RADICLE\">radicle</a> and plume, and no fresh matter of the same kind seems to be then deposited; so that the same vessels, which formerly exercised the function of secretion, may, without disturbing the economy of the plant, be now employed in the exercise of absorption. As thus the two functions do not require to be performed, in the same part, at the same time, they may, if nothing else forbid, be exercised at different times by the same organs. In the animal system, where the organs themselves are removed, secreting and absorbing vessels must necessarily co-exist; and to maintain the integrity of parts, their functions must proceed at the same time, and, to a certain extent, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> each other; but, as no similar operations appear to be carried on in the vegetable system, no such complex organization is required to sustain them.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">Section</a> III.\n\nOf the Cellular Tissue.\n\nArticle I.\n\nGeneral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">Description</a> and Character of the Cells.\n\n80. The elementary organ, denominated cellular tissue, may be said to consist of a membranous substance, disposed into a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of small circumscribed cavities, connected with each other, and arranged in rows or suites, generally in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> that cuts at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> tubes which represent the vascular system. From Grew, it received the appellation of parenchyme, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> still often used in describing different parts of this tissue; by Malpighi, it was called the utricular substance; and it owes, we believe, its present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> to M. Du Hamel.\n\n81. The cavities which distinguish its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> were called indifferently bags or bladders, pores, and cells, by Grew; by Malpighi, utricles; by others,\nElementary vesicles; and more commonly cells. The form of these cells varies so much, not only in different plants, but in different parts of the same plant, as to have authorized, in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, these different appellations. The tissue which they constitute, enters into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of every organ in the more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> plants. Of many herbaceous plants it forms the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> portion, and some of the lower tribes of vegetables are said to be wholly composed of it; in other words, no vessels can be actually demonstrated in them. In most cases, it contributes greatly to modify the form of organs, and adds always to their bulk and strength. Nothing can exceed the diversity of appearance in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, bulk, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEXTURE\">texture</a>, which it exhibits in the several parts, circumstances, and conditions in which it is placed. It represents sometimes a lax cellular substance, all the parts of which are succulent and transparent; in other instances, it is compressed into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> opaque body, retaining but faint traces of its former cellularity; and in others again it is spread out into a most thin and delicate membrane, in which the cellular character is wholly lost. It everywhere envelopes and holds together the vascular system, and seems to be the general receptacle of almost all the vegetable secretions.\n\n82. The figure of the component cells of this tissue is exceedingly various. Sometimes they have nearly a globular or spheroidal shape; in other instances, they are angular, and exhibit, in their section, a greater or lesser number of sides and angles, being in a few examples triangular; in others, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>, but more commonly hexagonal; the figure which collections of soft cells, mutually impressing each other, seem naturally disposed to assume. This form is represented in the transverse section of cells, fig. 20. A, Plate XV.; they seem, in this figure, and in most of those given in different works, to possess double sides; but as M. Kieser has remarked (M\u00e9m. sur l'Organisation des Plantes, p. 91.), this appearance is produced by the borders of the subjacent cells being seen through the transparent sides of the superior layer. In Plate XVI., fig. 22, is a representation of a transverse slice of the cellular part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SUGAR\">Sugar</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CANE\">cane</a>, drawn from nature, and so thin as to exhibit only one layer of cells, in which the sides appear distinctly single; but, in a thicker slice of the same plant, fig. 23, comprehending more than one layer, the double appearance becomes very evident.\n\n83. The size of the cells varies not less than their figure in different plants, and in different parts of the same plant. In one of the plates of Grew, they are represented as possessing twenty different sizes, from that of a minute pore, to the size of a common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol17.html#article-PEA\">pea</a>; Hooke examined them in Cork, and in the pith of many plants. In Cork, he reckoned several lines of these cells, or pores, as he calls them, and found there were about sixty placed endwise in one-eighteenth part of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a>, or somewhat more than a thousand in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> of an inch; and, therefore, in a square inch above a million, and in a cubic inch above 1200 millions. (Micrographia, p. 114.) In this substance, the cells are not visible by the naked eye, but become very distinct when highly magnified. In most plants, however, they are readily visible, and their appearance is familiar to every one.\n\n84. When viewed in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONGITUDINAL\">longitudinal</a> section, their hexagonal form is much less distinct, and is sometimes wholly lost. In fig. 24, Plate XVI. is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of single columns of the cells of sugar-cane, in which each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CELL\">cell</a> is, to appearance, bounded only by four sides. Similar representations are given by Hooke of the cells in Cork, and by Kieser, in most of the figures which exhibit longitudinal sections of the cellular tissue: but, in some instances, the hexagonal form is visible even in these sections. In fig. 25. of the same plate, we have given, in outline, the appearance of two series of columns of these transparent cells, in which one series is seen behind the other, and gives somewhat of the confused double appearance exhibited in the transverse section, fig. 23.\n\n85. The nature of the matter contained in the cells of this tissue, varies according to the part in which it exists, and the peculiar powers of the plant. Both Hooke and Grew remarked, that, in the pith and bark of succulent plants, the cells were often filled with aqueous juices, and in the same plants, at other periods, they appeared empty, or filled only with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>. In the seed, the cells of the cotyledons contain minute unorganized particles which, at a future <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, serve as nutriment for the young plantule. Other particles of still smaller size, of a resinous nature, and a green <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, exist in other parts of this tissue, and bestow on the plant its verdure. In every part of the plant, these cells are also the occasional receptacles of the peculiar fluids which both the sup-vessels and the proper vessels convey; and hence various gummy and resinous substances, corresponding in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> to the fluids previously existing in the vascular system, are frequently detected in them. In the pulp of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>, the various acid, saccharine, and austere juices that we meet with, are contained in different modifications of this tissue; and it is into its cells that the osseous secretions, which constitute their shells and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, are made. These facts prove not only the great importance of this tissue in the construction of the vegetable organs, but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> share it bears in the economy of their functions, and demonstrate likewise an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> betwixt the vessels and the cells.\n\n86. The sides of these cells, when emptied of their contents, and viewed through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MICROSCOPE\">microscope</a>, appear to be formed by a very fine transparent membrane, which some maintain to be everywhere entire, and others to be perforated with pores. The same sources of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> exist here as before noticed in similar microscopical observations on the vascular system; and, accordingly, the respective disputants maintain, with equal confidence, the same opinions with regard to the porosity or non-porosity of the cells, as they had previously held concerning the vessels. We must therefore <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CALL\">call</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-AID\">aid</a> of other means besides those of the microscope, for determining the important fact, whether the cells have or have not any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> communication with each other.\n\n87. Dr. Hooke examined the films or sides of the cells of Cork, of the pith of Elder, and of many other plants, with the very purpose of discovering\nElementary whether any direct communication existed between organs; but \"each cavern or cell,\" says he, \"is distinctly separate from the rest, without any kind of hole in the encompassing films;\" nor could he, with his microscope, nor by his breath, nor by any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> that he tried, \"discover a passage out of one of those cavities into another.\" (Micrographia, p. 116.) Dr Grew describes the little cells or bladders that compose the bark of roots, as possessing a spheroidal shape in most plants. When viewed with the microscope, their sides are as transparent as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>; and \"none of them,\" he adds, \"are visibly pervious from one into another, but each is bounded within itself.\" (Anat. of Plants, p. 64.) Both Hooke and Grew, however, believed a communication to exist between the cells, from the fact of their containing liquor; and Malpighi held the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> from similar considerations; but they nowhere describe the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> or structure by which they conceived it to be accomplished.\n\n88. Later writers have not only adopted this opinion, but professed to demonstrate the structure by which the communication is maintained. M. Mirbel describes the sides of the cells as composed of an extremely thin, colourless, and transparent membrane, which is commonly perforated with pores, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a> of whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APERTURE\">aperture</a> is not, perhaps, the 800th part of a millimetre. These pores are ranged generally in transverse series, and through them, it is said, the cellular tissue both receives fluids from the vessels, and transmits them very slowly through its cells. (Exposit. de la Th\u00e9orie, &c. p. 105.) M. Sprengel, and some others, adopt this view of the porosity of the cells; but it is denied by Link, Treviranus, and Kieser. The latter author declares, that, \"notwithstanding all that has been said concerning the pores in the sides of the cells, his observations, made with the greatest care and exactness, have not enabled him to discover the slightest trace of them.\" The sides of the cells, he adds, are always formed by a membrane extremely thin, but altogether smooth and uniform; and \"the cells themselves have never an open communication with each other.\" (Kieser sur l'Organisation des Plantes, p. 94.) In a critique on M. Mirbel's doctrine, he farther observes, that, although possessing eyes extremely piercing for microscopical objects, and employing the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNIFYING\">magnifying</a> powers, he has never been able to discern, in the membrane of the cells, the existence of pores, though he sought for them with the greatest care and precaution.\" (Ibid. p. 29.)\n\n89. From the results, therefore, of direct experiments employed to discover the porosity of the cells, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as from the combined reports of the most accurate microscopical observers, we must pronounce against the opinions of M. Mirbel; and although he has delineated the form and position of the pores, computed their number, and even measured their apertures, it may, we think, be asserted, that he has either been deceived himself, or has exhibited, as real copies of nature, forms and structures which never had existence but in his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> seems accordingly to have been preferred by some of his opponents; and, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRELIMINARY\">preliminary</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> to the explication of the figures in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, he comes forward with this reply to it: \"Pour \u00e9viter d\u00e9sormais toute esp\u00e8ce d'\u00e9quivoque, je dois pr\u00e9venir que les parties que je nomme organes \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires, ne se pr\u00e9sentent jamais isol\u00e9ment dans la Nature. Je fais donc ici ce que j'<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AI\">ai</a> fait dans mes descriptions; je divise par une op\u00e9ration de la pens\u00e9e, ce que la Nature n'offre que r\u00e9uni; et je montre, non pas rigoureusement ce qu'on peut voir, mais ce que la r\u00e9flexion, guid\u00e9e par l'observation et l'exp\u00e9rience, pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 l'esprit. N'est-ce pas l\u00e0 le r\u00e9sultat de l'analyse philosophique?\" (Exposition, p. 114.) He exclaims! We answer, that, in cases of this sort, we want the fair transcript of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> itself, and not the analytical result of the author's speculations about it; and we hold it not only unphilosophical, but something worse, knowingly to have given, as faithful copies of Nature, representations of the elementary organs, which, as M. Kieser remarks, are designed not from Nature, but from imagination. (M\u00e9m. sur l'Organisation des Plantes, p. 77.)\n\n90. If, then, no pores exist in the sides of the cells Mode of for the reception and transmission of the fluids they contain, some other means must be provided for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCOMPLISHMENT\">accomplishment</a> of these objects. M. Link, accordingly, supposes the juices to pass from one cell to another by transudation through invisible pores in their sides,\u2014a supposition which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> scarcely be admitted by physiologists as applicable to living organized textures. And M. Rudolphi suggests the still more extravagant opinion, that a decomposition of the fluid is effected by the cells themselves, during which it is transmitted through their sides. (Mirbel's Exposition, &c. p. 183.) To us there occur no other means of accomplishing these operations, consistently with the integrity of the cellular structure, than the exercise of those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> functions of secretion and absorption, which, from so many other considerations, we have supposed to be carried on in every living part of the vegetable system.\n\n91. Another question of less improtance in relation to the sides of the cells is, whether they are Cells single or double; that is, whether each cell has a side of its own, or whether one side is in every position common to two cells. Mirbel asserts the former, and Kieser maintains the latter opinion. In fig. 20. B. Plate XV. is an outline representation of these double sides as given by Kieser. From the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> thinness of the membrane, it is very difficult, he says, to distinguish this double structure; but where the cells are large, and a glass that magnifies highly is employed, each partition that separates two cells is distinctly seen to be composed of two membranes, which are sometimes separated about the middle of the partition, and united towards the angular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>. (M\u00e9m. sur l'Organisation des Plantes, p. 91.) The existence of this double structure receives some countenance from the fact lately observed in the construction of the honeycomb by Dr Barclay, who says that each side of every cell in the comb is composed of two plates, or is double. (Wernerian Transactions, Vol. II.) It may still, however, be more properly said, that each side of every cell is truly single, and is rendered double only by coming into contact with the corresponding side of an adjacent cell.\n92. When the cells have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> hexagonal figure, and are equally distended with their appropriate juices, there is no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> to suppose that any vacuities are left between their sides or angles. Mathematicians have long since demonstrated a regular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEXAGON\">hexagon</a> to be one of those figures that completely fills up a given space; and that no vacuities can exist either about its sides or its angles. Where, however, the cells deviate from this regular figure, and more or less approach to a spherical form, vacuities or interstices may readily be conceived to occur. These vacuities are said to have been first noticed by Leuwenhoeck, and afterwards by M. Treviranus, who describes them as interstices left between the cells in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> approximations towards each other: He gave them the name of *intercellular canals*, and considers them as the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> by which the fluids can be conveyed through the cellular tissue. (*Kieser's M\u00e9m. sur l'Organisation des Plantes*, p. 20.)\n\n93. On the other hand, MM. Mirbel and Rudolph, altogether deny their existence; but M. Kieser contends strenuously for it. He describes them as small interstices situated at the angles of the hexagonal cells, and formed not by any sides of their own, but by the mutual approach of three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTIGUOUS\">contiguous</a> cells, and possessing, therefore, a prismatic form. These interstices, he conceives to exist at every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a>, and thus every cell to be surrounded by them. In fig. 20, B, Plate XV., the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> angular points denote their place. By their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONJUNCTION\">conjunction</a> with each other, they form a canal, which, when the hexagonal figure is perfect, and the cells are ranged horizontally, extends both in a longitudinal and transverse direction; and when the cells are placed obliquely, then the canals have a similar direction. Their size varies according to that of the cells, by the sides of which they are constructed; they contain and convey the proper juices in the bark, but in the pith are often dry; and their course is said to terminate only with that of the cells themselves, at the surface of the plant. (*M\u00e9m. sur l'Organisation des Plantes*, p. 104.) Such are the organs which, as we have seen, M. Kieser considers to convey both the sap and the proper juices in plants; and which he describes as produced universally by that form of cell, which, of all others, is most calculated to exclude their existence. That, in some circumstances they may exist, and become reservoirs of the sap, or other juices, seems highly probable; but of the absurdity of ascribing to such casual productions, the performance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIMARY\">primary</a> functions of the vegetable system, we have already spoken.\n\n94. The cellular tissue, as described above, is that form of it which must be regarded as the most perfect. From various causes, however, it is subject to great alterations. In herbs, and in the pith and succulent parts of trees, the cells preserve their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> form and appearance for a considerable time; but, by the growth of the other parts, and consequent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> and compression they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, they acquire in the bark and wood an elongated figure, and this both in a transverse and longitudinal direction. In the latter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, they surround and connect the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAYERS\">layers</a> of vessels with each other, constituting what has been named the *parenchyme* of the bark and wood. In this form, their size is often greatly reduced, their cavities sometimes obliterated, and their cellular character altogether effaced. In other instances, traces of a cellular structure are occasionally visible, appearing in detached portions among the perpendicular vessels. In plants of very rapid growth, the cells are said by Kieser to become elongated in a longitudinal direction, and yet preserve their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a> nearly unchanged; so that the tissue which they form appears as if composed of a number of small cylinders. It was probably this construction that led Malpighi to regard sometimes as vessels, what, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a>, appear to be only a collection of these elongated cells. His error appears, however, but slight, compared with that of M. Kieser, who considers the bark as altogether constructed of these elongated cells, somehow metamorphosed into cortical fibres, and interlaced by other similar cells extending in a transverse direction. The wood, too, he supposes to differ in construction from the bark only in possessing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRAL\">spiral</a> vessels; its ligneous fibres he farther holds to be formed by the sides of the aforesaid elongated cells, where the intercellular canals have disappeared; and, as the spiral vessels, according to him, convey only air, no other organs remain for performing the office of sap-vessels but the intercellular canals. (*M\u00e9m. sur l'Organisation des Plantes*, p. 99, 101.) But there is a wide <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between the observations and the opinions of M. Kieser;\u2014the former we regard generally as laborious, minute, and faithful;\u2014the latter often appear to us crude, inconsistent, and absurd.\n\n95. From suffering compression in a transverse direction, the cells have frequently their longer diameter thrown into that position, and thus extend from the centre to the circumference of the plant. This disposition, as will afterwards be shown, was fully noticed by Grew and Malpighi. Leuwenhoeck also observed it, but mistook the cells, as Malpighi had done, in the opposite direction, for vessels, and considered their partitions as valves\u2014errors which M. Kieser, as well as others, duly points out, and yet, as we have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> shown, similar to that into which he himself has fallen. In this transverse direction, the tissue forms partitions more or less large between the vessels, as will afterwards be shown, and by the obliteration of its cells, it is frequently reduced to the condition of a solid membrane.\n\n96. Beside these more constant and necessary changes in the figure and character of the cellular tissue, it often suffers others of a more casual and accidental nature. In the pith, as the plant grows up, divers ruptures, says Grew, occur, oftentimes very regularly, and observed constantly in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of plant; these ruptures are sometimes prolonged, so as to form a tube of considerable length. (*Grew's Anatomy of Plants*, p. 120.) Others have observed similar canals in the pith, formed not by sides of their own, but by those of the adjacent cells, and very various in size and form: they have been called *lacunae* or reservoirs, contain a variety of substances, and sometimes, especially in aquatic plants, only air. As we have seen the cavities of the larger spiral vessels to be filled with vesicles, so the larger cells of the pith, according to Grew, frequently con-\nElementary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TAIN\">tain</a> smaller ones, or are divided by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> membranes.\n\nA similar observation is made by Kieser, who likewise remarks, that, in the empty cells of Calla \u00c6thiopic\u00e6, he has sometimes seen small round-headed bodies, supported on little peduncles, which spring from the sides, and point towards the centre of the cells. Small crystallized bodies are also occasionally found in the cavities of the cells, and within the intercellular canals. (M\u00e9m. sur l'Organisat. des Plantes, p. 94.) Of those changes in the character of the cellular tissue, by which its cells are converted into receptacles and reservoirs of the proper juices of the plant, we before discoursed when treating of the proper vessels. To such an extent does this change sometimes proceed, that, in aged Oaks, and, according to Kieser, in Guiacum, and probably in many other plants, the whole cellular tissue becomes filled with these secreted matters, and the distinctive characters of the cells, and almost of the vessels themselves, are obliterated and lost.","sp":554,"ep":559},{"h":"ARTICLE II","t":"Of the Structure and Formation of the Cellular Tissue.\n\nBut anatomists have not confined themselves solely to descriptions of the more obvious forms and characters of this tissue: they have attempted to penetrate into the secret of its ultimate structure, and, deserting thus the beaten path of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, have wandered at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> through the regions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>. It would be a waste of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> to pursue, to any considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, these vagaries of the fancy; but a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIEF\">brief</a> notice of a few of them may afford some amusement, and perhaps instruction, to the reader.\n\nIt seems pretty generally admitted, that the tissue, of which the cells are constructed, partakes of a membranous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>; and the first question therefore is, of what materials is this membrane composed? Grew considered the cells, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as the vessels, to be formed of exceedingly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> fibres, which were themselves tubulous, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> rather smaller vessels. (Anatomy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTS\">Plants</a>, p. 76, 77.) Malpighi deemed the thin membrane that forms the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CELL\">cell</a> to be produced from an effused juice, that gradually acquired <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOLIDITY\">solidity</a>, and was everywhere furnished with a reticulation of vessels. (Anat. Plantar. p. 29.) According to Du Hamel, the constituent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of this membranous structure is rather to be regarded as filamentous than vascular; though he admits, that, in fleshy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> the vessels of the cellular tissue are so numerous that they seem to form the cells themselves. (Phys. des Arbres, Tom. I. p. 15, 24.) In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a>, the elder De Saussure maintained, that what is called the cellular part is formed entirely of minute transparent vessels, which, between their junctions, swell out so as to give the appearance of cells or vesicles, though in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a> they are a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">net</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of vessels. (Encyclop. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">Method</a>. Tom. I. Art. Parenchyme.)\n\nThe manner in which these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIMITIVE\">primitive</a> vessels or filaments have been employed to form the membrane, has likewise been differently conceived by different writers. Grew imagined them to be disposed in opposite directions, like the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-WARP\">warp</a> and woof of the weaver's cloth, and everywhere knit together by the Elementary weftage of other fibres. Du Hamel could see no such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> structure, and therefore believed them to be united promiscuously, like the filaments in a piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FELT\">felt</a>; and Malpighi and Saussure seem to have regarded them as joined together in the form of net-work.\n\nNot less different have been the modes in which this membranous substance, during or after its formation, has been supposed to acquire its cellular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>. Grew seems to have thought that the figure of the cells was determined by the course which the vessels pursued in their formation; hence he remarks, that while the vessels proceed circularly, and keep within the compass of the cells, the cells are round; but where they wind out of one cell into another, then an angular form is produced. (Anatomy of Plants, p. 77.) Later observation, however, has rendered it probable that the angular form is the result rather of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> pressure which the cells subsequently exert <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> one another, than communicated during their formation. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> appearance which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of cells exhibited after their formation, he resembled to that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FROTH\">froth</a> of beer (Ibid. p. 67.); but never, as some seem to have supposed, imagined them to be produced by a similar operation. By all those who maintain the vascular nature of the cellular tissue, the cells must be considered as originating from the vessels\u2014an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> frequently advanced by Malpighi, who particularly describes the excrecence on the leaf of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OAK\">Oak</a>, called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GALL\">gall</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol15.html#article-NUT\">nut</a>, as composed of a cellular structure, which is derived immediately from the vessels of the leaf, and which opinion, as he justly remarks, the structure of the leaf itself, of the flower, and the fruit, hereafter to be described, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> illustrate and confirm.\n\nA different view of the origin and formation of cells has been taken by others. Ludwig conceived the vessels, as well as the cells, to derive their origin from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> membrane, but does not describe the manner in which the cells and vessels could be produced out of it. (Institut. Phys. Regni V\u00e9g\u00e9tab.) This opinion has since been adopted by Mirbel, who considers it as perfectly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a>; and of Mirbel has gone more into detail regarding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> in which cells and vessels are produced. According to him, the entire mass of the vegetable is a membranous tissue, the ultimate structure of which he does not pretend to explain; and out of this tissue the small cavities called cells, and the vessels are alike formed. He of course denies the independent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> of cells and vessels, and of the vascular productions or fibres by which these two organs have, by others, been supposed to be united: and maintains that the entire vegetable is constructed of one continuous membrane, between all the parts of which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> is kept up by means of innumerable pores. (Exposit. de la Th\u00e9orie de l'Organisat. V\u00e9g\u00e9t. p. 60, 62, 279.) How this membrane acquires the varied and regular forms which it exhibits in the cells and vessels of the plant, we are not distinctly told. All that we can discover on this point, is, that the cells are not distinct sacs or utricles, but produced out of a membrane which unfolds itself (se d\u00e9double) in some inconceivable manner, so as to leave empty\nElementary spaces <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTIGUOUS\">contiguous</a> to one another, which constitute Organs of the cells. (Trait\u00e9 d'Anat. et Physiol. V\u00e9g. Tom. I. p. 56.) The mass of cells thus formed, is considered very similar to the vesicles of the froth of beer, with which Grew had previously compared it; for the thin transparent plates of these vesicles are said to be everywhere continuous, and each side to be common to two vesicles, while all interstices or intercellular spaces, and all connecting vessels and fibres, are completely excluded. We are also told that the smaller vessels are only elongated cells, and the larger ones cavities formed in the cellular tissue; so that this tissue must be regarded as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> organ of vegetables, and the other organs are but modifications of it; and in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> M. Mirbel passes off the assertion of an opinion for an explanation of the mode in which the vessels are constructed.\n\n102. Instead of the continuous mass of cells which Mirbel professes to describe, M. Sprengel conceives the cells of this tissue to originate from elementary globules, such as are found in the cotyledon of the bean, which at first seem a chaotic mass of extremely minute vesicles, but are gradually developed, and acquire an angular form. This seems likewise to be the opinion of M. Treviranus, who regards the cells as originating from the aforesaid cotyledonous vesicles, which have at first a round form, but are changed afterward by the effect of pressure; these vesicles are supposed gradually to extend, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> towards each other, and in this way to construct the tissue. The elementary vesicles, however, out of which these writers construct their cells, are justly regarded by M. Link (Kieser's M\u00e9m. sur l'Organisation des Plantes, p. 17, 19, 23,) as globules of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STARCH\">starch</a> deposited for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> nutriment of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMBRYO\">embryo</a>.\n\n103. M. Kieser also derives the origin of the cells from primitive globules, but looks for them in a different part of the vegetable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a>. In the proper juices of plants, certain minute particles or globules have been observed, which, according to this author, are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> of future cells, or rather, says he, true cells themselves, though extremely minute. An <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFINITE\">infinite</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of these globules exist in the proper juices, which juices are present in every primitive utricle. Gradually these globules dilate, approach, and are soldered to each other, receiving by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECIPROCAL\">reciprocal</a> pressure an hexagonal figure, and thus constructing the cellular tissue, which is nothing but a parenchyme of many small cells, enclosed in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> cell, or primitive utricle. Each cell, therefore, of the cellular tissue is, in its origin, only a transparent globule, which becomes filled with fluids, and soldered to the adjoining cells, so as to form an entire piece, the parenchyme of the plant. As this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DILATATION\">dilatation</a> of these primitive globules is, in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a> of the plant, the cellular tissue is the first and primitive organization of the plant, from which proceed afterwards all the other elementary organs. (Ibid. p. 219.) Such is M. Kieser's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of the origin of the cellular tissue, which, as we think, surpasses in absurdity that of M. Mirbel, whose doctrine he so justly condemns;\u2014but so much easier is it to \"see the mote in our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>'s eye,\" than to be conscious of the \"beam in our own.\"\n\nCHAP.

In the Pine also, they have an oval shape, but have no rising border; and are arranged in lines from one end of the leaf to the other. (Anat. of Plants, p. 153.) Hedwig considered the borders mentioned by Grew, as produced by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol18.html#article-RING\">ring</a> of one or more vessels which terminated in the pore. The number of pores he represents as exceedingly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a>. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> of a line of the cuticle of a bulbous lily, he reckoned 577 pores.\n\n151. The characters and position of these pores by Decandolle have been farther examined by M. Decandolle, on more than 600 plants. They occur most frequently on the leaves, occupying both surfaces in herbs, and in trees chiefly the inferior surface. Stems, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a>, have no pores, except, as in the Gramineae, where they are succulent, and have the character of leaves, or where the plant is altogether destitute of leaves, as the Cactus. On the prominent lines of the leaves and stems, no pores are to be seen, but only in the grooves or depressed surfaces. They are never observed on the root, not even on bulbous roots, where the scales of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BULB\">bulb</a> are true leaves. The small leaflets called stipule and bract\u00e6, sometimes have, and sometimes have not, pores. The calices of the flower, in general, have pores, but the petals have not. Pericarps exhibit great variety in regard to pores; fleshy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> are generally destitute of them. The envelopes of the seed are destitute of pores, but they are found on all seminal leaves that rise above the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>. The lower tribes of vegetables, as the fuci, musci, hepatic\u00e6, fung\u00e6, &c., are destitute of pores.\n\n152. The occurrence of pores in those plants where they are found, seems to be much influenced by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> circumstances. They are never met with but on vegetables, and those parts of vegetables that are exposed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>; and, therefore, the internal surfaces of many leaves that embrace the stem are without pores, though, on the external surfaces of the same leaves, they are abundant. No plant that is completely aquatic, nor any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of it that is habitually under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, is provided with these organs, but the parts which rise above the water, are furnished with them. In Ranunculus aquatilis, the leaves that are constantly under water, are destitute of pores, while those that float on the surface are provided with them, but only on their superior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a>. Even leaves, which do not naturally possess pores when under water, acquire them if they are made to grow in air; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> plants, on the contrary, when made to grow under water, may, by such treatment, be deprived of their pores. Thus, the leaf of green mint, when growing in air, possesses not fewer than 1800 pores on its lower surface; but if kept for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> under water, its leaves <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a>, and the new ones that succeed are destitute of pores.\n153. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">Light</a> seems to be necessary also to the production of pores, for etiolated plants do not possess them. When grown by the light of lamps, the leaves possess a few pores; and in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, the parts secluded from light and air are destitute of these organs, but acquire them if they are duly exposed. These pores, M. Decandolle, as we had before occasion to remark, considers to perform alternately the functions both of transpiration and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSORPTION\">absorption</a>. (M\u00e9m. de l'Instit. Nat. Tom. I. p. 351.)\n\n154. This general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of the pores of plants is confirmed by the researches of M. Rudolph. In most herbaceous plants, he found the pores to occupy both sides of the leaf, but in trees, only the inferior surface. They were not often met with on the parts of the flowers, or on fruits; they were never seen on roots, nor on the trunks of trees; nor ever on aquatic plants, except on such parts as were raised above the water. The lower tribes of vegetables seemed to be universally destitute of them; the leaves also of those plants that were covered thickly with hairs on both sides had no pores. The form of the pores was commonly oval or elliptical, but in a few instances square or rhomboidal. In size they very much varied in different plants, but in the same plant the size was uniform. The largest pores were seen on the leaf of the white lily; the smallest on that of the French bean. (Kieser's M\u00e9m. sur l'Organisation des Plantes, p. 144.)\n\n155. From these accounts of the occurrence of pores, and of the conditions necessary to their production, they cannot be considered as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a>, or indeed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIMARY\">primary</a> character of the cuticle; but as owing their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> to the more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of the vegetable powers. Hence the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> that they are caused by innumerable vascular productions from the larger fasciculi of vessels, which gradually penetrate the cuticle, and thus open a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> for the discharge of their fluids, as the researches of De Saussure and Kieser seem to prove. That the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCLUSION\">exclusion</a> of air and light should prevent the formation of pores in the cuticle, is nothing more than we see daily on a larger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a>, with regard to branches themselves; for trees that grow very much crowded together, seldom produce branches from their sides; and if herbaceous plants be made to grow entirely secluded from light, they run altogether into stalk, and produce no buds or leaves from their sides.\n\nArticle III.\n\nOf Hairs.\n\n156. From the surface of the cuticle, in many parts of herbaceous plants, and in the succulent parts of arborescent ones, hairs (pili) are seen to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>. They possess very different forms, and vary likewise greatly in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEXTURE\">texture</a>. In a strict <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, they may be defined small filaments possessing considerable stiffness, which project from the surface, and stand out pretty erect. When they are very numerous, a little soft, and less erect, they take the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of villi; when still softer and less numerous, they are termed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> (pubes). Sometimes this down is composed of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> hairs nearly resembling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a>; at other times it approaches more to the character of cotton. When the hairs are stiff and ranged along the edge of a surface, like the lashes of the eye, they are named cilia; and if, with these characters, they are produced to a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>, as in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEARD\">beard</a> or awn of wheat, they acquire the name of barba or arista. Sometimes they resemble the bristles of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HOG\">hog</a>, and are then called setae. Many other varieties are enumerated by botanists, who farther distinguish them by various names, according as they terminate in a single point, or are hooked, or forked, or branched, or feathered, &c. In some instances, instead of appearing like one continuous substance, they are composed of many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a>, or are said to be articulated. In figures 16 and 17, Plate XVIII., we have copied from Du Hamel a few of the varieties, both of single and jointed hairs; but the forms they exhibit are so numerous and diversified, that we must refer to the writers on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTANY\">botany</a> for minuter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a>. In some examples, the point of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> is terminated by a small rounded globule, and sometimes by a fine filament that seems to proceed out of the hair.\n\n157. According to M. Decandolle, these several varieties of hairs appear generally on those parts of the stem and leaves that are destitute of pores; that is, on the prominent lines formed by the fasciculi of vessels, and which have been absurdly called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NERVES\">nerves</a> of the leaves. They appear also on the edges of leaves, whose pores are never seen, so that, in position, the hairs and pores always differ. (M\u00e9m. de l'Institut. Nat. Tom. I.) On the petals of flowers, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as on leaves, various <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CAPILLARY\">capillary</a> productions also occur, which frequently contribute much to their richness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>.\n\n158. With regard to the structure of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> bodies, little that is satisfactory can be said. They seem to originate either directly from the cuticle, or from the cortical texture beneath it; but not often from the ligneous texture, except in those instances where they are very long and rigid, as in the awns of wheat. Du Hamel observes, that almost all of them are implanted on small bodies, similar to the bulbs which give origin to the hairs of animals, (Phys. des Arbres, Tom. I. p. 183.) They commonly resemble simple filaments, but often appear like elongated cells threaded on one another, and, instead of terminating in a sharp point, end in a small papilla or utricle, which yields, in many instances, a viscid or oily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, or sometimes a coloured liquor, which has led many to regard them as exercising a glandular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a>. One <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of these supposed glandular organs has been more particularly studied, and their fluid analysed by M. Deyeux, who gives the following account of it.\n\n159. Soon after the seeds of the chick-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol17.html#article-PEA\">pea</a> (Cicer arietinum) are sown, its first leaves are seen to be covered with hairs, at the extremity of each of which is a transparent globule, about the size of a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PIN\">pin</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, consisting of a fluid matter. It abounds most in mid-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, when the air is warm and dry, and is scarcely perceptible at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>, or when the air is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> and moist; after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a>, indeed, it does not again appear for two or three days. When these fluid globules were removed, in a dry day, by blotting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, they soon again reappeared; they were acid to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>,\nreddened <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LITMUS\">litmus</a> paper, and caused an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EFFERVESCENCE\">effervescence</a> in carbonate of potass, when brought in contact with it. He regarded them as composed of oxalic acid, the properties of which they precisely resembled. (M\u00e9m. de l'Instit. Nat. Tom. I. p. 157.)\n\n160. These acid globules, and perhaps the other viscid, and oleaginous, or resinous substances furnished by hairs, are not, properly speaking, glandular secretions; but cellular fluids, which, after their separation from the fluids of the leaf, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> certain changes from the agency of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> and light, during their passage through these delicate organs. There does not, therefore, seem any good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> for considering such bodies as glands. Many have considered these hairs, as the organs by which transpiration is carried on, and others, as those by which dews and fluids are absorbed\u2014offices for which their structure seems but little fitted; and the transpiring and absorbing powers of leaves, are in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to the number of their pores, and not of their hairs. In many instances, they are obviously designed for protection against cold and moisture; but this is not the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> to consider their uses, farther than is necessary to assist in establishing their anatomical character.\n\nArticle IV.\n\nOf Prickles.\n\n161. It is not easy to discriminate between some of the harder species of hairs, described in the former article, and those to which the appellation of prickles (aculei) has been assigned. They are defined by Du Hamel to be excrescences, often hard, and always terminated by a sharp point, which are developed with the other productions of plants, but are not enclosed in particular buds; so that they may, for the most part, be regarded as hard and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> hairs.\n\n162. They spring equally from the stem, the branches, the petioles of the leaves, and also from the leaves themselves in various plants; and in the Chestnut and some others, they are seen to cover the fruit. They are frequently straight, but in the Rose and many others are curved at the point, as in fig. 18. Plate XVIII.; and, according to Malpighi, possess sometimes in this plant a little head, which yields a viscid fluid.\n\n163. Regarding their structure, Grew remarked, that they were connected only with the skin or the bark, and he therefore named them cortical, to distinguish them from thorns, properly so called, such as those of the Hawthorn, which spring from the wood, and which he denominates ligneous. These latter, he adds, always ascend, while the cortical thorns commonly point downwards. (Anat. of Plants, p. 33.) In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of their origin from the bark, Du Hamel remarks, that, if, after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MACERATION\">maceration</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> water, the bark of such plants be stripped off, all the prickles come away with it, and leave not the smallest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> on the wood, nor even on the more interior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAYERS\">layers</a> of the bark itself. When a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> also is made of the branch and prickle, as in fig. 18. Plate XVIII. the wood y and the pith z are both seen to have no connection with the prickle, but the inner layer of the bark x is interposed between the base of the prickle and the wood. The prickle does not, however, spring from the skin, for it is formed of many layers like the bark. As the parts become more solid, it is less freely supplied with juice, and therefore hardens and turns <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a>. (Phys. des Arbres, Tom. I. p. 188.)\n\n164. In the Nettle (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-URTICA\">Urtica</a> dioica), Malpighi prickle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, that, beside the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> prickles on the leaves, the Nettle, there are among them others of a different description. They possess more of a ligneous character, are hollow internally, and contain a juice, which, when it gains admission beneath the skin, excites itching and tumour. (Anat. Plantar. p. 137.) Dr Hooke had previously given a much more minute account of the sting of this plant. Almost every part of it, says he, is covered with prickles, like sharp <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol16.html#article-NEEDLES\">needles</a>. Each prickle consists of two parts, very different in shape and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> from one another; one is shaped much like a round <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BODKIN\">bodkin</a>, is very hard and stiff, exceedingly transparent and clear, and hollow from top to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a>. When this bodkin is thrust into the skin, it does not at all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BEND\">bend</a>; but a certain liquor is then seen to move up and down in it, rising towards the top, when the point is pressed down on the base. This base is formed by a little bag, is more pliable than the bodkin part, and within it is a cellular structure which contains a thin transparent liquor; see fig. 19. Plate XVIII.; it is this liquor that rises in the tube, and, being deposited beneath the skin after it is punctured, excites the irritation that succeeds. (Micrographia, p. 142.)\n\nFrom the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> in structure between thorns, properly so called, and branches, we shall defer their consideration until we come to treat of the structure of the branch.\n\nSection V.\n\nOf the Glands of Vegetables.\n\n165. Perhaps, in the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> of Anatomy, there is no word that has been employed with such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LATITUDE\">latitude</a> of signification, and is, therefore, exposed to so much ambiguity, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> gland. In animal anatomy it was doubtless used at first to denominate certain organs from the external resemblance which they bore to certain fruits or seeds; and in that sense it is still employed on several occasions. Afterwards, it was understood to signify not so much the external form as the internal organization, and was considered to express a certain structure, by which alone the function of secretion could be exercised; but it is well observed by Dr Thomson, in his valuable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> on Inflammation, that \"the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> of a secreting glandular part must be taken from its function, and not from its structure; for nothing can be more various than the internal structure of those organs that are denominated glandular secreting organs; they consist sometimes of convoluted vessels, sometimes of follicles or small hollow bags, and sometimes of transparent membranes, in which neither convoluted vessels, nor mucous follicles, can be perceived.\" (Lectures on Inflammation, p. 318.) Besides these more simple structures, it is well known that most of the internal viscera are likewise denominated glands, though differing, in all their characters, from those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> mentioned.\n166. The ambiguity which thus prevails in animal anatomy, in relation to the use of the term gland, has been increased tenfold in the applications that have been made of it to the organs of vegetables. It is justly observed by M. Decandolle, in reference to this subject, that the numerous approximations in structure between vegetables and animals have often promoted our researches into the former, but have sometimes led physiologists astray, and introduced into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of botany many inexact expressions. In animal anatomy, the term gland is understood to express some organ that exercises a secretory function; but, in vegetable anatomy, this term has often been applied to bodies that are not known to be real secretory organs. Thus, the cells of the cellular tissue, which frequently contain resinous or oily matter, have been sometimes named cellular glands; the little globules or utricles at the extremities of the hairs on the edges of leaves, utricular glands; the small organs formed by the pores on the leaf, cortical or milky glands; certain fleshy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TUBERCLES\">tubercles</a> on the leaves, urceolar glands; and the little scales that cover the fructification in ferns, scalyform glands. The nectarium of the flower commonly contains a sweet juice, and is, therefore, deemed a gland; but Linnaeus, with his usual disregard both of the structure and function of organs, considers as a nectary, not only the body which may secrete, but any other that may serve as a receptacle of the secretion; and, indeed, is said to comprehend under this term all those bodies which have no resemblance to the other parts of the flower, in whatever variety of form they may appear, or whatever purpose they may serve. (Willdenow's Prin. of Botany, p. 87.) In some other instances, the term gland has been used not to express the secreting organ itself, nor even the receptacle of the secretion, but the solid excreted matter on the surface of certain leaves; and others consider hairs, and every other protuberance that projects from the surface, and contains a fluid different from the common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAP\">sap</a>, as entitled to the distinctive appellation of gland.\n\n167. Amid such diversity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> concerning the structure, position, and function of these minute organs, and such vagueness in the methods employed to characterize them, it is extremely difficult to define their true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, or declare the principle on which this definition should proceed. The mere existence of a fluid, distinct from the common sap in any organ, cannot be considered as bestowing on it the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of gland, otherwise the greater portion of some plants would come to be regarded as glandular; those varieties of structure, which exercise no secretory function, may also be excluded from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of glands; and so likewise the hairs of plants, though containing peculiar fluids, may be excluded, since these peculiarities appear to arise frequently from circumstances foreign to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the organ itself; and even if they do not, some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIFIC\">specific</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> of the general name they bear is preferable to the employment of so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMBIGUOUS\">ambiguous</a> a word as gland. But where any organ is distinct from the common textures of the vegetable, and, by the peculiarity of its structure, is fitted to produce those changes on the vegetable fluids which we name secretion, it may be deemed a secreting organ. This secretory function, however, may sometimes be exercised, as in animal bodies, by membranous surfaces, and sometimes by small isolated bodies, to which, perhaps, may properly belong the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DENOMINATION\">denomination</a> of glands.\n\n168. But, even though this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of defining glands were adopted, it still is a matter of no small difficulty to distinguish their species by appropriate appellations. In animal anatomy, no settled rule obtains; but the name of the gland is assigned from some accidental circumstance of situation, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, use, &c. In vegetable anatomy, the botanist, regarding glands only as aiding the discrimination of species, refers commonly to their situation, and speaks of foliaceous, stipular, or petiolar glands, according as they happen to be seated on the leaves, the stipule, or the petioles. The anatomist imposes names according to their forms, as they chance most to resemble a globule, an utricle, or some other figure; and the physiologist is chiefly directed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> which indicate their functions, distinguishing them into mucous, oily, resinous, or nectariferous glands, according to the nature of the fluid they furnish. Of these different modes, that which proceeds on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> form, where it can be discovered, seems the most precise; but as this cannot always be accomplished, the situation of the organ, or the nature of the secreted fluid, must occasionally be had recourse to.\n\n169. Of these bodies, it is to be remarked that they differ in one respect from most of the corresponding organs in animals, almost all of them being seated on the external parts of the plant, like several of the more simple glandular bodies in animals. This arises from the greater simplicity of vegetable organization, particularly as it regards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSORBENT\">absorbent</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of growth, and the permanence of the organs produced; whence it happens that the living parts of aged perennial plants are situated only at, or near the surface; and it is only in such parts that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> secretory functions can have place. Hence it is on succulent stems, on leaves, flowers, and fruits, during the active state of vegetation, that the glandular functions of vegetables must be exercised, and which parts, therefore, are the appropriate seat of glands.\n\n170. In some leaves a secretory function extends over a great part of the surface, as in some species of Cistus, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SUGAR\">Sugar</a>-maple, of Larch, and others, enumerated by Du Hamel, on which various collections of saccharine, gummy, and resinous matter are found. (Phys. des Arbres, Tom. I. p. 183.) On the leaves of Sage, Hooke mentions the occurrence of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFINITE\">infinite</a> number of round balls resembling pearls, and which, says he, are nothing but a gummy exudation. (Micrographia, p. 142.) M. Guettard has described by Gastonier fewer than seven species of glandular bodies on the leaves of different plants, to which he assigned names, chiefly from the appearance of their form; these are the milky, the vesicular, the squamous, the globular, the lenticular, the utricular, and the urceolar glands. Of these reputed species, those called milky are no longer held to be glands, but cuticular pores; and the squamous species is found\nto be identical with the thin scale that covers the fructification of ferns. Others add to this list the organ called nectary; but the very vague notions entertained of its nature and use altogether preclude the possibility of assigning to it any precise anatomical character.\n\n171. Other writers have proposed to reduce all the bodies called glands to two classes, the cellular and the vascular, according as they conceive them to be formed of cellular tissue simply, or of this tissue and vessels combined. But such an arrangement would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> us, in some instances, to confound the mere receptacles of secreted fluids with the organs that secrete them; would bestow a secretory function on organs, considered by these writers to be non-vascular; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> the entire cellular tissue of the plant into a simple glandular body. The glands of plants may indeed possess the form and size of cells; but they are not, like cells, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> cavities; they resemble more the follicles and mucous glands of the animal system, and, from the nature of their function, must always be regarded as vascular.\n\nOf organs so minute, and so very imperfectly known and characterized, nothing can be attempted in the way of anatomical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a>. This, however, is the less to be regretted, as the glandular system in plants appears, in general, to be of much less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> in the vegetable, than it is in the animal economy.","sp":569,"ep":573},{"h":"ARTICLE II","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">Description</a> and Structure of the Coats of Seeds.\n\n183.

The common fathers of Vegetable Anatomy, Grew and Malpighi, who, at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, but in different countries, prosecuted their inquiries, for many years, without any knowledge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> with each other, are nearly of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> all the more important <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> in relation to these vessels.

Malpighi describes spiral vessels as existing in Opinion of the ligneous parts of all plants. He called them Malpighi; spiral tubes, because, when extended, they were resolved, not into separate rings, but into a single zone, which might be drawn out to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a>, they form continuous tubes, but are sometimes contracted at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> distances, so as to resemble somewhat a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a> cells. One of these contracted spiral vessels is represented in fig. 14, Plate XV. at the extremity of which, the spiral filament is in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> drawn out, and similar appearances of the spiral structure are exhibited in figures 9 and 10. by Mirbel. In herbs, according to Malpighi, these spiral vessels constantly accompany the common sap-vessels, and are ensheathed by them; in shrubs, they occur in every part of the wood, single or in clusters; and in trees, an intermixture of spiral vessels with the common sap-vessels, is observed in every part of the wood. In the Fir, they are found immediately beneath the bark, and are so numerous as to constitute the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> bulk of the wood. They exist with the sap-vessels in the petioles and ribs of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a>, and likewise in the petals of the flower. In\nElementary the roots, they are also met with, and in some roots Organs are so abundant, as to exceed in bulk all the other parts. They exist, he adds, in every part of the plant except the bark; and are annually formed with the albuminous vessels of trees. (Anatom. Plantar. passim.)\n\n20. From the writings of Grew we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLECT\">collect</a> also, that spiral vessels exist in every part of a plant, except the bark. In the root they are numerous, of very various size, and their bore is generally larger than that of the common sap-vessels. In the trunks, both of herbs and trees, they are equally visible; and in position, size, and number, subject to great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a>. Sometimes they are collected into fasciculi; at other times they are disposed in rays; and in other instances they are arranged in a circular form: They stand sometimes next to the pith, in other instances next to the bark; and in other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> again, they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> with the common sap-vessels in every part of the wood. They have a more ample bore than the common vessels, and vary in size to at least twenty different degrees. In the leaf, they always accompany the sap-vessels; and both in its petiole and ribs, are constantly surrounded or ensheathed by them. They have a similar position in the petals of the flower, and in the vascular parts of the fruit. (Anatomy of Plants, passim.) Hence, then, it appears, from the dissections of Malpighi and Grew, that, in every plant in which vessels are to be seen, and almost in every part of it, spiral vessels abound; they exist, however, only in the ligneous portion, or that part in which the sap ascends, and are never to be found in the bark.\n\n21. By Du Hamel, the spiral vessels, supposed to convey <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, are described as existing in the leaves and the flowers, the petals of which are almost wholly composed of them. In the herbaceous portion of young branches, they are also <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> seen; which portion afterwards becomes ligneous; so that it cannot be doubted that they exist in the wood, though he could never discover them but in young branches. (Phys. des Arbres, Tom. I. p. 42.) If, however, all the empty vessels, seen in a transverse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> of the wood, be deemed air-vessels, and all air-vessels have a spiral structure, then, says this author, they would, in many plants, form a great part of the ligneous body. From these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> vessels, however, he has seen, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUTUMN\">autumn</a>, fluids to escape; so that they are not properly air-vessels, or, as Grew observed, they sometimes carry sap. They are not to be found in the bark.\n\n22. Under the common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of sap-vessels, Hill delineates all the varieties of vessels that constitute the wood; they are largest in the outer circles, smaller in the others; they contain, says he, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> and at midsummer, a limpid liquor; but at all other seasons they appear empty, and have therefore been erroneously deemed air-vessels. He says nothing of their spiral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a>; but describes the vessels, which form the chief <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of the wood, as possessing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> and firm coats, forming an arrangement of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> and simple tubes; as in fig. 6. Plate XV.; resembling those of the albumen, except that they have no mouths in their sides. (On the Construction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">Timber</a>, p. 8 & 19.) But though, with Du Hamel, he was unable to trace their spiral structure in the wood, yet there can be no doubt of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> in that part; which, as we shall afterwards show, has been recently demonstrated by Kieser.\n\n23. M. Reichel maintains their existence in all parts of the plant. By causing plants to vegetate in coloured fluids, he traced them from the roots, through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a> and branches, to the extremity of the leaves, and into all parts of the flower,\u2014as the calyx, the petals, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a>, the stamens, and the anthers. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> and in seeds, and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RADICLE\">radicle</a> and plume of the latter, they were equally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a>. The coloured liquors, as they rose, communicated a tinge to the cellular tissue of the wood, as was previously observed by De la Baisse; but no trace of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> was ever observed either in the bark or pith, which therefore contains no spiral vessels. He considered the spiral vessels as the organs everywhere conveying nutrient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> to the plant, and as having no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> to the appellation of air-vessels. (Encyclop. M\u00e9thodique, Article Physiol. V\u00e9g\u00e9t. p. 288.) Similar experiments of Hedwig and others, confirm these facts as to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a> of the spiral vessels, and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> to every part the fluids absorbed by the roots. In his late <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, M. Kieser, as we shall afterwards see, in describing the vascular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of the ligneous parts of plants, regards it as composed entirely of spiral vessels, and asserts their existence in every part of the plant except the bark and pith.\n\n24. Against these combined authorities M. Mirbel opposes his fanciful views. We have already enumerated the five different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of vessels which he regards as constituting the woody part of plants. According to him, true spiral vessels (which he continues to denominate tracheae) are not to be found in the root, but only in the trunk and the parts which are produced from it. Even in the trunk, they are to be found only around the pith, and never in the exterior ligneous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAYERS\">layers</a>. He admits that they exist in all soft and succulent parts, and that coloured fluids rise in them as well as in the other varieties of vessels; but they never are to be found either in the bark or pith. (Exposition de la Th\u00e9orie de l'Organisation V\u00e9g\u00e9tale, p. 74, 78.) It appears, therefore, that the vessels which are thus erroneously called tracheae, are destined to carry fluids; and as to the parts in which they do or do not occur, the opinion of M. Mirbel weighs as nothing with us, in opposition to the facts observed by so many preceding and subsequent writers.\n\n25. From the combined observations, therefore, of all the preceding writers, with the exception of M. Mirbel, we collect that the vessels heretofore called air-vessels and tracheae, and which possess a spiral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONFORMATION\">conformation</a>, exist together with those called common sap-vessels, in every part and organ of the plant, except the bark. It appears also, that, though they are often found empty, yet their true office is to carry sap. This may be concluded not only from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> occurrence of sap in them early in spring and again in autumn, and from the entrance of coloured fluids at all seasons; but from the circumstance that, in some parts, no other vessels appear to exist by\nElementary which the rising sap can be conveyed. Are we, therefore, with many, to consider them, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of their formation, as a species distinct from the common sap-vessels, or are both to be held merely as varieties of one common kind?\n\n26. It is allowed, on all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, that spiral vessels are most readily visible, and are most numerous in the tender and succulent parts of vegetables, in which they form almost the entire bulk of the vascular portion. In the albuminous part of trees, which is added annually to the pre-existing wood, they are not so readily seen. Even in trees, however, while still succulent, the first circle of vessels formed, contains spiral vessels; as Du Hamel observes, and even Mirbel admits; but, at a later period of vegetable growth, the whole of the vessels, formed annually in trees, are represented by Grew as common vessels, which, he adds, \"begin to be formed in spring; but the spiral vessels not till the latter end of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, or thereabouts, at least not till about that time do they appear.\" (Anatomy of Plants, p. 131.) Malpighi also describes these spiral vessels as gradually appearing in the albumen, and continually augmenting in size in every successive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol18.html#article-RING\">ring</a> of wood. A similar remark, as to increase of size, is made by Grew: \"the spiral vessels,\" says he, \"being amplified in each annual ring, at least for a certain number of years, so as to form a vessel of a wider bore:\" (Anatomy of Plants, p. 139.) and accordingly, in all the plates of both these writers, and in those of other authors, the spiral vessels are always represented of different sizes in every part of the wood.\n\n27. From the foregoing facts, it would seem, that, in the young and succulent parts of plants, the spiral construction of the vessels is almost, if not actually, coeval with their existence; but that, in more rigid textures, they are not so early formed, or at least are not discoverable in parts in which they are subsequently seen. Hence, therefore, we must suppose a sort of transformation to occur with respect to these vessels, or, to use the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of Grew, that they \"are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POST\">post</a>-nate, and seem produced by some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, position, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEXTURE\">texture</a> of their fibres.\" If, indeed, spiral vessels exist in every part of the wood, but are not for some time visible in the albumen, and if the albumen be, as it most certainly is, the substance by which the ligneous layers are successively formed, then it follows, that the occurrence of spirals in the wood must be the result of some change induced on the vessels that at first constituted the albumen. Hedwig, indeed, considered all the albuminous vessels to possess from the first a spiral conformation, and that they gradually acquired the characters they possess in the wood. We shall presently see that the researches of Kieser support the same view, and thus go to establish the doctrine of transformation, first announced by Grew. Mirbel, however, protests against the transformation of one variety of vessel into another, and maintains that each of the five species, which he enumerates, retains, without change, its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> character and form. He nevertheless describes his fourth species, or what he calls mixed tubes, (fig. 10.) as composed of the three preceding species; and \"such,\" he adds, \"is the simplicity of vegetable organization, that frequently one and the same tube exhibits (as in fig. 12.) all the several species combined.\" (Expos. de la Th\u00e9orie, &c. p. 78, 80.) That the same vessel, from the operation of local causes, should sometimes exhibit, in different parts, a variety of appearance and form, is perfectly consistent with the principle of change and transformation which has been supposed to have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>; but that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> should from the first combine in one vessel, unsusceptible of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> change, five different species of forms, is not quite so credible; and to ordinary minds would certainly afford no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the \"simplicity\" of her operations.\n\n28. If then we adopt the opinion, that in young and succulent parts the vessels which carry sap have a variety of Sap-Vessels from the first a spiral construction; and if, as seems to be proved by the dissections of Grew, of Hedwig, and of Kieser, no other vessels, destined to such an office are, frequently, to be found, then we must conclude that, in such parts, only one species of sap-vessels exists, to which, from the first, the spiral construction belongs. If, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, it appear that, in the more rigid texture of the albumen of trees, no spiral vessels are at first to be found, but that they afterwards become visible in the wood, then it follows, from what has been already stated, that the spiral vessels of the wood are produced from the common sap-vessels of the albumen, and are consequently to be regarded, not as an original species, but only as a variety of one common kind. That such probably is the fact, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> farther appear from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> afterwards to be given of the structure of these vessels, and of the actual transformations which they seem to undergo. Even those who may still be of opinion, that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> form warrants a nominal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> of species, must, we think, admit that, in office, no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> for such distinction exists; but that all the vessels in the ligneous parts of plants are destined to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> one and the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a>. In relation to the economy of vegetables, this is a fact of far greater importance than any opinions that may be formed regarding the varieties of appearance or structure in the vessels themselves.\n\nArticle IV.\n\nOf the Structure of the Sap and Spiral Vessels.\n\n29. We have next to offer a few remarks on the structure of the vessels we have been engaged in describing. On this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, we shall not go much into detail. When we have seen such difficulties attending the correct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> of them in their entire forms, it may fairly be presumed that still greater perplexity must accompany the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> of their constituent parts. What, therefore, we have to advance, may be regarded rather as matter of opinion than of fact; and, in the present state of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>, this point must be deemed more a subject of curiosity than of use.\n\n30. According to Malpighi, the common sap-ves- sels of the wood, when viewed longitudinally, appear to be formed of a series of small vesicles or cells mutually opening into each other. These cells possess different forms, but in some vessels there seems to be no trace of such a cellular structure. In the\nElementary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OAK\">Oak</a>, the cells are represented to possess a roundish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, and in the Vine they possess an oblong form; as in Plate XV. fig. 13. (Anat. Plantar. Idea, p.2\u201424.) In these, and similar instances, Malpighi seems either to have mistaken a series of elongated cells for vessels, or to have conceived that the contractions, occasionally formed in the vessels of certain plants, afforded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> of their being constructed originally from cells. It is certain that, in the vessels of most parts of plants, no such cellular construction is apparent.\n\n31. Grew, on the other hand, considered the common sap-vessels to be composed of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRAIT\">strait</a> fibres, or rather smaller vessels, placed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to each other, and set round so as to form a cylindrical tube. (Anatomy of Plants, p.112.) In the opinion of Leuwenhoeck, the vessels are composed of two fine transparent coats, formed of other vessels exceedingly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a>, which are disposed partly in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONGITUDINAL\">longitudinal</a>, and partly in a circular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>. (Select Works, by Hoole, Vol. I. p. 11.) Du Hamel attempted to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> a knowledge of their structure, by submitting them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MACERATION\">maceration</a>. By this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a>, he separated the ligneous layers into leaflets thinner than the finest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, and the fasciculi of fibres or vessels that composed these layers, were farther separated into minuter filaments, placed parallel to one another, like the threads in a skein; and these filaments again seemed capable of almost indefinite subdivision. (Phys. des Arbres, Tom. I. p. 31.) Hill considered the vessels of the albumen to be formed of the same matter as the cells. He describes them as at first very delicate, and to collapse when emptied of their fluids. Sometimes the coat of which they were formed resembled a thin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARCHMENT\">parchment</a>, in which traces of lines surrounding one another were visible, so that the coat seemed as if composed of several membranes that were vascular. In one instance, where a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> was made to penetrate the vessel, it appeared as if composed of numerous cells; but, on farther <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>, these seeming divisions altered their places, and were found to proceed from small portions of watery sap still retained in the vessel. This appearance, as he properly observes, may be a very necessary lesson against hasty judgments. (Construction of Timber, p. 33.)\n\n32. M. Mirbel's opinion concerning the formation of vessels may next be shortly noticed. He sets out with asserting, that \"the entire mass of the plant is nothing but cellular tissue, the cells of which differ only in form and dimensions.\" This he declares to be the basis of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a>; and he may perhaps be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> in thinking, that \"no one, before himself, had formed a similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> of vegetable organization.\" The cells and vessels of this tissue are farther considered to be produced out of one and the same membranous tissue. In forming cells, this membrane is supposed to dilate in every direction; in producing vessels, it increases only in length. (Expos\u00e9 de la Th\u00e9orie de l'Organisation V\u00e9g., p.9\u2014103.) Of the structure of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIMITIVE\">primitive</a> membrane itself, he professes to give no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a>; and his account of the manner in which the vessels are produced out of it, is so entirely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a>, so clumsily conceived, and so incapable of execution, that we deem it altogether unworthy of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of any one accustomed to contemplate the structure and formation of organized textures.\n\n33. Concerning the structure of the spiral vessels, opinions have varied still more than in relation to those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> considered. Malpighi describes them as composed of a thin zone, formed of a pellucid silvery plate, somewhat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, which, being placed spirally, and united at its edges, constructs a tube, interiorly and exteriorly, somewhat rough. When this tube is drawn out, it does not separate into distinct rings, but is resolved into a continuous spiral zone. At particular places, these vessels are sometimes contracted, so as to exhibit the appearance of oblong cells opening into each other, as in fig. 14 Pl. XV. In size they greatly surpass the ordinary sap-vessels; and their canal is then frequently occupied by membranous vesicles, which nearly fill their cavity. (Anat. Plantar. p. 3\u201426.) These vesicles were also observed by Leuwenhoeck, and their appearance, both in the transverse and longitudinal section of an enlarged vessel, are represented in fig. 15.\n\n34. According to Grew, the thin plate that forms the spiral vessel, is not always of the same breadth, and, instead of being flat, it has sometimes the form of a round thread. When minutely examined, the spiral zone, he adds, is never one single piece, but consists of two or more round filaments placed collaterally, but perfectly distinct. These component filaments he regards as united by other smaller transverse filaments, and the thin plates which they form by their connection, constitute the spiral vessel; \"as if we should imagine,\" he adds, \"a piece of fine narrow ribbon to be wound spirally, and edge to edge, round a stick, and the stick being drawn out, the ribbon to be left in the figure of a tube, answerable to a spiral vessel.\" As, however, the ribbon is composed of numerous threads, placed parallel to each other, so is the plate that forms the spiral vessel; and it is according to the greater or less delicacy of the vessel examined, and the manner of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISSECTION\">dissection</a>, that it appears to be constituted either of a flat plate, or a round filament. The spiration of the filaments he considered to be made in the root, from right to left, and in the trunk, from left to right. (Anat. of Plants, p. 73, and 117.)\n\n35. The opinion of Du Hamel, with respect to the construction of these vessels, was very similar to that of Grew, and he employed the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> of a ribbon twisted round a stick, to illustrate it. Hedwig gave a very different account of them. He of Hedwig considered the spiral vessel to be composed of two distinct parts; one a membranous canal conveying air, and the other a spiral tube rolled round it, by which the fluids were conveyed. The spires of the tube, in some instances, are represented as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a>; in others, they are separated, and the intervening portions of the membranous canal exhibit a dotted appearance. He considered all the sap-vessels, from their first formation, to possess this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> structure, and, by a series of changes, which he professes to describe, to be ultimately transformed into the solid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIBRE\">fibre</a> of the wood. (De Fibrae Vegetab. Ortu; p. 25.) Others, also, have believed the spiral vessel to be formed of a membranous tube, but have denied that it","sp":541,"ep":544},{"h":"ARTICLE VI","t":"Of the Proper Vessels.\n\n51. By <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> flow of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAP\">sap</a>, combined with the results of experiments made with coloured liquors, we have endeavoured to determine the situation and kinds of vessels by which it is conveyed. The same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> best assist us in ascertaining the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of those which have been called Proper Vessels. Of these also, many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> have been described by authors, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> and characters of which we shall afterwards attempt to ascertain.\n\n52. It was before stated, that, early in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>, the sap of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> rises through the wood alone, and that no fluid whatever is then to be found in the bark. At a later <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, however, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> is completely reversed; for the vessels of the wood no longer appear to carry sap, and those of the bark then become abundantly supplied with it. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> is very clearly and concisely stated by Grew. \"The sap,\" says he, \"in many plants, as the Vine, ascends visibly through the wood for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a>, and rises through every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol18.html#article-RING\">ring</a> of wood to the very centre, yet, at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, there arises no sap at all out of the bark, nor between it and the wood.\" \"But late in spring,\" he continues, \"and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, the sap is no longer visible in the wood, but is abundant in the bark, in the inner margin adjacent to the wood.\" Du Hamel too remarks, that when the lymph rises abundantly through the wood in spring, the bark is dry, and adheres to the wood, and no sap then issues from it, nor from between it and the wood; but, later in the season, he adds, the bark yields abundance of sap. These statements have been verified by the multiplied observations of various subsequent authors.\n\n53. But why is the sap thus present only in the wood at its first rising in spring? Why at a later period does it cease to be visible in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a>? And how and why does it afterwards find a passage into the bark? Some observations of Du Hamel, Hales, and Walker, point, we think, to the true cause. In spring, says Du Hamel, when the sap rises vigorously, the buds have not appeared; when they begin to open, the sap then flows less freely; and when the leaves are fully developed, then the flow of sap entirely ceases. Dr Hales also remarks, that, towards the end of April, when the young shoots come forth, and the surface of the Vine is greatly increased by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPANSION\">expansion</a> of the leaves, the sap then ceases to flow in a visible manner till the return of the next spring. All bleeding trees, he adds, cease to bleed, as soon as the young leaves begin to expand enough to perspire plentifully, and draw off the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUNDANT\">redundant</a> sap. The bark of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OAK\">Oak</a>, too, separates easily when lubricated with sap; but before the leaves appear and perspire, the bark will no longer run (as they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> it), but adheres most firmly to the wood. (Vegetable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATICS\">Statics</a>, 3d edit., p. 126.) In like manner, in an experiment of Dr Walker, a Birch-tree bled from every perforation in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a>, and from every cut extremity of its branches, until vernation <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> budding began; then the bleeding was almost immediately checked, and when the young leaves had pushed beyond the hybernaculum, the bleeding entirely ceased. (Edin. Phil. Trans. Vol. I. p. 31.)\n\nIt is however certain, that though the sap was no longer visible in the wood after the leaves were developed, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> nevertheless to rise through it; for in no other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> could the leaves obtain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> portion of fluid which it is known that they constantly discharge by transpiration; and coloured fluids manifest their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a> in the vessels of the wood, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> after as before the development of those organs. The leaves, therefore, must be regarded as the organs which, by their perspiration, draw off, as Dr Hales observes, the redundant sap; and hence in an experiment, where a notch was cut two or three feet above the lower end of a stem, though a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of sap passed by the notch, yet was it perfectly dry; because, says he, \"the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> of the perspiring leaves was greater than the force of suction from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>.\" (Veg. Statics, p. 111.)\n\n54. Not only, however, does the development of the leaves render the sap no longer visible in the wood; but they also appear to be the organs by or through the bark which it finds its way to the bark. In all the experiments <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> recited, the bark continued dry until the sap disappeared from the wood; in other words, until it was drawn off by the leaves; and then, and not till then, the bark became moist, and continued <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LADEN\">laden</a> with sap through the rest of the summer. Now, as it has been before shewn that no sap enters the bark by the roots, nor gets into it directly from the wood, there is no other known channel by which it can be conveyed, except through the leaves; and these, therefore, necessarily appear to be the organs by which it is apparently carried off from the wood, and by or through which it, at the same time, finds its way to the bark.\n\nThis inference appears to follow, not only from the fact of the bark continuing dry until the leaves are developed, but from the circumstance that it is again rendered dry, after having become moist, if these same leaves be removed. If, says Du Hamel, we remove the leaves of a young tree, when in full sap, and whose bark is easily detached, in a few days after the same bark will adhere as closely to the wood as it commonly does during winter. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> connection between the leaves and bark, is also well illustrated in an experiment of Hales, employed by him for a very different purpose. From two thriving shoots of a Pear-tree, he cut, in several places, half an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a> of the bark off all round. All the ringlets of bark between these incisions had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a>-bud upon them except one, and all but this\nElementary one ringlet grew and swelled at their bottoms till August; and the larger and more thriving the leaf-bud was, so much the more did the adjoining bark swell. (Veg. Statics, p. 149.) Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KNIGHT\">Knight</a> also found the bark of the Vine to become shrivelled and dry when the leaves were stripped off; but in those parts in which it communicated directly with the leaves, it continued moist and flourishing. (Phil. Trans., 1801, p. 335.)\n\n55. By connecting, therefore, the circumstances attending the flow of sap with the development of the leaves, we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> satisfactory reasons for all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> anomalies observed to attend its course. In spring, before the appearance of the leaves, no natural outlet for the escape of the rising sap exists, and therefore, when the vessels are cut or perforated, they readily pour out their sap, or bleed; but late in spring, and in summer, when the leaves are developed, the more watery parts of the sap are thrown off by transpiration; and, while this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> proceeds, the fluids do not then accumulate in such quantity in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> vessels of the trunk, as to be effused, or bleed through their cut or perforated sides. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, however, or a moist and still <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>, by checking transpiration from the leaves, restores more or less the propensity to bleeding from the trunk; and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUTUMN\">autumn</a>, when fructification begins, and vegetation makes a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PAUSE\">pause</a>, the same disposition to bleeding recurs in the trunk, from the check imposed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> powers of growth.\n\n56. It is farther evident, that, when the vessels of the bark become supplied with fluid, they could not have derived it immediately from those of the wood, since, in these different parts, the fluids have frequently no sort of agreement in properties. Thus, Grew remarks, that almost all plants, late in spring and in summer, bleed from their bark; and the sap has either a sour, sweet, hot, bitter, or other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>. At this period, the bark of the Vine yields a sour sap; but, \"what is vulgarly called bleeding in the Vine, is,\" he adds, \"quite another thing, both as to the liquor which issueth, and the place whence it issues\u2014that is\u2014it is neither a sweet nor a sour, but a tasteless sap, issuing, not from any vessels in the bark, but from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>-vessels of the wood.\" (Anatomy of Plants, p. 125.) Malpighi also was well aware of the difference in the qualities of the sap, and thought every plant possessed its peculiar sap; but he has not so accurately defined the situation of the vessels that contain it. Du Hamel, however, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> out distinctly the difference of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> in the sap of the bark and wood. In the bark of some plants it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>; in others <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>; and in others <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a>: It is in some instances milky; in others resinous; and in others gummy. In many plants it has a sweet taste; in some it is caustic; and in others insipid. It has sometimes much odour as well as flavour, and frequently it is destitute of both. (Phys. des Arbres, Tom. I. p. 68.)\n\n57. But, if the qualities of the sap in the bark be acquired in thus different from those of the sap in the wood; if the leaves, these peculiar qualities are detected in it, only after the development of the leaves, and the leaves be the organs by which alone the sap can be conveyed from the one part to the other\u2014then it seems to follow, that the sap must acquire these new properties in the leaves, during its transmission through them. Malpighi remarked the existence of this altered sap in the leaves, and held them to be the organs which prepared nutrient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> for the plant; and Dr Darwin, by immersing plants of Spurge in coloured liquors, not only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a>, as others had previously done, the red fluid ascend through the leaf; but another fluid, of a white <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, returning, at the same time, from the extremities of the leaf, and descending into the petiole. (Botanic Garden, Vol. I. Notes, p. 450\u2014453.) This same returning fluid, Mr Knight observed, in similar experiments, on branches of the Apple and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HORSE\">Horse</a>-Chesnut trees, and even traced it through the petiole into the inner bark, by the vessels of which, it seemed to be conveyed to the extremities of the roots. (Phil. Trans., 1801.) The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, therefore, of the sap in the bark, is not that of ascent, as Grew and Malpighi and many others have believed; but of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a>, as the observations and experiments of De la Baisse, Du Hamel, Knight, and others, abundantly prove. To these vessels of the bark, Grew assigned particular names, according to the apparent quality of the fluid they conveyed. Malpighi gave them the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> appellation of vasa peculiaria, from their containing a fluid different from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> sap. By others they have been called cortical vessels, a term, however, not applicable to many tribes of vegetables which are entirely destitute of bark. Lastly, Du Hamel and others denominated them proper vessels, which term differs but slightly from the appellation of Malpighi, and, though not very precise, is that we shall continue to employ.\n\n58. From regarding the newly formed vessels of\n\nThe view thus presented of the course of the sap, and the modifications which its movements and qualities <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> from the development of the leaves, may assist in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a> of the important and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a>-agitated question regarding the proper period of felling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a>, as it relates both to the bark and wood. The most proper period for the timber, is doubtless that in which it is most dry or destitute of sap; and the properest period for the bark, both as regards its chemical condition, and the facility of stripping it, is, when it is most succulent, and filled with its \"proper juices.\" But these respective periods and conditions do not happen to coincide, and therefore, the time at which the wood is in best condition, is that in which the bark is in its worst; and vice versa. If, therefore, the qualities of the bark dictate the period of felling, it will be late in spring or in autumn, when it is most abundantly filled with its proper juices, and of course, when the wood also is necessarily filled with fluid, and in an active state of vegetation; if, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, the condition of the wood regulate the period, then it will be late in winter, or before the sap rises in spring, when the wood is destitute of sap, and the bark, of course, is necessarily dry and adherent. To reconcile these opposing conditions, it seems desirable, as far as it may be practicable, to strip the\nElementary the wood as part of the bark, Grew uniformly represents the bark as possessing two distinct species of vessels, in which he has been since followed by several other writers; but the vessels which he calls lympheducts belong rather to the wood, so that we may regard him as describing only one species of proper vessels. In herbs, these vessels stand sometimes in distinct parcels or columns; sometimes they are disposed in a ring; sometimes they have a radiated position; and sometimes they are more intermixed with the sap-vessels, and seem to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> with them. In trees, the vessels of the bark are more distinct, and have a much more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> appearance. They are commonly postured near the inner margin of the bark, and, when viewed in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONGITUDINAL\">longitudinal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>, seem collected into fasciculi which are more or less numerous, and the component vessels of which continually diverge and join with others, so as to form a reticulated appearance; as in fig. 18. Plate XV. Of these reticulated fasciculi, many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAYERS\">layers</a> exist in an old tree; and to these layers the thickness of the bark is chiefly owing. As they proceed inward, the direction of the fasciculi is less oblique, so that near to the wood they are almost straight: Hence, the spaces formed by the reticulations are very unequal, often large in the exterior part of the bark, and diminishing in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> towards the wood; they are everywhere filled with cellular tissue. Such is a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of the proper vessels of the bark as given by Grew, Malpighi, and Du Hamel. The organs here described, we regard as truly vessels; but some writers have also described, as vessels, various collections of the proper juices which occur in different parts of the cellular tissue of the bark, and have thus lost sight altogether of the anatomical characters which distinguish vessels from cells.\n\n59. The vessels which thus form the vascular portion of the bark appear to differ but little in structure from the more simple vessels of the wood. Grew considered them to possess a similar structure, from believing them to be formed by the inner bark, at the same time with the vessels of the wood; and, therefore, he adds, \"they may be reasonably thought similar in the bark and wood.\" (Anat. of Plants, p. 112.) Malpighi regarded them as simple tubes, containing sometimes peculiar juices, but advances nothing particular respecting their structure. (Anat. Plantarum, p. 3.) M. Mirbel's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> deserves some notice, insomuch as he declares the structure of these vessels to differ entirely from all those of the wood. Their sides, says he, are perfectly entire; they have neither pores nor clefts, and may therefore be deemed simple tubes. (Exposit. de la Th\u00e9orie de l'Organisation V\u00e9g\u00e9tal, p. 109). A single vessel of this kind is represented in Plate XV. fig. 16; and in fig. 17, a fasciculus of the same vessels magnified, is given, as delineated by M. Mirbel. A remark also of Hill, if it be deemed to rest on correct observation, is entitled to great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>. \"The vessels of the bark that form the fasciculi are not,\" says he, united to each other, but are connected with the cellular tissue at numerous places, and, when separated from it, there appear on the sides of the vessels small oval depressions, dotted as it were with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PIN\">pin</a>-holes.\" (On the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">Construction</a> of Timber, p. 28.) These appearances he regards as of a glandular nature, but their description corresponds better with that of Leuwenboeck respecting the lateral ramifications from the vessels of the wood; and they may probably be the points at which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> is effected betwixt the vessels and cells.\n\n60. The cause of the reticulated appearance which the vessels of the bark exhibit in trees, is doubtless to be attributed, as we think Du Hamel somewhere remarks, to their peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of growth. A new layer of cortical vessels is every year added to the inner surface of the bark, as well as a new layer of ligneous vessels to the outer surface of the wood; so that, as Grew observes, the new matter of the tree is every year distributed two contrary ways; one part falling outward towards the bark, and the other part retaining its situation inward to constitute the wood. At first, the newly formed cortical vessels are straight, and stand <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a>, like those of the wood; but, by the continual growth of the new parts, formed between the bark and the wood, the older vessels of the bark are gradually forced outward, and being thus every year disposed around a larger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a>, are necessarily more and more separated from each other, and produce at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">net</a>-like form which we observe them to possess. The newly formed vessels of the wood, on the other hand, retain their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> position, and, therefore, preserve their parallelism, seldom or never exhibiting those flexures and reticulations so common to the vessels of the bark.\n\n61. In the bark, as well as in the wood, the vessels are found to possess different sizes. In the Pine, vessels containing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURPENTINE\">turpentine</a> are represented by Grew, which are very much larger than the common sap-vessels, and are surrounded by smaller ones, exactly as the large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRAL\">spiral</a> tubes of the wood are said to be ensheathed by the common sap-vessels. The milky juice of a species of Sumach is contained in very large vessels, disposed so as to form a ring, and each large vessel is surrounded by many smaller ones. (Anat. of Plants, Tab. 20.) The appearance of these large vessels in one species of Pine, is well represented by Hill, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> he gives of their formation is probably correct. In this tree (Pinus orientalis), some of these vessels form oval openings, large enough to admit a straw; these openings occupy the centre of the bark, and are surrounded by a ring of smaller vessels; as their contents are soluble in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALCOHOL\">alcohol</a>, it is easy to obtain them empty. In fig. 19. Plate XV. the vessels of this tree, as they appear in the bark, are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a>; the woody portion of the tree has been scooped away, so that the longitudinal aspect, as well as the transverse sections of them, is exhibited. From a strict inquiry into\n\ntree of its bark while standing, in autumn, at or a little before the period of fructification, when the bark must possess its richest qualities, and be in the best condition to separate; and to fell the tree late in winter, when the wood is destitute of sap, and its vegetative powers are most completely suspended.\ntheir nature, Dr Hill concluded that these larger vessels were originally the same as those of the smaller fasciculi in the bark of the same tree; \"so that, if we conceive one of these smaller fasciculi opened in its centre, and the vessels driven every way outward, till they are stopped by the substance of the bark, we shall have an idea of the structure of this large vessel, which is nothing more than a great cylindrical hollow formed in the centre of such a fasciculus.\" (Hill on the Construction of Timber, p. 29.) It is in trees that have copious and viscid juices, that these enlarged vessels are formed; and where the juices do not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONCRETE\">concrete</a>, it is probable, that, as the vessels annually recede from the centre, they suffer a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> in size, from the continued effects of desiccation and compression to which they are exposed.\n\n62. The foregoing varieties appear alone entitled to the appellation of the proper vessels of the bark. In many tribes of vegetables, however, as will afterwards be shown, no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> of bark and wood exists; but one uniform <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a> of vessels extends from the centre to the circumference of the plant. Such plants have also their proper vessels, but the place and disposition of these vessels are not so precisely ascertained. From the mode in which their growth is accomplished, as well as from observation of their structure, it may be inferred, that their proper vessels are distributed through the whole substance of the plant, accompanying, in every part, the sap-vessels. In some plants, possessing this arrangement of parts, such as different species of wheat, Malpighi describes and delineates a vas proprium as forming a part of each fasciculus of vessels; and a similar intermixture of the two kinds must, we conceive, exist in all similar structures.\n\n63. Even in many plants, possessing a distinct bark, vessels containing proper juices are found in the wood. In every circle of wood, from the inmost that surrounds the pith, to the outmost in contact with the bark, vessels containing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUM\">gum</a>, turpentine, or some other concrete or coloured juice, may frequently be found. Malpighi conceived them to exist in all plants, though, from the nature of their fluids, they could not always be distinguished; and he believed them to afford a highly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> juice for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NUTRITION\">nutrition</a> of the plant. According to Grew, \"the turpentine vessels that are scattered up and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the wood of the Pine and Fir are the self same which did once appertain to the bark; but being pinched up by the wood, they are become much smaller pipes.\" (Anat. of Plants, p. 115.) Du Hamel also regarded them as similar to those of the bark, but rendered much smaller by compression. In the Pine and Fir, they are disposed circularly around the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol3.html#article-AXIS\">axis</a>, much like the sap-vessels, and alternate with them. (Phys. des Arbres, Tom. I. p. 41.)\n\nIn Piscidia erythrina, the proper juices are of a scarlet colour, and the vessels that contain them are therefore readily discerned wherever they exist. This plant has been selected by Hill to demonstrate the position of these vessels. In the bark, they are collected into fasciculi, all the vessels of which contain coloured juices, and are disposed in a ring on the inner margin of the bark. Within this ring stands the albumen, through the substance of which many smaller red vessels are distributed, and similar red vessels are more sparingly seen in every layer of wood, particularly in that which envelopes the pith. (Constr. of Timber.)\n\n64. Now, the red vessels thus observed in the wood of the above mentioned plant, must either have been formed in the situations they occupy, or transported from some other place. The latter supposition is inadmissible, insomuch as the wood of trees is formed by layers of new vessels superimposed on one another; and no removal of the old vessels, nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-REPRODUCTION\">reproduction</a> of new vessels within the old layers, ever takes place; consequently, no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> transposition of vessels could occur; nor could new vessels be developed in the wood after it had been completely formed. If, however, an alternate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEPOSITION\">deposition</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSORPTION\">absorption</a> of matter go on into, and from the cells, it is possible that the vessels might, in this way, become filled with a matter different from that which they originally possessed; but in the case before us, a readier explanation presents itself. The new matter of the wood is formed at the same time, and in the same place, as that of the bark; and through this new woody matter the red vessels were dispersed as well as in the bark. Consequently, every addition made to the ligneous layers would furnish some vessels that contained these proper juices; and this being annually repeated, would exhibit that intermixture of proper vessels with sap-vessels, which is observed in all the ligneous layers of this and many other trees. Hence these proper vessels of the wood must be held to retain the position in which they were originally produced; and cannot be said to have approached nearer to the centre, but only, by the addition of new layers exterior to them, to be placed farther from the circumference of the tree. As Grew, therefore, held the albumen to be a part of the bark, he might correctly say that these vessels \"did once appertain to it.\"\n\nArticle VII.\n\nOf Collections of the Proper Juices in the Cellular Tissue.\n\n65. Beside this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCUMULATION\">accumulation</a> of the proper juices in certain vessels of the wood, it frequently happens that depositions of similar matter occur in all parts of the cellular tissue of plants. In the bark of the single Oak and Poplar, and of other trees, resinous concretions are often found in the cells; they are situated irregularly, and, according to Malpighi, are observed even in very young bark. Sometimes the cells containing milky and resinous juices are so postured in the bark, says Grew, as to form cylindrical channels, which are neither parallel nor anywhere inclosed, but run, with some little obliquities, distinct from one another. They appear to be formed out of the cells, and are not bounded by any walls or sides proper to themselves, but only by those of the cells. (Anat. of Plants, p. 112.) They are often short and tortuous, always isolated, and are sometimes placed irregularly; at others, disposed in a circular form. They occur sometimes in the pith, and possess very different sizes and figures. They have fre-\nElementary quently been deemed a species of proper vessels, from the mere circumstance of their containing similar juices, and from possessing sometimes an elongated form; but they are organs which, neither in form nor in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a>, bear any resemblance to vessels. Mirbel proposes to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> them secretory canals, and M. Link cellular reservoirs; the term certainly most generally applicable, and involving no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> respecting either their formation or functions.\n\n66. The manner in which these cellular reservoirs may be produced in the bark or pith, is readily explained, on the supposition that a communication everywhere subsists between vessels and the cells. One set of vessels has been shown to receive and carry out sap to the leaves, and another to bring it back from them to the bark; and these latter vessels are everywhere, in their course, surrounded by cellular tissue. Hence the cells, in every part, may receive a portion of the fluid which the vessels are employed to convey. Thus in herbs, the cells both of the bark and pith are filled with fluid, which led Grew to believe that the sap was actually transmitted through those organs; but at the same time he delivers facts which, even in his own opinion, prove that it is derived directly from the vessels. Not only in herbs, but \"in every annual growth, whether of a sprout from a seed, of a sucker from a root, or of a seyon from a branch, the pith is always found the first year full of sap; but in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> year, the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a> pith always becomes dry, and so it continues ever after. One cause whereof is, that the lympheducts of the bark being, the first year, adjacent to the pith, they do all that time transtuse part of their sap into it, and so keep it always succulent. But the same lympheducts, the following year, are turned into wood, and the vessels which are then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> and carry the sap, stand beyond them in the bark; so that the sap, being now more remote from the pith, and intercepted by the new wood, cannot be transmuted with that sufficient force and plenty as before, into the pith; which, therefore, from the first year, always continues dry.\" (Anat. of Plants, p. 124.)\n\nAll that is here said respecting the transusion of the common sap from the vessels to the cells, as it ascends through the wood, is equally applicable to the proper juices as they descend through the bark. During the first year of growth, both the sap and proper vessels are adjacent to the pith, as well as to the bark, and each order may therefore transtuse its fluids into the cells of either. The common sap, from retaining its fluidity, is frequently removed by absorption, and the cells that contained it appear empty and dry; but where the proper juices are transtused, and become viscid or concrete, they are retained, and appear in different quantities and forms both in the bark and pith, according to the nature and properties of the juices from which they are derived, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEXTURE\">texture</a> and situation of the tissue into which they are poured.\n\n67. To these collections of the proper juices in cellular Canals the cells of the cellular tissue may be referred the opinions of those who describe them as existing sometimes in vacuities betwixt the cells. M. Treviranus professes to have discovered certain interstices between the cells, formed in a mode hereafter to be explained, to which he has given the name of intercellular canals. According to him, these canals contain the proper juices, and convey them to all the cellular parts of plants; and are the true proper vessels of the bark. We before saw that M. Kieser, after making the wood to consist almost entirely of spiral vessels, and then converting these vessels into tubes destined only to convey air, supposed the sap to be carried by these same intercellular canals. (Kieser's M\u00e9m. sur l'Organisation des Plantes, p. 36.) With M. Treviranus he also considers them as the real proper vessels of the bark, by which alone the juices are conveyed to all parts of the cellular tissue. (Ibid. p. 216.) If such canals really exist betwixt the cells, it is probable, that, like the cells themselves, they may sometimes become reservoirs of the proper juices; but simply on that account, to pronounce them vessels, is, in an anatomical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, exceedingly incorrect; and to make them afterwards supersede the existence of the real vessels themselves, seems nothing less than downright extravagance and absurdity. Were there any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> in such statements, we might at once banish from the organization of plants all the varieties of vessels, whose situation, structure, and characters we have been labouring to describe and define. But the opinions of these writers have not at all shaken our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> in the facts observed by their predecessors; and as long as the vegetable functions shall continue to be exercised as they have hitherto been, so long, we believe, will a vascular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a>, such nearly as we have attempted to demonstrate, be employed as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> in their execution.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">Section</a> II.\n\nOf the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSORBENT\">Absorbent</a> and Exhalent Systems.\n\nArticle I.\n\nOf the Absorbent System.\n\n68. Connected with the vessels that distribute the fluids through organized bodies, is another system of vessels by which extraneous matter is taken up to support the growth of parts, and supply the waste occasioned by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of the various functions. To these vessels Anatomists have given the name of Absorbents. The function which they perform is carried on either from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> surface, or from some internal part of the body; and its exercise, in animal bodies, may be distinguished into three kinds or stages. The first is that in which new or extraneous matter is taken up and added to the system, as in the absorption of substances from the skin, or of chyle from the intestines; the second is that in which substances previously separated from the fluids by secretion, but without becoming organized, are again taken up by the absorbents, and reconveyed into the blood-vessels, as in the absorption of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>, bile, and fat; the third kind is that in which the secreting organs themselves, and successively all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> parts of the body, are removed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the absorbent vessels. By plants, this function is exercised to less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, and seems to comprise only the two first kinds or degrees of it, viz. the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIMARY\">primary</a> absorption of extraneous matter, and the reabsorption of certain\nany power of reabsorbing what has once formed an organized part of the system. Hence the formation of organized parts in plants is not accompanied, as in animals, by the unceasing removal of old particles; but the particles, which have once become organized, continue permanent, until removed by some cause or process foreign to the living powers of the plant. When once, therefore, the organs of plants have become mature, they are exposed to decay only from the operation of foreign causes, and cannot be mined from within by that gradual loss of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> between the secreting and absorbing functions, which the advances of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> bring on the animal system. Neither in the vegetable system can the removal of organized parts under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>, any more than in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, have place; and consequently, the several modes or stages of ulcerative absorption, so finely illustrated by the researches of Mr Hunter, belong not to the economy of plants.\n\n69. As the function of absorption is thus of more limited extent in plants than in animals, so may we expect to find the arrangement of organs destined to its exercise. In animals, the absorbent vessels are quite distinct from those which carry blood, are provided everywhere with glands, and, like the veins, are furnished with valves. From their beginnings, in all parts of the body, to their termination, they continually unite with one another into vessels successively increasing in size, until, after a long course, they form at length two trunks, which deliver their contents into the large veins near the heart. As no common reservoir exists in plants, there is no such single point to which their absorbed fluids require to be carried. Hence their absorbents seem everywhere to have a very short course, to form no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNION\">union</a> with one another, but to deliver their contents at once into the sap-vessels adjacent to them. They appear to be destitute alike of glands and valves, and indeed, in an anatomical view, they can scarcely be considered distinct from the sap-vessels, but may rather be deemed ramifications from them; so that although we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a>, with Grew, that the ordinary sap-vessels do not ramify one out of another, yet they certainly send off those fine ramifications which, from their office, we denominate the absorbents of plants.\n\n70. In the root, the absorbents are capable of being demonstrated: when a plant is immersed in coloured fluids, many of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CAPILLARY\">capillary</a> absorbents become tinged through their whole course to their termination in the sap-vessels, proving them to be simple ramifications from these vessels themselves. A farther <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IDENTITY\">identity</a> of these two systems is derived from the fact, that any part of a sap-vessel is not only capable of emitting capillary absorbents from its sides, but of exercising itself an absorbent function, whenever its cut extremity is brought into contact with a fluid. These absorbents are formed very speedily, and in great multitudes on the roots of annual plants; and even in perennial plants, they appear, like the leaves, to suffer an annual decay, and be reproduced with the return of vegetation.\n\n71. But plants absorb fluids by other parts of their surface as well as by the roots. This absorbing power extends, in some of the lower tribes, over the entire surface of the vegetable, which is destitute of any organ analogous to a root; in other instances, where the roots are small and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> arid, the plant derives almost all its moisture by the absorption of dews through the leaves. The experiments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BONNET\">Bonnet</a> show that all leaves, both those of herbs and of trees, when brought into contact with water, are capable of absorbing it, and that the moisture thus absorbed is communicated through the vascular system of the leaf. The leaves of herbs he found to absorb nearly alike from either surface; but those of trees absorbed best by the lower surface. The petiole and larger rilets appeared to absorb much less than the other parts of the leaf. So great and general is this absorbing power, that vegetables, says he, may be said to be planted in the air, nearly as they are in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, the leaves being to the branches what the capillary rootlets are to the roots. (Recherches sur l'Usage des Feuilles, p. 22, 47.)\n\n72. What then are the organs by which this function is carried on in the leaf? M. Bonnet imagined the vessels of the leaves to receive their fluids by Pores, through the pores adjacent to them; and that the leaves, which had only few pores, possessed but little absorbent power. (Ibid. p. 20, 22.) He thought, also, that the hairs frequently distributed over the leaf, attracted moisture, and might even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> as absorbents; though he admits that many leaves which have only slight inequalities on their surface, without hairs, exercise an absorbent function. (Ibid. p. 47.)\n\nThis subject has been since investigated by M. Decandolle, whose researches appear to confirm the account of Bonnet, as to the absorbing power of the pores. According to him, these pores are found on all parts of the leaf except the rilets, which have none, but are covered with hairs. At the mouth of the pore, a vascular net-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> is always to be found, which he regards as a production from the larger vessels of the leaf. He asserts that pores are found only in those parts where vessels go to terminate, and not in others; and that in trees, this structure occurs chiefly on the lower surface of the leaf, while in herbs it is equally seen on both surfaces. The stem, in general, has few or no pores, except where it is soft and herbaceous; and even then, the pores occur only in the deeper green furrows, not on the prominent lines which bound them, and are usually covered with hairs. No pores are to be found on roots or bulbs or fleshy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>, but most of the organs above <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> are more or less furnished with them. Exposure to the air seems necessary to their formation; for plants, or parts of plants, that live beneath water or earth, are destitute of pores, but acquire them if brought into the free air. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCLUSION\">Exclusion</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> prevents also the formation of pores; and hence etiolated plants are not furnished with them. (M\u00e9m. de l'Inst. Nat. Tom. I. p. 351.) In general, his anatomical researches, respecting the existence of pores in leaves, agreed with the results of Bonnet's experiments on the absorbing power of their surfaces; and when we consider that all plants, and parts of plants, secluded from the air, are at the same time destitute of pores, and of the power of absorbing by their surfaces, it may be inferred that the organs of absorption, on the external surfaces of\nElementary plants, are the minute vascular productions, which in tender and succulent parts exposed to the air and light, everywhere perforate the cuticle, and form in it those innumerable orifices which we denominate pores.\n\n73. But the function of absorption in plants, is not confined to the taking up of extraneous matters. Many facts prove that, in every part where active vegetation exists, internal absorption is continually going on. The organs by which it is immediately performed cannot, perhaps, from their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> delicacy and minuteness, be rendered capable of anatomical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a>; but certain facts which occur in plants, coupled with certain analogies derived from other organized textures, must, we think, carry complete <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVICTION\">conviction</a> of their existence. In almost every part, and on every surface of animal bodies, the vessels which exercise absorption may be traced; but the mouths or orifices by which they actually absorb, are scarcely ever to be seen. In one instance only, viz. in the intestines, have they been followed to their beginnings, and discovered in the act of exercising their appropriate function. (Gordon's System of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">Human</a> Anat. Vol. I. p. 70.) But though their orifices remain, in other parts, undiscovered, no anatomist hesitates to admit their existence when he sees the canals of the vessels themselves laden with blood, or milk, or bile; and seeing them thus to convey fluids, whose colour manifests their presence, he equally believes them capable of absorbing and conveying other substances, though they may not be visible to the eye. Believing farther, that no solid part of the body, nor even fluid part that has been deposited in closed cavities, can be removed in a natural manner from its place, but by the agency of these vessels, he comes to regard the simple fact of the disappearance of such part, as sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> of its absorption.\n\n74. Now the facts and analogies on which internal absorption rests in the vegetable system, are precisely of the same nature, and the evidence of its existence is scarcely less complete. In every part of the cellular tissue of plants, various substances have been found, which must have been primarily derived from the vessels, the only organs which furnish new materials to the plant. These substances, however, often disappear from the cells, and are again to be detected in the vascular system. Thus, in the seed, as will afterwards be shown, the cells of the cotyledon contain a solid unorganized matter, which could have been originally deposited in them only by means of the vessels. During germination, this solid matter is rendered fluid, disappears from the cells, and is again to be traced in the vessels on its way to afford nutriment to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RADICLE\">radicle</a> and plumule. We say then that this unorganized matter must have been taken up from the cells of the cotyledon, and conveyed into the vascular system, by the agency of absorbent vessels, which, it is probable, are distributed everywhere on the inner surface of these cells; just as, in the animal system, absorbent vessels are considered to take up the fat from the surface of the cells in which it is deposited, and convey it into the vessels of the animal.\n\n75. This alternate absorption and deposition of the nutrient matter of seeds, is sometimes strikingly displayed in the growth of potatoes. It frequently happens that potatoes, lying in a damp cellar, put forth shoots which grow to a considerable size without the access of any foreign agents, except <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, water, and air. On these shoots, young potatoes, as large as the eggs of pigeons, are sometimes to be found, and the substance of the old potatoe has in great part disappeared. In such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, the matter from the cells of the old potatoe, must be considered as removed by absorption, and conveyed into the vessels of the shoot, where it was in part employed in forming the new organs of the young potatoe, and in part deposited, to experience, perhaps, in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> growth, similar successions of removal and deposition. In the living parts of perennial plants also, nutrient matter appears to be alternately deposited and absorbed from the cells during the active periods of vegetation; and in the cellular tissue of herbaceous plants, a similar deposition and absorption of fluids seems to be frequently taking place; so that in all the vegetating parts of plants, these alternate functions of secretion and absorption are more or less constantly exercised.\n\n76. A good illustration of the manner in which these functions are alternately exercised, is afforded by an experiment of M. Decandolle. The parasitic plant called Mistletoe draws its nourishment, as is well known, from the tree on which it grows. M. Decandolle placed a branch of an Apple-tree, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> a stalk of mistletoe, in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFUSION\">infusion</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COCHINEAL\">cochineal</a> for five days. He then dissected it, and observed the coloured liquor to have risen through the wood and albumen of the apple-branch, and reached the place of junction between it and the mistletoe, which it strongly reddened; and from thence it penetrated into the woody part of the mistletoe. There did not, however, appear to be a true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANASTOMOSIS\">anastomosis</a> between the vessels of these different plants; but, at the base of the mistletoe, where the parts were so deeply reddened, a minute cellular structure was observed. Into these cells the vascular system of the apple appeared to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEPOSIT\">deposit</a> its sap, and from them the capillary absorbents of the mistletoe, distributed upon the cells, seemed, like the ordinary absorbents of roots, to take it up. (M\u00e9m. de l'Instit. Nat. Tom. I. p. 370.) From these and many similar facts it may be inferred, that absorbents, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> with the vessels of the plant, exist in every part, and that the removal of all secreted matters from the cells and other closed cavities of the vegetable, when effected by the living powers of the plant, is accomplished, as in animal bodies, by the exercise of an absorbent function.","sp":548,"ep":554},{"h":"ARTS","t":"FINE.\n\nIn the Encyclopaedia there is some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a>, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> Arts, of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of the Fine Arts, including <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">Poetry</a>, Eloquence, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAINTING\">Painting</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATUARY\">Statuary</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">Architecture</a>.

These all stand unrivalled in the history of art; and they owe their pre-eminence and perfection to one and the same principle,\u2014the immediate imitation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>. This principle predominated equally in the classical forms of the antique, and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GROTESQUE\">grotesque</a> figures of Hogarth; the perfection of art in each arose from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IDENTITY\">identity</a> of the imitation with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a>; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> was in the subjects; there was none in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of imitation. Yet the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol1.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a> for the ideal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of art would persuade their disciples, that the difference between Hogarth and the antique does not consist in the different forms of nature which they imitated, but in this, that the one is like, and the other unlike nature. This is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>, the most detrimental, perhaps, of all others, both to the theory and practice of art. As, however, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> is very strong and general, and supported by the highest authority, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be necessary to go somewhat elaborately into the question, in order to produce an impression on the other side.\n\nWhat has given rise to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> of the ideal, as something quite distinct from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> nature, is probably the perfection of the Greek statues. Not seeing among ourselves, anything to correspond in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> and grandeur, either with the features or form of the limbs in these exquisite remains of antiquity, it was an obvious, but a superficial conclusion, that they must have been created from the idea existing in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol3.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a>'s mind, and could not have been copied from anything existing in nature. The contrary, however, is the fact. The general form, both of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, which we observe in the old statues, is not an ideal abstraction, is not a fanciful invention of the sculptor, but is as completely local and national (though it happens to be more beautiful), as the figures on a Chinese screen, or a copperplate engraving of a negro chieftain in a book of travels. It will not be denied, that there is a difference of physiognomy as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a> in different races of men... The Greek form appears to have been naturally beautiful, and they had, besides, every advantage of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, of dress, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a>, and modes of life to improve it. The artist had also every facility afforded him in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> and knowledge of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> form, and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> and public institutions gave him every encouragement in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROSE\">prose</a>-\nAll these causes contributed to the perfection of these noble productions; but we should be inclined principally to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> the superior symmetry of form common to the Greek statues, in the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, to the superior symmetry of the models in nature, and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, to the more constant opportunities for studying them. If we allow, also, for the superior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> of the people, we shall not be wrong; but this superiority consisted in their peculiar susceptibility to the impressions of what is beautiful and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> in nature. It may be thought an objection to what has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> been said, that the antique figures of animals, &c., are as fine, and proceed on the same principles as their statues of gods or men. But all that follows from this seems to be, that their art had been perfected in the study of the human form, the test and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of power and skill; and was then transferred easily to the general imitation of all other objects, according to their true characters, proportions, and appearances. As a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> of these remarks, the antique portraits of individuals were often superior even to the personifications of their gods. We think that no unprejudiced spectator of real <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> can hesitate for a moment in preferring the head of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANTINOUS\">Antinous</a>, for example, to that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOLLO\">Apollo</a>. And in general, it may be laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> as a rule, that the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> of the antiques are the most simple\u2014those which affect the least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, or violence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>\u2014which repose the most on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> beauty of form, and a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> of sweetness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>, that is, which remain most nearly in that state in which they could be copied from nature without straining the limbs or features of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a>, or racking the invention of the artist. This tendency of Greek art to repose has indeed been reproached with insipidity by those who had not a true feeling of beauty and sentiment. We, however, prefer these models of habitual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a> or internal grandeur to the violent distortions of suffering in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAOCOON\">Laocoon</a>, or even to the supercilious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a> of the Apollo. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIOBE\">Niobe</a>, more than any other antique head, combines truth and beauty with deep passion. But here the passion is fixed, intense, habitual\u2014it is not a sudden or violent gesticulation, but a settled mould of features; the grief it expresses is such as might almost turn the human countenance itself into marble!\n\nIn general, then, we would be understood to maintain, that the beauty and grandeur so much admired in the Greek statues were not a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUNTARY\">voluntary</a> fiction of the brain of the artist, but existed substantially in the forms from which they were copied, and by which the artist was surrounded. A striking authority in support of these observations, which has in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> been lately discovered, is to be found in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELGIN\">Elgin</a> marbles, taken from the Acropolis at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a>, and supposed to be the works of the celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHIDIAS\">Phidias</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of fastidious refinement and indefinite abstraction is certainly not visible there. The figures have all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, the simplicity, and variety, of individual nature. Even the details of the subordinate parts, the loose hanging folds in the skin, the veins under the belly, or on the sides of the horses, more or less swelled as the animal is more or less in action, are given with scrupulous exactness.\n\nThis is true nature and true art. In a word, these invaluable remains of antiquity are precisely like casts taken from life. The ideal is not the preference of that which exists only in the mind, to that which exists in nature; but the preference of that which is fine in nature to that which is less so. There is nothing fine in art but what is taken almost immediately, and, as it were, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>, from what is finer in nature. Where there have been the finest models in nature, there have been the finest works of art.\n\nAs the Greek statues were copied from Greek forms, so Raphael's expressions were taken from Italian faces; and we have heard it remarked, that the women in the streets at Rome seem to have walked out of his pictures in the Vatican.\n\nSir Joshua Reynolds constantly refers to Raphael as the highest example in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> times (at least with one exception) of the grand or ideal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a>; and yet he makes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSENCE\">essence</a> of that style to consist in the embodying an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> or general idea, formed in the mind of the artist by rejecting the peculiarities of individuals, and retaining only what is common to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>. Nothing can be more inconsistent than the style of Raphael with this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a>. In his Cartoons and in his groupes in the Vatican, there is hardly a face or figure which is any thing more than fine individual nature finely disposed and copied. The late Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARRY\">Barry</a>, who could not be suspected of a prejudice on this side of the question, speaks thus of them: \"In Raphael's pictures (at the Vatican) of the Dispute of the Sacrament, and the School of Athens, one sees all the heads to be entirely copied from particular characters in nature, nearly proper for the persons and situations which he adopts them to; and he seems to me only to add and take away what may answer his purpose in little parts, features, &c.; conceiving, while he had the head before him, ideal characters and expressions, which he adopts these features and peculiarities of face to. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to the particulars which distinguish all the different faces, persons, and characters, the one from the other, gives his pictures quite the verity and unaffected dignity of nature, which stamp the distinguishing differences betwixt one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a>'s face and body and another's.\"\n\nIf any thing is wanting to the conclusiveness of this testimony, it is only to look at the pictures themselves; particularly the Miracle of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVERSION\">Conversion</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">Assembly</a> of Saints, which are little else than a collection of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVINE\">divine</a> portraits, in natural and expressive attitudes, full of the loftiest thought and feeling, and as varied as they are fine. It is this reliance on the power of nature which has produced those masterpieces by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> of painters, in which expression is all in all;\u2014where one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a>\u2014that of truth,\u2014pervades every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a>, brings down <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAVEN\">Heaven</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARTH\">Earth</a>, mingles Cardinals and Popes with Angels and Apostles,\u2014and yet blends and harmonizes the whole by the true touches and intense feeling of what is beautiful and grand in nature. It is no wonder that Sir Joshua, when he first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> Raphael's pictures in the Vatican, was at a loss to discover any great excellence in them, if he was looking out for\nhis theory of the ideal,\u2014of neutral character and middle forms.\n\nThere is more an appearance of abstract grandeur of form in Michael Angelo. He has followed up, has enforced, and expanded, as it were, a preconceived idea, till he sometimes seems to tread on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERGE\">verge</a> of caricature. His forms, however, are not middle, but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> forms, massy, gigantic, supernatural. They convey the idea of the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> and strength in the figure, and in all the parts of the figure. Every muscle is swollen and turgid. This tendency to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXAGGERATION\">exaggeration</a> would have been avoided, if Michael Angelo had recurred more constantly to nature, and had proceeded less on a scientific knowledge of the structure of the human body; for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> gives only the positive form of the different parts, which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> may afterwards magnify, as it pleases, but it is nature alone which combines them with perfect truth and delicacy, in all the varieties of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> and expression. It is fortunate that we can refer, in illustration of our doctrine, to the admirable fragment of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THESEUS\">Theseus</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Elgin's, which shows the possibility of uniting the grand and natural style in the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>. The form of the limbs, as affected by pressure or action, and the general sway of the body, are preserved with the most consummate mastery. We should prefer this statue as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> for forming the style of the student to the Apollo, which strikes us as having something of a theatrical appearance, or to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERCULES\">Hercules</a>, in which there is an ostentatious and over-laboured display of anatomy. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> figure is so overloaded with sinews, that it has been suggested as a doubt, whether, if life could be put into it, it would be able to move. Grandeur of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a>, truth of nature, and purity of taste, seem to have been at their height when the masterpieces which adorned the temple of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINERVA\">Minerva</a> at Athens, of which we have only these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> fragments, were produced. Compared with these, the later Greek statues display a more elaborate workmanship, more of the artifices of style. The several parts are more uniformly balanced, made more to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TALLY\">tally</a> like modern periods: each muscle is more equally brought out, and more highly finished as a part, but not with the same subordination of each part to the whole. If some of these wonderful productions have a fault, it is the want of that entire and naked simplicity which pervades the whole of the Elgin marbles.\n\nHaving spoken here of the Greek statues, and of the works of Raphael and Michael Angelo, as far as relates to the imitation of nature, we shall attempt to point out, to the best of our ability, and as concisely as possible, what we conceive to be their general and characteristic excellences. The ancients excelled in beauty of form; Michael Angelo in grandeur of conception; Raphael in expression. In Raphael's faces, particularly his women, the expression is very superior to the form; in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> statues, the form is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> thing. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> which the latter excite, is in a manner <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a>; it depends on a certain grace and lightness of appearance, joined with exquisite symmetry and refined susceptibility to voluptuous emotions; but there is in general a want of pathos. In their looks, we do not read the workings of the heart; by their beauty they seem raised above the sufferings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>, by their beauty they are deified. The pathos which they exhibit is rather that of present and physical distress, than of deep internal sentiment. What has been remarked of Leonardo da Vinci, is also true of Raphael, that there is an angelic sweetness and tenderness in his faces, in which human frailty and passion are purified by the sanctity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>. The ancient statues are finer objects for the eye to contemplate; they represent a more perfect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of physical beings, but we have little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYMPATHY\">sympathy</a> with them. In Raphael, all our natural sensibilities are heightened and refined by the sentiments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">hope</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTING\">pointing</a> mysteriously to the interests of another world. The same intensity of passion appears also to distinguish Raphael from Michael Angelo. Michael Angelo's forms are grander, but they are not so informed with expression. Raphael's, however ordinary in themselves, are full of expression, \"even to overflowing;\" every nerve and muscle is impregnated with feeling,\u2014bursting with meaning. In Michael Angelo, on the contrary, the powers of body and mind appear superior to any events that can happen to them; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a> of thought and feeling is never full, never strained or tasked to the extremity of what it will bear. All is in a lofty repose and solitary grandeur, which no human interests can shake or disturb. It has been said, that Michael Angelo painted man, and Raphael men; that the one was an epic, the other a dramatic painter. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> we have stated is, perhaps, truer and more intelligible, viz. that the one gave greater dignity of form, and the other greater force and refinement of expression. Michael Angelo, in fact, borrowed his style from sculpture. He represented, in general, only single figures (with subordinate accompaniments), and had not to express the conflicting actions and passions of a multitude of persons. It is therefore a mere truism to say, that his compositions are not dramatic. He is much more picturesque than Raphael. The whole figure of his Jeremiah droops and hangs down like a majestic tree surcharged with showers. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> of the human form has the characteristic freedom and boldness of Titian's landscapes.\n\nAfter Michael Angelo and Raphael, there is no doubt that Leonardo da Vinci, and Correggio, are the two painters, in modern times, who have carried historical expression to the highest ideal perfection; and yet it is equally certain that their heads are carefully copied from faces and expressions in nature. Leonardo excelled principally in his women and children. We find, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> heads, a peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARM\">charm</a> of expression; a character of natural sweetness and tender playfulness, mixed up with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a> of conscious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTELLECT\">intellect</a>, and the graceful reserve of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> dignity. He blends purity with voluptuousness; and the expression of his women is equally characteristic of \"the mistress or the saint.\" His pictures are worked up to the height of the idea he had conceived, with an elaborate felicity; but this idea was evidently first suggested, and afterwards religiously compared with nature. This was his excellence. His fault is, that his style of execution is\ntoo mathematical; that is, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a> does not follow the graceful variety of the details of objects, but substitutes certain refined gradations, both of form and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, producing equal changes in equal distances, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> uniformity. Leonardo was a man of profound learning as well as genius, and perhaps transferred too much of the formality of science to his favourite art.\n\nThe masterpieces of Correggio have the same identity with nature, the same stamp of truth. He has indeed given to his pictures the utmost softness and refinement of outline and expression; but this idea, at which he constantly aimed, is filled up with all the details and varieties which such heads would have in nature. So far from any thing like a naked abstract idea, or middle form, the individuality of his faces has something peculiar in it, even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a> the grotesque. He has endeavoured to impress habitually on the countenance, those undulating outlines which rapture or tenderness leave there, and has chosen for this purpose those forms and proportions which most obviously assisted his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>.\n\nAs to the colouring of Correggio, it is nature itself. Not only the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TONE\">tone</a> is perfectly true, but every speck and particle is varied in colour, in relief, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEXTURE\">texture</a>, with a care, a felicity, and an effect, which is almost magical. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> and shade are equally admirable. No one else, perhaps, ever gave the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a> and roundness to his compositions. So true are his shadows,\u2014equally free from coldness, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPACITY\">opacity</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSE\">false</a> glare;\u2014so clear, so broken, so airy, and yet so deep, that if you hold your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> so as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHADOW\">shadow</a> on any part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> which is in the light, this part, so shaded, will present exactly the same appearance which the painter has given to the shadowed part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a>. Correggio, indeed, possessed a greater variety of excellences in the different departments of his art, than any other painter; and yet it is remarkable, that the impression which his pictures leave upon the mind of the common spectator, is monotonous and comparatively feeble. His style is in some degree mannered and confined. For instance, he is without the force, passion, and grandeur of Raphael, who, however, possessed his softness of expression, but of expression only; and in colour, in light and shade, and other qualities, was quite inferior to Correggio. We may, perhaps, solve this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a> by saying, that he applied the power of his mind to a greater variety of objects than others; but that this power was still of the same character; consisting in a certain exquisite sense of the harmonious, the soft and graceful in form, colour, and sentiment, but with a deficiency of strength, and a tendency to effeminacy in all these.\n\nAfter the names of Raphael and Correggio, we shall mention that of Guido, whose female faces are exceedingly beautiful and ideal, but altogether commonplace and vapid, compared with those of Raphael or Correggio; and they are so, for no other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> but that the general idea they convey is not enriched and strengthened by an intense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a> of nature. For the same reason, we can conceive nothing more unlike the antique than the figures of Nicholas Poussin, except as to the preservation of the costume; and it is perhaps chiefly owing to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of studying his art at second-hand, or by means of scientific rules, that the great merits of that able painter, whose understanding and genius are unquestionable, are confined to his choice of subjects for his pictures, and his manner of telling the story. His landscapes, which he probably took from nature, are superior as paintings to his historical pieces. The faces of Poussin want natural expression, as his figures want grace; but the back-grounds of his historical compositions can scarcely be surpassed. In his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAGUE\">plague</a> of Athens, the very buildings seem stiff with horror. His giants, seated on the top of their fabled mountains, and playing on their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAN\">Pan</a>'s pipes, are as familiar and natural as if they were the ordinary inhabitants of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a>. The finest of his landscapes is his picture of the Deluge. The sun is just seen wan and drooping in his course. The sky is bowed down with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of waters, and Heaven and earth seem mingling together.\n\nTitian is at the head of the Venetian school. He is the first of all colourists. In delicacy and purity Correggio is equal to him, but his colouring has not the same warmth and gusto in it. Titian's flesh-colour partakes of the glowing nature of the climate, and of the luxuriousness of the manners of his country. He represents objects not through a merely lucid medium, but as if tinged with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> light. Yet it is wonderful in how low a tone of local colouring his pictures are painted,\u2014how rigidly his means are husbanded. His most gorgeous effects are produced, not less by keeping down, than by heightening his colours; the fineness of his gradations adds to their variety and force; and, with him, truth is the same thing as splendour. Every thing is done by the severity of his eye, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a> of his touch. He is enabled to keep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PACE\">pace</a> with nature, by never hurrying on before her; and as he forms the broadest masses out of innumerable varying parts and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> strokes of the pencil, so he unites and harmonises the strongest contrasts by the most imperceptible transitions. Every distinction is relieved and broken by some other intermediate distinction, like half notes in music; and yet all this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCUMULATION\">accumulation</a> of endless variety is so managed, as only to produce the majestic simplicity of nature; so that to a common eye there is nothing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> in his pictures, any more than in nature itself. It is, we believe, owing to what has been here stated, that Titian is, of all painters, at once the easiest and the most difficult to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COPY\">copy</a>. He is the most difficult to copy perfectly, for the artifice of his colouring and execution is hid in its apparent simplicity; and yet the knowledge of nature, and the arrangement of the forms and masses in his pictures, is so masterly, that any copy made from them, even the rudest outline or sketch, can hardly fail to have a look of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> art. Because he was the greatest colourist in the world, this, which was his most prominent, has, for shortness, been considered as his only excellence; and he has been said to have been ignorant of drawing. What he was, generally speaking, deficient in, was invention or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>, though even this appears to have been more from habit than want of power; but his drawing of actual forms, where they were not to be put into momentary action, or adapted to a particular expression, was as\nHis drawing of the forms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INANIMATE\">inanimate</a> objects is unrivalled. His trees have a marked character and physiognomy of their own, and exhibit an appearance of strength or flexibility, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOLIDITY\">solidity</a> or lightness, as if they were endowed with conscious power and purposes. Character was another excellence which Titian possessed in the highest degree. It is scarcely speaking too highly of his portraits to say, that they have as much expression, that is, convey as fine an idea of intellect and feeling, as the historical heads of Raphael. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> difference appears to be, that the expression in Raphael is more imaginary and contemplative, and in Titian more personal and constitutional. The heads of the one seem thinking more of some event or subject, those of the other to be thinking more of themselves. In the portraits of Titian, as might be expected, the Italian character always predominates; there is a look of piercing sagacity, of commanding intellect, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACUTE\">acute</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a>, which it would be in vain to seek for in any other portraits. The daring spirit and irritable passions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> and country, are distinctly stamped upon their countenances, and can be as little mistaken as the costume which they wear. The portraits of Raphael, though full of profound thought and feeling, have more of common humanity about them. Titian's portraits are the most historical that ever were painted; and they are so, for this reason, that they have most consistency of form and expression. His portraits of Hippolito de Medici, and of a young Neapolitan nobleman, lately in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GALLERY\">gallery</a> of the Louvre, are a striking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTRAST\">contrast</a> in this respect. All the lines of the face in the one, the eye-brows, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOSE\">nose</a>, the corners of the mouth, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-CONTOUR\">contour</a> of the face, present the same sharp <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a>, the same acute, edgy, contracted, violent expression. The other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PORTRAIT\">portrait</a> has the finest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPANSION\">expansion</a> of feature and outline, and conveys the most exquisite idea possible, of mild, thoughtful sentiment. The consistency of the expression constitutes as great a charm in Titian's portraits, as the harmony of the colouring. The similarity sometimes objected to his heads, is partly national, and partly arises from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a> of persons whom he painted. He painted only Italians; and in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> it rarely happened, that any but persons of the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>, Senators, or Cardinals, sat for their pictures. The similarity of costume of the dress, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEARD\">beard</a>, &c., also adds to the similarity of their appearance. It adds, at the same time, to their picturesque effect; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> in this respect, is one circumstance among others that has been injurious, not to say fatal, to modern art. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> is not confined to portrait; for the hired dresses with which our historical painters clothe their figures, sit no more easily on the imagination of the artist, than they do gracefully on the lay-figures over which they are thrown.\n\nGiorgioni, Paul Veronese, Tintoret, and the Bassans, are the remaining great names of the Venetian school. The excellence of all of them consisted in the bold, masterly, and striking imitation of nature. Their want of ideal form, and elevated character, is, indeed, a constant subject of reproach against them. Giorgioni takes the first place among them; for he was in some measure the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of Titian, whereas the others were only his disciples. The Carraccis, Domenichino, and the rest of the Bolognese school, formed themselves on a principle of combining the excellences of the Roman and Venetian painters, in which they for a while succeeded to a considerable degree; but they degenerated and dwindled away into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> insignificance, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> as they departed from nature, or the great masters who had copied her, to mould their works on academic rules, and the phantoms of abstract perfection.\n\nRubens is the Prince of the Flemish painters. Of Flemish and Dutch Painters, he is perhaps the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a>,\u2014the one who painted most from his own imagination,\u2014and, what was almost the inevitable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, the most of a mannerist. He had neither the Greek forms to study from, nor the Roman expression, nor the high character, picturesque costume, and sun-burnt hues which the Venetian painters had immediately before them. He took, however, what circumstances presented to him,\u2014a fresher and more blooming tone of complexion, arising from moister air, and a colder climate. To this he added the congenial splendour of reflected lights and shadows cast from rich drapery; and he made what amends he could for the want of expression, by the richness of his compositions, and the fantastic variety of his allegorical groups. Both his colouring and his drawing were, however, ideal exaggerations. But both had particular qualities of the highest value. He has given to his flesh greater transparency and freshness, than any other painter; and this excellence he had from nature. One of the finest instances will be found in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEASANT\">Peasant</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">Family</a> going to Market, in which the figures have all the bloom of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> upon their countenances; and the very air of the surrounding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANDSCAPE\">landscape</a> strikes sharp and wholesome on the sense. Rubens had another excellence; he has given all that relates to the expression of motion in his allegorical figures, in his children, his animals, even in his trees, to a degree which no one else has equalled, or indeed approached. His drawing is often deficient in proportion, in knowledge, and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEGANCE\">elegance</a>, but it is always picturesque. The drawing of N. Poussin, on the contrary, which has been much cried up, is merely learned and anatomical: he has a knowledge of the structure and measurements of the human body, but very little feeling of the grand, or beautiful, or striking, in form. All Rubens's forms have ease, freedom, and excessive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTICITY\">elasticity</a>. In the grotesque style of history,\u2014as in the groups of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SATYRS\">satyrs</a>, nymphs, bacchanals, and animals, where striking contrasts of form are combined with every kind of rapid and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> movement, he has not a rival. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WITNESS\">Witness</a> his Silenus at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLENHEIM\">Blenheim</a>, where the lines seem drunk and staggering; and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROCESSION\">procession</a> of Cupids riding on animals at Whitehall, with that adventurous leader of the infantine crew, who, with a spear, is urging a lion, on which he is mounted, over the edge of the world; for beyond we only see a precipice of clouds and sky. Rubens's power of expressing motion perhaps arose from the facility of his pencil, and his habitually trusting a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> and imagination in his compositions; for this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> can be given in no other way. His portraits are the least\nvaluable productions of his pencil. His landscapes are often delightful, and appear like the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAIRY\">fairy</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>.\n\nIt remains to speak of Vandyke and Rembrandt, the one the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a> of Rubens, the other the entire founder of his own school. It is not possible for two painters to be more opposite. The characteristic merits of the former are very happily summed up in a single line of a poetical critic, where he speaks of\n\n\"The soft precision of the clear Vandyke.\"\n\nThe general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a> of the works of the great masters, has been to show, that their pre-eminence has constantly depended, not on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a> of a fantastic, abstract excellence, existing nowhere but in their own minds, but in their selecting and embodying some one view of nature, which came immediately under their habitual observation, and which their particular genius led them to study and imitate with success. This is certainly the case with Vandyke. His portraits, mostly of English women, in the collection in the Louvre, have a cool refreshing air about them, a look of simplicity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a> even in the very tone, which forms a fine contrast to the voluptuous glow and mellow golden lustre of Titian's Italian women. There is a quality of flesh-colour in Vandyke which is to be found in no other painter, and which exactly conveys the idea of the soft, smooth, sliding, continuous, delicately varied surface of the skin. The objects in his pictures have the least possible difference of light and shade, and are presented to the eye without passing through any indirect medium. It is this extreme purity and silvery clearness of tone, together with the facility and precision of his particular forms, and a certain air of fashionable elegance, characteristic of the age in which he flourished, that places Vandyke in the first rank of portrait painters.\n\nIf ever there was a man of genius in the art, it was Rembrandt. He might be said to have created a medium of his own, through which he saw all objects. He was the grossest and the least vulgar, that is to say, the least common-place in his grossness, of all men. He was the most downright, the least fastidious of the imitators of nature. He took any object, he cared not what, how <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> soever in form, colour, and expression, and from the light and shade which he threw upon it, it came out gorgeous from his hands. As Vandyke made use of the smallest contrasts of light and shade, and painted as if in the open air, Rembrandt used the most violent and abrupt contrasts in this respect, and painted his objects as if in a dungeon. His pictures may be said to be \"bright with excessive darkness.\" His vision had acquired a lynx-eyed sharpness from the artificial obscurity to which he had accustomed himself. \"Mystery and silence hung upon his pencil.\" Yet he could pass rapidly from one extreme to another, and dip his colours with equal success in the gloom of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>, or in the blaze of the noon-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> sun. In surrounding different objects with a medium of imagination, solemn or dazzling, he was a true poet; in all the rest, he was a mere painter, but a painter of no common stamp. The powers of his hand were equal to those of his eye; and indeed he could not have attempted the subjects he did, without an execution as masterly as his knowledge was profound. His colours are sometimes dropped in lumps on the canvas; at other times they are laid on as smooth as glass; and he not unfrequently painted with the handle of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRUSH\">brush</a>. He had an eye for all objects as far as he had seen them. His history and landscapes are equally fine in their way. His landscapes we could look at for ever, though there is nothing in them. But \"they are of the earth, earthly.\" It seems as if he had dug them out of nature. Everything is so true, so real, so full of all the feelings and associations which the eye can suggest to the other senses, that we immediately take as strong an affection to them, as if they were our home\u2014the very place where we were brought up. No <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> of time could add to the intensity of the impression they convey. Rembrandt is the least classical and the most romantic of all painters. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JACOB\">Jacob</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LADDER\">Ladder</a> is more like a dream than any other picture that ever was painted. The figure of Jacob himself is thrown in one corner of the picture like a bundle of clothes, while the angels hover above the darkness, in the shape of airy wings.\n\nIt would be needless to prove that the generality of the Dutch painters copied from actual objects. They have become almost a bye-word for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> this principle into its abuse, by copying every thing they saw, and having no choice or preference of one thing to another, unless that they preferred that which was most obvious and common. We forgive them. They perhaps did better in faithfully and skilfully imitating what they had seen, than in imagining what they had not seen. Their pictures at least show, that there is nothing in nature, however mean or trivial, that has not its beauty\u2014and some interest belonging to it, if truly represented. We prefer Vangoyen's views on the borders of a canal, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a>-tufted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a>, and passing sail, or Ruysdael's woods and sparkling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> falls, to the most classical or epic compositions which they could have invented out of nothing; and we think that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TENIERS\">Teniers</a>'s boors, old women, and children, are very superior to the little carved <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IVORY\">ivory</a> Venuses in the pictures of Vandermeer; just as we think Hogarth's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">Marriage</a> \u00e0 la Mode is better than his Sigismunda, or as Mr Wilkie's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARD\">Card</a>-Players is better than his Alfred. We should not assuredly prefer a Dutch Fair by Teniers to a Cartoon by Raphael; but we suspect we should prefer a Dutch Fair by Teniers to a Cartoon by the same master; or we should prefer truth and nature in the simplest dress, to affectation and insanity in the most pompous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISGUISE\">disguise</a>. Whatever is genuine in art, must proceed from the impulse of nature and individual genius.\n\nIn the French school there are but two names of high and established reputation, N. Poussin and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLAUDE\">Claude</a> Lorraine. Of the former we have already spoken: of the latter we shall give our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> when we come to speak of our own Wilson. We ought not to pass over the names of Murillo and Velasquez, those admirable Spanish painters. It is difficult to characterize their peculiar excellences as distinct from those of the Italian and Dutch schools. They may be said to hold a middle rank between\nFine Arts, the painters of mind and body. They express not so much thought and sentiment, nor yet the mere exterior, as the life and spirit of the man. Murillo is probably at the head of that class of painters who have treated subjects of common life. After making the colours on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CANVASS\">canvass</a> feel and think, the next best thing is to make them breathe and live. But there is in Murillo's pictures of this kind a look of real life, a cordial flow of native animal spirits, which we find nowhere else. We might here refer particularly to his picture of the Two Spanish Beggars boys in the collection at Dulwich <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">College</a>, which cannot easily be forgotten by those who have ever seen it.\n\nWe come now to speak of the progress of art in our own Country,\u2014of its present state,\u2014and the means proposed for advancing it to still higher perfection.\n\nWe shall speak first of Hogarth, both as he is the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> in the order of time that we have to boast of, and as he is the greatest comic painter of any age or country. His pictures are not imitations of still life, or mere transcripts of incidental scenes or customs; but powerful moral satires, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> vice and folly in their most ludicrous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of view, and with a profound insight into the weak sides of character and manners, in all their tendencies, combinations, and contrasts. There is not a single picture of his, containing a representation of merely natural or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> scenery. His object is not so much \"to hold the mirror up to nature,\" as \"to show vice her own feature, scorn her own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGE\">image</a>.\" Folly is there seen at the height\u2014the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">moon</a> is at the full\u2014it is the very error of the time. There is a perpetual collision of eccentricities, a tilt and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOURNAMENT\">tournament</a> of absurdities, pampered into all sorts of affectation, airy, extravagant, and ostentatious! Yet he is as little a caricaturist as he is a painter of still life. Criticism has not done him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, though public opinion has. His works have received a sanction which it would be vain to dispute, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> delight and admiration with which they have been regarded, from their first appearance, to the present moment. If the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of amusement, or of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> for reflection which they have afforded, is that by which we are to judge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRECEDENCE\">precedence</a> among the intellectual benefactors of mankind, there are perhaps few persons who can put in a stronger claim to our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> than Hogarth. The wonderful knowledge which he possessed of human life and manners, is only to be surpassed (if it can be) by the powers of invention with which he has arranged his materials, and by the mastery of execution with which he has embodied and made tangible the very thoughts and passing movements of the mind. Some persons object to the style of Hogarth's pictures, or the class to which they belong. First, Hogarth belongs to no class, or, if he belongs to any, it is to the same class as Fielding, Smollett, Vanbrugh, and Moli\u00e8re. Besides, the merit of his pictures does not depend on the nature of his subjects, but on the knowledge <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> of them, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a>, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUND\">fund</a> of observation and amusement contained in them. Make what deductions you please for the vulgarity of the subjects\u2014yet in the research, the profundity, the absolute truth and precision of the delineation of character,\u2014in the invention of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INCIDENT\">incident</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-WIT\">wit</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a>, in life and motion, in everlasting variety and originality,\u2014they never have, and probably never will be surpassed. They stimulate the faculties, as well as amuse them. \"Other pictures we see, Hogarth's we read!\"\n\nThere is one error which has been frequently entertained on this subject, and which we wish to correct, namely, that Hogarth's genius was confined to the imitation of the coarse humours and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARCE\">farce</a> of the lowest life. But he excelled quite as much in exhibiting the vices, the folly, and frivolity of the fashionable manners of his time. His fine ladies do not yield the palm of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIDICULE\">ridicule</a> to his waiting-maids, and his lords and his porters are on a very respectable footing of equality. He is quite at home, either in St Giles's or St James's. There is no want, for example, in his Marriage \u00e0 la Mode, or his Taste in High Life, of affectation verging into idiocy, or of languid sensibility that might\n\n\"Die of a rose in aromatic pain.\"\n\nMany of Hogarth's characters would form admirable illustrations of Pope's Satires, who was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">contemporary</a> with him. In short, Hogarth was a painter of real, not of low life. He was, as we have said, a satirist, and consequently his pencil did not dwell on the grand and beautiful, but it glanced with equal success at the absurdities and peculiarities of high or low life, \"of the great vulgar and the small.\"\n\nTo this it must be added, that he was as great a master of passion as of humour. He succeeded in low <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRAGEDY\">tragedy</a>, as much as in low or genteel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMEDY\">comedy</a>, and had an absolute power in moving the affections and rending the hearts of the spectators, by depicting the effects of the most dreadful calamities of human life, on common minds and common countenances. Of this, the Rake's Progress, particularly the Bedlam scene, and many others, are unanswerable proofs. Hogarth's merits, as a mere artist, are not confined to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINTS\">prints</a>. In general, indeed, this is the case. But when he chose to take pains, he could add the delicacies of execution and colouring in the highest degree to those of character and composition; as is evident in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of pictures, all equally well painted, of the Marriage \u00e0 la Mode, exhibited lately at the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">Institution</a>.\n\nWe shall next speak of Wilson, whose pictures may be divided into three classes:\u2014his Italian landscapes, or imitations of the manner of Claude,\u2014his copies of English scenery,\u2014and his historical compositions. The first of these are, in our opinion, by much the best; and we appeal, in support of this opinion, to the Apollo and the Seasons, and to the Phaeton. The figures are of course out of the question (these being as uncouth and slovenly as Claude's are insipid and finical); but the landscape,\n\nSee an admirable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> on the genius of Hogarth, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol6.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> Lamb, in a periodical work called The Reflector.\nFine Arts in both pictures, is delightful. In looking at them, we breathe the air which the scene inspires, and feel the genius of the place present to us. In the first, there is the cool freshness of a misty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>; the sky, the water, the dim <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZON\">horizon</a>, all convey the same feeling. The fine grey tone, and varying outline of the hills; the graceful form of the retiring lake, broken still more by the hazy shadows of the objects that repose on its bosom; the light trees that expand their branches in the air; and the dark <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> figure and mouldering temple, that contrast strongly with the broad clear light of the rising day,\u2014give a charm, a truth, a force and harmony to this composition, which produce the greater pleasure the longer it is dwelt on. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a> of light and shade resembles the effect of light on a globe. The Ph\u00e6ton has the dazzling fervid appearance of an autumnal evening; the golden radiance streams in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> masses from behind the flickering clouds; every object is baked in the sun,\u2014the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> fore-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>, the thick foliage of the trees, the streams, shrunk and stealing along behind the dark high banks,\u2014combine to produce that richness, and characteristic unity of effect, which is to be found only in nature, or in art derived from the study and imitation of nature. These two pictures, as they have the greatest general effect, are also more carefully finished than any other pictures we have seen of his.\n\nIn general, Wilson's views of English scenery want almost everything that ought to recommend them. The subjects he has chosen are not well fitted for the landscape-painter, and there is nothing in the execution to redeem them. Ill-shaped mountains, or great heaps of earth, trees that grow against them without character or elegance, motionless waterfalls, a want of relief, of transparency and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a>, without the imposing grandeur of real <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a> (which it is scarcely within the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of art to give),\u2014are the chief features and defects of this class of his pictures. In more confined scenes, the effect must depend almost entirely on the difference in the execution and the details; for the difference of colour alone is not sufficient to give relief to objects placed at a small distance from the eye. But, in Wilson, there are commonly no details,\u2014all is loose and general; and this very circumstance, which might assist him in giving the massy contrasts of light and shade, deprived his pencil of all force and precision within a limited space. In general, air is necessary to the landscape-painter; and, for this reason, the lakes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUMBERLAND\">Cumberland</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-WESTMORELAND\">Westmoreland</a> afford few subjects for landscape-painting. However stupendous the scenery of that country is, and however powerful and lasting the impression which it must always make on the imagination, yet the effect is not produced merely through the medium of the eye, but arises chiefly from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLATERAL\">collateral</a> and associated feelings. There is the knowledge of the physical magnitude of the objects in the midst of which we are placed,\u2014the slow, improgressive motion, which we make in traversing them;\u2014there is the abrupt precipice, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TORRENT\">torrent</a>'s roar, the boundless expanse of the prospect from the highest mountains,\u2014the difficulty of their ascent, their loneliness and silence; in short, there is a constant sense and superstitious awe of the collective power of matter, of the gigantic and eternal forms of nature, on which, from the beginning of time, the hand of man has made no impression, and which, by the lofty reflections they excite in us, give a sort of intellectual sublimity even to our sense of physical weakness. But there is little in all these circumstances that can be translated into the picturesque, which makes its appeal immediately to the eye.\n\nWilson's historical landscapes, his Niobe, Celadon and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMELIA\">Amelia</a>, &c. do not, in our estimation, display either true taste or fine imagination, but are affected and violent exaggerations of clumsy common nature. They are made up mechanically of the same stock of materials,\u2014an over-hanging rock, bare shattered trees, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> rolling clouds, and forked <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a>. The figures, in the most celebrated of these, are not like the children of Niobe, punished by the Gods, but like a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUP\">group</a> of rustics, crouching from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIL\">hail</a>-storm. We agree with Sir Joshua Reynolds, that Wilson's mind was not, like N. Poussin's, sufficiently imbued with the knowledge of antiquity to transport the imagination three thousand years back, to give natural objects a sympathy with preternatural events, and to inform rocks, and trees, and mountains, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a> of a God. To sum up his general character, we may observe, that, besides his excellence in aerial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSPECTIVE\">perspective</a>, Wilson had great truth, harmony, and depth of local colouring. He had a fine feeling of the proportions and conduct of light and shade, and also an eye for graceful form, as far as regards the bold and varying outlines of indefinite objects; as may be seen in his foregrounds, &c. where the artist is not tied down to an imitation of characteristic and articulate forms. In his figures, trees, cattle, and in everything having a determinate and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> form, his pencil was not only deficient in accuracy of outline, but even in perspective and actual relief. His trees, in particular, frequently seem pasted on the canvass, like botanical specimens. In fine, we cannot subscribe to the opinion of those who assert, that Wilson was superior to Claude as a man of genius; nor can we discern any other grounds for this opinion, than what would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> to the general conclusion,\u2014that the more slovenly the performance the finer the picture, and that that which is imperfect is superior to that which is perfect. It might be said, on the same principle, that the coarsest sign-painting is better than the reflection of a landscape in a mirror; and the objection that is sometimes made to the mere imitation of nature, cannot be made to the landscapes of Claude, for in them the Graces themselves have, with their own hands, assisted in selecting and disposing every object. Is the general effect in his pictures injured by the details? Is the truth inconsistent with the beauty of the imitation? Does the perpetual profusion of objects and scenery, all perfect in themselves, interfere with the simple grandeur and comprehensive magnificence of the whole? Does the precision with which a plant is marked in the foreground, take away from the air-drawn distinctions of the blue glimmering horizon? Is there any want of that endless airy space, where the eye wanders at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> under the open sky, explores distant objects, and returns back as from a de-\nThere is no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> between Claude and Wilson. Sir Joshua Reynolds used to say, that there would be another Raphael before there would be another Claude. His landscapes have all that is exquisite and refined in art and nature. Everything is moulded into grace and harmony; and, at the touch of his pencil, shepherds with their flocks, temples and groves, and winding glades, and scattered hamlets, rise up in never-ending succession, under the azure sky and the resplendent sun, while \"universal Pan,\n\n\"Knit with the Graces, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a> in dance,\nLeads on the eternal spring.\"\n\nMichael Angelo has left, in one of his sonnets, a fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOSTROPHE\">apostrophe</a> to the earliest poet of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>:\n\n\"Fain would I, to be what our Dante was,\nForego the happiest fortunes of mankind.\"\n\nWhat landscape-painter does not feel this of Claude? We have heard an anecdote connected with the reputation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAINSBOROUGH\">Gainsborough</a>'s pictures, which rests on pretty good authority. Sir Joshua Reynolds, at one of the Academy dinners, speaking of Gainsborough, said to a friend,\u2014\u201cHe is undoubtedly the best English landscape-painter.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Wilson, who overheard the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVERSATION\">conversation</a>, \u201che is not the best landscape-painter, but he is the best portrait painter in England.\u201d They were both wrong; but the story is creditable to the versatility of Gainsborough's talents.\n\nThose of his portraits which we have seen are not in the first rank. They are in a good measure imitations of Van Dyke; and have more an air of gentility than of nature. His landscapes are of two classes or periods; his early and his later pictures. The former are minute imitations of nature, or of painters who imitated nature, such as Ruysdael, &c., some of which have great truth and clearness. His later pictures are flimsy caricatures of Rubens, who himself carried inattention to the details to the utmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIMIT\">limit</a> that it would bear. Many of Gainsborough's latter landscapes may be compared to bad water-colour drawings, washed in by mechanical movements of the hand, without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> with the eye. The truth seems to be, that Gainsborough found there was something wanting in his early manner, that is, something beyond the literal imitation of the details of natural objects; and he appears to have concluded rather hastily, that the way to arrive at that something more, was to discard truth and nature altogether. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> rests principally, at present, on his fancy-pieces, cottage-children, shepherd-boys, &c. These have often great truth, great sweetness, and the subjects are often chosen with great felicity. We too often find, however, Fine Arts, even in his happiest efforts, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSCIOUSNESS\">consciousness</a> in the turn of the limbs, and a pensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUOR\">languor</a> in the expression, which is not taken from nature. We think the gloss of art is never so ill bestowed as on such subjects, the essence of which is simplicity. It is perhaps the general fault of Gainsborough, that he presents us with an ideal common life, of which we have had a surfeit in poetry and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-ROMANCE\">romance</a>. His subjects are softened, and sentimentalised too much; it is not simple unaffected nature that we see, but nature sitting for her picture. Our artist, we suspect, led the way to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASQUERADE\">masquerade</a> style, which piques itself on giving the air of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADONIS\">Adonis</a> to the driver of a hay-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol4.html#article-CART\">cart</a>, and models the features of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>-maid on the principles of the antique. His Woodman's Head is admirable. Nor can too much praise be given to his Shepherd Boy in a Storm; in which the unconscious simplicity of the boy's expression, looking up with his hands folded and with timid wonder,\u2014the noisy chattering of a magpie perched above,\u2014and the rustling of the coming storm in the branches of the trees, produce a most delightful and romantic impression on the mind.\n\nGainsborough was to be considered, perhaps, rather as a man of delicate taste, and of an elegant and feeling mind, than as a man of genius; as a lover of the art, rather than an artist. He devoted himself to it, with a view to amuse and soothe his mind, with the ease of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol10.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>, not with the severity of a professional student. He wished to make his pictures, like himself, amiable; but a too constant desire to please almost unavoidably leads to affectation and effeminacy. He wanted that vigour of intellect, which perceives the beauty of truth; and thought that painting was to be gained, like other mistresses, by flattery and smiles. It was an error which we are disposed to forgive in one, around whose memory, both as an artist and a man, many fond recollections, many vain regrets, must always linger.\n\nThe authority of Sir Joshua Reynolds, both from Sir Joshua's example and instructions, has had, and still continues to have, a considerable influence on the state of art in this country. That influence has been on the whole unquestionably beneficial in itself, as well as highly creditable to the rare talents and elegant mind of Sir Joshua; for it has raised the art of painting from the lowest state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEGRADATION\">degradation</a>,\u2014of dry, meagre, lifeless <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INANITY\">inanity</a>, to something at least respectable, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> to the rough strength and bold spirit of the national character. Whether the same implicit deference to his authority, which has helped to advance the art thus far, may not, among other causes, limit and retard its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> progress? Whether there are not certain ori-\n\n---\n\n* This painter's book of studies from nature, commonly called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIBER\">Liber</a> Veritatis, disproves the truth of the general opinion that his landscapes are mere artificial compositions, for the finished pictures are nearly facsimiles of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> sketches.\n\n\u2020 The idea of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of improving upon nature, and giving what was called a flattering likeness, was universal in this country fifty years ago; so that Gainsborough is not to be so much blamed for tampering with his subjects.\nginal errors, both in his principles and practice, which, the farther they are proceeded in, the farther they will lead us from the truth? Whether there is not a systematic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BIAS\">bias</a> from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> line by which alone we can arrive at the goal of the highest perfection?\u2014are questions well worth considering.\n\nWe shall begin with Sir Joshua's merits as an artist. There is one error which we wish to correct at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SETTING\">setting</a> out, because we think it important. There is not a greater or more unaccountable mistake than the supposition that Sir Joshua Reynolds owed his success or excellence in his profession, to his having been the first who introduced into this country more general principles of the art, and who raised portrait to the dignity of history from the low drudgery of copying the peculiarities, meannesses, and details of individual nature, which was all that had been attempted by his immediate predecessors. This is so far from being true, that the very reverse is the fact. If Sir Joshua did not give these details and peculiarities so much as might be wished, those who went before him did not give them at all. Those pretended general principles of the art, which, it is said, \"alone give value and dignity to it,\" had been pushed to their extremest absurdity before his time; and it was in getting rid of the mechanical systematic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONOTONY\">monotony</a> and middle forms, by the help of which Lely, Kneller, Hudson, the French painters, and others, carried on their manufactories of history and face-painting, and in returning (as far as he did return) to the truth and force of individual nature, that the secret both of his fame and fortune lay. The pedantic, servile race of artists, whom Reynolds superseded, had carried the abstract principle of improving on nature to such a degree of refinement, that they left it out altogether; and confounded all the varieties and irregularities of form, feature, character, expression or attitude, in the same artificial mould of fancied grace and fashionable insipidity. The portraits of Kneller, for example, seem all to have been turned in a machine; the eye-brows are arched as if by a compass; the mouth curled, and the chin dimpled, the head turned on one side, and the hands placed in the same affected position. The portraits of this mannerist, therefore, are as like one another as the dresses which were then in fashion; and have the same \"dignity and value\" as the full-bottomed wigs which graced their originals. The superiority of Reynolds consisted in his being varied and natural, instead of being artificial and uniform. The spirit, grace, or dignity which he added to his portraits, he borrowed from nature, and not from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMBIGUOUS\">ambiguous</a> quackery of rules. His feeling of truth and nature was too strong to permit him to adopt the unmeaning style of Kneller and Hudson; but his logical acuteness was not such as to enable him to detect the verbal fallacies and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a> absurdities which he had learned from Richardson and Copley; and, from some defects in his own practice, he was led to confound negligence with grandeur. But of this hereafter.\n\nSir Joshua Reynolds owed his vast superiority over his contemporaries to incessant practice, and habitual attention to nature, to quick organic sensibility, to considerable power of observation, and still greater taste in perceiving and availing himself of those excellences of others, which lay within his own walk of art. We can by no means look upon Sir Joshua as having a claim to the first rank of genius. He would hardly have been a great painter, if other greater painters had not lived before him. He would not have given a first impulse to the art, nor did he advance any part of it beyond the point where he found it. He did not present any new view of nature, nor is he to be placed in the same class with those who did. Even in colour, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PALLET\">pallet</a> was spread for him by the old Masters, and his eye imbibed its full perception of depth and harmony of tone, from the Dutch and Venetian schools, rather than from nature. His early pictures are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> and flimsy. He indeed learned to see the inner qualities of nature through the works of art, which he, perhaps, might never have discovered in nature itself. He became rich by the accumulation of borrowed wealth, and his genius was the offspring of taste. He combined and applied the materials of others to his own purpose, with admirable success; he was an industrious compiler, or skilful translator, not an original inventor in art. The art would remain, in all its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> elements, just where it is, if Sir Joshua had never lived. He has supplied the industry of future plagiarists with no new materials. But it has been well observed, that the value of every work of art, as well as the genius of the artist, depends, not more on the degree of excellence, than on the degree of originality displayed in it. Sir Joshua, however, was perhaps the most original imitator that ever appeared in the world: and the reason of this, in a great measure, was, that he was compelled to combine what he saw in art, with what he saw in nature, which was constantly before him. The portrait-painter is, in this respect, much less liable than the historical painter, to deviate into the extremes of manner and affectation; for he cannot discard nature altogether, under the excuse that she only puts him out. He must meet her, face to face; and if he is not incorrigible, he will see something there that cannot fail to be of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> to him. Another circumstance which must have been favourable to Sir Joshua was, that though not the originator in point of time, he was the first Englishman who transplanted the higher excellences of his profession into his own country, and had the merit, if not of an inventor, of a reformer of the art. His mode of painting had the graces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a> in the age and country in which he lived; and he had, therefore, all the stimulus to exertion, which arose from the enthusiastic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLAUSE\">applause</a> of his contemporaries, and from a desire to expand and refine the taste of the public.\n\nTo an eye for colour and for effects of light and shade, Sir Joshua united a strong perception of individual character,\u2014a lively feeling of the quaint and grotesque in expression, and great mastery of execution. He had comparatively little knowledge of drawing, either as it regarded proportion or form. The beauty of some of his female faces and figures arises almost entirely from their softness and fleshiness. His pencil wanted firmness and precision. The expression, even of his best portraits, seldom implies either lofty or impassioned intellect or deli-\ncate sensibility. He also wanted grace, if grace requires simplicity. The mere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGATION\">negation</a> of stiffness and formality is not grace; for looseness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTORTION\">distortion</a> are not grace. His favourite attitudes are not easy and natural, but the affectation of ease and nature. They are violent deviations from a right line. Many of the figures in his fancy-pieces are placed in postures in which they could not remain for an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INSTANT\">instant</a> without extreme difficulty and awkwardness. We might instance the Girl drawing with a pencil, and some others. His portraits are his best pictures, and of these his portraits of men are the best; his pictures of children are the next in value. He had fine subjects for the former, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASCULINE\">masculine</a> sense and originality of character of many of the persons whom he painted; and he had also a great advantage (as far as practice went) in painting a number of persons of every rank and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>. Some of the finest and most interesting are those of Dr Johnson, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOLDSMITH\">Goldsmith</a> (which is, however, too much a mere sketch), Baretti, Dr Burney, John Hunter, and the inimitable portrait of Bishop Newton. The elegant simplicity of character, expression, and drawing, preserved throughout the last picture, even to the attitude and mode of handling, discover the true genius of a painter. We also remember to have seen a print of Thomas Warton, than which nothing could be more characteristic or more natural. These were all Reynolds's intimate acquaintances, and it could not be said of them that they were men of \"no mark or likelihood.\" Their traits had probably sunk deep into the artist's mind; he painted them as pure studies from nature, copying the real image existing before him, with all its known characteristic peculiarities; and, with as much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> as good-nature, sacrificing the graces on the altar of friendship. They are downright portraits, and nothing more, and they are valuable in proportion. In his portraits of women, on the contrary (with very few exceptions), Sir Joshua appears to have consulted either the vanity of his employers or his own fanciful theory. They have not the look of individual nature, nor have they, to compensate the want of this, either peculiar elegance of form, refinement of expression, delicacy of complexion, or gracefulness of manner. Vandyke's attitudes have been complained of as stiff and confined. Reynolds, to avoid this defect, has fallen into the contrary extreme of negligence and contortion. His female figures which aim at gentility, are twisted into that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERPENTINE\">serpentine</a> line, the idea of which he ridiculed so much in Hogarth. Indeed Sir Joshua, in his Discourses (see his account of Correggio), speaks of grace as if it were nearly allied to affectation. Grace signifies that which is pleasing and natural in the posture and motions of the human form, as Beauty is more properly applied to the form itself. That which is stiff, inanimate, and without motion, cannot, therefore, be graceful; but, to suppose that a figure, to be graceful, need only be put into some languishing or extravagant posture, is to mistake flutter and affectation for ease and elegance.\n\nSir Joshua's children, as we have said above, are among his chef d'oeuvres. The faces of children have in general that want of precision of outline, that prominence of relief and strong contrast of colour, which were peculiarly adapted to his style of painting. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> simplicity of expression, and the grotesque character which he has given to the heads of his children, were, however, borrowed from Correggio. His Puck is the most masterly of all these; and the colouring, execution, and character, alike exquisite. The single figure of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANT\">Infant</a> Hercules is also admirable. Many of those to which his friends have suggested historical titles are mere common portraits or casual studies. Thus the Infant Samuel is an innocent little child, saying its prayers at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a>'s feet: it has nothing to do with the story of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEBREW\">Hebrew</a> prophet. The same objection will apply to many of his fancy-pieces and historical compositions. There is often no connection between the picture and the subject but the name. Even his celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IPHIGENIA\">Iphigenia</a> (beautiful as she is, and prodigal of her charms) does not answer to the idea of the story. In drawing the naked figure, Sir Joshua's want of truth and firmness of outline, became more apparent; and his mode of laying on his colours, which, in the face and extremities, was relieved and broken by the abrupt inequalities of surface and variety of tints in each part, produced a degree of heaviness and opacity in the larger masses of flesh-colour, which can indeed only be avoided by extreme delicacy, or extreme lightness of execution.\n\nShall we speak the truth at once? In our opinion, Sir Joshua did not possess either that high imagination, or those strong feelings, without which no painter can become a poet in his art. His larger historical compositions have been generally allowed to be most liable to objection, in a critical point of view. We shall not attempt to judge them by scientific or technical rules, but make one or two observations on the character and feeling displayed in them. The highest subject which Sir Joshua has attempted was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> Ugolino, and it was, as might be expected from the circumstances, a total failure. He had, it seems, painted a study of an old beggar-man's head; and some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a>, who must have known as little of painting as of poetry, persuaded the unsuspecting artist, that it was the exact expression of Dante's Count Ugolino, one of the most grand, terrific, and appalling characters in modern fiction. Reynolds, who knew nothing of the matter but what he was told, took his good fortune for granted, and only extended his canvass to admit the rest of the figures. The attitude and expression of Count Ugolino himself, are what the artist intended them to be, till they were pampered into something else by the officious vanity of friends\u2014those of a common mendicant at the corner of a street, waiting patiently for some charitable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DONATION\">donation</a>. The imagination of the painter took refuge in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> work-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, instead of ascending the steps of the Tower of Famine. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERO\">hero</a> of Dante is a lofty, high-minded, and unprincipled Italian nobleman, who had betrayed his country to the enemy, and who, as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> for his crime, is shut up with his four sons in the dungeon of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITADEL\">citadel</a>, where he shortly finds the doors barred against him, and food withheld. He in vain watches with eager feverish eye the opening of the door at the accustomed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>, and his looks turn to\nEven in the other world, he is represented with the same fierce, dauntless, unrelenting character, \"gnawing the skull of his adversary, his fell repast.\" The subject of the Laoco\u00f6n is scarcely equal to that described by Dante. The horror there is physical and momentary; in the other, the imagination fills up the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, obscure, dreary void of despair, and joins its unutterable pangs to the loud cries of nature. What is there in the picture to convey the ghastly horrors of the scene, or the mighty energy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> with which they are borne? His picture of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MACBETH\">Macbeth</a> is full of wild and grotesque images; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> of the witches contains a very elaborate and well arranged inventory of dreadful objects. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARDINAL\">Cardinal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEAUFORT\">Beaufort</a> is a fine display of rich mellow colouring; and there is something gentlemanly and Shakespearian in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">King</a> and the attendant Noblemen. At the same time, we think the expression of the Cardinal himself is too much one of physical horror, a canine gnashing of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>, like a man strangled. This is not the best style of history. Mrs Siddons as the Tragic Muse, is neither the tragic muse nor Mrs Siddons; and we have still stronger objections to Garrick between Tragedy and Comedy.\n\nThere is a striking similarity between Sir Joshua Reynolds's theory and his practice; and as each of these has been appealed to in support of the other, it is necessary that we should examine both. Sir Joshua's practice was generally confined to the illustration of that part of his theory, which relates to the more immediate imitation of nature, and it is to what he says on this subject, that we shall chiefly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> our observations at present.\n\nHe lays it down as a general and invariable rule, that \"the great style in art, and the most perfect imitation of nature, consists in avoiding the details and peculiarities of particular objects.\" This sweeping principle he applies almost indiscriminately to Portrait, History, and Landscape; and he appears to have been led to the conclusion itself, from supposing the imitation of particulars to be inconsistent with general truth and effect. It appears to us, that the highest perfection of the art depends, not on separating but on uniting general truth and effect with individual distinctness and accuracy.\n\nFirst, it is said, that the great style in painting, as it relates to the immediate imitation of external nature, consists in avoiding the details of particular objects. It consists neither in giving nor avoiding them, but in something quite different from both. Any one may avoid the details. So far, there is no difference between the Cartoons, and a common sign-\n\nGreatness consists in giving the larger Fine Arts masses and proportions with truth\u2014this does not prevent giving the smaller ones too. The utmost grandeur of outline, and the broadest masses of light and shade, are perfectly compatible with the utmost minuteness and delicacy of detail, as may be seen in nature. It is not, indeed, common to see both qualities combined in the imitations of nature, any more than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of other excellences; nor are we here saying to which the principal attention of the artist should be directed; but we deny, that, considered in themselves, the absence of the one quality is necessary or sufficient to the production of the other.\n\nIf, for example, the form of the eye-brow is correctly given, it will be perfectly indifferent to the truth or grandeur of the design, whether it consists of one broad mark, or is composed of a number of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>-lines, arranged in the same order. So, if the lights and shades are disposed in fine and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> masses, the breadth of the picture, as it is called, cannot possibly be affected by the filling up of those masses with the details, that is, with the subordinate distinctions which appear in nature. The anatomical details in Michael Angelo, the ever-varying outline of Raphael, the perfect execution of the Greek statues, do not destroy their symmetry or dignity of form; and, in the finest specimens of the composition of colour, we may observe the largest masses combined with the greatest variety in the parts of which those masses are composed.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> style consists in giving no details; the finical in giving nothing else. Nature contains both large and small parts, both masses and details; and the same may be said of the most perfect works of art. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNION\">union</a> of both kinds of excellence, of strength with delicacy, as far as the limits of human capacity, and the shortness of human life would permit, is that which has established the reputation of the most successful imitators of nature. Farther, their most finished works are their best. The predominance, indeed, of either excellence in the best Masters, has varied according to their opinion of the relative value of these qualities,\u2014the labour they had the time or the patience to bestow on their works,\u2014the skill of the artist,\u2014or the nature and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of his subject. But, if the rule here objected to (that the careful imitation of the parts injures the effect of the whole), be once admitted, slovenliness would become another name for genius, and the most unfinished performance be the best. That such has been the confused impression left on the mind by the perusal of Sir Joshua Reynolds's Discourses, is evident from the practice, as well as conversation, of many (even eminent) artists. The late Mr Opie proceeded entirely on this principle. He left many admirable studies of portraits, particularly in what relates to the disposition and effect of light and shade; but he never finished any of the parts, thinking them beneath the attention\n\n---\n\n* Why does not the British Institution, instead of patronising pictures of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> of Waterloo, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> coats, foolish faces, and labels of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VICTORY\">victory</a>, offer a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIZE\">prize</a> for a picture of the subject of Ugolino that shall be equal to the group of the Laoco\u00f6n? That would be the way to do something, if there is any thing to be done by such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRONAGE\">patronage</a>.\nHe went over the whole head the second day as he had done the first, and therefore made no progress. The picture at last, having neither the lightness of a sketch, nor the accuracy of a finished work, looked coarse, laboured, and heavy. Titian is the most perfect example of high finishing. In him the details are engrained on the most profound knowledge of effect, and attention to the character of what he represented. His pictures have the exact look of nature, the very tone and texture of flesh. The variety of his tints is blended into the greatest simplicity. There is a proper degree both of solidity and transparency. All the parts hang together; every stroke tells, and adds to the effect of the rest. Sir Joshua seems to deny that Titian finished much; and says that he produced, by two or three strokes of his pencil, effects which the most laborious copyist would in vain attempt to equal. It is true, he availed himself in some degree of what is called execution, to facilitate his imitation of the details and peculiarities of nature; but it was to facilitate, not to supersede it. There can be nothing more distinct than execution and daubing. Titian, however, made a very moderate, though a very admirable use of this power; and those who copy his pictures will find that the simplicity is in the results, not in the details. To conclude our observations on this head, we will only add, that, while the artist thinks there is anything to be done, either to the whole or to the parts of his picture, which can give it still more the look of nature, if he is willing to proceed, we would not advise him to desist. This rule is the more necessary to the young student, for he will relax in his attention as he grows older. And again, with respect to the subordinate parts of a picture, there is no danger that he will bestow a disproportionate degree of labour upon them, because he will not feel the same interest in copying them, and because a much less degree of accuracy will serve every purpose of deception.\n\nSecondly, with regard to the imitation of expression, we can hardly agree with Sir Joshua, that \"the perfection of portrait-painting consists in giving the general idea or character without the individual peculiarities.\" No doubt, if we were to choose between the general character, and the peculiarities of feature, we ought to prefer the former. But, they are so far from being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a> with, that they are not without some difficulty distinguishable from, each other. There is a general look of the face, a predominant expression arising from the correspondence and connection of the different parts, which it is of the first and last importance to give; and without which, no elaboration of detached parts, or marking of the peculiarities of single features, is worth anything; but which, at the same time, is not destroyed, but assisted by the careful finishing, and still more by giving the exact outline of each part.\n\nIt is on this point that the modern French and English schools differ, and (in our opinion) are both wrong. The English seem generally to suppose, that if they only leave out the subordinate parts, they are sure of the general result. The French, on the contrary, as erroneously imagine, that, by attending successively to each separate part, they must infallibly arrive at a correct whole; not considering that, besides the parts, there is their relation to each other, and the general expression stamped upon them by the character of the individual, which to be seen must be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FELT\">felt</a>; for it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEMONSTRABLE\">demonstrable</a>, that all character and expression, to be adequately represented, must be perceived by the mind, and not by the eye only. The French painters give only lines and precise differences; the English only general masses, and strong effects. Hence the two nations reproach one another with the difference of their styles of art,\u2014the one as dry, hard, and minute,\u2014the other as gross, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOTHIC\">gothic</a>, and unfinished; and they will probably remain for ever satisfied with each other's defects, as they afford a very tolerable fund of consolation on either side.\n\nMuch has been said of historical portrait; and we have no objection to this phrase, if properly understood. The giving historical truth to a portrait, means, then, the representing the individual under one consistent, probable, and striking view; or showing the different features, muscles, &c. in one action, and modified by one principle. A portrait thus painted may be said to be historical; that is, it carries internal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> of truth and propriety with it; and the number of individual peculiarities, as long as they are true to nature, cannot lessen, but must add to the strength of the general impression.\n\nIt might be shown (if there were room in this place) that Sir Joshua has constructed his theory of the ideal in art, upon the same mistaken principle of the negation or abstraction of particular nature. The ideal is not a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a> but a positive thing. The leaving out the details or peculiarities of an individual face, does not make it one jot more ideal. To paint history, is to paint nature as answering to a general, predominant, or preconceived idea in the mind, of strength, beauty, action, passion, thought, &c.; but the way to do this is not to leave out the details, but to incorporate the general idea with the details\u2014that is, to show the same expression actuating and modifying every movement of the muscles, and the same character preserved consistently through every part of the body. Grandeur does not consist in omitting the parts, but in connecting all the parts into a whole, and in giving their combined and varied action: abstract truth or ideal perfection does not consist in rejecting the peculiarities of form, but in rejecting all those which are not consistent with the character intended to be given; and in following up the same general idea of softness, voluptuousness, strength, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a>, or any combination of these through every ramification of the frame. But these modifications of form or expression can only be learnt from nature, and therefore the perfection of art must always be sought in nature. The ideal properly applies as much to the idea of ugliness, weakness, folly, meanness, vice, as of beauty, strength, wisdom, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNANIMITY\">magnanimity</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>. The antique heads of fauns and satyrs, of Pan or Silenus, are quite as ideal as those of the Apollo or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACCHUS\">Bacchus</a>; and Hogarth adhered to an idea of humour in his faces, as Raphael did to an idea of sentiment. But Raphael found the character of sentiment in nature as much as Hogarth did that of humour; otherwise\nneither of them would have given one or the other with such perfect truth, purity, force, and keeping. Sir Joshua Reynolds's ideal, as consisting in a mere negation of individuality, bears just the same relation to real beauty or grandeur as caricature does to true comic character.\n\nIt is owing either to a mistaken theory of elevated art, or to the want of models in nature, that the English are hitherto without any painter of serious historical subjects, who can be placed in the first rank of genius. Many of the pictures of modern artists have shown a capacity for correct and happy delineation of actual objects and domestic incidents, only inferior to the masterpieces of the Dutch School. We might here mention the names of Wilkie, Collins, Heath, and many others. We have portrait-painters, who have attained to a very high degree of excellence in all the branches of their art. In landscape, Turner has shown a knowledge of the effects of air, and of powerful relief in objects, which was never surpassed. But in the highest walk of art\u2014in giving the movements of the finer or loftier passions of the mind, this country has not produced a single painter, who has made even a faint approach to the excellence of the great Italian painters. We have, indeed, a good number of specimens of the clay-figure, the anatomical mechanism, the regular proportions measured by a two-foot rule\u2014large canvasses, covered with stiff figures, arranged in deliberate order, with the characters and story correctly expressed by uplifted eyes or hands, according to old receipt-books for the passions\u2014and with all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a> and inflexibility of figures carved in wood, and painted over in good strong body colours, that look \"as if some of nature's journeymen had made them, and not made them well.\" But we still want a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMETHEUS\">Prometheus</a> to give life to the cumbrous mass, to throw an intellectual light over the opaque image,\u2014to embody the inmost refinements of thought to the outward eye,\u2014to lay bare the very soul of passion. That picture is of little comparative value, which can be completely translated into another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>,\u2014of which the description in a common catalogue conveys all that is expressed by the picture itself; for it is the excellence of every art to give what can be given by no other, in the same degree. Much less is that picture to be esteemed, which only injures and defaces the idea already existing in the mind's eye,\u2014which does not come up to the conception which the imagination forms of the subject, and substitutes a dull reality for high sentiment; for the art is in this case an encumbrance, not an assistance, and interferes with, instead of adding to, the stock of our pleasurable sensations. But we should be at a loss to point out (we will not say any English picture, but certainly) any English painter, who, in heroic and classical composition, has risen to the height of his subject, and answered the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a> of the well-informed spectator, or excited the same impression by visible means, as had been already excited by words, or by reflection.\u2020\n\nThat this inferiority in English art is not owing to a fine arts deficiency of genius, imagination, or passion, is proved sufficiently by the works of our poets and dramatic writers, which, in loftiness and force, are not surpassed by those of any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>. But whatever may be the depth of internal thought and feeling in the English character, it seems to be more internal; and (whether this is owing to habit, or physical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>) to have, comparatively, a less immediate and powerful communication with the organic expression of passion,\u2014which exhibits the thoughts and feelings in the countenance, and furnishes matter for the historic muse of painting. The English artist is instantly sensible that the flutter, grimace, and extravagance of the French physiognomy, are incompatible with high history; and we are at no loss to explain in this way, that is, from the defect of living models, how it is that the productions of the French school are marked with all the affectation of national caricature, or sink into tame and lifeless imitations of the antique. May we not account satisfactorily for the general defects of our own historic productions, in a similar way,\u2014from a certain inertness and constitutional phlegm, which does not habitually impress the workings of the mind in correspondent traces on the countenance, and which may also render us less sensible of these outward and visible signs of passion, even when they are so impressed there? The irregularity of proportion, and want of symmetry, in the structure of the national features, though it certainly enhances the difficulty of infusing natural grace and grandeur into the works of art, rather accounts for our not having been able to attain the exquisite refinements of Grecian sculpture, than for our not having rivalled the Italian painters in expression.\n\nMr West does not form an exception to, but a confirmation of, these general observations. His pictures have all that can be required in what relates to the composition of the subject; to the regular arrangement of the groups; the anatomical proportions of the human body; and the technical knowledge of expression,\u2014as far as expression is reducible to abstract rules, and is merely a vehicle for the telling of a story; so that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a>, wonder, sorrow, pity, &c. have each their appropriate and well-known designations. These, however, are but the instrumental parts of the art, the means, not the end; but beyond these, Mr West's pictures do not go. They never \"snatch a grace beyond the reach of art.\" They exhibit the mask, not the soul of expression. We doubt, whether, in the entire <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANGE\">range</a> of Mr West's productions, meritorious and admirable as the design and composition often are, there is to be found one truly fine head. They display a total want of gusto. In Raphael, the same divine spirit breathes through every part; it either agitates the inmost frame, or plays in gentle undulations on the trembling surface. Whether we see his figures <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENDING\">bending</a> with all the blandishments of maternal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOVE\">love</a>, or standing in the motionless silence of thought, or hurried into the tumult of action, the\n\n* This subject of the Ideal will be resumed, and more particularly enlarged upon, under that head.\n\u2020 If we were to make any qualification of this censure, it would be in favour of some of Mr Northcote's compositions from early English history.\nFine Arts, whole is under the impulse of deep passion. But Mr West sees hardly anything in the human face but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BONES\">bones</a> and cartilages; or, if he avails himself of the more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEXIBLE\">flexible</a> machinery of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NERVES\">nerves</a> and muscles, it is only by rule and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a>. The effect is not that which the soul of passion impresses on the countenance; and which the soul of genius alone can <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a>; but such as might, in a good measure, be given to wooden puppets or pasteboard figures, pulled by wires, and taught to open the mouth, or knit the forehead, or raise the eyes in a very scientific manner. In fact, there is no want of art or learning in his pictures, but of nature and feeling.\n\nIt is not long ago that an opinion was very general, that all that was wanting to the highest splendour and perfection of the arts in this country might be supplied by Academies and public institutions. We believe the most sanguine promoters of this scheme have at present relaxed in their zeal. There are three ways in which Academies and public institutions may be supposed to promote the fine arts; either by furnishing the best models to the student; or by holding out immediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol6.html#article-EMOLUMENT\">emolument</a> and patronage; or by improving the public taste. We shall bestow a short consideration on the influence of each.\n\nFirst, a constant reference to the best models of art necessarily tends to enervate the mind, to intercept our view of nature, and to distract the attention by a variety of unattainable excellence. An intimate acquaintance with the works of the celebrated masters may indeed add to the indolent refinements of taste, but will never produce one work of original genius, one great artist. In proof of the general truth of this observation, we might cite the history of the progress and decay of art in all countries where it has flourished. It is a little extraordinary, that if the real sources of perfection are to be sought in Schools, in Models, and Public Institutions, that wherever schools, models, and public institutions have existed, there the arts should regularly disappear,\u2014that the effect should never follow from the cause.\n\nThe Greek statues remain to this day unrivalled,\u2014the undisputed standard of the most perfect symmetry of form. In Italy the art of painting has had the same fate. After its long and painful struggles in the time of the earlier artists, Cimabue, Ghirlandaio, Massacio, and others, it burst out with a light almost too dazzling to behold, in the works of Titian, Michael Angelo, Raphael, and Correggio; which was reflected, with diminished lustre, in the productions of their immediate disciples; lingered for a while with the school of the Carraccis, and expired with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUIDO_RENI\">Guido Reni</a>. From that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, painting sunk to so low a state in Italy as to excite only pity or contempt. There is not a single name to redeem its faded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> from utter oblivion. Yet this has not been owing to any want of Dilettanti and Della Cruscan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a>,\u2014of academies of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLORENCE\">Florence</a>, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOLOGNA\">Bologna</a>, of Parma, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PISA\">Pisa</a>,\u2014of honorary members and Foreign Correspondents,\u2014of pupils and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEACHERS\">teachers</a>, professors and patrons, and the whole busy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> of critics and connoisseurs.\n\nWhat is become of the successors of Rubens, Rembrandt, and Vandyke? What have the French Academicians done for the arts; or what will they ever do, but add intolerable affectation and grimace to centos of heads from the antique, and caricature Greek forms by putting them into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPERA\">opera</a> attitudes? Nicholas Poussin is the only example on record, in favour of the contrary theory, and we have already sufficiently noticed his defects. What extraordinary advances have we made in our own country in consequence of the establishment of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> Academy? What greater names has the English school to boast than those of Hogarth, Reynolds, and Wilson, who created it? Even the venerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-PRESIDENT\">President</a> of the Royal Academy was one of its founders.\n\nAgain, we might cite, in support of our assertion, the works of Carlo Maratti, of Raphael Mengs, or of any of the effeminiate school of critics and copyists, who have attempted to blend the borrowed beauties of others in a perfect whole. What do they contain, but a negation of every excellence which they pretend to combine? The assiduous imitator, in his attempts to grasp all, loses his hold of that which was placed within his reach, and, from aspiring at universal excellence, sinks into uniform mediocrity. The student who has models of every kind of excellence constantly before him, is not only diverted from that particular walk of art, in which, by patient exertion, he might have obtained ultimate success, but, from having his imagination habitually raised to an overstrained standard of refinement, by the sight of the most exquisite examples in art, he becomes impatient and dissatisfied with his own attempts, determines to reach the same perfection all at once, or throws down his pencil in despair. Thus the young enthusiast, whose genius and energy were to rival the great Masters of antiquity, or create a new era in the art itself, baffled in his first sanguine expectations, reposes in indolence on what others have done; wonders how such perfection could have been achieved,\u2014grows familiar with the minutest peculiarities of the different schools,\u2014utters between the splendour of Rubens, and the grace of Raphael, and ends in nothing. Such was not Correggio. He saw and felt for himself; he was of no school, but had his own world of art to create. That image of truth and beauty, which existed in his mind, he was forced to construct for himself, without rules or models. As it had arisen in his mind from the contemplation of nature, so he could only hope to embody it to others, by the imitation of nature. We can conceive the work growing under his hands by slow and patient touches, approaching nearer to perfection, softened into finer grace, gaining strength from delicacy, and at last reflecting the pure image of nature on the canvass. Such is always the true progress of art; such are the necessary means by which the greatest works of every kind have been produced. They have been the effect of power gathering strength from exercise, and warmth from its own impulse\u2014stimulated to fresh efforts by conscious success, and by the surprise and strangeness of a new world of beauty, opening to the delighted imagination. The triumphs of art were victories over the difficulties of art; the prodigies of genius, the result of that strength which had grappled with nature. Titian copied even a plant or a piece of common drapery from the objects\nthemselves; and Raphael is known to have made elaborate studies of the principal heads in his pictures. All the great painters of this period were thoroughly grounded in the first principles of their art; had learned to copy a face, a hand, or an eye, and had acquired patience to finish a single figure, before they undertook to paint extensive compositions. They knew that though Fame is represented with her head above the clouds, her feet rest upon the earth. Genius can only have its full scope, where, though much may have been done, more remains to do; where models exist chiefly to show the deficiencies of art, and where the perfect idea is left to be filled up in the painter's imagination. When once the stimulus of novelty and of original exertion is wanting, generations repose on what has been done for them by their predecessors, as individuals, after a certain period, rest satisfied with the knowledge they have already acquired.\n\nWith regard to the pecuniary advantages arising from the public patronage of the arts\u2014the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> unfortunately defeats itself; for it multiplies its objects faster than it can satisfy their claims; and raises up a swarm of competitors for the prize of genius from the dregs of idleness and dulness. The real <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a> is anxious to reward merit, not to encourage gratuitous pretensions to it; to see that the man of genius takes no detriment, that another Wilson is not left to perish for want\u2014not to propagate the breed of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMBRYO\">embryo</a> candidates for fame. Offers of public and promiscuous patronage can in general be little better than a species of intellectual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEDUCTION\">seduction</a>, administering provocatives to vanity and avarice, and leading astray the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YOUTH\">youth</a> of the nation by fallacious hopes, which can scarcely ever be realized. At the same time, the good that might be done by private taste and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a>, is in a great measure defeated. The moment that a few individuals of discernment and liberal spirit become members of a public body, they are no longer any thing more than parts of a machine, which is usually wielded at will by some officious, overweening pretender; their good-sense and good-nature are lost in a mass of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> and presumption; their names only serve to reflect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> on proceedings in which they have no share, and which are determined on by a majority of persons who have no interest in the arts but what arises from the importance attached to them by regular organization, and no opinions but what are dictated to them by some self-constituted judge. As far as we have had an opportunity of observing the conduct of such bodies of men, instead of taking the lead of public opinion, of giving a firm, manly, and independent tone to that opinion, they make it their business to watch all its caprices, and follow it in every casual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a>. They dare not give their sanction to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">sterling</a> merit, struggling with difficulties, but take advantage of its success, to reflect credit on their own reputation for sagacity. Their taste is a servile dependant on their vanity, and their patronage has an air of pauperism about it. Perhaps the only public patronage which was ever really useful to the arts, or worthy of them, was that which they received first in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>, and afterwards in Italy, from the religious institutions of the country; when the artist felt himself, as it were, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a> at the altar; when his hand gave a visible form to Gods or Heroes, Angels or Apostles; and when the enthusiasm of genius was exalted by mingling with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> of national <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a>. The artist was not here degraded, by being made the dependant on the caprice of wealth or fashion, but felt himself at once the servant and the benefactor of the public. He had to embody, by the highest efforts of his art, subjects which were sacred to the imagination and feelings of the spectators; there was a common link, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> sympathy between them in their common faith! Every other mode of patronage, but that which arises, either from the general institutions and manners of a people, or from the real unaffected taste of individuals, must, we conceive, be illegitimate, corrupted in its source, and either ineffectual or injurious to its professed object.\n\nLastly, Academies and Institutions may be supposed to assist the progress of the fine arts, by promoting a wider taste for them.\n\nIn general, it must happen in the first stages of the arts, that as none but those who had a natural genius for them, would attempt to practise them,\u2014so none but those who had a natural taste for them, would pretend to judge of or criticise them. This must be an incalculable advantage to the man of true genius; for it is no other than the privilege of being tried by his peers. In an age when connoisseurship had not become a fashion; when religion, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTRIGUE\">intrigue</a>, occupied the time and thoughts of the great, only those minds of superior refinement would be led to notice the works of art, who had a real sense of their excellence; and, in giving way to the powerful bent of his own genius, the painter was most likely to consult the taste of his judges. He had not to deal with pretenders to taste, through vanity, affectation, and idleness. He had to appeal to the higher faculties of the soul,\u2014to that deep and innate sensibility to truth and beauty, which required only fit objects to have its enthusiasm excited,\u2014and to that independent strength of mind, which, in the midst of ignorance and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARBARISM\">barbarism</a>, hailed and fostered genius, wherever it met with it. Titian was patronised by Charles V. Count Castiglione was the friend of Raphael. These were true patrons and true critics; and, as there were no others (for the world, in general, merely looked on and wondered), there can be little doubt that such a period of dearth of factitious patronage would be most favourable to the full development of the greatest talents, and to the attainment of the highest excellence.\n\nBy means of public institutions, the number of candidates for fame, and pretenders to criticism, is increased beyond all calculation, while the quantity of genius and feeling remain much the same as before; with these disadvantages, that the man of original genius is often lost among the crowd of competitors who would never have become such, but from encouragement and example, and that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> of the few whom nature intended for judges, is apt to be drowned in the noisy and forward suffrages of shallow smatterers in Taste.\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">ASIA</a>. Under this head in the *Encyclopedia*, there is a general survey of Asia and its Divisions, and of the prevailing manners, religions, and institutions of its chief Communities. We have, in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a>, already treated in a general way of those grand Divisions of our Globe, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>; and notwithstanding the extent of the space devoted to Asia in the body of the work, the recent acquisitions to our knowledge of that Continent might also, without impropriety, have been made the subject of a supplemental article in this place; but as these additions are more susceptible, than in the case either of Africa or America, of being separately introduced under the names of particular Countries and Islands, we shall, in order to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol16.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> room for other matters, adopt that course in regard to the recent improvements in Asiatic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">geography</a>.\n\nIt is proper to mention, that the best of the later Geographers have separated a vast number of Islands formerly described as Asiatic Islands, from that Continent, and arranged them with a multitude of other Countries and Islands to the south of Asia, and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PACIFIC_OCEAN\">Pacific <a cl</a>ass=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCEAN\">Ocean</a>, under the two new divisions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUSTRALASIA\">Australasia</a> and Polynesia. The grounds of this arrangement, which was first suggested by the learned President des Brosses, are stated with sufficient clearness by Mr Pinkerton, in his introductory observations on the Asiatic Islands; and the reader of this work will also find them explained under our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol8.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> on Australasia and Polynesia.\n\nWe may here observe generally, that a great deal yet remains to be done in order to complete the geography of Asia. Its central mountains, perhaps the most stupendous masses on the Globe, present a wholly unexplored <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a> of inquiry; the origin, the course, and progressive increase of some of its greatest rivers, remain still to be ascertained; and scarce any of its internal seas, except the Caspian, has been the subject of actual survey. The interior regions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIBERIA\">Siberia</a> require much illustration. The same may be said, and perhaps in a still stronger degree, of the central parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TARTARY\">Tartary</a>, of the northern parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHINA\">China</a>, and of those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>. As to the probable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> of this Continent, it is enough to say, that differences of a hundred millions exist in regard to that of China alone. From all this it appears how very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFECTIVE\">defective</a> our knowledge is of this important <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">Division</a> of the Globe, and what a vast and varied field it still presents to incite the inquiries, and reward the enterprise of future Explorers.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASPHALTITES\">Asphaltites</a>, a Lake of Judea, near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a>, so called from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BITUMEN\">Bitumen</a> which floats upon its surface; and equally well known under the name of the Dead <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">Sea</a>\u2014a name associated with many fables, and derived from a long standing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a>, that no creature could live in its waters, or within the reach of its pestiferous exhalations.\n\nThe reader will find the substance of the ancient accounts, and those of the earlier Travellers in regard to this famous Lake, in the article under its name in the *Encyclopedia*; we shall therefore confine ourselves in this place, to such authentic particulars, as have been furnished by the observations and inquiries of those who have recently visited the Holy Asphaltites <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">Land</a>.\n\nThis Lake is supposed to be from sixty to seventy miles in length, and from ten to twenty in breadth. It is curved like a bow, and placed between two ranges of mountains, of lofty and majestic appearance. But the grandeur of its features is blended with an air of sadness and desolation, which seems to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCORD\">accord</a> well with the marvellous stories associated with its name.\n\nSome of these fables have an obvious foundation in its physical properties. Its taste is remarkably bitter, saline, and pungent; and hence has arisen the notion of its pestiferous vapours and deadly influence. We are told even by Volney, that its waters are destructive both of animal and vegetable life; but he denies that its vapours have any deadly quality, for swallows, he says, are often seen to skim its surface without injury. M. De Chateaubriand, who visited its shores in 1807, with an imagination abundantly disposed to the marvellous, has given the first decided testimony that it abounds with fish. He reached the Lake when it was already dark, and passed the night among some Arab tents. \"About midnight,\" says he, \"I heard a noise upon the Lake, and was told by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BETHLEHEMITES\">Bethlehemites</a> who accompanied me, that it proceeded from legions of small fish which come out and leap about on the shore.\" This interesting Traveller speaks in the following terms of its saline properties: \"The first thing I did on alighting was to walk into the Lake up to my knees, and to taste the water. I found it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to keep it in my mouth. It far exceeds that of the sea in saltiness, and produces upon the lips the effect of a strong solution of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALUM\">alum</a>. Before my boots were completely dry, they were covered with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>: our clothes, our hats, our hands, were in less than three hours impregnated with this mineral.\"\n\nThe common story, that nothing will sink in it, is to be ascribed to the extraordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol7.html#article-DENSITY\">density</a> of its waters. Bodies follow the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, and sink or swim, according to the proportion of their gravity to the gravity of the water of the Lake; but its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIFIC\">specific</a> gravity is such, that a man may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> upon its surface motionless, without danger of sinking. This effect was experienced by Pococke, and by a Scottish traveller, Mr Gordon of Clunie, who also bathed in it. This gentleman brought home a phial of its water, and Dr Marcet found its specific gravity to be 1.211; a degree of density, says he, \"not to be met with in any other natural water.\" Dr Marcet was employed to analyse Mr Gordon's specimen, which that gentleman had presented to Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a> Banks in 1807; and the whole process, with its results, is detailed in the Philosophical Transactions for that year. It was found that 100 grains of the water contains the following substances, in the under-mentioned proportions:\n\n| Substance          | Grains |\n|--------------------|--------|\n| Muriat of lime     | 3,920  |\n| Muriat of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNESIA\">magnesia</a> | 10,246 |\n| Muriat of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SODA\">soda</a>     | 10,360 |\n| Sulphat of lime    | 0,054  |\n\nTotal: 24,580\nThe water of the Dead Sea had been previously analysed by Messrs Macquer, Lavoisier, and Sage, of whose experiments an account was published in the M\u00e9moires de l'Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences for the year 1778. Their analysis afforded results greatly different from those obtained by Dr Marcat, which that gentleman ascribes to some inaccuracy in their mode of operating. We find, however, that the processes employed by Dr Marcat have been called in question, and the accuracy of his proportions denied by a very skilful Chemist, who subsequently instituted an analysis of the Dead Sea water. We allude to Klaproth, who procured a specimen brought from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EAST\">East</a> by the Abb\u00e9 Mariot, and whose analysis offered the following proportions:\n\n| Substance          | Proportion |\n|--------------------|------------|\n| Muriat of magnesia | 24.20      |\n| Muriat of lime     | 10.60      |\n| Muriat of soda     | 7.80       |\n| Water              | 57.40      |\n\nKlaproth also found the specific gravity to be 1.245 instead of 1.211; agreeing in this respect more nearly with Macquer and Lavoisier, who stated it at 1.240. The specific gravity of Dr Marcat's specimen may, however, have been less, from its having been taken from the Lake, not far from the influx of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JORDAN\">Jordan</a>, on which account it might be somewhat diluted.\n\nDr Clarke mentions, that the inhabitants of the country still regard the Dead Sea with feelings of terror. This may be owing to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a> that its waters cover the engulfed cities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SODOM\">Sodom</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOMORRAH\">Gomorrah</a>, or to the ideas entertained of the peculiar insalubrity of its exhalations. It is much to be regretted, that this Traveller was prevented by the Arabs, who infested the neighbourhood, from exploring the Lake, which he only saw at some distance; as with his attainments, he could not have failed to gather some interesting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> regarding its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\">natural history</a>. Though M. de Chateaubriand, a few years after, succeeded in reaching its banks, he could only, owing to the same cause, remain a few hours; and besides, however capable of interesting his readers, he was not so well qualified for accurate or scientific observation. While some of his facts run <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTER\">counter</a> to the ancient fables, others seem calculated to add to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIST\">list</a>; as, when he discovers a resemblance between the noise of its waves, and the stifled clamours of the people whom they engulfed! The following passage, however, is of the antifabulous kind, and contains some information which cannot but be acceptable to our readers. \"There is scarcely any one who has not heard of the famous tree of Sodom; a tree, said to produce an apple pleasing to the eye, but bitter to the taste, and full of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASHES\">ashes</a>. Tacitus, in the fifth book of his History, and Josephus, in his Jewish war, are, I believe, the two first authors that made mention of the singular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> of the Dead Sea. Foulcher de Chartres, who travelled in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PALESTINE\">Palestine</a> about the year 1100, saw the deceitful apple, and compared it to the pleasures of the world. Since that period, some writers, as Ceverius de Vera, Baumgarten, de la Vall\u00e9e, Troilo, and certain Missionaries, confirm Foulcher's statement; others, as Reland, Father Neret, and Maundrell, are inclined to believe that this fruit is but a poetical image of our false joys; while others again, as Pococke and Shaw, absolutely question its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a>.\n\n\"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMMAN\">Amman</a> seemed to remove the difficulty. He gave a description of the tree, which, according to him, resembles the hawthorn. 'The fruit,' says he, 'is a small apple, of a beautiful colour.'\n\n\"Hasselquist, the Botanist, followed, and he tells a totally different story. The apple of Sodom, as we are informed by him, is not the fruit either of a tree or of a shrub, but the production of the Solanum melongena of Linnaeus. 'It is found in great abundance,' says he, 'round <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERICHO\">Jericho</a>, in the valleys near the Jordan, and in the neighbourhood of the Dead Sea. It is true that these apples are sometimes full of dust; but this appears only when the fruit is attacked by an insect (teuthredo), which converts the whole of the inside into dust, leaving nothing but the rind entire, without causing it to lose any of its colour.'\n\n\"Who would not imagine, after this, that the question had been set completely at rest, by the authority of Hasselquist, and the still greater authority of Linnaeus, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLORA\">Flora</a> Palestina? No such thing. M. Scetzen, also a man of science, and the most modern of all Travellers, since he is still in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARABIA\">Arabia</a>, does not agree with Hasselquist in regard to the Solanum Sodomaeum. 'I saw,' says he, 'during my stay at Karrak, in the house of the Greek clergyman of that town, a species of cotton resembling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SILK\">silk</a>. This cotton, as he told me, grows in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> of El Gor, near the southern extremity of the Dead Sea, on a tree like a fig-tree, called Abescha-ex; it is found in a fruit resembling the pomegranate. It struck me, that this fruit, which has no pulp or flesh in the inside, and is unknown in the rest of Palestine, might be the celebrated apple of Sodom.'\n\n\"Here I am thrown into an awkward <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DILEMMA\">dilemma</a>; for I too have the vanity to imagine that I have discovered the long-sought fruit. The shrub which bears it grows two or three leagues from the mouth of the Jordan: it is thorny, and has small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TAPER\">taper</a> leaves. It bears a considerable resemblance to the shrub described by Amman; and its fruit is exactly like the little Egyptian lemon, both in size and colour. Before it is ripe, it is filled with a corrosive and saline juice; when dried it yields a blackish seed, which may be compared to ashes, and which in taste resembles bitter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEPPER\">pepper</a>.\" See Chateaubriand's Travels in Greece, Palestine, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>, and Barbary.\u2014Dr Clarke's Travels in Greece, Egypt, and the Holy Land.\u2014Philosophical Transactions of the Royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> for 1807.\u2014Klaproth, Beitr\u00e4ge zur Chemischen Kenntniss der Mineral K\u00f6rper, B. 5. p. 185. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BERLIN\">Berlin</a>, 1810.","sp":833,"ep":852},{"h":"ASSAM","t":"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>, situated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>-west of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENGAL\">Bengal</a>, between the 25th and 26th degrees\nAssam of north <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LATITUDE\">latitude</a>, and extending from 94 to 99 degrees of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EAST\">east</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a>. The exact limits, however, are not precisely ascertained; for this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> is very little known to Europeans, and what respects its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> to the east is at present to be understood as partly conjectural. Assam is an immense valley, about 700 miles in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>, by between 60 and 80 in breadth, surrounded by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> hills on all sides, and interspersed with numerous eminences in the interior, universally susceptible of cultivation. The whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUPERFICIES\">superficies</a> is calculated at 60,000 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> miles, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> portion of which is occupied by woods and rivers, and the remainder consists chiefly of fertile <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>; but this calculation is exclusive of any conquered countries, and of the territories that extend in every line beyond the hills. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">Part</a> of the kingdom is mountainous, particularly what is called Higher <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Upper Assam; and part of it is low and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a>, containing extensive plains, subject to frequent inundations in the rainy seasons. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> position of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> valley, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as of the mountains and rivers traversing it, is in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> from north to south. It is bounded on the north by the successive ranges of the mountains of Bootan, Anka, Duffala, and Miree; and, on the south, by the Garrow Mountains, which rise higher as they recede northward, and change their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> to Naga at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> called Collabark. Probably the rivers intersecting Assam are more numerous than those of any other country of equal extent in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSE\">universe</a>, from its being completely environed by hills. The rains are collected together, and, pouring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> in irresistible torrents, swell the waters below, until the plains are covered by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INUNDATION\">inundation</a>. The valley is divided throughout, by the Burhampooter, into two parts nearly equal; and many Islands, some of them very large, are formed by it, and by the confluence and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERSECTION\">intersection</a> of other rivers. They contribute alike to fertilize the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>, and to facilitate the intercourse of the inhabitants, as they are navigable by flat-bottomed boats, capable of transporting them and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>. Of these rivers, not less than sixty-one are known and distinguished by particular names, of which thirty-four flow from the northern, and twenty-four from the southern mountains; but the source of the Burhampooter is scarcely yet ascertained, nor were Europeans acquainted with its course until traced by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJOR\">Major</a> Rennell. However, it seems to rise beyond the confines of Assam.\n\nAs the rivers change their names at different places, it is sometimes difficult to discover those that are meant in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>; and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> may be estimated differently, according as they are examined in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of inundation, or otherwise. The length of the course, and the sinuosities of many, are remarkable. The Dhekow or Degoo, by the size of which Geographers are accustomed to compare the other rivers, rises very far to the eastward of the Naga mountains, which it traverses for a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a>, and then winds 200 miles through the valley from its entrance, until joining the Dehingli, a great branch of the Burhampooter. Another river, the Dekrungh, rises in the Duffala mountains; and, exhibiting a large stream, occupies 100 miles in its windings, before falling into the Burhampooter, though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> line does not exceed 25. Notwithstanding its depth and rapidity, it is navigable by small boats. The river Pisola, which likewise rises in the Duffala mountains, pursues a winding course of 60 miles, and, during the rainy season, may be ascended to the base of the mountains; but it is not navigable after the inundations subside. The rivers to the south are never so rapid, as the inundations commence from the northern rivers. Both these and the Burhampooter are filled, so that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> has no considerable current until May or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a>, when the current is rather stronger from the south in the season of the rains, though the increase is not very material, as the large river at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> is always pretty full, and checks the rapidity of all the southern rivers.\n\nAmong the numerous Islands of different dimensions, formed by the intersection and confluence of the rivers, is Majuli, or the Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">Island</a>, as it is called by pre-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMINENCE\">eminence</a>, which appears to constitute one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> divisions of the kingdom. This Island extends 100 miles in length, by about 60 in breadth; and is formed by the river Dehingh on the west, and the Looicheh on the north; but independent of these great aquatic boundaries, it is intersected by numerous streams, so that it, in fact, consists of a cluster of lesser Islands, and some Islets, besides, near the banks, which in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> rivers are dry only while no inundations prevail. The other Islands throughout Assam are of all different dimensions, from the most inconsiderable size to six, ten, or twenty miles and more in length. A correct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> of the country may thus be figured as being an extensive valley, environed by mountains, full of rivers and level plains. While the rivers constitute its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>, and promote the convenience of its inhabitants, as also contribute to fertilize the soil overflowed by their inundations, they interrupt occasional intercourse from their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a> and rapidity; and it is to be observed, that there is only one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a> in the kingdom, which was erected at Rungepon by workmen brought from Bengal. Besides the Great Island or Majuli, Assam contains other two political divisions. Ootrecole, Uttarcul, or Otreparah; Deccancole, Dacshincul, or Deccaparrah; the former of which, Ootrecole, denotes the country lying north of the Burhampooter; the latter, Deccancole, that to the south. And it is further to be remarked, that Majuli is formed by great arms of the same river, though passing by different names.\n\nThe political subdivisions of Assam are apparently almost as numerous as the more important <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> ones; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of Camroop in Ootrecole, is one of the largest and the best known by description, at least, to Europeans. It formerly gave name to an extensive kingdom, of which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> seems to have been Rangmattee, beyond the present western confines of Assam. It now stretches about 100 miles in length, and its breadth, from the banks of the Burhampooter to the foot of the mountains, is 40 miles. There are no strong places within its limits, and its chief town is Cotta. The district Summooria, occupies the southern banks of the Burhampooter; and the district of Nodooaria, which extends to the eastward, is divided into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> shares or districts, held by so many rajahs, though under the rule of only two.\nValuable minerals are found in Assam; the whole country produces <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> in abundance, insomuch that from 12,000 to 20,000 of the inhabitants are said to have been constantly employed in collecting it. This precious metal is found in all the rivers flowing from the northern mountains, but it is of different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> in purity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, and also in malleability. That which is obtained in the Dekrung is particularly celebrated; and it is distinguished by a higher colour than what is found in the Burhampooter and other rivers. Gold is more abundant in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a> of the Burrowgown than in the channel of most rivers, but is thought of inferior colour and quality. What is procured from the bed of the Burrogown is esteemed as much superior even to the gold of the Dekrung; the colour is deeper and more vivid, and is compared by the natives to fire; it is likewise deemed of more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTRINSIC\">intrinsic</a> value, and always bears a greater price in Assam. The greatest quantities of gold are found nearest the mountains, which probably indicates that it is carried down from them by the torrents, but it is never sought in the beds of the southern rivers. In the others, as those flowing from the north, it is of paler colour, less pure, and in smaller <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a>, according as it is recovered from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> farther to the east. The persons employed in collecting it, pay a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBUTE\">tribute</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOVEREIGN\">Sovereign</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to their success. Besides this precious metal, there are mines of silver, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, which all belong to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">King</a>, and are wrought for his advantage alone. Rock-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> is dug out of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, but it is bitter, and of indifferent quality. The vegetable products of Assam are abundant, and of excellent quality; thick and extensive forests cover a large portion of the country; cultivated fields, especially of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol19.html#article-RICE\">rice</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAPLE\">staple</a> grain for subsistence, and the finest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>, are generally to be seen. A Persian writer, Mahammed Cazim, in describing this country, makes some observations on its general appearance, which, as he was hostile to the inhabitants, may probably merit the greater confidence. He speaks of Mojuli as \"an Island well inhabited, and in an excellent state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>; it contains a spacious, clear, and pleasant country, extending to the distance of about 100 miles. The cultivated part is bounded by a thick forest, which harbours elephants, and where these animals may be caught; as well as in four or five other forests of Assam. If there be occasion for them, five or six hundred elephants may be procured in a year. Across the Dhonee, which is the side of Ghergong, is a wide agreeable level country, that delights the heart of the beholder. The whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of it is marked with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> and tillage, and it presents, on every side, charming prospects of ploughed fields, harvests, gardens, and groves. From the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VILLAGE\">village</a> of Salagerah to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Ghergong, a space of about 100 miles, is filled with such an uninterrupted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANGE\">range</a> of gardens, plentifully stocked with fruit-trees, that it appears as one garden. Within them are the houses of peasants, and a beautiful assemblage of coloured and fragrant herbs, and of garden and wild flowers blowing together. As the country is overflowed in the rainy season, a high and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> causeway has been raised for the convenience of travellers, from Salagerah to Ghergong, which is the only uncultivated ground that is to be seen. Each side of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> is planted with shady bamboos, the tops of which meet and are entwined. Among the fruits which this country produces, are mangoes, plantains, jacks, oranges, citrons, limes, and puniales, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of amileh, which has such an excellent flavour, that every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> who tastes it, prefers it to the plum. There are also cocoa-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol15.html#article-NUT\">nut</a> trees, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEPPER\">pepper</a>, vines, areca trees, and the sadij (an aromatic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a>), in great plenty. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SUGAR\">Sugar</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CANE\">cane</a> excels in softness and sweetness, and is of three colours, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>; there is ginger free from fibres and betal vines. The strength of vegetation and fertility of the soil is such, that wherever seed is sown, or slips planted, they always thrive. The environs of Ghergong furnish small apricots, yams, and pomegranates, but as these are wild, and not assisted by cultivation and engraffing, they are very indifferent. The principal crop of this country consists in rice and mash. Ades (a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol17.html#article-PEA\">pea</a>) is very scarce, and wheat and barley are never sown.\" This is a favourable picture of the Kingdom, and although the revolutions and convulsions which it has since undergone, may have affected the industry of the inhabitants, the means of renewing it remain.\n\nElephants, wild buffaloes, hogs, and tigers, haunt the banks of the rivers, which are covered with grass and reeds so as to be impenetrable by men. It has been affirmed that there are neither horses, asses, nor camels here, though two species of the first are natives of a neighbouring territory. The other animals are unknown, but the rivers abound so plentifully with fish as to afford a copious supply to the inhabitants. A particular kind of animal, different from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SILK\">silk</a>-worm, according to Turpin, produces silk of another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEXTURE\">texture</a>, with which beautiful dresses, but of bad quality, are fabricated.\n\nIt is not unlikely that some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> physical distinctions prevail among the natives, according as they inhabit the high or the low countries, and that their moral qualities are influenced by the same cause. Mahammed Cazim remarks, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a> of the mountaineers, like that of the inhabitants of all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> climates, is red and white. They are an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a>, hardy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>, well formed, but the noses of the women are flattish. Both sexes go almost naked; formerly the mountaineers were absolutely so; and, unlike the easterns in general, none of the females, even those of the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>, are veiled. They wear a blue <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BONNET\">bonnet</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>, from which hogs' <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a> are suspended, which is perhaps of more recent use, as the Persian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> referred to says they had neither turbans, robes, drawers, nor shoes. Their most valuable ornaments, at present, are bracelets of coral or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMBER\">amber</a>, and sometimes tortoise shell or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> shells. They dwell in habitations constructed of wood, bamboos, and straw, and there is only an inconsiderable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between those of the more wealthy and the poorer classes. With regard to their state of civilization, or their manners and customs, we have very little certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> applicable to the present times. Most probably the mountaineers are more barbarous than the inhabitants of the low country and the plains; and as the kingdom is di\nvided into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of petty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">States</a>, those may be subordinate to some paramount authority; but the frequent broils of the Rajahs retard the civilization of their subjects. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAHOMMED\">Mahommed</a> Cazim, who entertained a decided <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERSION\">aversion</a> to the Assamese, reproaches them with indiscriminately feeding \"on all kinds of food, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> excepted; they even eat animals that have died a natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>.\" He divides them into two tribes, Assamians and Culitanians; the latter excelling the former in every thing but warlike operations.\n\nIt appears that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of this Kingdom is monarchical, and that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SULTAN\">Sultan</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RAJAH\">Rajah</a> rules the whole; yet, owing to the incessant contest for power, the course of succession, if it be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a>, is disturbed, and the most potent Chief, gaining an ascendency, restores the country to peace. The government was wont to be mildly administered: in the words of Turpin, the \"king was attentive to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> of his subjects, and employed none excepting slaves to labour in the mines. It was the only country where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a> was not crushed under the pressure of despotism.\" Formerly the Rajah kept a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> of six or seven thousand warlike troops, whose courage was equal to any enterprise.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> of these people is supposed by Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAMILTON\">Hamilton</a> to be Brahminical. It is certain that they have many temples erected to their Divinities throughout their territories, although the character and description of these Divinities have never been explained. In the time of Aurengzebe, they are said to have had no settled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>; \"they do not adopt any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of worship, practised either by Heathens or Mahometans. Nor do they concur with any of the known sects which prevail amongst mankind.\" But it is by no means credible, that all their temples have been erected since that era. Rafts, covered with human heads, are sometimes seen floating down the Burhampooter through Bengal, which has excited conjectures that they belonged to victims offered to their sanguinary Deities. It is not evident, however, that human sacrifices, unless the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a> of life at funeral obsequies be called such, are publicly offered up in the neighbouring Asiatic territories. This species of barbarity has been widely extended over the world; captives were slaughtered at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PILE\">pile</a> of the ancients; slaves were buried alive to serve their masters in the world to come; and even the chosen wife of her husband's affections has been doomed to destruction at the same moment that his earthly remains were consigned to oblivion. Such customs have been familiar to mankind from the earliest records of time; and, among the rest, were practised by the natives of Assam. On the decease of a Rajah, or any distinguished person, a capacious pit was prepared, where not only his own body, but many of his women and attendants, were also buried. Of the latter was a torch-bearer, together with a quantity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> and lamps, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> to his comfort in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> state; some of his most elegant and useful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FURNITURE\">furniture</a>, carpets and clothes, were, in like manner, included; and even elephants, together with gold and silver, formed part of the promiscuous assemblage. A strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a>, resting on thick timbers, was then constructed over the pit, and the miserable victims, not already slain, were left to perish by a lingering death.\n\nIn regard to the present state of the arts, it is to be inferred, that the Assamese are behind many nations in their vicinity: formerly they manufactured excellent silks, chiefly for home consumption; likewise they fabricated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELVET\">velvet</a>, and embroidered it beautifully with flowers. Perhaps the same is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>, as also the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTRACTION\">extraction</a> of salt from vegetable substances; and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a> was reputed of the best quality. Nay, the Easterns hence ascribed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of this destructive substance to their ingenuity, and affirm that it passed from them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEGU\">Pegu</a>, and thence to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHINA\">China</a>. Their chief exports to Bengal are gold, elephants' teeth, two kinds of lac, which was esteemed the finest in those regions,\u2014coarse raw silk, and coarse cotton cloths. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRANDY\">Brandy</a> is made from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAPES\">grapes</a>, afforded by the numerous vines in Assam. Agriculture is certainly well understood; the populousness of several districts, which have attracted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of the Traveller, proves that there is no scarcity of subsistence; and well frequented fairs are spoken of as being held in different places. Assam contains some celebrated Temples, probably of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a>; and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> causeways, constructed at an early period of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, are of admirable extent and magnitude. One of these, now in a state of decay, runs from Cooch <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAHAR\">Bahar</a> in Bengal, through Rangamatty, to the utmost extremity of the eastern limits of the kingdom, serving as a boundary of the Bootan dominions. Another, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of immense labour, passes the capital; and the banks of the Dheckow is connected with the southern mountains by a lofty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAMPART\">rampart</a>, traversing the space of ten or fifteen miles. It is undoubted, that although most authors who have treated of this subject, describe these structures as military causeways only, they have served both as the means of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> among the inhabitants during the season of inundations, and as barriers to the overflowing rivers spreading still farther on the plains. Thus the great causeway, which approaches the capital, was raised, to preserve the interior from the inundations of the Dehingh, while in the dry season, the river retires two miles from its base.\n\nA great many towns and villages are scattered over the banks of the rivers of Assam, these having been peculiarly selected by the natives for their habitations; and a certain number seems to be included in a circle, under the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMINISTRATION\">administration</a>. The capital, which is called Ghergong, Kirgana, or perhaps more properly Gurgown, is situated in $25^\\circ 35'$ north latitude, $93^\\circ 10'$ east longitude, at a considerable distance above Rungpoor, which is sometimes called the capital, but is only the military station of Ghergong. It stands on the high banks of the river Dheckow, or Degoo, and until recent disasters had overwhelmed it, was a place of great extent. This city, Dr Wade, who resided ten years in Assam, describes to have been ten miles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> by five in breadth; and we learn from other authors, that it was fortified and encircled by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FENCE\">fence</a> of bamboos, enclosing villages and fields in its circuit. Like other cities of the East, each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> stood separate, amidst a cultivated spot or\ngarden; each side of the river was lined with dwellings, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> was situated on its banks. It had four gates, constructed of earth and stone, from each of which the palace was distant four miles and a half, by which means its position was nearly in the centre, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> to the Dhekow. This palace was a spacious edifice, apparently between two and three miles in circuit, surrounded by a causeway, planted on each side by a close bamboo hedge, serving instead of a wall, and beyond them a wet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DITCH\">ditch</a>, always full of water. The interior contained many apartments, both for state and convenience, elegantly ornamented. Mahammed affirms it as an undoubted fact, that 3000 carpenters and 12,000 labourers were constantly occupied, during two years, in constructing the palace; but an insurrection, which took place about the year 1790, has proved almost totally destructive of it and the rest of the city. Rungpoor, situated in 25\u00b0 47' north latitude, and 89\u00b0 5' east longitude, stands on the opposite side of the Dhekow, with the river Numdaugh flowing on the south; a rampart, or causeway, to resist the inundations, protects it on the east; and on the west it is secured by a bridge, the only access whereby it can be approached. The circle including it contains several towns, and is about twelve miles in length, by ten in breadth. Goahantee is the capital of Lower Assam, and the residence of a Viceroy; the surrounding territory occupies a hilly country, on both sides of the Burhampooter, the hills on each side forming a spacious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMPHITHEATRE\">amphitheatre</a>, which has been fortified equally by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> and art. The district Goahantee is divided into north and south, including several strong passes among the fortified hills. A great number of other towns might be mentioned by name; but, excepting their position, we are unacquainted with anything regarding them. Many were greatly injured, and some totally ruined, by the distractions of the country; the cessation of which, for a few years, is now allowing them to recover from their disasters.\n\nThe history of this kingdom is involved in great obscurity, arising both from its remote situation, and from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JEALOUSY\">jealousy</a> of strangers, which has almost entirely precluded the access of Europeans; and by a singular fatality, after this difficulty had been conquered, by the admission and residence of an intelligent physician, Dr Wade, some of the most important materials collected by him were lost on being transmitted to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. The present race of inhabitants is said to have occupied the country during a thousand years, but not by any means in tranquillity; at least, we know that, since 1638, they have been involved in frequent contests with their neighbours. In these, however, they have, in general, been successful, for unconquerable obstacles are opposed to their enemies. \"Whenever an invading <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> has entered their territories, the Assamese have sheltered themselves in strong posts, and have distressed the enemy by stratagems, surprises, and alarms, and by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> off their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>. If these means failed, they have declined a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a>, but have carried the peasants into the mountains, burnt the grain, and left the country deserted. But when the rainy season has set in upon the advancing enemy, they have watched their opportunity to make excursions, and vent their rage; the famished invaders have either become their prisoners, or been put to death. In this manner, powerful and numerous armies have been sunk in that whirlpool of destruction, and not a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> has escaped.\" Such dangers were sufficient to intimidate the boldest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ADVENTURERS\">adventurers</a>, and we have the testimony of eye-witnesses that they are not exaggerated. About the close of the fifteenth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, Husein Shah, King of Bengal, invaded Assam, with a formidable force of cavalry, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANTRY\">infantry</a>, and also of boats; and, in the outset, was successful. The Rajah, unable to meet him in the plains, retired to the mountains, whither Husein could not follow him; but returning to Bengal, he left his son with a large army to keep possession of the country; the rainy season commenced, and the roads were shut up by inundations; then the Rajah descended from the mountains, intercepted the supplies of the invaders, harassed them with skirmishes, and cut off the whole in detail. Another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">Prince</a> of Hindostan attempted the conquest of Assam, with an immense force of cavalry, but, says the author, who records the enterprise, they were all devoted to oblivion in that country of enchantment; and no intelligence or vestige of them remained. The Assamese, however, met with a reverse of fortune in leaving their own confines to sail down the Burhampooter, and assail the inhabitants of Bengal; for in the year 1638, they were repulsed by the troops of Shah Jehan.\n\nThe Rajah of Assam had assumed or preserved the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of Sarjee or Swerg, which signifies celestial, and lived in great pomp and splendour in the reign of Aurengzebe, the Mogul <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">Emperor</a>, who died in 1707. That great Prince, desirous of extending his conquests, sent an army, under an able general, to attempt the subjugation of this Kingdom; partly, it would appear, to humble the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a> of the Rajah, who was so vain-glorious as to believe that his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a> were of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVINE\">divine</a> origin, and that one of them, inclining to visit the earth, descended by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LADDER\">ladder</a>; partly to disseminate the principles of the Mahometan faith. The army advanced victoriously, conquering all opposition, and gained possession of the capital. There the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERIAL\">imperial</a> general, considering himself firmly established, made many regulations for internal administration, and also proclaimed the Mahometan religion. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-MEASURES\">Measures</a> were taken for keeping the roads open, and for supplying the army with provisions; and as the season was now changing, he resolved, when the inundations subsided, to put his troops in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> to extirpate the Rajah, and those adherents who had escaped. The conquest of Assam extended to a large portion of the country, for all the villages of Decancole submitted to the invaders; and those of Ootrecle followed: Yet it is not to be inferred that this was accomplished without loss, for the panegyrist of the general describes the country as spacious, populous, and hard to be penetrated; that it abounded in dangers; that the paths and roads were beset with difficulties; and that the obstacles to conquest were more than could be expressed. The inhabitants, he says, were enterprising, well armed, and always prepared for\nAssam battle: they had lofty forts; numerously garri-\nsioned, and plentifully provided with warlike\nstores; and the approach to them was opposed\nby thick and dangerous jungles, and broad and boisterous rivers. Under these circumstances, it was to be considered wonderful that the army had prevailed; \"but the Musselman hordes experienced the comfort of fighting for their religion, and the blessings of it reverted to the sovereignty of his just and pious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJESTY\">Majesty</a>.\" But the Assamese were unsubdued: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> proved destructive to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOGULS\">Moguls</a>, and the general was obliged, first to evacuate the city, and as his troops were harassed by the natives, they were at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> compelled to retreat from the country with diminished numbers.\n\nTowards the earlier part of the eighteenth century, it is said that some of the Brahmins of Bengal reached Assam, desirous of introducing their religion there, where the inhabitants still had no settled faith. Amidst their exertions for this great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>, they persuaded them that it would be gratifying to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEITY\">Deity</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRAMA\">Brama</a>, if they would use salt imported from Bengal in preference to their own, which it greatly excelled. To this the Sovereign consented, on condition that it should be monopolized by himself, and that the vessels conveying it should not penetrate beyond the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONTIER\">frontier</a>; and, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, forty vessels, each of from 500 to 600 tons burden, have annually been sent thither.\n\nAbout the year 1790, the Kingdom was in the most distracted state from a widely extended insurrection, followed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> destruction of many important places; and, in the year 1793, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DETACHMENT\">detachment</a> of British troops was sent to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-AID\">aid</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESTORATION\">restoration</a> of the Rajah, who seems to have been dethroned by the insurgents. This detachment gained the capital, and completely effected their object, and the Rajah was so sensible of the assistance he had derived, that he immediately concluded a commercial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a> very favourable to the British interests. It was probably on this occasion that Dr Wade visited Assam, and that Mr Wood, of the Engineers, constructed a map of a considerable portion of the country. Either this, or another, was transmitted to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, we have understood, to be deposited in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol1.html#article-ADVOCATES\">Advocates</a>' Library at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>; but, after its arrival, it unfortunately never reached the place of its destination, which is much to be regretted, since the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">geography</a> and history of the country are both so little known. The troops having remained some time in Assam, suffered severely from the pestilential climate, and returned to Bengal with considerable loss.","sp":852,"ep":857},{"h":"ASSAYING","t":"taken generally, implies an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a> of any substance, whose constituent parts are to be chemically determined. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a>, however, more particularly relates to the ascertaining the qualities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">Gold</a> and Silver in relation to their state of purity; and in the following observations we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> to confine ourselves entirely to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>.\n\nIn whatever point of view we consider the art of assaying these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-METALS\">metals</a>, it cannot fail to appear of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> importance to the welfare and prosperity of the civilized world. Every one must be aware of the importance of a metallic currency agreeing in its standard fineness with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECREE\">decree</a> which establishes its circulation; and that it is an object of the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, to have the means of ascertaining, with accuracy, the value of the coins issued by the authority of the Monarch. Since the reign of Henry the Eighth, we have had no capricious and unjustifiable changes in the standard fineness of our coins. That monarch, as Dr Henry remarks, \"after he had squandered all his father's treasures, the grants he had received from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a>, and the great sums he had derived from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> houses, began to diminish his coins both in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> and fineness. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIMINUTION\">diminution</a> at first was small, in hopes, perhaps, that it would not be perceived; but after he had got into this fatal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CAREER\">career</a>, he proceeded by rapid steps to the most pernicious lengths. In the thirty-sixth year of his reign, silver <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> of all the different kinds was coined, which had only one-half silver and the other half <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALLOY\">alloy</a>. He did not even stop here; in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> year of his reign, he coined money that had only 4 oz. of silver and 8 oz. of alloy in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> weight; and the nominal pound of this base money was worth only 9s. 3\u00bdd. of our present money. He began to debase his gold coins at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, and proceeded by the same degrees. But it would be tedious to follow him in every step. In this degraded and debased condition Henry the Eighth left the money of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> to his son and successor Edward the Sixth. This shameful debasement of the money of his kingdom, was one of the most imprudent, dishonourable, and pernicious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> of his reign; it was productive of innumerable inconveniences and great perplexity in business of all kinds, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESTORATION\">restoration</a> of it to its standard purity, was found to be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of great difficulty.\"\n\nHenry's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> of Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, Vol. XII. p. 336 and 337.\n\nTo possess the art, therefore, by which such dishonourable proceedings as are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> detailed, may be speedily detected, is evidently an object of the greatest utility; in as much as the debasement of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-COIN\">coin</a> would require an adjustment of the relative value of commodities to the degraded standard; and the more facility that can be given to this adjustment, the less perplexity and injury <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be sustained by the public.\n\nThe importance of the art of assaying will farther appear, when we consider the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of the manufacture of plate, and ornamental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol8.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of gold and silver; the standard value of which is determined by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASSAY\">assay</a> of a few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TROY\">Troy</a> grains only. The nicety and delicacy of the operation must be great, and much practical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> requisite to obtain uniformly a satisfactory result.\n\nThe principle of assaying gold and silver is very simple; it consists of two operations\u2014the separation of the alloy from the precious metals, and the parting of these latter from each other.\n\nBefore proceeding to the detailed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of these processes, we shall describe the furnaces and implements used in the art of assaying.\n\nPlate XXVIII.

The first is to express the position of all the heavenly bodies in terms of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> reckoned from a given <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INSTANT\">instant</a>, either in the past <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> of the world. The same may be otherwise stated by saying, that the thing required is, to express the position of any one of the heavenly bodies in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a> of the time, the time being considered as the only variable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a>, though combined with other known quantities, which enter into the function as the co-efficients of the different terms. This is the most general view of that which is usually called Descriptive, or sometimes Geometrical Astronomy. The solution of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a> enables us to determine for any time the places of the heavenly bodies, relatively to one another, and relatively to any point <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>'s surface.

The solution of this problem constitutes what is called Physical Astronomy; it is the same with inquiring into the causes of the celestial motions: for by causes we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> the general facts concerning the motion of bodies which are observed to take <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> on the surface of the earth.\n\nThough the first of these two problems goes necessarily before the second, for the solution of which it affords the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATA\">data</a>, yet, after this solution is obtained, it affords <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> assistance to many of the researches involved in the first, and exemplifies, in a most remarkable manner, the use of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> of facts, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RE\">re</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, as it were, of the second problem on the first.\n\nTaking for granted the solution of the first problem, as given under the article Astronomy in the Encyclopedia, we are now to consider the second, and to explain the manner in which it has been resolved by Newton and the philosophers who have come after him.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of the first of these two problems is long and interesting, beginning from the remotest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> to which the records or the traditions of mankind have ventured to ascend, and coming <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to the present time; and, in the ages to come, it is never likely to know any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIMIT\">limit</a> but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOVEABLE\">moveable</a> instant which separates the past from the future,\u2014as long, at least, as science and civilization are inhabitants of the earth.\n\nThe history of the second comes within small compass; because between the first rude effort, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> refined investigation, there is hardly any intermediate step but one.\n\nVOL. I. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">PART</a> II.\nII. That the planets describe ellipses, each of which has one of its foci in the same point, viz. the centre of the sun.\n\nIII. That the squares of the times of the revolutions of the planets are as the cubes of their mean distances from the sun.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">Section</a> I.\n\nOf the Forces which retain the Planets in their Orbits.\n\n1. If a body gravitating to a fixed centre, have a motion communicated to it in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> not passing through that centre, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> move in a curve, and the straight line drawn from the body to the centre will describe areas <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to the times.\n\nLet S (fig. 1.) be the centre to which the body A gravitates, at the same time that a motion is communicated to it in the direction AB. And first, let the gravitating or centripetal force be supposed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> not continually but at intervals, producing instantaneously, at the beginning of each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a>, the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a> that it would have produced by acting continually during the whole of that time; let AC be the space which the body would describe by the action of this force alone; also let AB be the space which it would describe in the same time by the projectile force acting on it alone. It will therefore describe the line <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AD\">AD</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIAGONAL\">diagonal</a> of the parallelogram contained by AB and AC, and at the end of the first interval will be in D. If, then, no new impulse of gravity were to act on it, it would in the second interval of time go on in the direction AD, and describe DF equal to AD. But, if, at the beginning of the second interval, an impulse of the centripetal force be instantaneously impressed, sufficient to carry the body in that time from D to E, in the line DS, it will describe the line DG, the diagonal of the parallelogram contained by DE and DF. The same is true of the third interval, in which the body will go from G to L, and of every subsequent interval. Join SB, SF, SK, &c. The areas of the triangles ABS, ADS are equal, the triangles being on the same base AS, and between the same parallels AS and BD. For the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a>, the triangles DGS, DFS are equal, and DFS is equal to ADS, because they have equal bases and the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ALTITUDE\">altitude</a>. For the same reason, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a> SGL is equal to SDG, or to ADS; and the same is true of all the other triangles that are described in the equal intervals of time by the line drawn from the body to the centre S. This holds, however short the intervals may be, and however great their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>; and therefore, it is true, when the intervals are infinitely small, and their number infinitely great, that is, when the action of the centripetal force is continual.\n\nBut when the intervals of time become infinitely small, the rectilineal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> ADGL passes into a curve. For when these intervals diminish, the lines AB, DF, &c. the lengths of the parallelograms, diminish in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a>, but the lines AC, DE, &c. the breadths, diminish in a greater proportion, viz. in that of the squares of these intervals. Hence, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> which AD, DG, GL, the diagonals, make with the sides AB, DF, GK, continually diminish; and therefore, the angles ADG, DGL, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> which each diagonal makes with that which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTIGUOUS\">contiguous</a>, increases without limit, so that, as the diagonals diminish in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>, the angles they make with one another become greater than any finite rectilineal angles, and therefore the figure becomes a curve line.\n\nThat the lines AC, &c. or the supposed effect of the centrifugal force diminish as the squares of the times, is evident from the laws of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> of heavy bodies, as explained under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DYNAMICS\">Dynamics</a>.\n\n2. Hence, conversely, if a body move in a curve, so that the line drawn from it to a fixed point, describe areas proportional to the times, the body gravitates to that point, or tends continually to descend to it.\n\nFor, since it does not move in a straight line, it must be continually acted on by a deflecting force; and the direction of the deflecting force must always pass through the same point, otherwise the areas described about that point would not be proportional to the time.\n\n3. Corollary. The velocities of a body in different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of the curve, which it describes about a centre of force, are inversely as the perpendiculars drawn from the centre to the tangents of the curve at these points. Let ACA', fig. 2., be the curve which a body describes about the centre S. Let AA' and A'a' be two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a> of the curve, described in the same indefinitely small portion of time. Join Sa, Sa', then the areas of the triangles ASa, A'Sa' are equal by this proposition. At A and A', draw the tangents AB' A'B', and from S let <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> on them the perpendiculars SB and SB'. Because the areas of the triangles ASa, A'Sa', are equal, AA \u00d7 SB = A'a' \u00d7 SB'; or AA : A'a' :: SB' : SB; but AA is to A'a' as the velocity of the body describing the curve at A to its velocity at A'; therefore, these velocities are inversely as the perpendiculars SB, SB'.\n\nThe straight line AB, (fig. 1.), according to which the projectile motion was impressed on the body, is a tangent to the curve at the point A.\n\n4. On comparing the first and second of these propositions, with the first of Kepler's laws, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> enumerated, it is evident that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIMARY\">primary</a> planets all gravitate to the sun, and that the secondary planets gravitate every one to its primary. The next thing, therefore, is to discover the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a> observed by this force, or the function of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> to which it is proportional; and also, whether, in that function, other variable quantities are not involved beside the distance. The general fact that the orbits, or curves described by the planets round the sun are ellipses, may assist in this investigation, and in expressing the velocity of a planet, in terms of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RADIUS\">radius</a> vector, or its distance from the sun.\n\n5. Let ADBE (fig. 3.) be the orbit of a planet, S the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FOCUS\">focus</a> in which the sun is placed, AB the transverse, and DE the conjugate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol3.html#article-AXIS\">axis</a>, C the centre, and F the superior focus. Let the planet be anywhere at P; draw a tangent to the orbit in P, on which from the foci let fall the perpendiculars SG, FH. Draw also DK touching the orbit in D, and let SK be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> to it. Let the velocity of the planet, when at the mean distance, or at D, be = c, and when at\nPhysical Astronomy.\n\nP = v. Join SP, FP. Then, by the corollary to the last proposition, the velocity at D is to the velocity at P as SG to SK, that is, \\( c : c' : SG : DC \\), or \\( v = \\frac{DC}{SG} \\).\n\nBut because the triangles SGP, FHP, are equiangular, having <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> angles at G and H, and also the angles SPG, FPH equal, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the ellipse, SP : PF :: SG : FH, and, therefore, also SP : PF : SG\u00b2 : SG \u00d7 GH. But SG \u00d7 FH = CD\u00b2, therefore SP : PF :: SG\u00b2 : CD\u00b2, and \\( \\frac{CD^2}{SG^2} = \\frac{PF}{SP} \\).\n\nNow \\( v = c \\cdot \\frac{CD}{SG} \\), or \\( v' = c' \\cdot \\frac{CD}{SG} \\), and therefore \\( v'^2 = c'^2 \\cdot \\frac{PF}{SP} \\).\n\nHence, as the distance of a planet from the sun, at any point in its orbit to its distance from the superior focus, so the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> of its velocity at its mean distance from the sun to the square of its velocity at the point just mentioned.\n\n6. If SL be taken in the greater axis equal to SP, and FN = PF, so that SN = the transverse axis AB,\n\n\\( v^2 = c^2 \\cdot \\frac{NL}{LS} \\). Then as SN is a given line, \\( v \\) is expressed in terms where SP, the distance from the sun, is the only variable quantity.\n\nIf, from the velocity of the revolving body thus expressed, in terms of the distance, a transition can be made to that of a body descending in a straight line, the law of the centripetal force will be easily investigated. This will be facilitated by the following proposition:\n\nAn equal approach to the centre of force, produces an equal increase of the square of the velocity, whether the body revolve in a curve about the centre, or descend to it in a straight line. In like manner, equal recesses from the centre of force, produce equal diminutions of the square of the velocities, in whatever lines the bodies move.\n\nLet ABC (fig. 4.) be a curve which a body describes about a centre, S, to which it gravitates, while another body descends in a straight line AS, to that centre. Let BC be any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> of the curve ABC, and let BD, CH, be arches of circles described from the centre S, intersecting the line AS in D and H; the square of the velocity of the body, which describes the arch BC, will be as much increased as the square of the velocity of that which falls through DH.\n\nFrom the centre S, describe the arch bd, indefinitely near to BD, and draw Ef perpendicular to the arch Bd. Also let the centripetal force at B or D, be called G. Now, the part of this force which is in the direction Bd, and which is employed in accelerating the body moving in that line, is \\( G \\times \\frac{Bf}{BE} \\) and the increment of the space being Bb, therefore, \\( 2G \\times \\frac{Bf \\times Bb}{BE} \\) is the momentary increment of the square of the velocity of the body at B. But \\( Bf \\times Bb = BE^2 \\), because \\( BEb \\) is a right-angled triangle, and Ef the perpendicular on the hypotenuse. Therefore \\( 2G \\times \\frac{Bf \\times Bb}{BE} = 2G \\times \\frac{BE^2}{BE} = 2G \\times BE = 2G \\times Dd \\). But \\( 2G \\times Dd \\) is the momentary increment of the square of the velocity of the body at D, or the increment of that square, while the body falls from D to d. These momentary increments therefore are equal; and as the same may be shown for the next and every subsequent instant, the whole increase of the square of the velocities of the bodies in moving over BO and DH are equal.\n\nIf the bodies moved in the opposite directions, the one from C to B, and the other from H to O, it would be proved, in the same manner, that the squares of their velocities would be equally diminished.\n\n7. Hence it is evident, that, if the velocities of the revolving and of the falling body, are equal in any one instance when they are equally distant from the centre, their velocities will always be equal when they are equally distant from that point. For equal quantities receiving equal increments continue equal.\n\n8. Suppose now, that a planet revolves in the elliptical orbit APB (fig. 3.), it will have at A, the higher apsis, a velocity \\( = c \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{AF}{AS}} \\), or (if AN in the axis produced, be taken equal to AF) \\( = c \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{AN}{AS}} \\).\n\nLet a body at A begin to descend towards S with the same velocity, then if SL = SP, the velocity of the planet at P, will be the same with that of the falling body at L. But the velocity of the planet at P is \\( c \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{PF}{PS}} = c \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{NL}{SL}} \\), therefore, a body descending from A, and falling directly to the sun, under the action of the same centripetal force which urges the planet, would at any point L in its fall have its velocity \\( = c \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{LN}{LS}} \\). Hence at the point N, its velocity would be equal to 0, or the body must begin to fall from N, in order that its velocity may be everywhere equal to that which the planet has in its orbit, when at the same distance from the sun.\n\nThe law, therefore, according to which the planets gravitate is such, that any body under the influence of the same force, and falling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> to the sun, will have its velocity at any point equal to a certain velocity, multiplied into the square-root of the distance it has fallen through, divided by the square-root of the distance between it and the sun's centre.\n\nThis is a fact with respect to the law of gravity in the solar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a>, of which, though there be no direct example, yet is it no less certain than the ellipticity of the planetary orbits, of which it is a necessary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>.\n\nFrom the law thus found to regulate the velocity of bodies falling in straight lines to the sun, the law of the force by which that velocity is produced, may be derived by help of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> which is quite elementary.\n\nLet C (fig. 5.) be the centre to which the falling body gravitates, A the point from which it begins to fall,\nPhysical and let its velocity at any point B, be to its velocity in the point G, which bisects AC as \\( \\frac{AB}{BC} = 1 \\); it is required to find the law of the force with which the body gravitates to C.\n\nLet DEF be a curve, such, that if AD be an ordinate or a perpendicular to AC, meeting the curve in D, and BE any other ordinate, AD is to BE, as the force at A to the force at B; then will twice the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol2.html#article-AREA\">area</a> ABED be equal to the square of the velocity which the body has acquired in B. If, therefore, the velocity at B be v, that at the middle point b being c, \\( v = c \\sqrt{\\frac{AC}{BC}} \\), by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>, and, therefore, \\( 2ABED = c^2 \\cdot \\frac{AB}{BC} \\); and since \\( AB = AC - BC \\), \\( 2ABED = c^2 \\cdot \\frac{AC - BC}{BC} = c^2 \\left( \\frac{AC}{BC} - 1 \\right) \\).\n\nFor the same reason \\( 2BbED = c^2 \\left( \\frac{AC}{bc} - 1 \\right) \\) and, therefore, the difference of those areas, or \\( 2BbE \\), that is, \\( 2EB \\times Bb = c^2 \\left( \\frac{AC}{bc} - \\frac{AC}{BC} \\right) = c^2 \\cdot \\frac{AC \\cdot Bb}{BC^2} \\). Therefore, dividing by Bb, \\( 2EB = c^2 \\cdot \\frac{AC}{BC^2} \\), or \\( EB = c^2 \\cdot \\frac{AG}{BC} \\); now \\( c^2 \\) and AG are given, therefore, EB is inversely as BC, that is, the centripetal force at B is inversely as the square of BC, the distance from the centre of force. In the planetary system, therefore, the force with which any planet gravitates to the sun, varies in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERSE\">inverse</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a> of the square of the distance of the planet from the sun's centre.\n\n10. The line CG is the same with the mean distance of the planet, in an orbit of which AC is the length of the transverse axis, and if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRAVITATION\">gravitation</a> at that distance \\( F \\), and the mean distance itself \\( a \\), \\( F = c^2 \\cdot \\frac{a^2}{c^2} = \\frac{c^2}{a} \\), or \\( aF = c^2 \\).\n\nLet it next be required, the elliptic orbit of a planet being given, to find the time in which the planet will revolve round the sun.\n\nIf \\( a \\) be the mean distance, or the semitransverse axis, \\( b \\) the semiconjugate, then \\( ab = \\) the area of the orbit. But as \\( c \\) is the velocity at the mean distance, or the elliptic arch which the planet moves over in a second when it is at D, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERTEX\">vertex</a> of the conjugate axis, therefore \\( \\frac{1}{2} bc \\) is the area described in that second by the radius vector; and since this area is the same for every second of the planet's revolution, therefore the area of the orbit divided by \\( \\frac{1}{2} bc \\) will give the number of seconds in which the revolution is completed, which is therefore \\( \\frac{ab}{\\frac{1}{2} bc} = \\frac{2ab}{c} \\), or since \\( c^2 = aF \\), the time of a revolution \\( = \\frac{2\\pi a}{\\sqrt{aF}} = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{F}} \\).\n\n11. Hence it is easy to compare the times of the revolutions of any two planets of which the mean distances are known. Let \\( t \\) and \\( t' \\) be the times of revolution for two different planets, of which the mean distances are \\( a \\) and \\( a' \\), and the gravitation at those distances \\( F \\) and \\( F' \\), and, by what has just been shown \\( t : t' :: a^{\\frac{3}{2}} : a'^{\\frac{3}{2}} \\), or \\( t^2 : t'^2 :: \\frac{a}{F} : \\frac{a'}{F'} \\). But \\( F : F' :: \\frac{a^2}{a'^2} : \\frac{a^2}{a'^2} \\), or \\( t^2 : t'^2 :: a^3 : a'^3 \\), that is, the squares of the times of revolution of any two planets, are as the cubes of their mean distances from the sun. Thus the third law of Kepler is explained by the conclusions deduced from the other two.\n\n12. The share which this third law has in establishing the principle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> gravitation, does not seem to have been always clearly apprehended. From the elliptical orbit of a planet, it is fairly inferred that, over all the circumference of that orbit, gravitation is inversely as the square of the distance from the centre of the sun. That force is shown to be \\( \\frac{c^2a}{x^2} \\), and the same is true of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a> planet; but whether \\( c^2a \\) was a constant quantity, or one which retained the same value through the whole planetary system, could not be known without comparing the periods of different planets, with their distances from the sun. It was indeed highly probable, that \\( c^2a \\) was a given quantity, or the same for every part of our system; but it could not be considered as a thing demonstrated till the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> of the third law was introduced.\n\n13. These laws hold of the secondary planets relatively to their primary, just as with the primary planets relatively to the sun. Each system of secondary planets, however, has a different numerator to the fraction which expresses gravity; that is, the quantity \\( c^2a \\) is the same for all the satellites of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a>, but it is a different quantity from that which belongs to the satellites of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SATURN\">Saturn</a>, and different from that which belongs to the primary planets. The quantity \\( c^2a \\) seems therefore to depend on the central body of each system of planets, and the precise nature of this connection requires to be farther examined into.\n\n14. Let the centripetal force tending to a given centre \\( s \\) be inversely as the squares of the distances, and let the intensity of that force at any given distance from the centre be also given; then, if a body be projected from a given point, with a given velocity, and in a given direction, it is required to determine the comic section which it will describe.\n\nLet the semitransverse, or the mean distance to be found \\( = a \\), the semiconjugate \\( = b \\), the velocity at the distance \\( a = c \\), and at the given distance \\( d \\) let the centripetal force \\( = f \\); and first let the direction of the initial motion be at right angles to the radius vector, so that the point of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROJECTION\">projection</a> is either the higher or the lower apsis. Let the velocity of the projection \\( = v \\), and the radius vector at the point of projection \\( = r \\).\n\nBecause the areas described in equal times are\nequal, \\( bc = rv \\); and if \\( F \\) denote the centripetal force at the distance \\( a \\), \\( c^2 = aF \\), and \\( F = \\frac{c^2}{a} \\). But \\( F = \\frac{d^2f}{a^3} \\), therefore \\( \\frac{c^2}{a} = \\frac{d^2f}{a^3} \\), and \\( c = d \\sqrt{\\frac{f}{a}} \\). Hence,\n\nby substituting for \\( c \\), \\( bd \\sqrt{\\frac{f}{a}} = rv \\), and \\( b^2d^2f = ar^2v^2 \\). But \\( b^2 = AS \\times SB = r(2a - r) \\), wherefore \\( r(2a - r)d^2f = ar^2v^2 \\), and \\( a = \\frac{rd^2f}{2d^2f - rv^2} \\).\n\nThus \\( a \\), the semitransverse axis, and therefore the transverse axis itself is found, and thence with the focus \\( S \\) and the apsis \\( A \\), the conic section may be described.\n\n15. The conic section will be a circle, when \\( a = r \\), that is, when \\( 2d^2f - v^2r = d^2f \\), or when \\( d^2f = v^2r \\), and \\( v^2 = \\frac{d^2f}{r} \\).\n\n16. But if \\( 2d^2f = rv^2 \\), or \\( v^2 = \\frac{d^2f}{r} \\), the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DENOMINATOR\">denominator</a> vanishes, and \\( r \\) becomes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFINITE\">infinite</a>, so that the trajectory is a parabola, of which the focus is \\( S \\), the vertex \\( A \\), and the parameter \\( 4r \\). The square of the velocity which determines the trajectory to be a parabola, is, therefore, double of the square of the velocity which determines it to be a circle.\n\n17. When \\( 2d^2f > v^2r \\), the value of \\( a \\) is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFFIRMATIVE\">affirmative</a>, and the conic section is an ellipse, and this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELLIPSIS\">ellipsis</a> has its higher apsis at \\( A \\), if \\( v^2 < \\frac{d^2f}{r} \\), but when \\( v^2 > \\frac{d^2f}{r} \\), and less than \\( \\frac{2d^2f}{r} \\), \\( A \\) is the lower apsis.\n\n18. When \\( v^2 \\) goes beyond this last limit, or when \\( v^2 > 2d^2f \\), the value of \\( a \\) is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a>, and the trajectory become a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPERBOLA\">hyperbola</a>.\n\n19. Next, let the body be projected from \\( B \\) (fig. 6.) with the velocity \\( v \\), in the direction \\( BD \\), oblique to \\( BS \\). Find the distance from which a body must fall to acquire at \\( B \\) the velocity \\( v \\), and let \\( OB \\) taken in \\( SB \\) produced, be equal to this distance; then is \\( SO \\) equal to the transverse axis. Let \\( BE \\) be drawn, making with \\( BD \\) the same angle that \\( SB \\) makes with \\( BG \\), and let \\( BE = BO \\), then is \\( E \\) the higher focus. Produce \\( SE \\) to \\( N \\), so that \\( SN = SO \\), and bisect \\( EN \\) in \\( A \\), then is \\( A \\) the higher apsis, and if \\( SP \\) be made equal to \\( EA \\), \\( P \\) is the lower apsis, and \\( AP \\) the transverse axis, and therefore the foci and the transverse axis being given, the elliptic orbit may be described.\n\n20. From what has been shown at Art 9. it is evident, that the primary planets gravitate to the sun with forces that are inversely as the squares of the distances, and that the secondary gravitate toward the primary, according to the same law. This inference, however, does not apply exactly to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>, which, being a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SATELLITE\">satellite</a>, does not by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> with any other, afford a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> that, in bodies revolving round the earth, the squares of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PERIODIC\">periodic</a> times are as the cubes of the distances. The centripetal force at the moon, however, from our knowledge of her periodic time, may be compared with the force of gravity at the earth's surface, and will determine whether that force decrease as we recede from the earth in the inverse ratio of the squares of the distances.\n\nLet \\( a \\) be the distance of the moon from the centre of the earth, \\( r \\) the radius of the earth, \\( g \\) the velocity acquired by a heavy body at the earth's surface, by falling during one second; let \\( t \\) be the period of the moon's revolution in seconds, and \\( c \\) the velocity of her motion. Then by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SECT\">sect</a>. 14, \\( ac^2 = r^2g \\), and, therefore, \\( c = r \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{a}} \\).\n\nNow, the circumference of the circle described by the moon is \\( 2\\pi a \\), and this, divided by \\( c \\), gives the periodic time of the moon in seconds, or \\( \\frac{2\\pi a}{c} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{g}} = t \\), so that \\( t^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2a^3}{rg} \\), and \\( a^3 = \\frac{rgt^2}{4\\pi^2} \\). Hence \\( \\frac{a^3}{r^3} = \\frac{gt^2}{4\\pi^2r} \\), and \\( \\frac{a}{r} = \\left( \\frac{gt^2}{4\\pi^2r} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\). Hence as \\( g \\), \\( r \\), and \\( t \\), are known, we may find \\( \\frac{a}{r} \\) or the ratio of the moon's distance to the radius of the earth, which, if it come out the same that it is known to be, from observations of the moon's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARALLAX\">parallax</a>, will prove, that the force which retains the moon in her orbit, is the same that causes bodies to fall at the surface of the earth, but diminished in the same ratio that the square of the moon's distance is greater than the square of the radius of the earth.\n\nNow \\( g = 32.166 \\) feet, \\( r = 3481279.4 \\) fathoms, or \\( 20887676.4 \\) feet, and \\( t = 2360591.5 \\) seconds. Hence \\( \\frac{a}{r} = 60.218 \\).\n\nNow the mean equatorial parallax of the moon is found by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>, \\( = 57'11'' \\), from which the mean distance in semidiameters of the equator is found \\( = 60.121 \\).\n\nBut it is in mean semidiameters of the earth, that the moon's distance is given in the former computation; therefore, to reduce the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> to the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a>, it must be increased by a 600th part, as the mean radius of the globe is about that much less than the radius of the equator; the distance 60.121, then becomes 60.221, which agrees with the former number to the small fraction .008 of the earth's radius.\n\nThus, from the theory of gravity, combined with the time of the moon's sidereal revolution, her distance from the earth is found to be less than a twenty-thousandth part of the whole.\n\n21. It is, therefore, a general proposition, derived from the most rigorous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDUCTION\">induction</a>, that the primary planets gravitate to the sun, and the secondary planets to the primary, with forces which are inversely as the squares of the distances. But since, in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> of motion, the reaction is equal to the action, when a planet gravitates to the sun, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> forces us to conclude, that the sun gravitates to the planet, in such\nPhysical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> in the direction EC is \\( \\frac{2\\pi m}{x^3} \\times c = \\frac{2\\pi m}{x^3} \\), the fluent of which taken so as to vanish when DC = 0, or when \\( x = a \\), is \\( 2\\pi m - \\frac{2\\pi ma}{x} = 2\\pi m \\left(1 - \\frac{a}{x}\\right) \\) = the attraction of the circle DKH.\n\nTherefore, when \\( x = AE \\), the whole attraction of the plate, or the whole force which it exerts on the particle E, is \\( 2\\pi m \\left(1 - \\frac{EC}{ED}\\right) \\).\n\n23. Next, let ADB (fig. 8.) be a circle of which the centre is C, and E a particle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> anywhere in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a> AB produced. Draw ED to any point D in the circumference; draw also DC, and let DF be at right angles to AB. Then, when the whole figure revolves about EB, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEMICIRCLE\">semicircle</a> ADB will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATE\">generate</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPHERE\">sphere</a>, and DF a circle perpendicular to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> ABD, and having its centre in F. If all the particles of the sphere attract the particle E with forces inversely as the squares of their distances from it, then, by the last proposition, the attraction of the circular plate, of which the centre is F, will be \\( 2\\pi m \\left(1 - \\frac{EF}{ED}\\right) \\).\n\nLet CE = \\( a \\), AC = \\( r \\), ED = \\( x \\), EF = \\( y \\), and the attraction above will be \\( 2\\pi m \\left(1 - \\frac{y}{x}\\right) \\); and if \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) be variable, the quantity \\( m \\) in this formula, or the thickness of the circular plate will be \\( y \\), and therefore the attraction of the plate \\( = 2\\pi y \\left(1 - \\frac{y}{x}\\right) \\).\n\nIn order to integrate this quantity, \\( y \\) must be expressed in terms of \\( x \\), or \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\).\n\nNow, because AE = \\( a - r \\), and AF = \\( y - a + r \\), FB = \\( 2r - y + a - r = a + r - y \\), and AF \u00d7 FB = \\( (y - a + r)(a + r - y) = r^2 - a^2 + 2ay - y^2 \\). Hence \\( r^2 - a^2 + 2ay = x^2 \\), or \\( y = \\frac{x^2 - a^2 + 2ay}{2a} \\), and therefore \\( \\dot{y} = \\frac{\\dot{x}}{a} \\). By substituting these values of \\( y \\) and \\( \\dot{y} \\) in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> for the attraction of the circular plate, that attraction\n\n\\[ = \\frac{2\\pi m}{a} \\left(1 - \\frac{a^2 - r^2 + x^2}{2ax}\\right) \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{2\\pi m}{a} \\left(\\frac{a^2 - a^2 + r^2 - x^2}{a^2}\\right) + C. \\]\n\nBut the attraction of this circular plate may be considered as the fluxion of the attraction of the spherical segment, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> by the revolution of the arch AD, and therefore the fluent of the above fluxionary quantity will give the attraction of that segment. Now,\nHere C must be so determined, that the fluent may be equal to 0, when the arch AD = 0; or when \\( x = y = a - r \\). Therefore \\( C = \\frac{1}{a^2} (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AX\">ax</a>^2 - ax^2 + \\frac{3}{2} r^2) \\); and the attraction is found \\( = \\frac{4\\pi r^5}{3a^2} \\). But \\( \\frac{4\\pi r^3}{3} \\) is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> content of the sphere; therefore the attraction of the sphere, on any particle E, is as the quantity of matter in the sphere, divided by the square of the distance of its centre from E. Hence also the sphere attracts any particle without it, as if all its matter were united in its centre. The sphere, it is also obvious, would attract another sphere, just in the ratio of its quantity of matter, divided by the distance of the centres of the spheres.\n\n24. Thus, supposing that the particles of matter attract one another, with forces which are inversely as the squares of the distances, it is certain that the spherical bodies composed of these particles would do so likewise, or would attract one another with forces directly as their quantities of matter, and inversely as the squares of the distances of their centres. Since, therefore, it has been found that round or spherical bodies, such as the sun and the planets, do attract other bodies with forces that are inversely as the squares of the distances, it is reasonable to suppose, that these bodies are composed of particles gravitating towards one another, or attracting one another with forces inversely as the squares of the distances. Gravitation, therefore, is not to be considered as a force residing in the centres of the planets, but as a force belonging to all the particles of matter, and as universally diffused throughout the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSE\">universe</a>.\n\nAnd, as it has been shown, that, between spherical bodies constituted of such particles, the force of attraction is as the quantity of matter in the attracting body, divided by the square of the distance between its centre and that of the attracted body; if \\( m \\) be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> or quantity of matter in the former body, and \\( x \\) the distance of the centres, \\( \\frac{m}{x^2} \\) is the value of \\( f \\), the accelerating force with which it attracts the other body.\n\n25. Hence the masses of any two planets which have bodies revolving round them, may be compared with one another. Let \\( a \\) and \\( a' \\) be the mean distances at which satellites revolve about any two planets, \\( m \\) and \\( m' \\) the quantities of matter in those planets, \\( t \\) and \\( t' \\) their periods of revolution; it has been shown that\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{2\\pi a^{\\frac{3}{2}}}{a'^{\\frac{3}{2}}} = \\frac{2\\pi a^{\\frac{3}{2}}}{m^{\\frac{3}{2}}} \\text{, and consequently } t : t' : \\frac{a^{\\frac{3}{2}}}{m^{\\frac{3}{2}}} : \\frac{a'^{\\frac{3}{2}}}{m'^{\\frac{3}{2}}} \\]\n\nThe masses, therefore, of any two planets are as the cubes of the mean distances at which their satellites revolve, divided by the squares of the periodic times of those satellites.\n\n26. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>, the masses of the four planets which have satellites may be compared with one another, and with the mass of the sun.\n\nWhen this calculation is undertaken with the most correct data, it is found that the mass of the sun being\n\n| Planet     | Mass |\n|------------|------|\n| Earth      | 1    |\n| Jupiter    | 1/1067.1 |\n| Saturn     | 1/3359.4 |\n| Uranus     | 1/19504 |\n\nOr if we make the mass of the Earth 1, that of the Sun = 329630; of Jupiter, 308.9; of Saturn, 98.122; and of Uranus, 16.94. From this also may be derived the densities of the sun, and of the four planets just mentioned. Seen from a distance equal to the mean radius of the earth's orbit, the diameter of the sun subtends an angle of 1914\"; that of the earth would subtend 17\".4; of Jupiter, 186\".8; of Saturn, 177\".7; and of Uranus, 74\". The real diameters, therefore, are in the proportion of these numbers, and the bulk in the proportion of their cubes. By dividing the quantities of matter by the bulks, we have the densities; and if that of the earth be 4.713, which is its mean <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol7.html#article-DENSITY\">density</a>, that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> being = 1.\n\n| Planet     | Density |\n|------------|---------|\n| Sun        | 1.1775  |\n| Earth      | 4.713   |\n| Jupiter    | 1.1673  |\n| Saturn     | 0.4055  |\n| Uranus     | 1.0348  |\n\nThe mean density of the earth, in respect of water, is here taken from the experiments made at Schehallien. Phil. Trans. 1811, p. 376.\n\n27. It has been already observed, that, because action is always accompanied by an equal reaction, when the sun attracts a planet, the planet also attracts the sun, and that the velocities impressed on the bodies by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> attraction are in the inverse ratio of their masses.\n\nIn consequence of this mutual action, the sun and the planet must both move, and must describe orbits about their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> centre of gravity, the only point which the mutual action of those bodies has no tendency to put in motion.\n\nIn the solar system, therefore, the centre of gravity of the whole is the focus about which all the orbits are described. Thus if C be that centre (fig. 9.), S the sun, and P a planet, while P describes the elliptic arch PP' about C, S describes the arch SS' similar to PP', and having to it the ratio that SC has to CP, or the ratio which the mass of the planet has to the mass of the sun.\n\nThe true orbits, therefore, are all described about the same immovable point; but the orbit of any of the planets may be referred to the sun as a centre,\nby supposing a body placed in that centre equal to the sum of the masses of the sun and of the planet. This is true, because the bodies appear to approach one another, or to recede from one another, with a force that is equal to the sum of the forces with which they tend towards their centre of gravity. Thus if S denote the mass of the sun, and E that of the earth, the distances from the centre being CP and CS, the orbit which each of the two bodies will appear to describe round the other, is that which would be described about an immoveable centre C, with a centripetal force \\( \\frac{S + P}{SP^2} \\).\n\nThus we have arrived at the knowledge of the principle of universal gravitation, a power which pervades all nature, extending to an unlimited distance, and determining the condition of every body in the universe, at any instant from its state in the former instant, and from the relations in which it stands to all other bodies. Whether this force can be explained upon any principle more general than itself, is yet undecided, though, from the bad success which has hitherto attended all attempts towards that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>, it seems probable that such explanation is not within the reach of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> understanding. This much, however, we know with certainty, that the law of Gravity, as just announced, may be considered as a very accurate expression of all the phenomena of the planetary motions.\n\nSection II.\n\nOf the Forces which disturb the Elliptic Motion of the Planets.\n\n1. Of the force by which the Sun disturbs the motion of the Moon round the Earth.\n\nThe motion of the moon in an elliptic orbit round the earth is disturbed by the action of the sun; the gravity of the moon to the earth is increased at the quadratures, and diminished at the syzygies, and the areas described by the radius vector, except near these four points, are never exactly proportional to the times.\n\nLet ADBC (fig. 10.) be the orbit, nearly circular, in which the moon M revolves, in the direction CADB round the earth E. Let S be the sun, and let SE, the radius of the earth's orbit, be taken to represent the force with which the earth gravitates to the sun. Then \\( \\frac{1}{SE^2} : \\frac{1}{SM^2} : : SE : SM = \\) the force by which the sun draws the moon in the direction MS. Take MG \\( = \\frac{SE^3}{SM^2} \\), and let the parallelogram KF be described, having MG for its diagonal, and having its sides <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to EM and ES. The force MG may be resolved into the two MF, and MK, of which MF, directed towards E, the centre of the earth, increases the gravity of the moon to the earth, and does not hinder the areas described by the radius vector from being proportional to the times.\n\nThe other force MK draws the moon in the direction of the line joining the centres of the sun and earth. It is, however, only the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a> of this force above the force represented by SE, or that which Physical draws the earth to the sun, which disturbs the relative position of the moon and earth. This is evident; for if KM were just equal to ES, no disturbance of the moon relatively to the sun could arise from it. If, then, ES be taken from MK, the difference HK is the whole force in the direction parallel to SE, by which the sun disturbs the relative position of the moon and earth. Now, if in MK, MN be taken equal to HK, and if NO be drawn perpendicular to the radius vector EM produced, the force MN may be resolved into two, MO and ON; the first, lessening the gravity of the moon to the earth, and the second, being parallel to the tangent of the moon's orbit in M, accelerates the moon's motion from C to A, retards it from A to D, and so alternately in the other two quadrants.\n\nThus the whole solar force directed to the centre of the earth is composed of the two parts MF and MO, which are sometimes opposed to one another, but which never affect the uniform <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of the areas about E. Near the quadratures, the force MN vanishes, and the force MF, which increases the gravity of the moon to the earth, coincides with CE or DE. As the moon approaches the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONJUNCTION\">conjunction</a> at A, the force MO prevails over MF, and lessens the gravity of the moon to the sun. In the opposite point of the orbit, when the moon is in opposition at B, the force with which the sun draws the moon is less than that with which the sun draws the earth, so that the effect of the solar force is to separate the moon and earth, or to increase their distance; that is, it is the same as if, conceiving the earth not to be acted on, the sun's force drew the moon in the direction from E to B. This force is negative, therefore, in respect of the force at A, and the effect in both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> is to draw the moon from the sun, in a direction perpendicular to the line of the quadratures.\n\nThe analytical values of these forces must be found, if a more exact estimate is to be made of their effects. Let SE, considered as constant, \\( = a \\); EM, the radius vector of the moon's orbit, \\( = r \\); the angle CEM \\( = \\phi \\); the mass of the sun \\( = m \\). The force SE then, which retains the earth in its orbit, is \\( \\frac{ma}{a^2} \\), and the sun's force in the direction SM, if ML be drawn perpendicular to ES, is \\( \\frac{m}{SM^2} = \\frac{m}{SL^2 + LM^2} = \\frac{m}{(a - r \\sin \\phi)^2 + r^2 \\cos^2 \\phi} = \\frac{m}{a^2 - 2ar \\sin \\phi + r^2} \\). The part of this force, which is in the direction ES or MK, is therefore \\( \\frac{ma}{(a^2 - 2ar \\sin \\phi + r^2)} \\). By raising the denominator to the power \\( -\\frac{3}{2} \\), rejecting the terms which involve the higher powers of \\( r \\), and multiplying \\( ma \\) by those that are left, the force MK comes out \\( = \\frac{m}{a^2} \\left( 1 + \\frac{3r}{a} \\sin \\phi \\right) \\) nearly. Taking away from this ES or MH \\( = \\frac{m}{a^2} \\), there remains the force MN \\( = \\frac{m}{a^2} \\times 3r \\sin \\phi \\).\nHence the force $MO = \\frac{m}{a^3} \\cdot 3r \\sin \\varphi^2$; and the force $NO$ at right angles to the radius vector $= \\frac{m}{a^3} \\cdot 3 \\sin \\varphi \\times \\cos \\varphi = \\frac{m}{a^3} \\cdot \\frac{3r}{2} \\sin 2\\varphi$. Also the force $MF = \\frac{mr}{a^3}$, rejecting such terms as involve the square and higher powers of $r$. Therefore $MF - MO$, or the whole solar force increasing or diminishing at any point, the moon's tendency to the earth is $\\frac{mr}{a^3} (1 - 3 \\sin \\varphi^2)$.\n\n30. At the quadratures where $\\varphi$ vanishes, this force is $\\frac{mr}{a^3}$, and is affirmative, increasing the moon's gravity to the earth. At a certain point, between the quadratures and the syzygies, when $3 \\sin \\varphi^2 = 1$, or $\\sin \\varphi = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$, that is, when $\\varphi = 35^\\circ 15' 5''$, the same force becomes equal to 0, and at this point in each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRANT\">quadrant</a>, the moon's gravity to the earth is neither increased nor diminished. From these points to the conjunction and opposition, as $\\sin \\varphi$ increases, the quantity $1 - 3 \\sin \\varphi^2$ is negative, and the moon's gravity to the earth suffers a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIMINUTION\">diminution</a>. At the opposition and conjunction $\\sin \\varphi = 1$, and therefore the disturbing force is $-\\frac{2mr}{a^3}$, and by this quantity the moon's gravitation is diminished.\n\nThe mean quantity of the force which is thus continually directed to, or from the centre of the earth, may also be easily computed. Since for any point in the moon's orbit, where the radius vector makes the angle $\\varphi$ with the line of the quadratures, this force $= \\frac{mr}{a^3} (1 - 3 \\sin^2 \\varphi)$; multiplying by $\\dot{\\varphi}$, we have $\\frac{mr}{a^3} (\\dot{\\varphi} - 3 \\dot{\\varphi} \\sin^2 \\varphi)$, the fluent of which $= \\frac{mr}{a^3} (-\\frac{1}{2} \\dot{\\varphi} + \\frac{3}{2} \\sin \\varphi \\cos \\varphi)$, and this, when $\\varphi$ is an entire circumference or four right angles, is $\\frac{mr}{a^3} \\times -\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. This is the sum of the forces for an entire revolution, and when divided by $\\pi$, gives the mean force $-\\frac{mr}{2a^3}$, which being negative, shows that the solar force, on the whole, diminishes the gravitation of the moon to the earth.\n\nThus it appears, that at the quadratures the gravity of the moon to the earth is increased by a quantity equal to the mass of the sun, multiplied into the radius of the moon's orbit, and divided by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUBE\">cube</a> of the sun's distance from the earth: at the syzygies it is diminished by twice this quantity; and the effect on the whole is a diminution by one half of the same quantity.\n\nIf $\\frac{mr}{a^3}$ be reduced to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMERICAL\">numerical</a> value, supposing the moon's gravitation to the earth to be 1, it is found $= \\frac{1}{174}$ nearly. Hence the mean disturbing force of the sun is nearly $= \\frac{1}{583}$ of the moon's gravity to the earth.\n\n31. From the disturbing force of the sun arise two kinds of inequalities which affect the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUNAR\">lunar</a> motions. The one kind affects the form and position of the orbit of that planet, the other immediately affects the motion of the planet in the orbit. When any of these inequalities is expressed numerically, the measure it so obtained is, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of astronomy, called an Equation.\n\n32. The line in which the plane of the moon's orbit cuts the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECLIPTIC\">ecliptic</a> is called the line of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NODES\">nodes</a>, and this line is subject to change its position continually, in such a manner as to go back annually $19^\\circ 18' 11''$. The way in which this effect is produced may be thus conceived. That part of the solar force which is parallel to the line joining the centres of the sun and earth, is not in the plane of the moon's orbit except when the sun itself is in that plane, or when the line of the nodes, being produced, passes through the sun. In all other cases, it is oblique to the plane of the orbit, and may be resolved into two forces, one of which is at right angles to that plane, and is directed towards the ecliptic. This force of course draws the moon continually towards the ecliptic, or produces a continual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEFLECTION\">deflection</a> of the moon from the plane of her own orbit towards that of the earth. Hence the moon meets the plane of the ecliptic sooner than it would have done if that force had not acted. At every half revolution, therefore, the point in which the earth meets the ecliptic advances in a direction contrary to that of the moon's motion, or contrary to the order of the signs. This retrograde motion is such that, in its mean quantity, it amounts to $19^\\circ 18' 11''$ in a year. The manner of deducing it from the theory of gravity is explained by Newton, Princip. Lib. iii. Prop. 31. This motion is subject to many inequalities, depending on the changes in the quantity and direction of the solar force.\n\nIf the earth and the sun were at rest, the effect of the deflecting force just described would be to produce a retrograde motion of the line of the nodes till that line was brought to pass through the sun, and of consequence the plane of the moon's orbit to do the same, after which they would both remain in their position, there being no longer any force tending to produce a change in either. The motion of the earth carries the line of the nodes out of this position, and produces, by that means, its continual retrogradation.\n\n33. The same force produces a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> in\nthe inclination of the moon's orbit, giving it an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> increase and decrease within very narrow limits.\n\n34. The line of the moon's apsides, that is, the longer axis of her orbit, has also a slow angular motion round the centre of the earth, which is progressive, or in the same direction with the motions of the moon itself. To conceive the cause of this phenomenon, we may begin with supposing the moon at the lower apsis, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIGEE\">perigee</a>; and, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, if that planet were urged by no other force than its gravitation to the earth, that after the radius vector had moved over 180\u00b0, the moon would be at the higher apsis, where its motion would be at right angles to the said radius. But as the mean disturbing force in the direction of the radius vector, tends, on the whole, to diminish the gravitation of the moon to the earth, the portion of her path, described in any instant, will be less bent or deflected from the tangent, than if this disturbing force did not exist. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> path of the moon, therefore, will be less incurved than the elliptic orbit, that would be described under the influence of gravity alone, and will not be brought to intersect the radius vector at right angles, till this last have moved over an arch of more than 180\u00b0.\n\nHence, the solar force, by lessening the moon's gravity to the earth, produces a progressive motion in the apsides of the lunar orbit. If the disturbing force had increased the moon's gravity to the earth, the motion of the apsides would have been in antecedentia.\n\nThe precise quantity of the motion of the apsides is not however easily determined. Newton left this part of the lunar theory almost untouched, and the only investigation he has entered into having any reference to it, assigned a measure only the half of that which is known from observation to belong to it. Several years afterwards, when Clairaut attempted a more accurate investigation of the lunar inequalities than was to be obtained by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> which Newton had followed, he at first encountered the same difficulty, and found that his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CALCULUS\">calculus</a> gave the motion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOGEE\">apogee</a> only half of the real quantity. He began, therefore, to suspect that gravity does not follow so simple a law as the inverse of the squares of the distances; but one which is more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPLEX\">complex</a>, and such as cannot be expressed but by a formula of two terms. The second of these terms he supposed to be inversely as the fourth power of the distance, and proceeded to inquire what must be the co-efficient of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a>, in order to make this new supposition represent the true motion of the apsides. In order to this, he found it necessary to carry his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROXIMATION\">approximation</a> farther than he had yet done, and to include terms which he had before neglected. When these terms were included, he found, that the coefficient he was seeking for came out equal to 0; the necessary inference from which was, that there was no such term; and that the Newtonian law of gravity, when the approximation was carried far enough, was quite sufficient to explain the motion of the apsides. This doubt concerning the law of gravity terminated, therefore, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> of it.\n\n35. When the doubts excited by Clairaut's first attempt were made known, and before his final solution of the difficulty was fully understood, there were several mathematicians who, still following the method of Newton, endeavoured to deduce the true motion of the moon's apsides from the theory of gravity. Among those who were most successful in this attempt, were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol8.html#article-DOM\">Dom</a>. Walmesley, and afterward Dr Matthew Stewart, Professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol1.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">Mathematics</a> in the University of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>. In his Mathematical and Physical Tracts, he has demonstrated this remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEOREM\">theorem</a>.\n\nLet \\( r \\) be the radius of the moon's orbit, supposing it to be a circle, and the moon to be acted on only by \\( F \\), her gravity to the earth. If the mean disturbing force by which the sun diminishes the moon's gravity be \\( f \\); then will the greatest distance to which the moon will recede from the earth be \\( r \\times \\frac{F-3f}{F-5f} \\); and the cube of this distance will be to the cube of \\( r \\), in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUPLICATE\">duplicate</a> ratio of the angle described by the moon, from one apsis to the same apsis again, to four right angles.\n\nHence the angle described by the radius vector from one apsis to the same apsis, is \\( 360^\\circ \\times \\left( \\frac{F-3f}{F-5f} \\right)^{\\frac{3}{2}} \\).\n\nThis proposition, which is demonstrated by Dr Stewart in the 4th of his Tracts, in a manner somewhat prolix, on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of his rigorous adherence to the manner of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">geometry</a>, but in a way perfectly clear and elementary, is employed by him to deduce the mean disturbing force, from the motion of the apsides as ascertained by observation. But when the mean disturbing force is known from other phenomena, the same proposition may be employed to deduce the motion of the apsides from that force. Accordingly, if the disturbing force be taken \\( = \\frac{1}{357.7} \\), the motion of the apsides will come out \\( = 3^\\circ 1' 20'' \\) for a sidereal revolution of the moon, very near the quantity actually observed.\n\n36. Having determined the sun's mean disturbing force from the motion of the apsides, Dr Stewart proceeded to determine, from the former of these, the sun's distance from the earth. The result of a very nice investigation gave the sun's parallax \\( 6''.9 \\), a quantity that is no doubt too small, and makes, of course, the sun's distance too great. It is indeed but an inconsiderable part of the sun's disturbing force into which the parallax enters as an element, and therefore any deduction founded on it must be liable to this inaccuracy, that a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> in the data will produce a great one in the result.\n\n37. After the inequalities which are conceived as belonging to the moon's orbit, come those which directly affect the place of the moon in that orbit. The most considerable of these, after what is called the equation of the centre, arising from the elliptic figure of the lunar orbit, and independent of all disturbance, is the equation or inequality called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCENTRIC\">excentric</a>, which was discovered by the Greek astronomers. This depends on the position of the transverse axis of the moon's orbit in respect of the line of the syzygies. When that axis is in the line just mention-\nbecause the quantity by which the solar force diminishes the gravitation of the moon in the syzygies is *ceteris paribus* proportional to her distance from the earth, it is greatest when the moon is in the apogee, and least when in the perigee. In this situation of the orbit, therefore, the greatest diminution is made from the quantity of the moon's gravitation, which is already the least, and the least from that which is already the greatest; the gravitation at the perigee, and therefore the difference, is augmented, and the orbit appears to have its eccentricity increased. When the line of the apsides is in the quadratures, the contrary happens: the gravitation at the apogee is most augmented, and at the perigee least; the difference is therefore diminished, and the eccentricity of the lunar orbit seems also to be diminished. This is conformable to observation; and when the evocation is accurately deduced from the theory of gravitation, it appears\n\n\\[ (1^\\circ 25' 5'' \\frac{3}{4}) \\sin \\left( 2(\\zeta - \\odot) - a \\right) \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\zeta \\) is the mean <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a> of the moon, \\( \\odot \\) that of the sun, and \\( a \\) the mean <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANOMALY\">anomaly</a> of the moon counted from the perigee.\n\n38. The moon's variation is an inequality which was discovered by Tycho, and found to depend on the angular distance of that planet from the sun. It is derived from that part of the sun's disturbing force which is at right angles to the radius vector, and which accelerates the motion of the moon from the quadratures to the syzygies, and retarding it from the syzygies to the quadratures. The effect of this force is found, from the theory of gravity, to be represented by three terms, which, if \\( \\Delta \\) be the angular distance of the moon from the sun, are,\n\n\\[ + (33' 47'') \\sin 2 \\Delta \\]\n\\[ + (0' 2'') \\sin 3 \\Delta \\]\n\\[ + (0' 14'') \\sin 4 \\Delta \\]\n\n39. The lunar inequality, called the annual equation, arises from the variation of the sun's disturbing force according to the place which the earth occupies in its orbit. It is shown above that the sun's disturbing force is *ceteris paribus* as the cube of his distance from the earth, so that, when the earth is in its perihelion, this force is the greatest, and at the aphelion the least, its effect varying at the same rate with the equation of the sun's centre, or having everywhere the same ratio to that equation. Hence this equation is nearly \\((11' 12'') \\times \\sin\\) sun's mean anomaly, with a contrary sign to the equation of the sun's centre.\n\n40. These inequalities are all phenomena which were observed before the explanation of them was known. To them may be added a fourth inequality, known by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of the moon's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCELERATION\">acceleration</a>. It appeared to Astronomers as a continual increase in the velocity of the moon, or in the rate of her mean motion, amounting to about \\(10''\\) in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>; and its effect, like that of all other constant accelerations, accumulating as the squares of the times. It did not seem to be periodical, like the other lunar inequalities, but to be a constant increase of the velocity, and a corresponding diminution of the periodical time of the moon, which must in the end change entirely the relation of that body to the earth.\n\nIt is but within these few years that La Place discovered it to be a periodic inequality, though requiring, in order to accomplish the series of its changes, a length of time which science has not yet ventured to calculate. For many centuries to come it may be expressed by this formula, taking \\( n \\) to denote the number of centuries reckoned from the year 1700, viz.\n\n\\[ 10'' 1816127 \\times n^2 + 0.018538441 \\times n^3. \\]\n\nThe first term includes all that was known from observation previously to the discovery of La Place. This, however, must be considered not as the true form of the equation, which must include the sines or cosines of certain angles, but merely a provisional formula, to serve till the true one can be rigorously assigned.\n\nThis inequality has, in its cause, a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> to the annual equation.\n\nWhatever changes the form of the earth's orbit has an effect on the disturbing force of that body on the moon, which is in the inverse ratio of the cube of the distance between the sun and earth. But it is found that though the mean distance remains invariable, the eccentricity of the earth's orbit changes, on account of the action of the other planets, and in fact has been diminishing, from a more remote antiquity than that to which the history of astronomy extends. From this cause La Place has deduced the supposed acceleration of the moon's mean motion.\n\n41. All these inequalities have been pointed out by observations, and have been explained in the most satisfactory manner by the principle of universal gravitation. But when all these were reduced into equations and arranged in tables, yet the places of the moon calculated from them were never quite exact; and there seemed a cause of error or a mass of small inequalities unknown in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a> and form, to which this inaccuracy was to be ascribed, and which operated, as it may be said, like a mist which concealed the true place of the moon from the calculator, and prevented his results from agreeing completely with those of the observer. The most likely way to discover these inequalities, if they arose from gravity, was to push the approximation to the moon's place still farther, and to try if the terms hitherto neglected in the approximation would not, when taken into account, afford a complete <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a> of the circle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a>, which might be said to surround the moon on all occasions.\n\nThe problem on which mathematicians now entered, and which Clairaut, already mentioned, Euler, and D'Alcambert, all three resolved nearly about the same time, has been called the Problem of Three Bodies. The thing proposed is, Three bodies which attract one another with forces directly as their quantities of matter, and inversely as the squares of their distances, being given, and any motions whatever being impressed on them, to find the orbits which they will describe round their common centre of gravity. It is, however, only in certain cases, that this general problem admits of solution, and one of these is, when one of the bodies is at a vast distance from the other two. This is exactly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> with the moon and earth in respect of the sun, the orbit of the earth being nearly the same.\nas if there only existed the sun and earth; and the orbit of the moon relatively to the earth being nearly the same as if there were only the moon and earth. This solution of the problem, however, in this direct way, leads to far more exact conclusions than can be obtained from the more simple but more indirect method which Newton followed. The general view which leads to the most exact estimate of the merit of the two solutions, is, that the motions of the moon, when analytically and fully expressed, necessarily form a number of different series, each of which converges with more or less rapidity. The prosecution of the direct method, allows the terms of these series to be computed to an indefinite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, or till the quantities omitted are too small to affect observation. The method of Newton can go no farther than to compute the first, or at most a few of the leading terms of each of the series. Its accuracy is therefore limited; that of the other knows no limits. Though this be a true estimate of the value of the methods, yet that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> inventor possesses infinite merit, as having first led the way to this arduous investigation, and as still serving to carry the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> better along with it than the other, and to keep the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> principles more directly in view.\n\nThe complete solution of the problem of the three bodies, has accordingly discovered a great number of new equations, each individually small, which would sometimes nearly destroy one another, and, at other times, having many of them the same sign, would accumulate to a considerable amount. This was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIUMPH\">triumph</a> of the theory, and the strongest evidence of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>. The effect of these irregularities varied so much, and depended on so many elements, that it may be doubted whether the most accurate and most constant observation would ever have enabled astronomers to discover their precise quantities, and to separate them from one another.\n\nThe tables of the moon in the state to which they are now (1816) brought, contain twenty-eight equations for the longitude, twelve for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LATITUDE\">latitude</a>, and thirteen for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> parallax of the moon. Of the first of these, twenty-three have been deduced from theory alone; of the second <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a>, and of the third eleven. This applies to the tables of De B\u00fcrgh; those since published by Burckhardt contain more equations, and are still more accurate.\n\n2. Of the Disturbance in the Motion of the Primary Planets, produced by their action on one another.\n\n42. It is evidently necessary, in this inquiry, to know the quantities of matter in the different planets, or which comes to the same, the intensity of the attraction of each at a given distance from its centre. With respect to those planets which have satellites, the Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus, their masses or quantities of matter have been already determined. The masses of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-VENUS\">Venus</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARS\">Mars</a> have been estimated by M. La Place, from the effects which they appear to produce on the earth's motion. The mass of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">Mercury</a> has been estimated on the supposition that the densities of that planet and of the earth are inversely as their mean distances from the sun. This law holds with respect to the Earth, Jupiter, and Saturn, and analogy renders it probable that the same law includes the other planets. Thus, the mass of the Sun being 1, that of Mercury is $\\frac{1}{2025810}$, of Venus $\\frac{1}{383137}$, and of Mars $\\frac{1}{1846082}$, the masses of the other planets being as already stated.\n\n43. The effects of the action of the planets on one another is more difficult to be investigated than the effects of the sun's action on the moon, because the disturbing forces are not only more numerous, but because the distance of the disturbing from the disturbed body, is not so great that the quantities divided by higher powers of that distance, can be so safely rejected. The general principle, however, according to which the solar action on the moon was resolved into forces either in the direction of the radius vector, or at right angles to it, is applicable to both questions.\n\nThus supposing $P$ and $P'$ (fig. 11.) to be two planets revolving in orbits, nearly circular, about the sun at $S$, in order to find how the motion of $P'$ is affected by the action of $P$, let $PP'$, $PS$, and $P'S$ be drawn, and let the line $A$ denote the force with which $P$ attracts a particle of matter at the distance $PS$, then the force with which it attracts a particle at the distance $PP'$, will be $A \\times \\frac{PS^2}{PP'^2}$. Let $P'R = A \\times \\frac{PS^2}{PP'^2}$, and if $P'R$ be resolved into two forces, $P'M$ and $P'N$, the one in the direction of the radius vector $P'S$, and the other parallel to $PS$; take $NO = A$, then the remaining forces $OP'$ and $P'M$ are those which disturb the motion of $P'$, as was proved in the case of the moon. The former of these, $OP'$, may be resolved into $OQ$ and $P'Q$, of which $P'Q$ diminishes the gravity of the planet to the sun, and $OQ$ accelerates its motion in a direction perpendicular to the radius vector. Therefore, as the force $P'M$ always increases the planet's gravity to the sun, $P'M - P'Q$ is the whole force increasing or diminishing the gravity of $P'$ to $S$; and the force directly employed in increasing or diminishing the angular motion of $P$ about $S$, is $OQ$ or $P'T$. The analytical values of these quantities may be found, as in the theory of the moon, though not with equal simplicity, because $SP$ cannot always be supposed great in respect of $SP'$.\n\n44. In consequence of these actions, the orbit of every planet may be considered as an ellipse, which is undergoing slowly certain changes in its form, magnitude, and position, or in what are called its elements. By the elements of the orbit of any heavenly body, are meant the quantities that determine the position and magnitude of that orbit, viz. the position of the line of the nodes, the inclination of the plane of the orbit to the plane of the ecliptic, the position of the line of the apsides, the eccentricity, and the mean distance. These are all quantities independent of one another, and from them may be deduced all other circumstances with respect to the elliptic orbit. Of these five elements, which would be invariable, if the planet only gravitated to the sun, all, except the mean distance, are subject to slow, but perpetual changes.\n45. The line of the nodes in every one of the planets has a retrograde angular motion, which goes on continually, and of which the amount, when calculated as due to each planet, agrees very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> with observation. The plane of the orbit also varies its inclination by certain small periodical changes which alternately increase and diminish it, as in the case of the moon. The line of the apsides, from the same cause as in the planet just mentioned, has a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> motion forward, or according to the order of the signs. Thus, in Mercury, the node goes back about $9^\\circ$ annually. The aphelion goes forward about $6^\\circ 2''$, and the inclination of the orbit in the course of a century, increases about $2^\\circ 1''$, which, in the course of succeeding ages, will be compensated by an equal diminution, so as to preserve it always nearly of the same quantity. In the same planet the equation of the centre, which depends on the eccentricity, increases about $20^\\circ 1\\frac{1}{2}$ in a century, indicating a small increase of eccentricity. These variations in the orbit of Mercury, arise from the action of Venus, the Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn; the effects of the first of these planets, on account of its vicinity, being by much the most considerable. The mean distance, however, of Mercury from the Sun, does not, any more than that of the other planets, undergo any change whatever.\n\n46. Similar conclusions apply also to the orbit of Venus. The orbit of the earth also is subject to similar changes, the line of the apsides moving forward annually at the rate of $11^\\circ 8''$, in respect to the fixed stars. The earth's eccentricity is also diminishing, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SECULAR\">secular</a> variation of the greatest equation of the centre is $-17''.66$.\n\nThe motion of the earth is subject to another inequality on account of the action of the moon; for, to speak strictly, it is not the centre of the earth, but the centre of gravity of the moon and earth, which describes equal areas in equal times about the centre of the sun. It is evident, that, on this account, the earth will be sometimes advanced before, and sometimes will fall behind, the point which describes the circumference of the ellipse, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONFORMITY\">conformity</a> with the general law of the planetary motions. From the same cause also, as the moon does not move in the plane of the ecliptic, the earth will be forced out of that plane, in order to preserve a position diametrically opposite to the moon. These irregularities, however, are inconsiderable. By observers on the earth's surface, they are transferred to the sun, but in an opposite direction. The sun, therefore, has a motion in longitude, by which he alternately advances before the point which describes the elliptic orbit in the heavens, and falls behind it, and also a motion in latitude, by which he alternately ascends above, and descends below the plane of the ecliptic. As the mass of the moon, however, is not more than $\\frac{1}{68.5}$ part of that of the earth, the distance of the centre of gravity of the moon and earth, from the centre of the latter, must be less than a semidiameter, and therefore the inequality thus produced in the sun's longitude, must be less than his horizontal parallax. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> in latitude can hardly amount to a second. This inequality in the sun's motion is called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MENSTRUAL\">menstrual</a> parallax, and was first mentioned by Smeaton, Phil. Trans. 1768.\n\n47. In the orbit of Mars, the node moves backward $23^\\circ 1'$ annually, and the line of the apsides moves forward $16^\\circ 3'$, both in respect of the fixed stars. The eccentricity of the orbit is diminishing, and the secular variation of the greatest equation of the centre is $-37''$.\n\nIn the case of this planet, however, the elliptic orbit is not only changed by these quantities, but the place of the planet in that orbit is sensibly affected by the action of Venus, Jupiter, and the Earth. The effect of the action of Venus is expressed by this formula $5''.7 \\sin (\\text{long. } \\varphi - 3 \\text{ long. } \\delta)$; of the earth, $7''.2 \\sin (\\text{long. } \\odot - \\text{long. } \\varphi)$. Several inequalities are produced by Jupiter.\n\n48. The inequalities of the small planets <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VESTA\">Vesta</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUNO\">Juno</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CERES\">Ceres</a>, and Pallas, have not yet been computed; the disturbances which they must suffer from Mars and Jupiter, are no doubt considerable, and, on account of their vicinity, though their masses are small, they may somewhat disturb the motions of one another. Their action on the other bodies in the system is probably insensible.\n\nAs two of these planets have nearly the same periodic time, they must preserve nearly the same distance, and the same aspect with regard to one another. This offers a new case in the computation of disturbing forces, and may produce equations of longer periods than are yet known in our system.\n\nThe motion of the apsides and the change of eccentricity in the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn are chiefly produced by their action on one another, but a part also depends on the action of the other planets. The node of Jupiter moves backward annually $19\\frac{1}{2}'$, and his aphelion forward $6''.58$. The secular change in the inclination of the orbit is $27''$, and in the first and last of these inequalities the action of Venus has the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> share. The equation of the centre increases $56\\frac{1}{2}''$ in a century, of which nearly the whole arises from the action of Saturn. In Saturn again the node goes back at the rate of $21''$ annually, and the aphelion forward at the rate of $16''$, the secular change of the inclination is $-23''$, and the secular diminution of the equation of the centre $1' 50''$.\n\nThere is, beside these variations in the orbits, an inequality in the motion of each of these planets, which it has been found very difficult to explain, and has only lately been fully accounted for, according to the theory of gravity, by the profound investigations of La Place. These inequalities are both of a long period, viz. $918.76$ years, which is the time that they take to run through all their changes. If $n$ express a number of years reckoned from the beginning of 1750, $S$ the mean longitude of Saturn, and $I$ that of Jupiter, reckoned from the same time, then the equation which must be applied to the mean longitude of Jupiter, or the amount of this inequality, is\n\n$$+ (20' 49''.5 - n \\times 0''.042733) \\times \\sin (5 S - 2 I + 5' 34''.8 - n \\times 58''.88)$$\n\nand that which must be applied to $S$, is\n\n$$-(48' 44''. - n \\times 0''.1) \\times \\sin (5 S - 2 I + 5' 34''.8 - n \\times 58''.88).$$\nThese two equations are to one another nearly in the ratio of 3 to 7. The reason of the long period above mentioned is, that the argument $5S - 21 = n \\times 58^\\circ.38$, requires all that time to increase from 0\u00b0 to 360\u00b0.\n\nUranus, on account of his great distance, suffers hardly any disturbance in his motion, but from Saturn and Jupiter. The node moves backward at the rate of $34^\\circ.4$ annually, and the aphelion forward at that of $2^\\circ.55$. The eccentricity is increasing, and the secular variation of the greatest equation of the centre is $11^\\circ.03$.\n\nThere is also an inequality in the longitude of this planet depending on the action of Saturn. If $S$ be the longitude of this last planet, $U$ the longitude of Uranus, and $A$ the longitude of the aphelion of Saturn, the inequality in question amounts to $2^\\circ.30' \\times \\sin(S - 2U + A)$.\n\nOf all these inequalities, and of many other smaller ones which theory has discovered, it must be observed that they are periodical, each returning after a certain time to run through the same series of changes which it had formerly exhibited.\n\nAnother general remark is, that one element in every planetary orbit, viz. the mean distance, is exempted from all change; and since on the mean distance depends the time of revolution, that time remains also unchanged. From the invariability of the mean distance, and the periodical revolution of all the inequalities, it follows that the actual condition of the planetary system can never deviate far from the mean, about which, we may, therefore, conceive it to be continually making small oscillations, which, in the course of ages, compensate one another; and, therefore, produce nothing like disorder or permanent change. It is in this manner that the stability of the planetary system is provided for by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> of its Author.\n\nComets, in describing their elliptic orbits round the sun, have been found to be disturbed by the action of the larger planets, Jupiter and Saturn; but the great eccentricity of their orbits makes it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a>, in the present state of mathematical science, to assign the quantity of that disturbance for an indefinite number of revolutions, though it may be done for a limited portion of time, by considering the orbit as an ellipse, the elements of which are continually changing. This is the method of La <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANGE\">Grange</a>, and is followed in the *Mecanique Celeste*, Part II, chap. 9.\n\nDr Halley, when he predicted the return of the comet of 1682, took into consideration the action of Jupiter, and concluded that it would increase the periodic time of the comet a little more than a year; he therefore fixed the time of the re-appearance to the end of the year 1758, or the beginning of 1759. He professed, however, to have made this calculation hastily, or, as he expresses it, *lexi calamo*. (Synopsis of the Astronomy of Comets.)\n\nThe effects both of Jupiter and Saturn on the return of the same comet were afterwards calculated more accurately by Clairaut, who found that it would be retarded 511 days by the action of the former planet, and 100 by the action of the latter; in consequence of which, the return of the comet to its perihelion would be on the 15th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a> 1759. He admitted, at the same time, that he might be out a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> in his calculation. The comet actually reached its perihelion on the 13th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-MARCH\">March</a>, just 33 days earlier than was predicted; affording, in this way, a very striking verification of the theory of gravity, and the calculation of disturbing forces. The same comet may be expected again about the year 1835.\n\nIn some instances, the effect which the planets produce on the motion of comets are far more considerable than in this example. A comet which was observed in 1770 had a motion which could not be reconciled to a parabolic orbit, but which could be represented by an elliptic orbit of no great eccentricity, in which it revolved in the space of five years and eight months. This comet, however, which had never been seen in any former revolution, has never been seen in any subsequent one. On tracing the path of this comet, Mr Burekhardt found that, between the year 1767 and 1770 it had come very near to Jupiter, and had done so again in 1779. He therefore conjectured, that the action of Jupiter may have so altered the original orbit as to render the comet for a time visible from the earth; and that the same cause may have so changed it, after one revolution, as to restore the comet to the same region in which it had formerly moved. This is the greatest instance of disturbance which has yet been discovered among the bodies of our system, and furnishes a very happy, as well as an unexpected, confirmation of the theory of gravity.\n\nThough the comets are so much disturbed by the action of the planets, yet it does not appear that their re-action produces any sensible effect. The comet of 1770 came so near to the earth as to have its periodic time increased by two days .246 according to La Place's computation, and if it had been equal in mass to the earth it would have augmented the length of the year by not less than two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a> and forty-eight minutes. It is certain that no such augmentation took place, and therefore that the disturbing force by which the comet diminished the gravity of the earth is insensible, and the mass of the comet, therefore, less than $\\frac{3}{10}$th of the mass of the earth. The same comet also passed through the middle of the satellites of Jupiter. Hence it is reasonable to conclude, that no material or even sensible alteration has ever been produced in our system by the action of a comet.\n\n3. Of the disturbances which the satellites of Jupiter suffer from their action on one another.\n\n51. The same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> of the forces by which one satellite acts upon another, into two, one directed to the centre of the primary, and the other at right angles to it, serves to explain the irregularities which had been observed in their motions, and to reduce under known laws, several other inequalities, of which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> only is indicated by observation.\n\nAn instance of this we have in the very remarkable relation which takes place between the mean motions of the first three satellites; the mean motion of the first satellite, together with twice the mean motion of the third, being equal to three times the\nmean motion of the second. La Place has shown that, if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIMITIVE\">primitive</a> mean motions of these satellites were nearly in this proportion, the mutual action of these bodies on one another must, in time, have brought about an accurate conformity to it.\n\nThe first satellite moves nearly in the plane of Jupiter's equator, and has no eccentricity, except what is communicated from the third and fourth, the irregularities of one of these small planets producing similar irregularities in those that are contiguous to it. The first satellite has beside an inequality, chiefly produced by the action of the second, and circumscribed by a period of 437.659 days.\n\n52. The orbit of the second satellite moves on a fixed plane, to which it is inclined at an angle of 27\u00b0 13', and on which its nodes have a retrograde motion, so that they complete a revolution in 29.914 years. The motion of the nodes of this satellite, is one of the principal data used for determining the masses of the satellites themselves, which are so necessary to be known for computing their disturbances. This satellite has no eccentricity but that which it derives from the action of the third and fourth. The third satellite moves on a fixed plane, to which it is inclined at an angle of 12\u00b0 20', and its nodes make a tropical revolution backwards in 141.739 years. The equator of Jupiter is inclined to the plane of his orbit at an angle of 3\u00b0 5' 27\". The fixed planes on which the planes of the orbits move are determined by theory, and could not have been discovered by observation alone.\n\nThe orbit of the third satellite is eccentric, but appears to have two distinct equations of the centre; one which really arises from its own eccentricity, and another which theory shows to be an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMANATION\">emanation</a>, from the equation of the centre of the fourth satellite. The first equation is referable to an apsis, which has an annual motion of 2\u00b0 36' 39\" forward in respect of the fixed stars; the second equation is referable to the apsides of the fourth satellite.\n\nThese two equations may be considered as forming one equation of the centre, referable to an apsis that has an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> motion. The two equations coincided in 1682, and the sum of their maxima was 13\u00b0 16'. In 1777, the equations were opposed, and their difference was 5\u00b0 6'.\n\nThe last two inequalities were perceived by Mr Wargentin by observation alone, but their exact amount, and the law which they observe in their changes, he could not discover. The orbit of the fourth satellite moves on a fixed plane, to which it is inclined at an angle of 14\u00b0 58', and its nodes complete a sidereal revolution backward in 551 years. The fixed plane on which the orbit moves is inclined at an angle of 24\u00b0 33' to the equator of Jupiter; the orbit is sensibly elliptical, and its greater axis has an annual motion of 43\u00b0 35'. The motion of this axis is one of the principal data from which the quantities of matter of the different satellites have been determined.\n\nIf the mass of Jupiter be supposed unity, the mass of the 1st Satellite = .0000173281.\nOf the 2d = .0000232355.\nOf the 3d = .0000854972.\nOf the 4th = .0000426591.\n\nIf the mass of the earth be supposed unity, that of the third satellite will be found = .027337; and, as the mass of the moon is \\( \\frac{1}{68.5} = .014599 \\), the quantity of matter in the third satellite is about twice as great as that in the moon. The fourth satellite is therefore nearly equal to the moon; the second about one half, and the first somewhat more than one third.\n\n53. The general result of this investigation concerning the inequalities in the motion of the planets, both primary and secondary, is, that in every one of these orbits, two things remain secure against all disturbance, the mean distance and the mean motion; or, which is the same, the transverse axis of the orbit, and the time of the planet's revolution. Another result is, that all the inequalities in the planetary motions are periodical, and observe such laws, that each of them, after a certain time, runs through the same series of changes. This last conclusion follows from the fact, that every inequality is expressed by terms of the form \\( A \\sin nt \\) or \\( A \\cos nt \\), where \\( A \\) is a constant co-efficient, and \\( n \\) a certain multiplier of \\( t \\) the time, so that \\( nt \\) is an arch of a circle, which increases proportionally to the time. Now, in this expression, though \\( nt \\) is capable of indefinite increase, yet, since \\( nt \\) never can exceed the radius or 1, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MAXIMUM\">maximum</a> of the inequality is \\( A \\). Accordingly, the value of the term \\( A \\sin nt \\) first increases from 0 to \\( A \\), and then decreases from \\( A \\) to 0; after which it becomes negative, extends to \u2014 \\( A \\), and passes from thence to 0 again. If, when the inequality was affirmative, it was an addition to the mean motion, when negative, it will become a diminution of it; and the sum of all these increments and decrements, after \\( nt \\) has passed over an entire circumference or \\( 360^\\circ \\), is equal to 0; so that, at the end of that period, the planet is in the same position as if it had moved on regularly all the while, at the rate of the mean motion. As this happens to every one of the inequalities, the deviation of the system from its mean state can never go beyond certain limits, each inequality in a certain course of time destroying its own effect.\n\nIt would be far otherwise, if into the value of any inequalities, a term entered of the form \\( A \\times \\<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TAN\">tan</a> nt \\), \\( \\frac{A}{\\sin nt} \\). The inequalities so expressed would continually increase with the time, so as to go beyond any assignable limit, and of consequence to destroy entirely the order of any system to which they belonged.\n\nLa Grange and La Place, who discovered and demonstrated, that no such terms as these last can enter into the expression of the disturbances which the planets produce by their action on one another, made known one of the most important truths in physical science. They proved that the planetary system is stable, that it does not involve any principle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a> in itself, but is calculated to endure for ever, or till the action of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> power shall put a period to its existence. After the knowledge of the principle of gravitation, this may be fairly considered as the greatest discovery to which men have been led by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of the heavens.\nThe accurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPENSATION\">compensation</a>, just remarked, depends on three conditions, belonging to the primitive or original <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of our system, but not necessarily determined, inasmuch as we know, by any physical principle. The first of these conditions is, that the eccentricities of the orbits are all inconsiderable, or contained within very narrow limits, not exceeding in any instance \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) or \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) part of the mean distance. The second condition is, that the planets all move in the same direction, or from west to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EAST\">east</a>. This is true both of the primary and secondary planets, with the exception only of the satellites of Uranus, which may be accounted retrograde, but their planes being nearly at right angles to the orbit of their primary, the direction of their motion, whether retrograde or otherwise, can have little effect. Lastly, the planes of the orbits of the planets are not much inclined to one another. This is true of all the larger planets, though it does not hold of some of the new and smaller ones; of which, however, the action on the whole system must be wholly insensible.\n\nUnless these three conditions were united in the constitution of the solar system, terms of the kind just mentioned, admitting of indefinite increase, might enter into the expression of the inequalities, which would indicate a gradual and unlimited departure from the original order and constitution of the universe.\n\nNow, the three conditions just enumerated, do not necessarily arise out of the nature of motion, or of gravitation, or from the action of any physical cause with which we are acquainted. Neither can they be considered as arising from chance, for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> is almost infinite to one, that, without a cause particularly directed to that object, such a conformity could not have arisen in the motions of thirty-one different bodies, scattered over the whole extent of the solar system. The only explanation, therefore, that remains is, that all this is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of intelligence and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>, directing the original constitution of our system, and impressing such motions on the parts as were calculated to give stability to the whole.\n\nFor some farther particulars, connected with Physical Astronomy, see Earth, Figure of, in this Supplement.","sp":872,"ep":888},{"h":"ATMOMETER","t":"an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> lately contrived by Professor Leslie, for measuring the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of moisture exhaled from any humid surface in a given <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>.

The tube is marked downwards through its whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> by the point of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIAMOND\">diamond</a>, with divisions across it, amounting from 200 to 500, each of which corresponds to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol18.html#article-RING\">ring</a> of fluid, that, spread over the whole exhaling surface, would form a film only one thousand <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a> in thickness. This graduation is performed by previously sealing one of the ends of the tube with wax, and introducing successive portions of quicksilver, to mark every 20, 50, or 100 of those divisions; being calculated of equal bulk to discs of water, that have the surface of the ball (exclusive of the neck) for their base, and so many thousand parts of an inch for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ALTITUDE\">altitude</a>.\n\nThe instrument, being thus constructed, has its cavity filled with pure water, and its cap screwed tight, and is then suspended freely out of doors, sheltered indeed from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a>, but exposed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the wind. The water transudes through the porous substance of the ball, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> as fast as it evaporates from the external surface; and this waste is measured by the corresponding descent of the liquid in the stem. At the same time, the column is suspended in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the tightness of the cap, and prevented from oozing so freely as to drop from the ball. As the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of evaporation goes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> globules of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, separated by the removal of atmospheric pressure from the body of the water, or partly introduced by external <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSORPTION\">absorption</a>, continue to rise in fine streamlets to the top, where they partially occupy the space left by the subsidence of the fluid column. We need scarcely observe, that, after the water has sunk to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> of the stem, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be requisite again to fill the cavity.\n\nIt is a fact of main importance for the accuracy of the Atmometer, that the rate of evaporation is nowise affected by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of the porous ball, and continues precisely the same, whether the exhaling surface appears almost dry or glistens with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a> of moisture. This rate must evidently depend on the effect of the dryness of the air combined with its quickness of circulation. In a close room, the instrument might therefore serve the purpose of an hygrometer; and, placed out of doors, first screened, perhaps, for an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>, and then exposed during an equal space of time, it would furnish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATA\">data</a> for calculating the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a> of the wind.\n\nThis elegant instrument is of extensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> practical utility. To ascertain readily and accurately the rate of evaporation from any surface, is an important <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACQUISITION\">acquisition</a>, not only in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METEOROLOGY\">Meteorology</a>, but in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">Agriculture</a>, and in the various <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> arts. The quantity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXHALATION\">exhalation</a> from the surface of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> is not of less consequence than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> of rain, and a knowledge of it might often <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">farmer</a> advantageously in his operations.

This doctrine was adopted by Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Newton, and, indeed, has been almost universally embraced by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> philosophers. But it was in chemistry alone that it could be applied with any advantage. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of chemists was to determine the component parts of bodies, and to ascertain the different elements out of which all substances are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a>. Considerable progress was gradually made in this difficult <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>. Thus it was soon ascertained that the salts, which constitute a very numerous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a> of bodies, contain always at least two constituents, namely, an acid and a base. Thus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALTPETRE\">saltpetre</a> is a compound of the acid called nitric acid, and the base called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POTASH\">potash</a>. Now, how small a portion soever of saltpetre you examine, whether a grain or the millionth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of a grain, you <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> always find it to contain both the ingredients of which saltpetre is composed. The same thing holds with respect to all the other salts, and, indeed, with respect to all compound bodies whatever. Now, this could not be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, unless these compounds were formed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNION\">union</a> of the minutest possible particles of the constituents with each other; that is to say, unless it were the ultimate atoms of the elements which united together and constituted the compound. Accordingly, it has been admitted as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AXIOM\">axiom</a> in chemistry, that chemical union consists in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of the atoms of bodies with each other.\n\nChemistry originated from the absurd pursuits of the alchemists; and many years elapsed before it was able to shake off its connection with the chimerical notions respecting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> medicine. Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CULLEN\">Cullen</a> was perhaps the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> that viewed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> as constituting a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> and important branch of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\"><a class=\"xref\" hr</a>ef=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> philosophy. His views were followed out by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">Black</a>, Cavendish, Priestley, and a cloud of other eminent men, who have added so much lustre to the scientific pre-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMINENCE\">eminence</a> of Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>. Margraaf, Bergman, and Scheele, were the first scientific chemists who appeared <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the Continent. Bergman, in particular, was of the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> to the science. Educated in those branches of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> philosophy which had already made such progress, and accustomed to the rigid accuracy of mathematical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a>, he introduced the same correct views, the same precise reasoning, the same generalization to which he had been already\nhabituated. Lavoisier, who had the advantage of a similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>, adopted a similar conduct. His industry was indefatigable, and he contributed much more than any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> to introduce that precision in experimenting, and that accuracy of reasoning, which characterize the chemists of the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>.\n\nThe exertions of these eminent men led to the discovery of the art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a>, such, though in a rude state, as it is practised at present. Bergman, Kirwan, and Wenzel, particularly distinguished themselves by the analysis of the salts. Of these three, Wenzel is by far the most accurate. The result of their experiments was, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a> that salts, and, indeed, all compound bodies, are universally composed of the same constituents united in the same proportions. Thus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> is always a compound of 1 part by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of hydrogen, and $7\\frac{1}{2}$ parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OXYGEN\">oxygen</a>; sulphate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a> always contains equal weights of sulphuric acid and black oxide of copper; and sulphate of barytes is always a compound of 100 parts by weight of sulphuric acid, and 194 of barytes.\n\nJ. B. Richter, who was for sometime Mining Secretary at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRESLAU\">Breslau</a>, and afterwards Arcanist in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PORCELAIN\">Porcelain</a> manufactory at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BERLIN\">Berlin</a>, where he died on the 4th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a> 1807, employed himself, during the whole of his life, in endeavouring to introduce the use of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol1.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a> into chemistry. His inaugural dissertation, printed in 1789, was entitled *De usu mathematicos in chymia*. In the year 1792, he published the first part of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> entitled *Anfangsgr\u00fcnde der Stochiometrie, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ODER\">oder</a> Messkunst chymischer Elemente; Foundation of Stochiometry, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">geometry</a> of the chemical elements*. This work he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to publish in successive parts, in 1793, 1794, 1795, 1802. Richter observed, that when two neutral salts, which mutually decompose each other, are mixed together, the two new salts which are formed still retain the same neutral state as the two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> ones from which they were formed. Thus, sulphate of potash, and nitrate of barytes, are two neutral salts, which decompose each other when mutually mixed; sulphate of barytes, and nitrate of potash, being formed both in a neutral state. This circumstance enabled him to examine the accuracy of the results obtained by preceding experimenters, and he showed that the numbers assigned both by Bergman, Kirwan, and Wenzel, for the constituents of the salts, were inaccurate, as they were unable to stand the test of this double decomposition. He was induced, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, to make a new set of experiments, in order to determine the constituents of the salts with more precision, and these experiments occupied him about ten years. He first analyzed the alkaline and earthy muriates and sulphates, then the nitrates, then the fluutes, then the carbonates, oxalates, succinates, tartrates, citrates, acetates, and some others; and lastly the phosphates. He placed in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of each of the bases required to saturate 100 parts of muriatic acid, beginning with that base of which the smallest quantity was necessary for the purpose, and terminating with the base of which the greatest quantity was requisite. Similar tables were drawn up, representing the weight of the different bases requisite to saturate 100 parts of sulphuric acid, nitric acid, carbonic acid, and all the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a> contained in the different genera of salts which he had subjected to analysis. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of these tables with each other enabled him to draw the two following remarkable consequences: First, The different bases follow exactly the same order in all the tables, and that order is as follows:\n\n- Alumina.\n- <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNESIA\">Magnesia</a>.\n- <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol2.html#article-AMMONIA\">Ammonia</a>.\n- Lime.\n- <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SODA\">Soda</a>.\n- Strontian.\n- Potash.\n- Barytes.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">Second</a>, The numbers in each table constitute a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a>, which have the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a> to each other in all the tables. Suppose, for example, that in the table representing the muriates, the quantity of potash requisite to saturate 100 parts of muriatic acid were three times as great as the quantity of alumina requisite to produce the same effect, the same thing would hold in the sulphates, nitrates, and all the other genera of salts. Three times as much potash would be requisite to saturate 100 sulphuric, nitric, or any other acid, as would be required of alumina. In the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>, if three times as much barytes be requisite to saturate a given weight of one acid as is required of lime, the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> will hold when we saturate any other acid; with these earths we must always employ three times as much barytes as of lime. When the quantity of each of the acids requisite to saturate a given weight of each successive base, was placed in tables in a similar way, it was found, as might have been anticipated, that the acids followed precisely the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a>.\n\nThese facts explain why, when two neutral salts decompose each other, the new formed salts are also neutral, and why there is never any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a> of acid or base upon the one side or the other. The same proportions of bases that saturate a given weight of one acid, saturate all the other acids, and the same proportion of acids that saturate one base, saturate all the other bases. Hence numbers may be attached to each acid and base, indicating the weight of it which will saturate the weights attached to all the other bases or acids. This accordingly was done by Fischer from Richter's experiments and tables. We shall here insert his numbers, not because they are accurate, which is very far from being the case, but because they constitute the first specimen of the kind ever offered to the chemical world. (Berthollet's *Essai de Statique Chimique*, I. 136.)\n\n| Alumina | Fluoric acid |\n|---------|-------------|\n| Magnesia | Carbonic acid |\n| Ammonia | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEBACIC_ACID\">Sebacic acid</a> |\n| Lime    | Muriatic acid |\n| Soda    | Oxalic acid |\n| Strontian | Phosphoric acid |\n| Potash  | Formic acid |\n\n5\nAccording to this table, 525 of alumina is saturated by 427 of fluoric acid, 377 of carbonic acid, 755 of oxalic acid, 1000 sulphuric acid, &c.; and 427 of fluoric acid, is saturated by 525 of alumina, 615 of magnesia, 672 of ammonia, &c. It is obvious, therefore, that this table, supposing it accurate, would give us the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of all the salts into which the bases and acids contained in it enter.\n\nM. Proust, a French chemist of great sagacity, who was settled as Professor of Chemistry at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MADRID\">Madrid</a>, was the first person who attempted an accurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of metallic oxides. He studied the oxides of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZINC\">zinc</a>, arsenic, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTIMONY\">antimony</a>, &c. The result of his examination was, that every metal is capable of forming a certain determinate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of oxides and no more. Zinc forms only one oxide; iron, arsenic, and antimony, form two each; tin forms three, &c. Each of these oxides he found composed of a determinate proportion of metal, and oxygen, which remained always the same in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>. Thus, the oxide of zinc, according to him, is always a compound of 100 parts zinc, and 25 oxygen. The two oxides of iron are the black and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>. If iron be combined with oxygen at all, it is either connected with the quantity of oxygen which constitutes the black oxide, or with the quantity which constitutes the red oxide, but it is incapable of uniting with any other proportion of oxygen. Wherever iron, already in the state of black oxide, combines with more oxygen, it becomes red oxide, being incapable of existing in any intermediate state between the black and the red oxide. The same law holds with respect to tin, antimony, arsenic, and all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-METALS\">metals</a>; thus, M. Proust proved that metals unite only with determinate proportions of oxygen, which may be assigned in numbers. He showed that the same law held with respect to the combinations of the metals with sulphur. When Berthollet published his Chemical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATICS\">Statics</a>, one of his objects was to show that there are two proportions of oxygen which unite with metals, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINIMUM\">minimum</a> and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MAXIMUM\">maximum</a>, and that between these two extremes, usually placed at a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> from each other, there are an infinity of proportions of oxygen capable of uniting with every metal. Hence he inferred that there is no such thing as permanent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEFINITE\">definite</a> metallic oxides; but an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFINITE\">infinite</a> number of shades of oxidization graduating into each other, and each capable of uniting with acids, and thus of forming an infinite variety of salts, differing from each other by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> shades of character. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, which, if correct, would have put an effectual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> to all chemical investigation, as it would have been useless and absurd to attempt to examine compounds, which had no permanence and no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> to each other, occasioned a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a> between Proust and Berthollet. Proust showed, by decisive experiments, that the indefinite numbers of metallic oxide, supposed by Berthollet, does not exist, and that metals are only capable of combining with 1, 2, or 3 doses of oxygen; that there is no indefinite number of oxides between the black and the red oxides of iron; but that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INSTANT\">instant</a> that iron combined with more oxygen than existed in the black oxide, it is converted into the red oxide.\n\nSuch was the state of the subject when Mr. Dalton turned his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to the combination of bodies with each other about the year 1804. At that period, it was known that hydrogen combines only in one proportion with oxygen; that carbon, sulphur, and phosphorus, unite each in two proportions; that carbon unites in two proportions with hydrogen, sulphur in two proportions with the same substance, and phosphorus in one proportion; that azote unites in one proportion with hydrogen, and in four proportions with oxygen. It was known, too, that several of the metals combine with only one dose of oxygen, while some unite with two doses, and others with three. It had been ascertained, that, in certain cases, when metals combine with two doses of oxygen, the second dose is exactly double the first dose, while in other cases it is to the first dose as 3 to 2. Thus, in platinum, the second oxide contains <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> double the quantity of oxygen that the first oxide contains, while in iron, the quantity of oxygen in the red oxide, is, to the quantity in the black oxide, as 3 to 2. None of the combinations of oxygen or hydrogen, with the simple combustibles, had been accurately analyzed; though approximations to a correct analysis of most of them existed, and what was chiefly wanting, was a criterion for distinguishing the comparative merits of the different analysis of these bodies which had been presented to the chemical world.\n\nMr. Dalton was struck with the small number of compounds which the elementary bodies are capable of forming with each other, and with the very simple relations which existed between the numbers that denote the weight of the different constituents in these compounds; and he set himself <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to endeavour to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> for these circumstances not hitherto inquired into. Water, he found, was always a compound of 1 part by weight of hydrogen, and 8 parts by weight of oxygen.\n\n| Compound                  | Weight |\n|---------------------------|--------|\n| Carbonic oxide            | 750    |\n| Carbonic acid             | 750    |\n| Sulphurous acid           | 2      |\n| Sulphuric acid            | 2      |\n| Nitrous oxide             | 175    |\n| Nitrous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAS\">gas</a>               | 175    |\n| Nitrous acid              | 175    |\n| Nitric acid               | 175    |\n\n* In the following examples, instead of using the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> analysis with which Mr. Dalton was obliged to be satisfied, and which misled him in some cases, we have thought it better to employ the most precise experiments hitherto made.\nNow, in all these compounds, it will be perceived, that the numbers denoting the oxygen, united to a given weight of the same base, bear a very simple and obvious ratio to each other. The oxygen in carbonic acid is twice as great as in carbonic oxide; the oxygen in sulphuric acid is to that in sulphurous as the numbers 3 to 2; while the oxygen, in the respective compounds of azote and oxygen, bears the ratio of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 5.\n\nThese and many other similar examples which Mr Dalton registered and examined, but which it is unnecessary to state here, led him to the lucky idea that the atoms of bodies unite together; that the atom of each body has a determinate weight, and that this weight regulates the proportion in which bodies combine with each other. Let us suppose, for example, that water is formed by the union of one atom of oxygen, with one atom of hydrogen, it follows, as the oxygen in water is 8 times that of the hydrogen, that the weight of an atom of oxygen is to that of an atom of hydrogen as 8 to 1. So that, if we represent the weight of an atom of hydrogen by 1, that of an atom of oxygen will be 8; or if, as is more convenient in practice, we pitch upon 1 for the weight of an atom of oxygen, an atom of hydrogen will weigh 0.125. As carbon unites with two proportions of oxygen, we may suppose that an atom of carbon unites with 1 atom, and with 2 atoms of oxygen. Hence, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> why the quantity of oxygen in carbonic acid is twice as great as in carbonic oxide. If an atom of oxygen weigh 1, it is obvious that an atom of carbon will weigh 0.751, supposing the numbers which we have given in the preceding table to be accurate. It is equally obvious, that sulphurous acid must contain 2 atoms of oxygen, and sulphuric acid 3 atoms; and that an atom of sulphur will weigh 2, on the supposition that an atom of oxygen weighs 1. Finally, nitrous oxide is a compound of 1 atom azote, and 1 atom oxygen; nitrous gas of 1 atom azote, and 2 atoms oxygen; nitrous acid of 1 atom azote, and 3 atoms oxygen; and nitric acid of 1 atom azote, and 5 atoms oxygen. And, supposing the numbers in our table correct, if an atom of oxygen weigh 1, an atom of azote will weigh 1.75.\n\nMr Dalton did not rest satisfied with this simple and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUMINOUS\">luminous</a> explanation, which threw a new and strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> around chemical combinations\u2014which afforded the means of correcting and checking chemical experiments, hitherto conducted without any guide, and promised, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, to introduce mathematical precision, and mathematical reasoning, into a science which hitherto has been able only to boast of analogical and probable conclusions. He contrived a set of symbols to represent the different elements, and make the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the combinations which they form obvious to the eye of the most careless reader. A few examples will be sufficient to make the nature and use of these symbols perfectly well understood.\n\nLet \\( O \\) be an atom of oxygen\n\n- \\( O \\) - - - - hydrogen\n- \\( O \\) - - - - azote\n- \\( O \\) - - - - carbon\n\nLet \\( \\oplus \\) be an atom of sulphur\n\n- \\( \\oplus \\) - - - - phosphorus,\n\nThen \\( \\bigcirc \\) represents an integrant particle\n\n- \\( \\bigcirc \\) - - - - of water\n- \\( \\bigcirc \\) - - - - of carbonic oxide\n- \\( \\bigcirc \\) - - - - of carbonic acid\n- \\( \\bigcirc \\) - - - - of sulphurous acid\n- \\( \\bigcirc \\) - - - - of nitrous oxide\n- \\( \\bigcirc \\) - - - - of nitrous gas\n- \\( \\bigcirc \\) - - - - of nitrous acid\n- \\( \\bigcirc \\) - - - - of nitric acid\n- \\( \\bigcirc \\) - - - - of carbureted hydrogen\n- \\( \\bigcirc \\) - - - - of olefiant gas.\n\nIt would be easy to multiply these symbols much farther; but the preceding specimen is sufficient, we conceive, to make the use of them understood, and even to make Mr Dalton's doctrine more simple to those who are still strangers to it. Mr Dalton has already published two volumes of what he entitles a New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYSTEM\">System</a> of Chemical Philosophy, in order to explain and show the accuracy and importance of this doctrine. Our object, in the present article, will be to lay the whole of it in its present state before our readers. But we must, in the first place, trace the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of the improvements which it has received to its termination.\n\nIn the year 1809, M. Gay-Lussac, who had already distinguished himself by many important chemical discoveries, and who was well acquainted with Mr Dalton's theory, published a curious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> on the combinations of gaseous substances with each other. (Memoires d'Arcueil, II. 205.) He showed that they follow a very simple law in their combinations; that one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of one gas always combines either with one volume of another gas, or with two volumes, or with three volumes. Thus,\n\n1 volume ammonia saturates 1 vol. of muriatic acid\n1 vol. of carbonic acid\n1 vol. of fluoboric acid.\n\nThe resulting compounds are neutral muriate, carbonate, and fluoborate of ammonia.\n\nNitrous gas is composed of one volume of azote, and one volume of oxygen.\n\nSubcarbonate of ammonia is composed of one volume carbonic acid, and two volumes ammoniacal gas.\n\nSubfluoborate of ammonia of one volume fluoboric acid, and two volumes ammoniacal gas.\nWater of one volume of oxygen, and two volumes of hydrogen gas. Nitrous oxide of one volume oxygen, and two volumes azote. Nitric acid of one volume oxygen, and two volumes nitrous gas. Sulphuric acid of one volume oxygen, and two volumes sulphurous acid. Carbonic acid gas of one volume oxygen, and two volumes carbonic oxide.\n\nFinally, ammonia is composed of one volume azote, and three volumes hydrogen; and nitrous acid gas of one volume oxygen, and three volumes of nitrous gas.\n\nGay-Lussac showed likewise, that the diminution of volume which takes place on the combination of these gases, follows as simple a law as the volumes in which they combine. In nitrous gas, the oxygen and azote undergo no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONDENSATION\">condensation</a>. Accordingly, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIFIC\">specific</a> gravity of nitrous gas is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> between that of oxygen and azote. Frequently one of the two gases retains its bulk unaltered, while the other totally disappears. Thus, when 100 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> of carbonic oxide, and 50 measures of oxygen gas, are united together by combination, the resulting compound constitutes 100 measures of carbonic acid. Sometimes the bulk is reduced to one half. Thus, when 100 measures of azote, and 300 measures of hydrogen, are united, they form 200 measures of ammoniacal gas.\n\nThis curious law, discovered by Gay-Lussac, when coupled with the doctrine of Mr Dalton, shows us, that there exists a very simple relation between the weight of the atoms and the bulk of the gaseous bodies. Accordingly, the weight of the atoms of these bodies may be deduced, with sufficient accuracy, from their specific gravity. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> was employed both by Sir Humphry Davy and Dr Wollaston.\n\nProfessor Berzelius of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STOCKHOLM\">Stockholm</a>, one of the most accurate and indefatigable chemists of the present time, was led, some years ago, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> the composition of the salts, in consequence of the perusal of Richter's Stoichiometry. He soon satisfied himself that neither the analyses of Richter, nor of preceding chemists, could be depended on for accuracy. He resolved, therefore, to institute a new analysis of a considerable number of saline bodies, and to be at particular pains to ensure the greatest possible precision which the present state of the science enabled him to attain. The result of this laborious undertaking has been published in the Annales de Chimie, the Annalen der Physik, Nicholson's Journal, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANNALS\">Annals</a> of Philosophy. It constitutes by far the most complete and valuable set of chemical analyses of which the science is possessed. Berzelius not only satisfied himself of the accuracy of Richter's law, but was so fortunate as to discover another of a very unexpected nature, and of the greatest importance in chemical analysis, because it enables us to subject the results of all our analyses to calculation, and thus to determine with certainty how far their accuracy may be depended on. All the acids, with a very few exceptions, contain oxygen. This is the case likewise with all the salifiable bases, so that the salts may be considered as combinations of two sets of oxides with each other. Now, Berzelius compared the oxygen in the base of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> with the oxygen in its acid, and he found that they always bore a very simple relation to each other. They were either equal, or the oxygen in the acid was twice as much as that in the base, or thrice as much, or four times as much, &c. If the acid contained twice as much oxygen as the base, this was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> that the acid contained two atoms of oxygen; if it contained thrice as much, it contained three atoms of oxygen, and so on. Thus, in the sulphates, the sulphuric acid contains three times as much oxygen as the quantity of base which it saturates. Hence we infer, that sulphuric acid is a compound of 1 atom sulphur, and 3 atoms oxygen. In the sulphites, the acid contains twice as much oxygen as the base which it saturates. Hence, we infer that sulphurous acid is composed of 1 atom sulphur, and 2 atoms oxygen. In the carbonates, the oxygen in the acid is twice as much as in the base which it saturates. Hence we infer that carbonic acid is composed of 1 atom of carbon, and 2 atoms of oxygen.\n\nBerzelius, during his experimental investigation of the atomic theory, met with some objections which he was not able immediately to surmount. In consequence of these difficulties, he substituted for the atomic theory what he calls the theory of volumes, derived from Gay-Lussac's discovery respecting the proportions in point of volume in which gaseous substances combine. This is merely substituting another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> for the atomic theory. For it is easy to show, that the theory of volumes, as Berzelius considers it, is precisely the same thing as Dalton's atomic theory. The difficulties of Berzelius will come under our consideration hereafter.\n\nAfter the preceding historical sketch, which we thought necessary in order to do <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> to all parties concerned in this important branch of chemistry, we shall proceed to lay the atomic theory, with the proofs in support of it, before our readers.\n\nI. Outline of the Atomic Theory.\n\nWith respect to the nature of the ultimate elements of bodies, we have no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> means of obtaining accurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a>. But it is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> opinion, that they consist of atoms or minute particles, incapable of farther division. It is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to demonstrate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of this opinion; but, for our part, we can conceive no other. It has been almost universally admitted, by mechanical philosophers, since the time of Newton. We shall, therefore, adopt it here as the foundation of our reasoning.\n\nWhen two bodies unite chemically, so as to form a third body, the two substances combined are dispersed everywhere through the new compound. Water, for example, is composed of oxygen and hydrogen. Now, how minute a portion soever of water we examine, we shall find it to contain both oxygen and hydrogen. Saltpetre is a compound of nitric acid and potash. If we examine the salt, whether we take an ounce or the hundredth part of a grain, we shall always find it to be a compound of nitric acid and potash. If any portion of it were to want one of these constituents, it would no longer be saltpetre; it would be potash, or nitric acid, according to the constituent which is not present. Limestone is a compound of carbonic acid and lime. Now, we\nmay reduce it to an impalpable powder; but if we take one of the grains of this powder, however small, and throw it into nitric acid, we shall perceive an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EFFERVESCENCE\">effervescence</a>, indicating the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a> of carbonic acid, and it will dissolve, indicating that lime was also one of its constituents. Mechanical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRITURATION\">trituration</a>, however carefully made, is quite incapable of separating from each other substances which are chemically combined. Now, this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a> of the constituents could never be so complete through every part of the compound, unless it were the atoms of the combined bodies that united with each other. This, accordingly, is the opinion respecting chemical combinations, which appears always to have been entertained by chemical philosophers. Nor do we believe that any person will be disposed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CALL\">call</a> its truth in question.\n\nAll chemical compounds contain the same constant proportion of constituents with the most rigid accuracy, no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> whatever ever taking place. Water is universally a compound of 1 part by weight of hydrogen, and 8 of oxygen; sulphuric acid, of 1 part sulphur, and 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) oxygen; carbonic acid, of 1 part carbon, and 2.666 of oxygen. This permanency in the constituents of chemical compounds, indeed, is generally admitted. It constitutes, in fact, the basis of the whole science. For, if the proportions of the constituents of bodies were variable, chemical analysis would be nugatory, and the whole science of little importance. Even Berthollet, who contends for indefinite proportions in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a>, admits the incontrovertible fact that the proportions of chemical combinations in general are permanent.\n\nSince, then, bodies unite chemically atom to atom; and since they always unite in the same proportions, without the smallest deviation, this regularity can be ascribed to nothing else than the constant union of one atom of one body with one atom of another; or of a determinate number of atoms of one body with a determinate number of atoms of another. At first sight, it may appear impossible to determine how many atoms of each constituent combine with an indefinite number of atoms of the other. But there are some circumstances which afford us considerable assistance in this apparently intricate investigation.\n\nThus, oxygen has the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of uniting in different proportions with the same base; sometimes in two, sometimes in three, sometimes in four, &c., proportions. Thus, with carbon it unites in two proportions, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a> in two, with copper in two. With tin it unites in three proportions, while with manganese it unites in four proportions. Now, if we represent the weight of base with which the oxygen unites by \\(a\\), and suppose all the different proportions of oxygen to unite with this proportion of base; and if we denote the first portion of oxygen by \\(b\\), then, in general, the constituents of the different compounds formed by the union of the different doses of oxygen with the base will be as follows:\n\n1st compound \\(a + b\\).\n2d compound \\(a + 2b\\).\n3d compound \\(a + 3b\\).\n4th compound \\(a + 4b\\).\n\nSuppose 10 parts of oxygen enter into the first compound, then 20 parts enter into the second, 30 parts into the third, and 40 parts into the fourth compound. Hence, whatever number of atoms enter into the first compound, twice that number enters into the second compound, thrice the number into the third compound, and four times the number into the fourth compound. Hence it is clear, that there is a determinate number of atoms of oxygen, which always enter into these combinations. If we represent this number by \\(x\\), then \\(a + x\\) is the first compound, \\(a + 2x\\) the second, \\(a + 3x\\) the third, and \\(a + 4x\\) the fourth. Now, it would be singular, if 2, 3, 4, &c., atoms of oxygen, were to be always inseparably linked together, so as never to be able to enter into combinations separate. It is much more simple to conceive, that \\(x\\) represents only 1 atom. Indeed, there can be little doubt that this is actually the case. For oxygen gas, being a permanently <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> fluid, must consist of atoms that repel each other. Hence a compound atom of oxygen, or a number of atoms united together, seems to be impossible. But even though the opinion that \\(x\\) represents one atom should not be mathematically true, still it would be proper to adopt it. For, as far as our calculations are concerned, a number of atoms of oxygen, constantly and invariably united together, would constitute a compound atom, about which we may reason as accurately and justly as we could do about the simple atoms themselves. But if \\(x\\) in these combinations be considered as representing an atom of oxygen, there can be no doubt that \\(a\\) represents an atom of the body, which unites with oxygen. So that, by knowing the proportions in which they unite, we have the relative weight of an atom of oxygen, and of the body with which it unites.\n\nThis reasoning may be applied to hydrogen as well as oxygen. Hydrogen has the property of uniting in different proportions with various bodies, as with carbon, phosphorus, sulphur, &c. In these different proportions, we find the hydrogen always denoted by \\(y\\), \\(2y\\), &c., just as is the case with oxygen. Hence we have the same reason for concluding that \\(y\\), which represents the minimum of hydrogen which unites with the other constituent, is an atom.\n\nThe numbers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are easily discovered by making an accurate analysis of the different compounds into which various proportions of oxygen and hydrogen enter; and, when reduced to their lowest terms, they are very nearly \\(x = 8\\), and \\(y = 1\\). Hence these numbers represent the ratios of the weight of an atom of oxygen and an atom of hydrogen to each other. Now, it deserves attention, that these numbers represent the composition of water. For it has been ascertained, by very careful experiments, that water is composed of 100 measures of oxygen gas, and 200 measures of hydrogen gas. Now, the specific gravity of these gases is as follows:\n\n| Substance | Specific Gravity |\n|-----------|-----------------|\n| Oxygen    | 1.111           |\n| Hydrogen  | 0.069           |\n\nHence water is composed by weight of\n\n| Substance | Weight Ratio |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| Oxygen    | 8.00        |\n| Hydrogen  | 1.00        |\nFrom this coincidence we are entitled to conclude, that water is formed by the union of an atom of oxygen with an atom of hydrogen. And consequently, that an atom of hydrogen is to an atom of oxygen in weight, as 1 to 8. This very important conclusion is supported by other considerations. Oxygen and hydrogen have never been made to combine in any other proportion than that in which they exist in water. Hence this proportion must be that which unites most readily and with the greatest force. Now, as the atoms of hydrogen repel each other, as is the case also with the atoms of oxygen, it is obvious, that when they are mixed equably, as is the case when 200 measures of hydrogen gas, and 100 measures of oxygen gas, are put into a tube and fired by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTRICITY\">electricity</a>, they will most readily unite atom to atom. This, though not in itself decisive, is a corroborating circumstance. It follows from it, that a given bulk of hydrogen gas contains only one half the number of atoms which exist in the same bulk of oxygen gas.\n\nBut we must not conceal that there is another view of this subject, which has been taken by Davy and Berzelius, and certainly possesses much plausibility. It is founded on this curious fact, first noticed, we believe, by Dr Wollaston, and confirmed by the theory of Gay-Lussac, detailed in the historical introduction to this article, that if we determine the weight of an atom of the gaseous bodies from their specific gravity (or at least a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MULTIPLE\">multiple</a> of it), the numbers obtained will correspond with the atomic theory, as well as the numbers found by the method above described, which is the method of Dalton. In fact, they will always be the same numbers, or their halves or their doubles. This shows us, that a very simple relation exists between the bulk of a gas and the number of atoms which it contains. If the weight of an atom of a gas were always the same as its specific gravity, it would follow, that the same bulk of every gas contains always the same number of atoms. But cases occur in which this simple rule does not answer. Thus, it is admitted even by Davy and Berzelius, that the weight of an atom of azote is twice that of its specific gravity. So that, in a given <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of azotic gas, there is only one half of the number of atoms that exist in an equal measure of oxygen gas.\n\nThose who found their weights of the atoms of bodies on the specific gravity of the gases, consider water as composed of 2 atoms of hydrogen, and 1 atom of oxygen. If this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> be correct, the weight of an atom of hydrogen, is to that of an atom of oxygen, as 1 to 16. This is nearly the proportion given by Davy and Berzelius. Davy, who rejects decimals, makes an atom of hydrogen weigh 1, and an atom of oxygen 15. Berzelius makes an atom of oxygen weigh 15.069, supposing that of hydrogen to weigh 1. As oxygen and hydrogen cannot be united in any other than 1 proportion, we have no means of putting it to the test of experiment. But the example of azote (admitted at least by Davy, though Berzelius, by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>, that azote is a compound of nitricum and oxygen, gets over the difficulty) is sufficient to show us that it is not necessary that the weights of the atoms of gases should be directly as the specific gravity of these bodies. On this account, the reasons before urged in favour of the opinion, that water is a compound of 1 atom of oxygen, and 1 atom of hydrogen, seems to us sufficient to give a preponderancy to this opinion, and to induce us to embrace it.\n\nKnowing the weight of an atom of oxygen, and an atom of hydrogen, we have it in our power to determine the weight of an atom of the other substances, which unite with oxygen or with hydrogen, or with both. For example, 100 parts of sulphur unite with two proportions of oxygen, namely, with 100 parts constituting sulphurous acid, and with 150 parts constituting sulphuric acid, both by weight. Here, the proportions of oxygen being to each other as the numbers 1:1\u00bd or 2:3; it is reasonable to suppose, that the first proportion represents 2 atoms of oxygen, and the second 3 atoms. There may, perhaps, exist another compound, consisting of 1 atom sulphur, and 1 atom oxygen, or by weight of 100 sulphur and 50 oxygen. But such a compound is at present unknown. It is evident, if sulphurous acid be composed of 1 atom sulphur, and 2 atoms oxygen, that an atom of sulphur is twice as heavy as an atom of oxygen. So that if we were to represent the weight of an atom of oxygen by 8, that of an atom of sulphur would be 16. Davy makes an atom of oxygen 15. Accordingly, his atom of sulphur is represented by 30.\n\nWe have it in our power to verify this reasoning by means of the combinations which sulphur makes with hydrogen. This verification may be made two ways, and we shall employ both to show how they serve to corroborate one another. 1. It has been ascertained, that 100 measures of hydrogen gas may be united to sulphur, and converted into sulphureted hydrogen gas, without undergoing any change of bulk. Hence, to know with precision the composition of sulphureted hydrogen, we have only to determine with care the specific gravity of hydrogen gas, and sulphureted hydrogen gas. Now,\n\n100 cubic inches of hydrogen gas weigh 2.117 grains.\n100 cubic inches of sulphur. hyd. gas 35.89.\n\nHence it follows, that sulphureted hydrogen gas is composed of\n\n| Hydrogen | - - - | 2.117 or 1.00 |\n| Sulphur  | - - - | 33.773 16.00 |\n\nThis shows us, that if sulphureted hydrogen gas is composed of 1 atom sulphur, and 1 atom hydrogen, and if we suppose an atom of hydrogen to weigh 1, an atom of sulphur will weigh 16. The combination of oxygen and sulphur gave us 16. Thus the two processes of reasoning <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> to the same conclusion, since the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> really existing is greatly within the limits of the unavoidable errors in such kinds of experiment. 2. Sulphureted hydrogen gas requires for its complete <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMBUSTION\">combustion</a> 1\u00bd times its bulk of oxygen gas. The products of the combustions are sulphurous acid and water. The sulphurous acid gas amounts exactly to the bulk of the sulphureted hydrogen gas consumed. Suppose 100 measures of sulphureted hydrogen gas to\nbe burned. We must employ for the purpose 130 measures of oxygen gas. The gaseous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRODUCT\">product</a> consists of 100 measures of sulphurous acid gas; 100 measures of the oxygen gas go to the formation of the sulphurous acid gas, and 50 measures go to the formation of water. Now, 100 cubic inches of sulphurous acid gas weigh 66.89 grains, and contain 33.445 grains of sulphur; 50 cubic inches of oxygen combine with 100 cubic inches of hydrogen, or with 2.117 grains. So that, according to this analysis, sulphureted hydrogen is composed of\n\n| Hydrogen | 2.117 or 1.000 |\n|----------|----------------|\n| Sulphur  | 33.445         |\n\nSo that, according to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a>, the weight of an atom of sulphur is 15.8. This differs only .2 from the preceding, and is also within the limits of the unavoidable errors of chemical experiment. We may, therefore, consider these two methods of determining the weight of an atom of sulphur as all coinciding, and giving absolutely the same result.\n\nBy a similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of reasoning, we may determine, with considerable accuracy, the weight of an atom of azote, phosphorus, carbon, the metals, and almost all those bodies which at present are considered as simple. It would be tedious to give any more illustrations here. Enough, we conceive, has been said to explain the nature of the theory, and to render the manner of proceeding in determining the weights of the atoms of bodies intelligible to the reader. In a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> part of this article, we shall give a table of the weights of the atoms of bodies, and state, at the same time, the documents on which these weights are founded.\n\nIt is hardly necessary to observe, how very powerfully a particular conclusion is confirmed, when we arrive at it by different processes. This advantage we have in full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a>, when we set about determining the weight of the atoms of the simple substances. In most cases, we come to the same conclusions by two, three, or four different methods. These coincidences could not exist, unless the conclusions were well founded.\n\nWith respect to the number of atoms capable of uniting together, no general rule can be given. In organic bodies, this number is often very great. Hence, probably, the reason why we cannot succeed in our attempts to form animal and vegetable bodies. In unorganic bodies, the number of atoms united is much smaller. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIMARY\">primary</a> compounds, we do not recollect an example of any substance containing more than 7 atoms. These atoms are always confined to two different kinds of matter, as hydrogen and oxygen, carbon and oxygen, sulphur and oxygen, carbon and hydrogen, sulphur and phosphorus, &c. We never find three different kinds of matter united together in any primary compound, provided it does not belong to the vegetable or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANIMAL_KINGDOM\">animal <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>. For primary compounds of organized matter contain usually three, and sometimes four, or even five or six, different kinds of substances; as hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen; hydrogen, carbon, azote, oxygen; hydrogen, carbon, azote, iron, oxygen; hydrogen, car-\n\nbon, azote, phosphorus, sulphur, oxygen. According to Berzelius, one of the constituents of unorganized bodies always amounts only to 1 atom. This law certainly holds in the primary compounds. Whether it holds in those compounds called salts, is not so clear. We shall be better able to judge, when we have examined the composition of the salts in a subsequent part of this article.\n\nIn organic bodies, on the contrary, none of the constituents exists of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> to the amount of 1 atom; though this may sometimes happen from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCIDENT\">accident</a>. Hence the reasons of the very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPLEX\">complex</a> nature of organic bodies, and the numerous modifications of most of them that exist.\n\nThe secondary compounds, or those bodies formed by the union of primary compounds with each other, are of a much more complex nature. They frequently contain three or four different ingredients united together; as, for example, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALUM\">alum</a>, tartar emetic, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROCHELLE\">Rochelle</a> salt. Now, as each of these constituents is composed of several atoms, it is obvious, that the composition of the secondary compounds is much more complicated than that of the primary compounds. It will be convenient, on that account, to consider each separately.\n\nII. Weight of the Atoms of the Simple Substances.\n\nBefore we can draw up a table of the relative weights of the simple substances, we must fix upon some one whose atom shall be represented by unity. Mr Dalton has made choice of hydrogen for this purpose, because it is the lightest of all known bodies. Sir Humphry Davy has followed his example; but he has doubled the weight of an atom of oxygen, and of most other bodies, by the arbitrary supposition, that water is composed of 2 atoms of hydrogen, and 1 atom of oxygen. Dr Wollaston, Professor Berzelius, and Dr Thomson, have adopted oxygen as the most convenient unit; nor can there be any hesitation in embracing their plans. Oxygen is, in fact, the substance by means of which the weights of the atoms of almost all other bodies are determined. It enters into a much greater number of combinations than any other known body. Hence, if we denote the weight of its atom by 1, a considerable convenience will result to the practical chemist. We shall exhibit the weights of the atoms of the simple bodies, under the form of tables, and we shall state at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> of each, the documents by means of which these weights were obtained.\n\n1. Simple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUPPORTERS\">Supporters</a>.\n\n| Substances | Weight of Atom |\n|------------|---------------|\n| Oxygen     | 1.000         |\n| Chlorine   | 4.500         |\n| Iodine     | 15.621        |\n\nOxygen having been chosen for the unit, we have already stated our reasons for the weight assigned. The weight is arbitrary, and adopted merely for the sake of convenience.\n\nChlorous oxide (the euchlorine of Davy) is composed of 2 volumes of chlorine gas, and 1 volume of\nThe specific gravity of chlorine gas is 2.483; that of oxygen gas 1.104. If we suppose chlorous acid to be composed of 1 atom chlorine, and 1 atom oxygen, a supposition which gives the simplest view of the composition of the chlorides, we have for the weight of an atom of chlorine this proportion, \\( \\frac{1.104}{2.483} = \\frac{1}{2} \\) or 0.498 = the weight of an atom of chlorine.\n\nThe weight of an atom of iodine is the result of the experiments of Gay-Lussac, and may be considered as nearly correct. But we could not explain, in this place, the manner of conducting the experiments by which it was ascertained, without entering into details respecting the properties of this newly discovered substance that would be quite foreign to the present article.\n\n### 2. Simple Combustibles\n\n| Substances | Weight of an Atom |\n|------------|------------------|\n| Hydrogen   | 0.125            |\n| Boron      | 0.733            |\n| Carbon     | 0.750            |\n| Phosphorus | 1.625            |\n| Azote      | 1.750            |\n| Sulphur    | 2.000            |\n| Silicon    | 2.000            |\n\nThe method of determining the weight of an atom of hydrogen has been explained in a preceding part of this article. It was there shown from the composition of water, that the weight of an atom of hydrogen is to that of an atom of oxygen as 1 to 7.56. Now, \\( \\frac{7.56}{1} : 1 : 0.125 = \\text{weight of an atom of hydrogen} \\). We have given 0.125 in the table, as the weight of an atom of hydrogen, because we consider it as established by a paper in the *Annals of Philosophy*, Vol. VI. p. 322, that the specific gravity of oxygen is 16 times that of hydrogen.\n\nThe experiments of Davy on the combustion of boron in oxygen gas, and those of Berzelius on the borates (*Annals of Philosophy*, Vol. III. p. 66), have shown that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BORACIC_ACID\">boracic acid</a> is composed of 100 oxygen + 36.649 boron. The resemblance between boron and carbon is so great, that it is very probable they will be analogous to each other in the proportion of oxygen with which they combine. Now, we shall see afterwards that carbonic acid is a compound of 1 atom carbon, and 2 atoms oxygen. Supposing boracic acid to be a compound of 1 atom boron, and 2 atoms oxygen, to determine the weight of an atom of boron, we have this proportion \\( \\frac{100}{2} : 36.649 : : 1 : 0.733 = \\text{weight of an atom of boron} \\).\n\nWhen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CHARCOAL\">charcoal</a> is burnt in oxygen gas, the bulk of the gas is not altered; it is merely converted into carbonic acid gas. Therefore, if we subtract the specific gravity of oxygen gas from that of carbonic acid gas, the remainder denotes the quantity of carbon in carbonic united with the weight of oxygen indicated by the specific gravity. Now,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Grains.} \\\\\n100 \\text{ cubic inches of carbonic acid weigh } & 46.313 \\\\\n100 \\text{ oxygen gas } & 33.672 \\\\\n\\text{Remainder, } & 12.641\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTherefore carbonic acid is composed of\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Carbon} & - 12.641 \\text{ or } 27.29 \\\\\n\\text{Oxygen} & - 33.672 \\text{ or } 72.71 \\\\\n& 100.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nWe shall see afterwards that carbonic acid is composed of 1 atom carbon + 2 atoms oxygen. Therefore, to find the weight of an atom of carbon, we have this proportion, \\( \\frac{72.71}{2} : 27.29 : : 1 : 0.751 = \\text{weight of an atom of carbon} \\).\n\nThe writer of this article has ascertained, by experiments which it would be too tedious to adduce here, that phosphoric acid is composed of 100 phosphorus + 123 oxygen, and that it consists of 1 atom phosphorus + 2 atoms oxygen. Hence the weight of an atom of phosphorus is 1.625.\n\nThe determination of the weight of an atom of azote is attended with considerable difficulty. We have no doubt, that it is in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a> a compound. But whether it consists of hydrogen united to oxygen, as is the opinion of Mr Miers, or of nitricum and oxygen, as Berzelius believes, has not yet been decided by satisfactory experiments. We must, therefore, in the present state of our knowledge, allow it a place among the undecomposed bodies. It scarcely belongs to the combustibles, as it does not in any case exhibit the phenomena of combustions. But we give it a place among them for want of any better situation under which it could be arranged. Azote combines with four proportions of oxygen, and constitutes four compounds, all of which have been analyzed with care. If we denominate the quantity of oxygen that unites with 100 parts of azote by \\( x \\), the following table will exhibit the constituents of these compounds.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Nitrous oxide} & . 100 \\text{ azote } + 1 x \\\\\n\\text{Nitrous gas} & . 100 \\text{ azote } + 2 x \\\\\n\\text{Nitrous acid} & . 100 \\text{ azote } + 3 x \\\\\n\\text{Nitric acid} & . 100 \\text{ azote } + 5 x\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nFrom this table there can be no doubt, that \\( x \\) represents an atom of oxygen. Hence we have only to ascertain the value of \\( x \\); to be able to determine the weight of an atom of azote. Now nitrous oxide, nitrous gas, and nitric acid, have been analyzed with care, and the number in the table is the mean resulting from these analyses.\n\nIt has been ascertained by many and careful experiments, that sulphurous and sulphuric acids are composed as follows:\nHence we see, that the first contains two atoms of oxygen, and the second three atoms of oxygen, combined each with one atom of sulphur. Therefore for the weight of an atom of sulphur, we have this proportion \\( \\frac{100}{2} : 100 : : 1 : 2 = \\text{weight of an atom of sulphur.} \\)\n\nThe atom of silicon, which is a combustible substance analogous to charcoal, the base of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> called silica, is derived from the experiments of Berzelius, for which we refer to his mineralogical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSAY\">essay</a>, lately translated into English, as it would not be possible to make these experiments intelligible here, without entering into details, quite inconsistent with the nature of this article. These details will probably find a place under the article Chemistry, to which therefore we refer the reader.\n\n### 3.

The weights of the atoms of the metals inserted, have been taken from the best documents at present in possession of chemists. But we are far from supposing that they are all correct. Some have little better than analogical reasoning in their favour, while the weight of others is founded upon a law discovered by Berzelius relative to the salts; namely, that the oxygen in the acid of a neutral salt, is always a multiple of the oxygen in the base, by 2, 3, 4, 5, &c. and this number is always constant for every particular acid.\n\nThe weight of an atom of aluminum is calculated from the composition of alum. This salt is a combination of sulphate of potash and sulphate of alumina. Sulphuric acid is saturated by a quantity of base containing one third of the oxygen in the acid. Knowing the analysis of the salt, we obtain from this law the quantity of oxygen in a given weight of alumina. If we suppose alumina a compound of 1 atom aluminum, and 1 atom oxygen, the weight of an atom of aluminum will be as in the table. This hypothesis, however, is quite arbitrary. But it seems better to be satisfied with it at present, because we are not in possession of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATA\">data</a> to enable us to reason on the subject. The weight of the atoms of the bases of the alkaline earths, and earths proper, were ascertained by a similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of reasoning. They are smaller than the weights of those atoms assigned by Berzelius, because he conceives them to be united with more than one atom of oxygen. We have given, however, in the table, the weight of an atom of glucinium, as determined by Berzelius in a set of new experiments, which he has published as an appendix to his treatise on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-MINERALOGY\">mineralogy</a>, above referred to. The weights of the atom of potassium and sodium, are obtained from the experiments of Davy, and Gay-Lussac, and Thenard. It appears that potash is a compound of 100 potassium, and 20 oxygen, and peroxide of potassium of 100 potassium, and 60 oxygen. Hence the weight of an atom of potassium is obvious. Soda is composed of 100 sodium and 34.1 oxygen; peroxide of sodium of 100 sodium, and 51.1. Now 34.1 is to 51.1 as 2:3. Hence soda must contain 2 atoms of oxygen. For its weight therefore we have this proportion \\( \\frac{34.1}{2} : 100 : : 1 : 5.882 = \\text{weight of an atom of sodium.} \\)\n\nAmmonium is a problematic substance which never yet has been obtained in a separate state. But when a globule of mercury is moistened with ammonia, and acted on by a galvanic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATTERY\">battery</a>, the mercury is converted into an amalgam of the consistence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a>, and not the fourth part of its original specific gravity. This fact cannot be explained any other way than by supposing ammonia to be a compound of oxygen, and an unknown metallic base which amalgamates with the mercury in the galvanic experiment. Analogy comes strongly in favour of this opinion. We are acquainted with nearly fifty bases which have the property of neutralizing acids, of which ammonia is one. Now it is known, that all the rest contain oxygen as a constituent. Hence, it would be singular if ammonia alone, of all\nthe bases, should constitute an exception to a general rule. There seems to be little doubt, that sal-ammoniac is a compound of chlorine and ammonium. This salt is formed by the union of equal volumes of muriatic acid gas, and ammoniacal gas. Hence, it consists of\n\nMuriatic acid - - 100\nAmmonia - - 46.178\n\nBy weight - - 146.178\n\nNow, muriatic acid is a compound of 75.731 chlorine, and 2.23 hydrogen. Therefore, 100 muriatic acid contain 2.86 hydrogen. We must suppose this hydrogen to find in the ammonia a quantity of oxygen capable of converting it into water. Now, 2.86 hydrogen require 21% oxygen to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> them into water. Therefore ammonia must be a compound of\n\nAmmonium 24.511 or 100.\nOxygen . . 21.666 88.39.\n\nNow, if ammonia be composed of 1 atom oxygen, and 1 atom ammonium, we have, for finding the weight of an atom of ammonium, this proportion:\n\n\\[ \\frac{21.666}{24.511} : 1 : 1.149 = \\text{weight of an atom of ammonium.} \\]\n\nThe weight of an atom of zinc is founded on Dr Thomson's analysis of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol4.html#article-BLENDE\">Blende</a> (Annals of Philosophy, IV. 89). It agrees almost exactly with the analysis of oxide of zinc by Berzelius. But Berzelius doubles the weight of an atom of zinc, by supposing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> of another oxide, containing less oxygen than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> oxide. But as this oxide has never been obtained nor examined by any one, we have no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to suppose its existence. The weight of an atom of tellurium is derived from the experiments of Berzelius. Its oxide, according to him, is composed of 100 tellurium + 24.83 oxygen.\n\nBerzelius (Annals of Philosophy, III. 101.) has shown that there are three oxides of chromium, the green, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a>, and chromic acid. The first contains 100 metal + 42.37 oxygen, while the acid is composed of 100 metal + 84.74 oxygen. These numbers are to each other as 1 to 2. As the brown oxide is intermediate, we must suppose the green oxide a compound of 1 atom metal + 2 atoms oxygen; the brown of 1 atom metal + 3 oxygen; and the acid of 1 atom metal + 4 atoms oxygen. This gives us the weight of an atom of chromium, stated in the table. But it would not be surprising if the brown oxide were merely a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> or combination of the green oxide and chromic acid. On that supposition the weight of an atom of chromium would be only 2.375.\n\nBerzelius has published an elaborate set of experiments on arsenic (Annals of Philosophy, III. 93.), in which he endeavours to prove that there are four oxides of arsenic, namely, 1. The black oxide, composed of 1 atom metal + 1 atom oxygen. 2. Salpable oxide of arsenic, composed of 1 atom metal + 3 atoms oxygen. 3. Arsenious acid, composed of 1 atom metal + 4 atoms oxygen; and, 4. Arsenic acid, composed of 1 atom metal + 6 atoms oxygen. But his experiments are too complicated, and his reasoning too hypothetical, to produce <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVICTION\">conviction</a>; especially as they appear inconsistent with the much simpler experiments of Proust, Thenard, Rose, Bucholz, and Thomson, from which it appears that 100 arsenic, when converted into arsenic acid, becomes 152.4. It was from this experiment of Dr Thomson that the weight of an atom of arsenic in the table was derived.\n\nThe weight of an atom of molybdenum is deduced from the experiments of Bucholz. He found two oxides of molybdenum, the blue and the white, composed of 100 metal united with 34 and 50 oxygen. Now 34 is to 50 as 2 to 3. Hence the first is a deuterioxide, and we have for the weight of molybdenum this proportion \\( \\frac{34}{2} : 100 :: 1 : 6.013 = \\text{weight of an atom of molybdenum.} \\)\n\nThere are four oxides of manganese, the green, the olive, the brown, and the black. The composition of these oxides is as follows:\n\n| Oxide | Metal | Oxygen |\n|-------|-------|--------|\n| 1st   | 100   | 14.0533|\n| 2d    | 100   | 28.107 |\n| 3d    | 100   | 42.16  |\n| 4th   | 100   | 56.213 |\n\nNow, the quantities of oxygen in these oxides are to each other as the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4. Hence the first is a protoxide; and for the weight of an atom of manganese we have this proportion \\( 14.0533 : 100 :: 1 : 6.833 = \\text{weight of an atom of manganese.} \\)\n\nIron forms two oxides, the black and the red. The first of these, according to the experiments of Dr Thomson, is composed of 100 metal + 28 oxygen, the second of 100 metal + 42 oxygen. Now 28 is to 42 as 2 to 3. Hence \\( \\frac{28}{2} : 100 :: 1 : 7.143 = \\text{weight of an atom of iron.} \\)\n\nNickel and cobalt agree with iron in being magnetic. They agree, likewise, in the number of oxides which they form, and almost in the proportion of oxygen with which they unite. Probably future experiments will show these proportions to be absolutely identical. At present it is believed, that the two oxides of nickel are composed as follows:\n\n| Oxide | Nickel | Oxygen |\n|-------|--------|--------|\n| 1st   | 100    | 27.6   |\n| 2d    | 100    | 41     |\n\nwhile those of cobalt consist of\n\n| Oxide | Cobalt | Oxygen |\n|-------|--------|--------|\n| 1st   | 100    | 27.3   |\n| 2d    | 100    | 40.95  |\n\nThese slight differences in the proportion of oxygen occasion the difference between the weights of the atoms of these metals and that of iron.\n\nThere are two oxides of copper, the red and the black, composed of\nHence \\(12.5 : 100 :: 1 : 8\\) = weight of an atom of copper.\n\nBismuth forms only one oxide. A mean of the experiments of Thomson, Lagerhjelm, and John Davy, gives its composition 100 metal + 11.229. Hence the number in the table.\n\nThere is no metal so difficult to experiment on as antimony. Hence, notwithstanding the laborious efforts of many distinguished chemists, considerable uncertainty still exists, both respecting the number and the composition of its various oxides. Proust makes only two oxides of antimony: Thenard makes six, and Berzelius makes four. We think it safer, in the present state of our knowledge, to deduce the weight of an atom of antimony from the sulphuret, which can be analyzed with accuracy, than from the oxides, respecting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of which considerable doubts still remain. From the experiments of Dr Thomson (Annals of Philosophy, IV. 99.), it appears that sulphuret of antimony is composed of 100 metal + 35.556 sulphur. Now, supposing it a compound of 1 atom metal + 2 atoms sulphur, an atom of antimony will weigh 11.249.\n\nThe weight of an atom of cerium is founded on the experiments of Hisinger, which may be seen in the Annals of Philosophy, IV. 355.\n\nBueholz has shown that there are two oxides of uranium, the black and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a>; the first composed of 100 metal + 8.333 oxygen, the second of 100 metal + 25 oxygen. These numbers are to each other as 1 to 3. Hence 8.333 : 100 :: 1 : 12 = weight of an atom of uranium.\n\nBerzelius has shown (Annals of Philosophy, III. 244), that there are two oxides of tungsten, brown oxide, and tungstic acid. The first is composed of 100 metal + 16.5 oxygen, the second of 100 metal + 24.75 oxygen. Now 16.5 is to 24.75 as 2 to 3.\n\nTherefore \\(\\frac{16.5}{2} : 100 :: 1 : 12 : 121 =\\) weight of an atom of tungsten.\n\nBerzelius obtained two oxides of platinum. The first composed of 100 metal + 8.287 oxygen, the second of 100 metal + 16.36. Now 8.287 is to 16.36 as 1 to 2. Therefore 8.287 : 100 :: 1 : 12.161 = weight of an atom of platinum.\n\nSilver forms only one oxide, and it parts with its oxygen so easily, that it is very difficult to determine the proportion of oxygen with which it unites. The number in the table is derived from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HORN\">horn</a>-silver, which is known to be a compound of 100 chlorine and 304.89 silver. This gives us the weight of an atom of silver 13.714, and the oxide of silver, a compound of 100 silver + 7.291 oxygen.\n\nBerzelius could form only one oxide of palladium. It was brown, and composed of 100 metal + 14.209 oxygen. If we suppose this a deutoxide, which is probable, then we have \\(\\frac{14.209}{2} : 100 :: 1 : 14.075 =\\) weight of an atom of palladium.\n\nProust first proved that tin forms three oxides. According to Berzelius, the first oxide is composed of 100 metal + 13.6 oxygen, and the peroxide of 100 metal + 27.2. As there is an intermediate oxide, we cannot avoid concluding that the first oxide is a compound of 1 atom metal + 2 atoms oxygen. For the oxygen in the peroxide is just double that in the first oxide. Therefore for an atom of tin we have this proportion, \\(\\frac{13.6}{2} : 100 :: 1 : 14.705 =\\) weight of an atom of tin.\n\nBerzelius has shown that there are three oxides of rhodium. The first, constituting the base of the muriate, is composed of 100 metal + 6.71 oxygen. The second of a fleck brown <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, obtained by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, is composed of 100 metal + 13.42 oxygen. The third is red, and is obtained by precipitation from the soda-muriate. It contains more oxygen than either of the other two (Annals of Philosophy, III. 252.). We have therefore 6.71 : 100 :: 1 : 14.903 = weight of an atom of rhodium.\n\nThe weight of an atom of titanium, given in the table, is not much to be depended on. It is the number given by Berzelius from an experiment of Richter (Annals of Philosophy, III. 251.), and is merely inserted for want of better data.\n\nTo the indefatigable industry and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> of Berzelius, we are indebted for our knowledge of the composition of the oxides of gold. His mode of proceeding was not quite beyond the reach of objection, though perhaps, upon the whole, the best that he could have had recourse to, with the prospect of an answer to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a> which he was investigating. A determinate quantity of gold was dissolved in nitromuriatic acid, and thus converted into yellow oxide or peroxide of gold. He ascertained how much mercury was necessary to precipitate this gold in the metallic state. This portion of mercury united with all the oxygen of the gold. Now, as the composition of oxide of mercury is known, it was easy to determine how much oxygen had been united with the gold. By <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> the muriate of gold to heat, its nature was altered, and another oxide of gold formed, containing less oxygen. When water is poured upon this substance, two-thirds of the gold are reduced, and the other third converted into yellow oxide. Hence this new oxide contained only the third part of the oxygen in the yellow oxide. The yellow oxide was composed of 100 gold + 12.077 oxygen. Hence, the protioxide consisted of 100 gold + 4.026 oxygen. Now 4.026 : 100 :: 1 : 24.338 = weight of an atom of gold.\n\nThe weight of an atom of mercury, is taken from the experiments of Thenard, and Fourcroy, and Sefstrom. The mean of these give us black oxide of mercury, composed of 100 mercury + 4 oxygen, and red oxide of 100 mercury + 8 oxygen.\n\nThere are three oxides of lead, the yellow, the red, and the brown; the first composed of 100 metal + 7.7 oxygen, the second of 100 metal + 11.55 oxygen, and the third of 100 metal + 15.4 oxygen. Now 7.7, 11.55, and 15.4, are to each other as the numbers 2, 3, 4. Therefore, the yellow oxide con-\ntains two atoms of oxygen, and we have \\( \\frac{7.7}{2} : 100 :: 1 : 1 \\).\n\n\\( 25.974 = \\) weight of an atom of lead.\n\nSuch are the weights of the atoms of the simple substances, and such the documents upon which these weights are founded. The importance of these weights will best appear by giving a view of the compounds which these bodies form with each other.\n\n### III. Weight of the Integrant Particles of Primary Compounds.\n\nThe primary compounds being very numerous, we shall, for the sake of distinctness, subdivide them under different heads.\n\n#### 1. Compounds of the Simple Combustibles with Oxygen.\n\n| Substances          | Number of Atoms | Weight of an Integrant Particle |\n|---------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------|\n| Water               | 1a + 1o         | 1'125                           |\n| Boracic acid        | 1b + 2a         | 2'733                           |\n| Carbonic oxide      | 1c + 1o         | 1'750                           |\n| Carbonic acid       | 1c + 2o         | 2'750                           |\n| Phosphorous acid    | 1p + 1o         | 2'625                           |\n| Phosphoric acid     | 1p + 2o         | 3'625                           |\n| Nitrous oxide       | 1a + 1o         | 2'750                           |\n| Nitrous gas         | 1a + 2o         | 3'750                           |\n| Nitrous acid        | 1a + 3o         | 4'750                           |\n| Nitric acid         | 1a + 3o         | 6'750                           |\n| Sulphurous acid     | 1s + 2o         | 4'000                           |\n| Sulphuric acid      | 1s + 3o         | 5'000                           |\n| Silica              | 1s + 2o         | 6'000                           |\n\nWater is composed of two measures of hydrogen gas, united to one measure of oxygen. The reasons for considering it as a compound of 1 atom hydrogen, and 1 atom oxygen, have been already stated.\n\nBoracic acid is conceived to contain two atoms of oxygen, because this is the case with carbonic acid, and the analogy between carbon and boron is very striking.\n\nIf 100 measures of carbonic oxide be mixed with 50 measures of oxygen gas, and the mixture be fired by electricity, the result will be 100 measures of carbonic acid. If charcoal be burnt on 100 measures of oxygen gas, the bulk is not altered, but the oxygen is changed into carbonic acid. From these facts, it is obvious that the oxygen in carbonic oxide, combined with a given quantity of carbon, is just half of that in carbonic acid combined with the same quantity of carbon. Hence the first must be a compound of 1 atom carbon + 1 atom oxygen; the second of 1 atom carbon + 2 atoms oxygen. The weights in the table correspond exactly with the analysis of these two substances.\n\nSeveral of the compounds of azote and oxygen have been analyzed with great care; namely, nitrous oxide, nitrous gas, and nitric acid; and the results coincide with the numbers given in the table. Nitrous acid is merely given from theory. It has not hitherto been possible to analyze it.\n\nSulphurous acid was first analyzed by Dr Thom-\n\nson, who showed that it contained two-thirds of the oxygen in sulphuric acid. It seems demonstrated by the experiments of Klaproth, Berzelius, &c. that sulphuric acid is a compound of 100 sulphur + 150 oxygen. Therefore sulphurous acid must be composed of 100 sulphur + 100 oxygen, and the composition of both must be as in the table.\n\nThe composition of silica is taken from the experiments and calculations of Berzelius, and depends chiefly upon analogical reasoning.\n\n#### 2. Compounds of the Simple Combustibles with each other.\n\n| Number of Atoms | Weight of an Integrant Particle |\n|-----------------|--------------------------------|\n| Olefiant gas    | 1c + 1h                        | 0.875 |\n| Carbureted hydrogen | 1c + 2h                      | 1.000 |\n| Hydrophosphoric gas | 1p + 2h                     | 1.875 |\n| Phosphureted hydrogen | 1p + 4h                    | 2.125 |\n| Ammonia         | 1a + 3h                        | 2.125 |\n| Sulphureted hydrogen | 1s + 1h                   | 2.125 |\n| Sulphuret of carbon | 1c + 2s                  | 4.750 |\n\nOlefiant gas requires for complete combustion three times its bulk of oxygen gas, and forms twice its bulk of carbonic oxide; carbureted hydrogen requires twice its bulk of oxygen, and forms its own bulk of carbonic acid. Hence, it is obvious, that supposing the quantity of hydrogen the same in both, the carbon in olefiant gas, is just double that in carbureted hydrogen. We might have conceived carbureted hydrogen to be a compound of 1 atom hydrogen, and 1 atom carbon, and olefiant gas of 1 atom hydrogen, and 2 atoms carbon. But the reasons assigned by Mr Dalton, have induced us to adopt the composition in the table, which comes in fact to the very same thing.\n\nThe two gases which are composed of phosphorus and hydrogen, have not been hitherto analyzed. But it appears from Davy that the specific gravity of the first is double that of the second. Davy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> his hydrophosphoric gas to be composed of 100 hydrogen by weight, and 489.56 phosphorus. The numbers in the table are founded on these data; though they do not quite correspond.\n\nAmmonia, by electricity, may be resolved into 3 measures of hydrogen, and 1 measure of azote. 300 cubic inches of hydrogen gas weigh 6.69 grains, and 100 cubic inches of azotic gas weigh 29.56 grams. Now \\( \\frac{6.69}{29.56} : 0.132 \\times 3 : 1.704 = \\) weight of an atom of azote very nearly.\n\nWe have given the data upon which the composition of sulphureted hydrogen is founded in a preceding part of this article. It is therefore unnecessary to repeat them here.\n\nSulphuret of carbon was analyzed by Berzelius and Marcat, who found it a compound of 84.85 sulphur, and 15.17 carbon. The composition of this substance, as given in the table, supposes it a compound of 84.2 sulphur + 15.8 carbon; numbers which may be considered as identical with the preceding, since the difference is within the limits of the unavoidable errors of experiment.\nThis table contains all the metallic oxides at present known, which are 62 in number. We have omitted a few which Thenard has admitted into his *System of Chemistry*, just published; but which do not seem to be supported by sufficiently strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a>, to induce us to admit their existence. The same remark applies to some of the oxides of Gay-Lussac and Thenard; and, perhaps, also to some of the oxides of Berzelius. In short, we have admitted no primary compound into our tables, the existence of which is not demonstrated by the clearest evidence. For the loose admission of hypothetical bodies seems to us injurious, rather than beneficial to the progress of the science.\n\nAlumina, Magnesia, Lime, Zirconia, Strontian, Yttria, Barytes, are supposed compounds of 1 atom base, and 1 atom oxygen; because we do not know any other compounds which these bases form with oxygen; and, therefore, have no data to reason on the subject. Their composition has been calculated from the composition of the sulphates of alumina, magnesia, lime, zirconia, strontian, yttria, barytes, the constitution of which will be shown in a subsequent part of this article. The calculation was made, on the supposition, that the quantity of each base which saturates a given weight of sulphuric acid, contains just one-third of the oxygen in the acid: a law which holds, in every case, in which we have it in our power to verify it.\n\nAmmonia, in the present state of the sciences, is an enigmatical substance. We have given before a view of its composition, on the supposition, that it is a compound of hydrogen and azote. Here, its composition is seen on the supposition that it is a compound of ammonium and oxygen. Both analyses seem demonstrated. The seeming inconsistency will vanish, whenever it can be shown that azote is a compound of hydrogen and oxygen.\n\nPotash, peroxide of potash, soda, peroxide of soda, are given according to the experiments of Davy, and Gay-Lussac, and Thenard. The French chemists admit an oxide of potassium and sodium, containing each less oxygen than exists in potash and soda. But the existence of these supposed oxides is not made out in a satisfactory manner. For anything that appears to the contrary, their oxides may be mixtures of potash and potassium, soda and sodium.\n\nIn stating the weights of the atoms of the metals, we have noticed the most accurate experiments hitherto made, to determine the number and composition of the different metallic oxides; and it does not seem necessary to resume the subject here. If the reader be at the trouble to make the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>, he will find, that the numbers in the table agree very correctly with the best results of the analysis of the metallic oxides hitherto obtained. Hence there can be no doubt, that at least a considerable part of the table is accurate.\nAccording to the experiments of Dr Thomson (Annals of Philosophy, IV. 94.), sulphuret of zinc is composed of 100 metal + 48.84 sulphur. Hence the numbers in the table which have been derived from that analysis.\n\nThe composition of sulphuret of tellurium is derived from an experiment of Davy. He found, that tellurium united by fusion with nearly its own weight of sulphur. Hence it ought to combine with two atoms. Analogy, however, is against this conclusion. In all other cases, when a metal forms only one oxide, its sulphuret contains only one atom of sulphur. Hence the composition of sulphuret of tellurium, as stated in the table, is very doubtful.\n\nThe composition of sulphuret of potassium is derived from the experiments of Davy. Sulphuret of sodium is stated from the following analogy, having never been analyzed. Berzelius has shown, that all the sulphurets, when treated with nitric acid, are converted into neutral sulphates, without any redundancy of acid or base. Therefore, sulphuret of sodium, by this treatment, would be converted into sulphate of soda. But sulphate of soda is composed of 2 integrant particles of sulphuric acid, and 1 integrant particle of soda. Therefore, sulphuret of sodium must be composed of 2 atoms sulphur, and 1 atom sodium.\n\nFrom the experiments of Laugier it appears, that sulphuret of arsenic is composed of 42 sulphur + 58 arsenic. According to him, it is often mixed with an excess of arsenic, which occasions the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> variability in its composition. The experiments of Proust and Thenard do not agree well with those of Laugier. Hence the subject cannot be considered as completely cleared up.\n\nSulphuret of manganese is derived from an experiment of Vauquelin, who found that 74.8 manganese united with 25.5 of sulphur by heat.\n\nBucholz found sulphuret of molybdenum composed of 60 molybdenum + 40 sulphur. Hence its constitution as stated in the table.\n\nThe two sulphurets of iron were first analyzed by Hatchett, and the table is conformable to the results of that analysis. We consider the late speculations of Stromeyer on magnetic pysites as erroneous.\n\nNickel and cobalt have so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> an analogy to iron in their combinations, that it is reasonable to expect that the sulphurets will also correspond. Hence the reason for considering these sulphurets as compounds of one atom metal and two atoms sulphur. This statement likewise approaches nearest to the results obtained by Proust.\n\nIt has been ascertained that 100 copper combine with 25 sulphur. This coincides exactly with the statement in the table.\n\nJohn Davy has shown that 67.5 bismuth unite with 15.08 sulphur. Lagerhjelm found that 100 bismuth unite with 22.52 sulphur. Both of these statements coincide sufficiently with the table.\n\nFrom the analysis of sulphuret of antimony by Dr Thomson (Annals of Philosophy, IV. 99.), we learn, that it is a compound of 100 metal + 35.556 sulphur. With this analysis the statement in the table exactly coincides.\nBerzelius informs us, that 100 platinum combine with 32.8 sulphur. Now \\( \\frac{108}{32.8} : \\frac{12.161}{3.098} = 2 \\) atoms of sulphur very nearly.\n\nAccording to Berzelius, 100 sulphur combine with 14.9 sulphur. Now \\( \\frac{100}{14.9} : \\frac{13.714}{2.043} = 1 \\) atom of sulphur very nearly.\n\nSulphuret of palladium has not been analyzed; but, as palladium forms only one oxide, we may, without much risk of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>, consider the sulphuret as a compound of 1 atom metal and 1 atom sulphur.\n\nFrom the experiments of Dr Davy it appears, that mosaic gold contains just double the quantity of sulphuret in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> sulphuret of tin. According to the experiments of the same chemist, protosulphuret of tin is a compound of 55 tin + 15 sulphur. Now \\( \\frac{55}{15} : \\frac{14.705}{4.015} = 2 \\) atoms of sulphur very nearly.\n\nOberkampf has shown, that the sulphuret of gold is composed of 100 gold + 24.39 sulphur. Now \\( \\frac{100}{24.39} : \\frac{24.838}{6.057} = 3 \\) atoms of sulphur very nearly.\n\nAccording to the experiments of Sefstrom, black sulphuret of mercury is composed of 100 metal + 8.005 sulphur; and red sulphuret of 100 metal + 16.01 sulphur. Now \\( \\frac{100}{8.005} : \\frac{25}{2.001} \\) and \\( \\frac{100}{16.001} : \\frac{25}{4.002} \\). But 2.001 and 4.002 are obviously equal respectively to 1 atom and 2 atoms of sulphur.\n\nGalena is a compound of 100 lead + 15.42 sulphur. Now \\( \\frac{100}{15.42} : \\frac{25.974}{4.005} = 2 \\) atoms of sulphur. Sir John Sinclair found a variety of galena in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CAITHNESS\">Caithness</a>, which burned with a blue <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> when held to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a>. It was analyzed by Dr Thomson, and found to contain double the quantity of sulphur in common galena. Hence it was a compound of 1 atom lead and 3 atoms sulphur. This variety must be scarce, for it has never been noticed by mineralogists.\n\nSuch are the sulphurets with the composition of which we are at present acquainted. A good number are of necessity omitted, because they have never been analyzed by chemists. It would be easy to state the composition of most of these from theory. But we do not see any advantage that would result to the science from such theoretical statements, unsupported by experiment.\n\nNeither the phosphurets nor carburets have been examined with such precision as to enable us to exhibit their composition in a table. It is probable that the phosphurets are analogous to sulphurets. But certainly no such analogy holds with the carburets and silicarrets; both of which exist, though they have been hitherto too slightly examined to give us any exact notions of their constitution. Carbon seems to combine with a great number of atoms of iron, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> iron, and with a still greater number in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a>.\n\n5. Organic Bodies.\n\nHitherto the only correct analysis of organic bodies are those made by Berzelius, and published in the fifth volume of the Annals of Philosophy. As these experiments are so recent as not to be generally known, we shall state in the table the results of each analysis, and likewise the number of atoms of which the body is composed.\n\n| Constituents | Atoms | Weight | Atomic Theory |\n|--------------|-------|--------|---------------|\n| Citric acid  | oxygen | 55.096 | 2             |\n|              | carbon | 41.270 | 2             |\n|              | hydrogen | 3.634 | 1             |\n| Tartaric acid| oxygen | 60.213 | 10            |\n|              | carbon | 35.980 | 8             |\n|              | hydrogen | 3.807 | 5             |\n| Oxalic acid  | oxygen | 66.534 | 12            |\n|              | carbon | 33.292 | 8             |\n|              | hydrogen | 0.244 | 1             |\n| Succinic acid| oxygen | 47.888 | 3             |\n|              | carbon | 47.600 | 4             |\n|              | hydrogen | 4.512 | 2             |\n| Acetic acid  | oxygen | 46.832 | 3             |\n|              | carbon | 46.833 | 4             |\n|              | hydrogen | 6.35  | 3             |\n| Gallic acid  | oxygen | 38.02  | 3             |\n|              | carbon | 56.96  | 6             |\n|              | hydrogen | 5.02  | 5             |\n| Saccharic acid| oxygen | 61.465 | 8             |\n|              | carbon | 33.430 | 6             |\n|              | hydrogen | 5.105 | 5             |\n| Benzoic acid | oxygen | 20.43  | 3             |\n|              | carbon | 74.41  | 15            |\n|              | hydrogen | 5.16  | 6             |\n| Tannin from Nutgalls | oxygen | 44.654 | 4             |\n|              | carbon | 51.160 | 6             |\n|              | hydrogen | 4.186 | 3             |\n| Common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a> | oxygen | 49.015 | 20            |\n|              | carbon | 44.200 | 24            |\n|              | hydrogen | 6.785 | 21            |\n| Sugar of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>| oxygen | 53.359 | 8             |\n|              | carbon | 39.474 | 10            |\n|              | hydrogen | 7.167 | 8             |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUM\">Gum</a> Arabic   | oxygen | 51.306 | 12            |\n|              | carbon | 41.906 | 13            |\n|              | hydrogen | 6.788 | 12            |\n\n100,000 37\nFor the way in which these experiments were made, we refer to the original paper of Berzelius, quoted above. We have no doubt that the results are very near approximations to the truth, though some slight corrections may perhaps be necessary. The great number of atoms that enter into the composition of some of these bodies is very remarkable. We would find it difficult to explain the nature of such combinations, without having recourse to some hypothesis respecting the nature of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTICITY\">elasticity</a>. Twelve atoms of oxygen, and 13 of hydrogen, in a compound possessed of so little elasticity as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol15.html#article-POTATO\">potato</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STARCH\">starch</a>, is very extraordinary. The old opinion of Dr Black and his contemporaries was, that bodies owe their elasticity to a quantity of heat combined with them. Of course, when the heat is separated, the elasticity disappears. Were we to suppose, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONFORMITY\">conformity</a> with this hypothesis, that the oxygen and hydrogen which exists in organized bodies, are deprived of the heat requisite to give them the elastic form, there would be no difficulty in understanding how so many atoms unite together, and have no tendency to separate, and how the compound is so speedily decomposed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> of heat, or by combustion.\n\nThus, we have gone over all the primary compounds which have been subjected to examination by chemists, without finding a single exception to the atomic theory. On the contrary, the great and unexpected elucidation which this theory throws upon the nature of chemical combinations, is highly pleasing. The simplicity of the proportions in which the atoms of unorganic matter unite, is equally delightful and astonishing, and throws a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of grandeur around the science, hitherto conversant in minute and apparently unconnected combinations, fully equal to what distinguishes the sublimest branch of mechanical philosophy. The operations of nature are everywhere equally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a>, and regulated by general principles equally simple and luminous, whether we examine the laws which regulate the motions of the solar system, or the minutest compound to be found in the terrestrial globe. Let us now examine the secondary compounds, that we may be able to judge how far they come under the dominion of the Atomic Theory.\n\nIV. Composition of Secondary Compounds.\n\nHere, our task is much more difficult, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a> in a great measure unexplored, or only partially so. The secondary compounds are very numerous, amounting to several thousands. Accurate chemical analysis cannot be dated farther back than a few years. A correct knowledge of the whole of these compounds, therefore, is not to be expected. But, from the indefatigable zeal, uncommon accuracy, and gigantic industry of Berzelius, we have it in our power to examine the composition of many genera of salts with considerable precision; supposing always that the laws which he has pointed out respecting the combination of acids and bases be precise. We shall continue the method which we adopted when treating of the primary compounds; namely, exhibit tables of the composition of the different genera of secondary compounds, and then give the documents on which these tables were founded.\n\n1.

I. PART II.\nBy hydrate of potash is understood caustic potash, that has been exposed to a red heat. For it is well known, that the whole water cannot be expelled from potash by heat. The statement in the table supposes this hydrate to be composed of 100 potash + 18.867 water. Now Davy, by heating potash and boracic acid together, actually separated between 17 and 18 water. Berzelius obtained 16 per cent., which is very near the exact quantity. For if our determination be correct, 100 potash ought to contain 15.872 water.\n\nHydrate of soda has never been analyzed. The number in the table is given from this analogy. Berzelius has shown, that the hydrates of the salifiable bases, are in fact salts, the water acting the part of an acid, and saturating the base. Now, in all the salts of soda hitherto examined, 1 integrant particle of the soda is always combined with 2 integrant particles of acid. We suppose the same thing to hold with water.\n\nSlacked lime, which is the hydrate, according to the experiments of Lavoisier, is composed of 100 lime + 28.7 water; according to Dalton, of 100 lime + 33.333 water. The mean of these two results gives the statement in the table almost precisely.\n\nThe experiments of Berthollet and Berzelius prove, that hydrate of barytes is a compound of 100 barytes + 12.121 water. The statement in the table supposes it a compound of 100 barytes + 11.632, which coincides very nearly.\n\nHydrate of strontian is given merely from analogy. Crystallized strontian is a compound of 1 particle strontian + 13 particles of water.\n\nAccording to Davy, hydrate of magnesia contains one-fifth of its weight of water. Hence the statement in the table. Probably there may be another hydrate composed of 1 integrant particle magnesia, and 1 integrant particle water, but which cannot be obtained in a separate state.\n\nWavelite, which is a native hydrate of alumina, is composed of 74 alumina + 26 water. Hence the composition of the hydrate in the table.\n\nHydrate of glucina has never been analyzed. According to Klaproth, hydrate of yttria is composed of 69 yttria + 31 water. According to Davy, zirconia, when in the state of a hydrate, contains more than one-fifth of its weight of water.\n\nHydrate of silica has never been analyzed. But silica absorbs about one-fourth of its weight of water.\n\nThe hydrate of sulphuric and nitric acids were determined by Mr Dalton. Sulphuric acid of 1.85 is the strongest that can be made. It is composed of 100 real acid + 22.64 water. The second hydrate is composed of 100 acid + 45.28 water. It freezes at the temperature of 42\u00b0. It was upon it that Mr Keir made his experiments.\n\nThe hydrate of phosphorous acid was determined by Sir Humphry Davy. See his Elements of Chemical Philosophy, p. 289.\n\nDavy found hydrate of boracic acid composed of 57 acid + 43 water. Now, this agrees very nearly with the statement in the table.\n\nHydrate of peroxide of copper is obtained by precipitating the sulphate or nitrate of copper, by means of an alkali. It is a blue powder composed, according to Davy, of 9 peroxide of copper + 1 water. This agrees nearly with the statement in the table.\n\nAccording to Berzelius, when iron is kept in water, a hydrate is formed, composed of 128 parts of black oxide of iron + 15.866 water. Now, this coincides almost exactly with 1 integrant particle of black oxide, 1 integrant particle of water.\n\nHydrate of the red oxide of iron is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">orange</a> powder obtained from persulphate of iron by an alkali. It has never been analyzed.\n\nThe hydrate of deutoxide of tin, is the white powder obtained by precipitating the recent solution of tin in muriatic acid. According to Proust, it is composed of 95 oxide + 5 water. This approaches most nearly to the statement in the table. The other hydrate of tin has never been analyzed.\n\nThe hydrate of nickel is a green powder obtained by precipitating sulphate of nickel by an alkali. According to Davy, more than one-fourth of its weight is water. This statement approaches most nearly to the supposition, that it contains 3 particles of water + 1 oxide of nickel.\n\nThe hydrates of cobalt, manganese, and arsenic, have never been analyzed. They are stated merely from analogy.\n\nAccording to Berzelius, the tritoxide of antimony forms a hydrate composed of 95.22 oxide + 4.78 water. This approaches most nearly to the statement in the table; but does not agree with it.\n\nThe hydrates of oxalic acid, tartaric acid, and citric acid, were determined by Berzelius. Crystallized oxalic acid is composed of 58 acid + 42 water; crystallized tartaric acid of 58.75 acid, and + 11.25 water; and crystallized citric acid of 100 acid + 20.5 water. These proportions coincide with the statements in the table very nearly.\n\nThus, it appears that the composition of the hydrates, as far as they have been examined, agree perfectly with the atomic theory. We see, likewise, that the number of particles of water which enter into combination with other bodies is not confined within such narrow limits as most of the other primary compounds are. In many hydrates, only a single particle of water is found; while, in others, no fewer than 12 particles exist.\n\nLet us now proceed to examine the salts, in order to judge how far their composition is regulated by the laws of the atomic theory.\n\n2. Salts.\n\nThe salts are very numerous, and have been divided into as many genera as there are acids entering into their composition. Some of these genera have been carefully analyzed, while others still remain in a great measure unknown.\n\n**<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENUS\">Genus</a> I.\u2014Sulphates.**\n\n| Number of Atoms | Weight of an Integrant Particle |\n|-----------------|--------------------------------|\n| 202 Sulphate of potash | 1 s + 1 p = 11.000 |\n| 203 Bisulphate of potash | 2 s + 1 p = 16.000 |\nDr Thomson found sulphate of potash composed of 42.2 acid + 50.1 potash, which corresponds with the tabular statement almost exactly. Dr Wollaston has shown, that the bisulphate contains just double the acid in the sulphate.\n\nSulphate of soda, according to Wenzel, is composed of 100 acid + 78.32 base; according to Berzelius, of 100 acid + 79.34. The tabular statement supposes a combination of 100 acid + 78.82 soda. Now, this is the mean of the two experiments.\n\nAccording to Berzelius, sulphate of ammonia is composed of 100 acid + 42.561 ammonia. Now 100:42.561::5:2.128 = weight of an integrant particle of ammonia very nearly.\n\nAccording to Berzelius, sulphate of magnesia is composed of 100 acid + 50.06 magnesia. Now 100:50.06::5:2.508 = weight of an integrant particle of magnesia very nearly.\n\nSulphate of lime, according to the analysis of Berzelius, is composed of 100 acid + 72.41 base. Now,\n\n\\[ 100:72.41::5:3.620 = \\text{weight of an integrant particle of lime almost exactly.} \\]\n\nSulphate of barytes, according to the analysis of Berzelius, is composed of 100 acid + 194 barytes. Now 100:194::5:9.700 = weight of an atom of barytes very nearly.\n\nThe weight of an integrant particle of strontian was deduced from an accurate analysis of carbonate of strontian, which was found to consist of 29.9 carbonic acid + 70.1 strontian.\n\nAccording to Berzelius's analysis, sulphate of alumina is composed of 100 acid + 42.722 alumina. It was from this analysis, that the weight of an integrant particle of alumina was determined. Of course, the statement in the table must coincide with it entirely.\n\nThe sulphates of yttria, glucina, and zirconia, have not hitherto been analyzed. Their composition is stated merely from analogy.\n\nAlum, according to the experiments of Berzelius, is composed of\n\n- Sulphuric acid: 34.33\n- Alumina: 10.86\n- Potash: 9.81\n- Water: 45.00\n\nNow, this will be found to consist of an integrant particle of sulphate of potash, combined with five integrant particles of sulphate of alumina.\n\nSulphate of potash and ammonia is a compound of 1 integrant particle of sulphate of potash, and 1 integrant particle of sulphate of ammonia. All the other triple salts are formed in the same way, by the combination of 1 integrant particle of 1 salt, with 1 or more integrant particles of another salt. Sulphate of potash and magnesia consists of 1 integrant particle of sulphate of potash, united with 2 integrant particles of sulphate of magnesia; sulphate of soda and ammonia is composed of 1 integrant particle of sulphate of soda, united with 6 integrant particles of sulphate of ammonia; sulphate of soda and magnesia of 1 integrant particle of sulphate of soda, and 3 integrant particles of sulphate of magnesia; and sulphate of magnesia and ammonia of 2 integrant particles of sulphate of magnesia, and 1 integrant particle of sulphate of ammonia.\n\nAs an atom of sulphuric acid weighs 5, and an atom of black oxide of copper 10, it is obvious that if sulphate of copper contains 2 particles of acid, and 1 of oxide, the weight of the two constituents must be equal. Now, according to Proust, the salt is composed of 33 acid + 32 base; according to Berzelius of 49.1 acid + 50.9 oxide. The mean of these two experiments gives us the salt composed of 100 acid + 100.317 base, which almost coincides with theory. According to Proust, the subsulphate of copper is composed of 18 acid + 68 oxide. Now 5:10 \u00d7 2 :: 18:72, this does not differ much from the analysis, if we consider the difficulty in getting the salt quite pure, and in a proper state for examination.\n\nSulphate of iron, according to the analysis of Ber-\nAccording to Berzelius, sulphate of silver is composed of 25.78 acid + 74.22 oxide. Now 5:14:714 :: 25.78:75.865, which corresponds with the analysis very nearly.\n\nLagerhjelm found sulphate of bismuth composed of 33.647 acid + 66.653 oxide. Now, this corresponds almost exactly with the statement in the table.\n\nAccording to Tapputi, sulphate of nickel is composed of 100 acid + 87.266. Now, this does not differ very much from the statement in the table, which supposes the salt composed of 100 acid + 93.05 oxide.\n\nAccording to the analysis of Rolhoff, sulphate of cobalt is composed of 52.11 acid + 47.89 oxide. If the statement in the table be correct, it will be composed of 51.744 acid + 48.256 oxide. Now, this may be considered as agreeing with the analysis, since the difference is within the limits of the unavoidable errors of experiment.\n\nAccording to John, sulphate of manganese is composed of 100 acid + 91.326 protoxide. Dr Thomson lately analyzed this salt, and obtained for its constituents 100 acid + 71 protoxide. Now 100:71 :: 10:7.1; and 7.1 does not differ much from the weight of a particle of protoxide of manganese. The mean of the two experiments gives 8.113, which comes still nearer the true result.\n\nSulphate of uranium has hitherto been analyzed by Bucholz only. He makes it a compound of 22.1 acid + 77.9 peroxide. If the statement in the table be correct, as is probable, it ought to be a compound of 25 acid + 75 peroxide.\n\nThe persulphate of platinum, according to Berzelius, is composed of 41.223 acid + 58.777 peroxide. Supposing the tabular statement correct, it ought to be a compound of 41.389 acid + 58.611 peroxide. Now, this is identical with the experimental result of Berzelius.\n\nThus we have gone over the sulphates, the genus of salts, which has been most accurately examined, and have found the whole of them to correspond most accurately with the atomic theory. They all agree with Berzelius's law, that the oxygen in the acid is a multiple by a whole number of the oxygen in the base, except in the instance of subsulphate of iron. But perhaps his law was only meant to ap-\nply to the neutral salts, and not to the subsalts or supersalts. His law, that the oxygen in the acid amounts to three times the oxygen in the base, holds in all the neutral sulphates, except the persulphate of mercury, and sulphate of uranium; and neither of these salts can be considered as analyzed with such accuracy as to lay much stress upon their composition, as stated in the table. Let us now examine the carbonates, which are likewise pretty accurately known.\n\n**Genus II.\u2014Carbonates.**\n\n| Number of Atoms | Weight of an Integrant Particle |\n|-----------------|--------------------------------|\n| 237 Bicarbonate of potash | 2 c + 1 p 11.500 |\n| 238 Carbonate of potash | 1 c + 1 p 8.750 |\n| 239 Supercarbonate of soda | 3 c + 1 s 16.125 |\n| 240 Carbonate of soda | 2 c + 1 s 13.375 |\n| 241 Bicarbonate of ammonia | 2 c + 1 a 7.625 |\n| 242 Carbonate of ammonia | 1 c + 1 a 4.875 |\n| 243 Carbonate of lime | 1 c + 1 l 6.375 |\n| 244 Carbonate of barytes | 1 c + 1 b 12.500 |\n| 245 Carbonate of strontian | 1 c + 1 str 9.250 |\n| 246 Bicarbonate of magnesia | 2 c + 1 m 8.000 |\n| 247 Carbonate of magnesia | 1 c + 1 m 5.250 |\n| 248 Carbonate of yttria | 1 c + 1 y 11.151 |\n| 249 Carbonate of zirconia | 1 c + 1 z 8.375 |\n| 250 Carbonate of glucina | 1 c + 1 g 12.584 |\n| 251 Carbonate of silver | 1 c + 1 s 17.500 |\n| 252 Percarbonate of mercury | 1 c + 2 m 56.750 |\n| 253 Percarbonate of copper | 1 c + 1 cop 19.750 |\n| 254 Carbonate of iron | 2 c + 1 i 14.615 |\n| 255 Carbonate of nickel | 2 c + 1 n 14.805 |\n| 256 Carbonate of cobalt | 2 c + 1 cob 14.826 |\n| 257 Carbonate of lead | 2 c + 1 l 33.500 |\n| 258 Carbonate of zinc | 1 c + 1 z 7.845 |\n| 259 Carbonate of manganese | 2 c + 1 m 13.335 |\n| 260 Carbonate of cerium | 2 c + 1 ce 19.349 |\n| 261 Percarbonate of cerium | 3 c + 1 ce 23.100 |\n\nThe bicarbonate of potash is the common crystallized carbonate of the shops. If it be a compound of 2 integrant particles of carbonic acid, and 1 integrant particle of potash, it ought to consist of 47.835 acid + 52.165 base. Now, Berthelot obtained 47.64 acid + 52.36 base, a result which may be considered as quite identical with the theory, the difference being greatly within the limits of error from experiment. Dr Wollaston has shown, that the deliquescent carbonate contains just half the carbonic acid which exists in the bicarbonate.\n\nThe supercarbonate of soda is found native in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>, and may be formed artificially, by passing a current of carbonic acid gas through common carbonate of soda dissolved in water. According to the analysis of Klaproth, it is composed of 39 acid + 38 base. Now, the tabular statement supposes it a compound of 39 acid + 37.247 base. We have different analyses of the carbonate of soda; but they do not agree well with each other. Bergman obtained 16 acid + 20 base; Darcey 16.04 acid + 20.85 base; and Klaproth 16 acid + 22 base. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> is the most correct. According to the tabular statement, which must be correct, the salt ought to be a compound of 16 acid + 22.021 base.\n\nThe analysis of the ammoniacal salts is attended with such difficulties, that great exactness can hardly be expected, except in those cases when the acid has a gaseous form. It is then easy to determine the volume of ammoniacal gas capable of saturating a given volume of the acid gas. Carbonic acid being a gas, the composition ammoniacal carbonates may be determined with accuracy. Now, 100 measures of carbonic acid condense and neutralize 100 measures of ammoniacal gas. This will be found, on making the calculation, to be 2 integrant particles of carbonic acid, and 1 integrant particle of ammonia, constituting the first of the ammoniacal salts in the table. Fifty measures of carbonic acid are likewise capable of combining with 100 measures of ammoniacal gas, constituting the second ammoniacal salt in the table. It has not been proved that any other carbonate of ammonia exists.\n\nSupposing carbonate of lime a compound of 1 integrant particle of carbonic acid, and 1 integrant particle of lime, it should be a compound of 43.18 acid + 56.82 lime. Now, Dr Marcet obtained 43.9 acid + 56.1 base; and Dr Thomson, by a careful analysis of very pure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CALCAREOUS_SPAR\">calcareous <a c</a>lass=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SPAR\">spar</a>, obtained 43.2 acid + 56.8 base. This last result is almost the very same with the theoretical result.\n\nCarbonate of barytes, by the statement in the table, is a compound of 22.04 acid + 77.96 barytes. Now, Kirwan obtained 22 acid + 78 base; and Berzelius 21.6 acid + 78.4 base. Both of these results agree sufficiently with our theoretical result; the first, indeed, coincides with it.\n\nThe analyses of carbonate of strontian hitherto made cannot be expected to agree completely with our theoretical statement, because they have been all made upon the native carbonate of that earth, which always contains a certain proportion of carbonate of lime. According to an accurate analysis by the writer of this article, it is composed of 29.9 acid + 70.1 base. Klaproth's analysis gives us 30 acid + 69.5 base. The excess of acid is obviously owing to the presence of carbonate of lime in the native salt.\n\nWe have never seen any specimen of carbonate of magnesia composed of 1 integrant particle of acid, and one integrant particle of base, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>. But it occurs native in abundance, constituting an ingredient in the magnesian limestone, which is so abundant in the counties of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURHAM\">Durham</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DERBY\">Derby</a>, and which seems to constitute a peculiar formation. The bicarbonate may be formed by passing a current of carbonic acid through water in which magnesia is suspended. The salt is soluble in water, and crystallizes. It is composed of 69.911 acid + 30.089 base. Kirwan and Fourcroy found 66.6 acid + 33.3 base. Probably their salt was mixed with a little carbonate.\n\nCarbonate of yttria was analyzed by Klaproth; and the tabular statement exactly coincides with\nhis result. We have no analysis of carbonates of zirconia, and glucina.\n\nBerzelius found carbonate of silver a compound of 15.9 acid + 84.1 base. According to the statement in the table, it ought to be composed of 15.9 acid + 81.407 base, numbers which do not deviate far from those given by Berzelius.\n\nWe have no good analysis of the percarbonate of mercury. The statement in the table is given on the authority of Bergman; but is not very likely to be correct.\n\nPercarbonate of copper, according to the analysis of Berzelius, is composed of 19.73 acid + 71.7 peroxide. Dr Thomson analyzed it, with precisely the same result. This analysis coincides exactly with the statement in the table.\n\nKlaproth analyzed the carbonate of iron, and found it a compound of 38.3 acid + 61.6 base. This analysis corresponds sufficiently with the statement in the table.\n\nNickel and cobalt have so striking an analogy with iron in most particulars, that there is every reason for believing that the salts of the three metals are similarly constituted. Hence, as the carbonate of iron consists of 2 integrant particles of carbonic acid, and 1 integrant particle of black oxide of iron, we have supposed, in the table, that this is the case likewise with the carbonates of nickel and cobalt. The carbonate of nickel has been analyzed by Proust, and his result does not differ much from the tabular statement; but we have no analysis of the carbonate of cobalt.\n\nBerzelius analyzed carbonate of lead, and found it a compound of 16.444 acid + 83.333. The analysis of other chemists corresponds nearly with this result. Now, our statement in the table supposes the salt a compound of 16.446 acid + 83.554 base, which may be considered as absolutely the same with the numbers given by Berzelius.\n\nAccording to Mr Smithson, the carbonate of zinc is composed of 1 acid + 2 oxide. Now, the statement in the table supposes it a compound of 1 acid + 1.852 base; a coincidence as near as can be expected, when we consider the small quantity of salt upon which Mr Smithson makes his experiments.\n\nIf the carbonate of manganese be composed as stated in the table, it will be a compound of 34.16 acid + 50.476 base. John's analysis gives us 34.16 acid + 55.84 base; a result which does not correspond well. Hence there is reason to suspect inaccuracy.\n\nThe carbonates of cerium have been analyzed by Hisinger, and the results which he obtained agree tolerably well with the tabular statement.\n\nThus the carbonates correspond likewise with the Atomic Theory. They all agree with Berzelius's law, that the oxygen in the acid is a multiple by a whole number of the oxygen in the base. Most of them agree with his law, that the oxygen in the acid is double that in the base. But the carbonate of copper constitutes an exception to this rule. Indeed, we must expect to find some exceptions to these laws of Berzelius in almost every genus of salts. But it is surprising in how many unexpected cases they hold. Let us now examine the nitrates.\n\n| Genus III.\u2014Nitrates | Number of Atoms | Weight of an Integrant Particle |\n|---------------------|----------------|-------------------------------|\n| 262 Nitrate of potash | 1 n + 1 p      | 12.750                        |\n| 263 Nitrate of soda  | 2 n + 1 s      | 21.375                        |\n| 264 Nitrate of ammonia | 1 n + 1 a    | 8.875                         |\n| 265 Nitrate of magnesia | 1 n + 1 m   | 9.250                         |\n| 266 Nitrate of lime   | 1 n + 1 l      | 10.375                        |\n| 267 Nitrate of barytes | 1 n + 1 b    | 16.500                        |\n| 268 Nitrate of strontian | 1 n + 1 str | 13.250                        |\n| 269 Nitrate of ammonia and magnesia | 4 n + 3 m + 1 a | 36.625                        |\n| 270 Nitrate of copper | 2 n + 1 c      | 23.500                        |\n| 271 Subnitrate of copper | 1 n + 2 c  | 26.750                        |\n| 272 Nitrate of iron   | 2 n + 1 i      | 22.625                        |\n| 273 Pernitrate of iron | 3 n + 1 i    | 29.375                        |\n| 274 Nitrate of zinc   | 1 n + 1 l      | 10.840                        |\n| 275 Nitrate of lead    | 2 n + 1 l      | 41.500                        |\n| 276 1st subnitrate of lead | 1 n + 1 l | 34.750                        |\n| 277 2d subnitrate of lead | 2 n + 3 l | 97.500                        |\n| 278 3d subnitrate of lead | 1 n + 3 l | 90.750                        |\n| 279 Nitrate of nickel  | 3 n + 1 nick   | 29.555                        |\n| 280 Subnitrate of nickel | 1 n + 7 nick | 71.885                        |\n| 281 Nitrate of silver  | 1 n + 1 s      | 21.500                        |\n| 282 Nitrate of mercury | 1 n + 1 m      | 32.750                        |\n| 283 Pernitrate of mercury | 1 n + 2 m  | 60.750                        |\n| 284 Subnitrate of platinum | 1 n + 4 pl | 53.250                        |\n| 285 Nitrate of bismuth | 1 n + 1 b      | 16.750                        |\n| 286 Nitrate of uranium | 1 n + 1 u      | 21.750                        |\n\nThe analysis of the nitrates is attended with considerable difficulty, because we have no substance which forms an insoluble compound with nitric acid. We cannot, therefore, separate the acid by precipitation, as we do in the case of the sulphates, neither does it fly off when another acid is applied, as happens in the carbonates, so as to enable us to determine, by the loss of weight, how much acid the salt contains. Nevertheless, as a considerable number of the nitrates are destinate of water of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CRYSTALLIZATION\">crystallization</a>, and composed only of the acid and base united together, we have the means of ascertaining the composition of such salts very accurately, by determining the proportion of base which they contain.\n\nAccording to the analysis of Dr Thomson, nitre is composed of 100 acid + 83.823 base. According to Dr Wollaston, it is composed of 100 acid + 86.764 base. The statement in the table supposes it a compound of 100 acid + 88.8 potash. The difference between this result and experiment may be owing to our having made an atom of nitric acid a very little too great.\n\nAccording to Dr Thomson, nitrate of soda is composed of 100 acid + 57.8 soda. According to Wenzel, it is composed of 100 acid + 60 base. Our tabular statement supposes 100 acid + 57.92, which almost coincides with the result of Dr Thomson.\n\nBerzelius found nitrate of ammonia composed of 100 acid + 31.266 ammonia. Our tabular state-\nment supposes the salt to be composed of 100 acid + 30.853 ammonia, which very nearly coincides with the experiment of Berzelius.\n\nAccording to Wenzel, nitrate of magnesia is composed of 100 acid + 38.88 base. According to Dr Thomson, of 100 acid + 34.729 base. Our tabular statement supposes it a compound of 100 acid + 37.881 base, which comes very near the experiment of Wenzel.\n\nAccording to Kirwan, nitrate of lime is composed of 100 acid + 55.70 lime. According to Dr Thomson, of 100 acid + 53.091 lime. The tabular statement supposes it composed of 100 acid + 53.2 lime; a number which comes sufficiently near experiment.\n\nAccording to Berzelius, nitrate of barytes is composed of 100 acid + 140.73 barytes. The tabular statement supposes 100 acid + 143.02 base, which does not differ more than 1 per cent. from experiment.\n\nVauquelin informs us that nitrate of strontian is composed of 100 acid + 98.341 base. Now, our statement supposes it a compound of 100 acid + 101.42 base, which is within less than 1 per cent. of the experimental result.\n\nWe suppose nitrate of ammonia and magnesia to be a compound of 3 integrant particles of nitrate of magnesia, and 1 integrant particle of nitrate of ammonia; because that comes nearest the analysis of Fourcroy. But indeed his analyses are very seldom to be depended on.\n\nThe nitrate of copper has not been analyzed. Its composition is inferred from the sulphate of copper, which has been examined with accuracy. Berzelius found the subnitrate composed of 100 acid + 349.2 base. Proust obtained from the same salt 100 acid + 418.7 base. The mean of these two experiments gives 100 acid + 383.95 base. Now, the constitution of the salt which we have supposed in the table requires its composition to be 100 acid + 386.67 base, which comes within half a percent. of the preceding mean, and cannot, therefore, be far from the truth.\n\nThe nitrates of iron are given from theory and from analogy, as it would be scarcely possible, in the present state of the science of chemistry, to analyze them with accuracy.\n\nNeither has the nitrate of zinc been analyzed; yet we do not think there can be any hesitation in admitting the statement given in the table to be correct.\n\nAccording to Berzelius, octahedral nitrate of lead is composed of 100 acid + 205.1 oxide. This analysis, which we consider as exact, corresponds well with our statement in the table. The three subnitrates are described and analyzed by Berzelius (Annals of Philosophy, II. 278). The first contains 2 cc as much oxide as the octahedral nitrate, the second thrice as much, and the third six times as much. The second of these salts exhibits one of Berzelius's exceptions to the Atomic Theory. Its symbol would be, \\(1(a^o) + \\frac{1}{3}(l^o)\\), or 1 integrant particle of nitric acid united with \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) integrant particles of oxide of lead. This appears an absurdity at first sight, because half an integrant particle can have no existence. But when stated, as we have done in the table, the absurdity vanishes: the symbol then becomes \\(2(a^o) + 3(l^o)\\), or two integrant particles of nitric acid, united to three integrant particles of oxide of lead. There is nothing in such an union <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a> with the Atomic Theory; though it is inconsistent with one of Berzelius's general laws, that, in all unorganic compounds, one of the elements enters always in the state of a single atom. In this compound there is no single atom. It consists of 11 atoms of oxygen, + 3 atoms of lead, + 2 atoms of azote.\n\nNitrate of nickel, according to Proust, is composed of 100 acid + 45.45 base. If so, its composition must be as represented in the table. Proust found the subnitrate composed of 100 acid + 735.3 oxide. This leads to the constitution of the salt in the table; if any confidence can be put in the accuracy of the analysis.\n\nThe analysis of Berzelius makes nitrate of silver a compound of 100 acid + 216.45 base. Proust gives us 100 acid + 233.33 base. The statement in the table supposes 100 acid + 216.286, which almost coincides with the result obtained by Berzelius.\n\nNitrate of mercury has not been analyzed. But Messrs Braamchamp and Siguiera Oliva found the pernitrate composed of 100 acid + 733.33 base. This constitutes a very near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROXIMATION\">approximation</a> to the tabular statement, especially when we consider the difficulty of the analysis.\n\nChenevix found the subnitrate of platinum composed of 100 acid + 809.09. This comes within \\(1\\frac{1}{2}\\) per cent. of our statement in the table; a sufficiently near coincidence, if the difficulty of analysis be attended to.\n\nAccording to Berzelius, nitrate of bismuth is composed of 100 acid + 142.69 base. Our statement supposes it composed of 100 acid + 145.42; a sufficiently near coincidence for our purpose.\n\nNitrate of uranium, according to Bucholz, is composed of 100 acid + 292 base. This approaches pretty nearly to the statement in the table, which supposes the salt to be composed of 100 acid + 290.4 base.\n\nThus, we have gone over the composition of the nitrates, without finding anything inconsistent with the Atomic Theory. On the contrary, they agree with that theory so exactly, wherever accurate methods of analysis can be had recourse to, that we may apply the theory, without hesitation, to determine the composition of those nitrates which cannot, in the present state of the science, be analyzed correctly. But, when we apply Berzelius's law, that the oxygen in the acid is a multiple of the oxygen in the base, by a whole number to the nitrates, we find that it fails in several cases, though it holds in the greatest number. As nitric acid contains 5 atoms of oxygen, it is obvious that it cannot combine with a single particle of a deutoxide, without transgressing the rule. But Berzelius has fallen upon a way of reconciling the nitrates to his law. According to him, azote is a compound of 1 atom of oxygen, and 1 atom of nitricum, so that nitric acid, according to him, is a compound of 6 atoms oxygen, and 1 atom nitricum. This opinion is certainly plausible, though it cannot\nbe adopted till something better than mere theory is brought forward in support of it. Let us now examine the phosphates, a genus of salts still much more imperfectly analyzed than any of the three preceding genera.\n\n**Genus IV.\u2014Phosphates.**\n\n| Number of Atoms | Weight of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEGRAL\">Integral</a> Particle |\n|-----------------|----------------------------|\n| 287 Phosphate of potash | 1 ph + 1 p 9.625 |\n| 288 Biphosphate of potash | 2 ph + 1 p 13.250 |\n| 289 Subphosphate of potash | 1 ph + 2 p 15.625 |\n| 290 Phosphate of soda | 2 ph + 1 s 15.125 |\n| 291 Biphosphate of soda | 4 ph + 1 s 22.375 |\n| 292 Phosphate of ammonia | 5 ph + 4 a 26.625 |\n| 293 Biphosphate of ammonia | 5 ph + 2 a 22.875 |\n| 294 Quadrostophosphate of lime | 5 ph + 1 l 21.750 |\n| 295 Binostophosphate of lime | 5 ph + 2 l 25.375 |\n| 296 Bigephosphate of lime | 5 ph + 3 l 29.000 |\n| 297 Osteophosphate of lime | 5 ph + 4 l 32.625 |\n| 298 Phosphate of lime | 5 ph + 5 l 36.350 |\n| 299 Gephosphate of lime \u2020 | 5 ph + 6 l 39.975 |\n| 300 Phosphate of barytes | 1 ph + 1 b 13.375 |\n| 301 Phosphate of strontian | 1 ph + 1 s 10.125 |\n| 302 Phosphate of magnesia | 1 ph + 2 m 8.625 |\n| 303 Protophosphate of copper | 1 ph + 1 c 12.625 |\n| 304 Perphosphate of copper | 1 ph + 2 c 23.625 |\n| 305 Protophosphate of iron | 2 ph + 1 i 16.393 |\n| 306 Perphosphate of iron | 2 ph + 1 i 17.393 |\n| 307 Phosphate of lead | 2 ph + 1 l 35.250 |\n| 308 Phosphate of zinc | 1 ph + 1 z 8.720 |\n| 309 Biphosphate of zinc | 2 ph + 1 z 12.345 |\n| 310 Phosphate of nickel | 2 ph + 1 n 16.553 |\n\nPhosphate of potash, supposing it composed of 1 integrant particle of acid, and 1 integrant particle of base, ought to consist of 100 acid + 166.762 potash. Now, according to the analysis of Saussure jun. it is composed of 100 acid + 185.714 base. According to Berthollet, it is composed of 100 acid + 199.242 base. The author of this article lately subjected all the three phosphates of potash to a careful analysis. The results agree exactly with the tabular number.\n\nWe are not acquainted with any analysis of phosphate of soda, except one made lately by Dr Thomson. He found it composed of 100 acid + 109.59 soda. Now, according to the statement in the table, it is composed of 100 acid + 109.533. In this salt, the difference between the theoretical and experimental result may be considered as nothing.\n\nThe phosphates of ammonia and of magnesia are given from analyses of these salts made by the author of this article, but not yet published.\n\nPhosphate of magnesia and ammonium, according to the analysis of Fourcroy, is composed of equal parts of phosphate of magnesia and phosphate of ammonia. But this result not agreeing with the constituents of these salts, as determined by experiment, this triple salt has been left out of the table.\n\nThere can be no doubt that phosphate of lime is composed of an integrant particle of phosphoric acid, united with an integrant particle of lime. This is the case with the sulphate, carbonate, and nitrate of lime, and unless the phosphate of lime were so formed, Richter's law could not hold good. According to this constitution, the salt must consist of 100 acid + 100 base. We have a considerable number of analyses of phosphate of lime; but all deviating so much from each other, that little confidence can be put in any of them. According to Klaproth, it is composed of 100 acid + 254.281 lime. But the salt which he formed by saturating phosphoric acid with marble, certainly was not the common phosphate of lime, but a subsalt, which has not yet been accurately examined. According to Ekeberg (when his calculations are rectified), phosphate of lime is composed of 100 acid + 82.186 base. This approaches much nearer the true composition, though it is not correct. The salt which Ekeberg found exists, and constitutes earth of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BONES\">bones</a>. It is the ostcophosphate of the table. According to Fourcroy and Vauquelin, phosphate of lime is composed of 100 acid + 143.9 lime. Here there is still a greater error on the opposite side than that fallen into by Ekeberg. But their analysis approaches to that of apatite, the gephosphate of the table. The other phosphates of lime in the table were discovered by the author of this article, and are detailed by him in a paper on phosphoric acid, read to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a>, but not yet published.\n\nPhosphate of barytes, according to the experiments of Berzelius, is composed of 100 acid + 259.715 barytes. Our statement in the table, founded on evidence, which seems quite satisfactory, supposes it a compound of 100 acid + 270.477 base. The difference here between experiment and theory does not exceed 3 per cent.\n\nIf phosphate of strontian be composed of 1 integrant particle of phosphoric acid, and 1 integrant particle of strontian, as there can be no doubt is the case, then its composition must be 100 acid + 191.773 base. We have an analysis of this salt by Vauquelin, according to whom it is composed of 100 acid + 192.48 base. But the data upon which he founded his conclusions, were necessarily so inaccurate, in consequence of the erroneous notions which he entertained respecting the composition of phosphate of lime, that a nearer approach to accuracy could not, in his case, be expected. The numbers in the table are the result of experiments by the author of this article.\n\nIt seems to be a law in saline combinations, that a deutoxide always combines with two integrant particles of acid. Thus, black oxide of copper unites with two integrant particles of sulphuric acid, and likewise with two integrant particles of nitric acid.\n\n---\n\n* So called, because it is a constituent of bones.\n\u2020 This is the apatite of mineralogists.\nHence we may conclude, that it will combine likewise with two integrant particles of phosphoric acid. According to this statement, it must be composed of 100 acid + 138.854 black oxide of copper. Now, according to the analysis of Chenevix, it is composed of 100 acid + 141.428 black oxide of copper. This agrees with the tabular statement very nearly.\n\nWe have the same reason for considering phosphate of iron as a compound of two integrant particles of acid, and one of deutoxide of iron. According to this statement, it ought to be composed of 100 acid + 126.667 black oxide of iron. We have no analysis of this sort. Lougier, indeed, has analyzed a substance which occurs in small prisms in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRAZIL\">Brazil</a>, and in the Isle of France. He found it composed of 100 acid + 214.285 black oxide. This approaches to a compound of 1 integrant particle of acid, and 1 integrant particle of oxide. Dr Thomson found two phosphates composed as in the table.\n\nThe perphosphate of iron is a white insoluble powder, obtained by precipitating persulphate of iron by phosphate of ammonia. It has not been analyzed. Nor do we know whether the theoretical result, as stated in the table, can be admitted to much confidence. This salt is converted into a subsalt, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of an alkali.\n\nPhosphate of lead has been analyzed with great care by three different chemists. According to Berzelius, it is composed of 100 acid + 380.565 base; according to Dr Wollaston, of 100 acid + 370.72 base; and according to Dr Thomson, of 100 acid + 398.49 base. The mean of these experiments gives us 100 acid + 38, nearly 3.258 base. This agrees with the composition of the salt, as stated in the table. It was from it, in part, that we deduced the weight and composition of phosphoric acid.\n\nThe phosphates of zinc, and phosphate of nickel, have been analyzed by Dr Thomson. The composition of these salts in the table is stated from this analysis.\n\nThere is no analysis of the phosphate of mercury. We do not even know if it exists. But the perphosphate of mercury has been analyzed by Messrs Braamcamp and Siguiera. According to them, it is composed of 100 acid + 250.857 peroxide of mercury. Now, if it be a compound of 3 integrant particles of acid and 1 integrant particle of base, its constituents ought to be 100 acid + 250.159 base. This may be considered as identical with the experiment, since the difference is far within the limits of unavoidable error, from the imperfection of our methods.\n\nThus it appears, not only that no exception to the atomic theory exists among the salts; but that it puts it in our power to determine the composition of all the genera of salts, provided we know the analysis of one species, with more accuracy than would result from ordinary experiment. We have not the least doubt, that, when an accurate analysis of the phosphates is published, it will be found in almost every instance to agree with our table. We shall give another example of a genus of salts, the constituents of which we have determined almost entire-\n\n**Genus V.\u2014Borates.**\n\n| Number of Atoms | Weight of an Integrant Particle |\n|-----------------|--------------------------------|\n| 311 Borate of potash | 1 b + 1 p | 8.733 |\n| 312 Sub-borate of potash | 1 b + 2 p | 14.733 |\n| 313 Borate of soda | 2 b + 1 s | 13.341 |\n| 314 Sub-borate of soda | 1 b + 2 s | 18.483 |\n| 315 Borate of ammonia | 1 b + 1 a | 4.858 |\n| 316 Sub-borate of ammonia | 1 b + 2 a | 6.983 |\n| 317 Borate of magnesia | 1 b + 1 m | 5.283 |\n| 318 Borate of lime | 1 b + 1 l | 6.358 |\n| 319 Borate of barytes | 1 b + 1 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> | 12.483 |\n| 320 Borate of strontian | 1 b + 1 str | 9.233 |\n| 321 Borate of alumina | 1 b + 1 a | 4.858 |\n| 322 Borate of yttria | 1 b + 1 y | 11.138 |\n| 323 Borate of glucina | 1 b + 1 g | 12.566 |\n| 324 Borate of zirconia | 1 b + 1 z | 8.358 |\n| 325 Borate of copper | 2 b + 1 c | 15.466 |\n| 326 Borate of iron | 2 b + 1 i | 14.581 |\n| 327 Borate of nickel | 2 b + 1 n | 14.771 |\n| 328 Borate of cobalt | 2 b + 1 c | 14.792 |\n| 329 Borate of lead | 2 b + 1 l | 33.466 |\n| 330 Borate of zinc | 1 b + 1 z | 7.828 |\n| 331 Borate of mercury | 1 b + 1 m | 28.733 |\n| 332 Borate of silver | 1 b + 1 s | 17.483 |\n| 333 Borate of bismuth | 1 b + 1 b | 12.733 |\n| 334 Borate of manganese | 2 b + 1 m | 10.566 |\n| 335 Borate of uranium | 1 b + 1 u | 15.733 |\n| 336 Borate of platinum | 1 b + 1 p | 15.894 |\n\nWe shall take one other genus of salts, as a farther elucidation of the atomic theory; and we shall select one of the vegetable acids, which have been analyzed by Berzelius, that we may be able to judge how far the weight of an integrant particle of the acid derived from his analysis, will agree with the constitution of the salts.\n\n**Genus VI.\u2014Oxalates.**\n\n| Number of Atoms | Weight of an Integrant Particle |\n|-----------------|--------------------------------|\n| 337 Oxalate of potash | 1 ox + 1 p | 10.634 |\n| 338 Binoxalate of potash | 2 ox + 1 p | 15.268 |\n| 339 Quadroxalate of potash | 4 ox + 1 p | 24.536 |\n| 340 Oxalate of soda | 2 ox + 1 s | 17.150 |\n| 341 Oxalate of ammonia | 1 ox + 1 a | 6.783 |\n| 342 Oxalate of magnesia | 1 ox + 1 m | 7.211 |\n| 343 Oxalate of lime | 1 ox + 1 l | 8.254 |\n| 344 Binoxalate of lime | 2 ox + 1 l | 12.888 |\n| 345 Oxalate of barytes | 1 ox + 1 b | 14.365 |\n| 346 Oxalate of strontian | 1 ox + 1 str | 11.534 |\n| 347 Oxalate of alumina | 1 ox + 1 a | 6.770 |\n| 348 Oxalate of yttria | 1 ox + 1 y | 13.034 |\n| 349 Oxalate of glucina | 1 ox + 1 gl | 14.467 |\n| 350 Oxalate of zirconia | 1 ox + 1 z | 10.290 |\n| 351 Oxalate of copper | 2 ox + 1 c | 19.268 |\n\nVOL. I. PART II.\nAccording to the analysis of Berzelius, exhibited in a preceding part of this article, oxalic acid is a compound of 21 atoms, namely, 12 atoms of oxygen, 8 atoms of carbon, and 1 atom of hydrogen. But there can be little hesitation in doubling the quantity of hydrogen found in this acid by Berzelius; because this will greatly increase the simplicity of the composition of the acid, and the difference is considerably within the unavoidable errors in such experiments. In that case, the acid would be constituted of 11 atoms; namely, 6 of oxygen, 4 of carbon, and 1 of hydrogen; and its weight would be 9.070. But the weight of an atom of oxalic acid, even when thus corrected, will not agree with the known constitution of the oxalates. Berzelius analyzed oxalate of lead with great care, and found it composed of 100 acid + 307.5 oxide of lead. Now, it appears from all the genera of salts which we have examined, that the yellow oxide of lead unites always with 2 integrant particles of acid. The weight of an integrant particle of yellow oxide of lead is 28.\n\nNow, \\( \\frac{307.5}{2} : \\frac{100}{2} : 57 : 4.528 = \\) the weight of an integrant particle of oxalic acid. Now, this is very nearly one half of the weight resulting from analysis. To obtain this weight, it would be necessary to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRUPLE\">quadruple</a> the quantity of hydrogen found in oxalic acid by Berzelius, and to consider it as composed of 3 atoms oxygen, 2 atoms carbon, and 1 atom hydrogen. Now, it deserves to be noticed, that this is the constitution of oxalic acid adopted by Mr Dalton (Annals of Philosophy, III. 179.), obtained, we presume, from an examination of the composition of the oxalates, and from the analysis of oxalic acid, previously made by Dr Thomson and by Gay-Lussac and Thenard. Whatever confidence the analytical experiments of Berzelius may be entitled to, we have no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol1.html#article-ALTERNATIVE\">alternative</a> in the present case but to adopt the conclusion suggested by the oxalates. The analysis of these bodies is much easier, and therefore more likely to prove correct, than that of oxalic acid itself. We may adopt 4.625 as the weight of an atom of oxalic acid; and consider it as a compound of 6 atoms, 3 of oxygen, 2 of carbon, and 1 of hydrogen. Its composition would then be:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Oxygen} & : 64.789 \\\\\n\\text{Carbon} & : 32.413 \\\\\n\\text{Hydrogen} & : 2.848 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nWe do not pretend to reconcile this result with that obtained by Berzelius; but the constitution of the oxalates obliges us to adopt it as nearest the truth.\n\nWe have three analyses of the oxalate of potash, one by Dr Thomson (Phil. Trans. 1807), one by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-VOGEL\">Vogel</a> (Schweigger's Journal, II. 470), and one by M. Berard (Annales de Chimie, 73. 270). The statement in the table supposes the salt a compound of 100 acid + 129.477 potash. Now, Dr Thomson's analysis gives us 100 acid + 122.86 base, Vogel's 100 acid + 132.558 base, and Berard's 100 acid + 102.757 base. The first two analyses, especially the second, are very near the truth. Berard's is a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> more incorrect. Dr Wollaston has shown, that binoxalate of potash contains exactly twice as much acid, and quadroxalate of potash four times as much acid as neutral oxalate of potash.\n\nIf oxalate of soda be composed of two integrant particles of acid, and 1 of soda, it must be composed of 100 acid + 85.045 soda. Now, the analysis of Vogel gives us 100 acid + 82.563 base, which agrees very nearly with theory. The analysis of Thomson and Berard are both considerably more incorrect.\n\nSupposing oxalate of ammonia to be constituted as represented in the table, it must be a compound of 100 acid + 46.374 ammonia. Now, the analysis of Berzelius gives us 100 acid + 45.264 base, and that of Berard 100 acid + 44.369 base. Both of these agree well with the tabular statement.\n\nSuperoxalates of soda and of ammonia exist, but we did not give them a place in the table, as they have been but superficially examined. The first is probably a compound of 3 integrant particles of acid, and 1 integrant particle of soda; the second no doubt contains 2 integrant particles of acid and 1 of ammonia. Oxalate of magnesia, supposing it constituted as in the table, is a compound of 100 acid + 55.610 magnesia. Now, Bergman's analysis gives us 100 acid + 53.846 base. This agrees sufficiently with the theory. The analysis of Thomson and Berard are both very faulty. It is not difficult to see how they were misled.\n\nOxalate of lime has been analyzed with great care by different chemists, Bergman, Thomson, Berard, Vogel, Gay-Lussac, and Thenard, &c. But the results differ considerably from each other. The reason is, that various oxalates of lime exist, and that experimenters are always sure to get a mixture of them, when they form oxalate of lime by precipitation. The neutral salt must be composed of 100 acid + 78.117 lime. Now, Vogel's analysis gives us 100 acid + 76 lime, which is sufficiently near to show us, that he calculated the composition of the neutral salt. Dr Thomson gives 100 acid + 60 lime,\nthis must have been a mixture of neutral oxalate and binoxalate of lime. Berard found 100 acid + 61.2 lime, and Thenard, and Gay-Lussac, nearly the same proportions. All these must have been mixtures.\n\nThe analyses of the oxalate of barytes hitherto made, do not correspond with its composition as represented in the table; owing, probably, to the same causes that have occasioned inaccuracy in the analysis of oxalate of lime. This salt ought to be composed of 100 acid + 209.991 barytes. Dr Thomson's analysis gives us 100 acid + 142.86 base, and Berard's 100 acid + 164.3 base. Both of these are very far from accurate.\n\nOxalate of strontian, according to the statement in the table, ought to be composed of 100 acid + 148.894 strontian. Now, according to Dr Thomson's analysis, it is composed of 100 acid + 151.51 base. This agrees sufficiently. Berard's analysis is much less accurate. He obtained 100 acid + 119.5 base. The oxalates of alumina, yttria, glucina, and zirconia, have not been analyzed. But there can be no hesitation in considering their composition as stated in the table to be correct.\n\nOxalate of copper, according to the constitution of it given in the table, is composed of 100 acid + 107.898 black oxide of copper. Now, Vogel found it composed of 100 oxide + 100 acid, including a little water. This agrees sufficiently with the theoretic statement. The three triple oxalates are composed respectively as follows:\n\n1. One integrant particle oxalate of potash, + 1 integrant particle oxalate of copper.\n2. 1 oxalate of soda + 1 oxalate of copper.\n3. 1 oxalate of ammonia + 1 oxalate of copper.\n\nThis agrees with Vogel's analysis. He found oxalate of potash and copper composed of\n\n| Acid | Potash | Oxide of copper |\n|------|--------|----------------|\n| 45   | 30     | 25             |\n\n100\n\nAnd oxalate of ammonia and copper of\n\n| Acid | Ammonia | Oxide of copper |\n|------|---------|----------------|\n| 47.5 | 10.5    | 25.0           |\n\n100.0\n\nThe remaining oxalates, if we except the oxalate of lead, have not yet been subjected to an accurate analysis. The composition, as stated in the table, is deduced from a comparison with the other genera of salts, and there can be no doubt that, in general, it is correct.\n\nIt would be easy for us to exhibit the composition of the remaining genera of salts; but we have already extended this article to as great a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> as is consistent with our limits. The remaining genera, indeed, have been so imperfectly examined, that they would throw no additional light on the atomic theory; though that theory would enable us to calculate their compositions in most cases with sufficient precision. We have omitted, likewise, the chlorides and iodes, two numerous classes of bodies analogous to the oxides to which the atomic theory applies, with as much precision as it does to those substances which we have examined in this article. But these two classes of bodies being but recently discovered, are not probably so familiar to the reader, as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARRANT\">warrant</a> our introducing them without any previous explanation.\n\n(J.)\n\n**<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">Attraction</a>.**\n\nThe word **Attraction** (see *Encyclopaedia*), is used to denote what we observe, when one body approaches another, or tends to approach it, without any apparent impulse, or other cause, to which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> can be ascribed.\n\nWe have instances of attraction when iron approaches the magnet,\u2014when certain bodies are placed near an excited electric,\u2014when a stone falls to the earth. We say likewise that the earth attracts the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>; by this mode of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> meaning no more than that the moon is continually deflected towards the earth, from the rectilineal course which it would otherwise pursue. It is likewise in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> that we must be understood, when we say that the sun attracts all the planets.\n\nIn the instances already mentioned, attraction extends to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a>. In other cases, it is confined within limits so extremely narrow, as to become imperceptible at an interval which cannot be appreciated by the senses. Of this kind is the attraction which takes place between the particles of the same fluid, as is apparent from the round <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of small drops. To this class likewise belongs the attraction between fluid and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> bodies; whence originate the very interesting appearances observed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CAPILLARY\">capillary</a> tubes, and other kindred phenomena. An attraction between the small elementary particles of all solid bodies, is manifest from the force with which they cohere, or resist an endeavour to separate them. In many cases, the intensity of this force is prodigiously great in contact, or at the nearest distances; while it ceases to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a>, upon making the smallest separation between the parts. Lastly, Chemistry develops innumerable instances of attraction between the molecules of the bodies about which it is conversant; insomuch, that it is to this principle, under the name of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a>,\nAttraction. that we must ultimately ascribe the various decompositions and new combinations which occur in that science.\n\nAll these phenomena, although very different from one another in other respects, yet have this in common, that we observe, in certain bodies, a tendency to approach one another, and to resist a separation, with some degree of force. The facts are certain, and are attended with no ambiguity; and it is to express these facts that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> attraction is used in physics.\n\nWe likewise observe, in some bodies, a tendency to fly off from one another when they are brought near. This is called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REPULSION\">repulsion</a>.\n\nThe word force has, in general, some degree of obscurity. It is used to denote the cause of motion; but we have no direct knowledge of it, and we judge of its intensity by the effect which we suppose it to produce. In all our reasoning concerning forces, it is the changes of motion which we measure and compare together, and which are really the subjects of our thoughts. Attraction and repulsion are forces, or principles of motion, known to us only by the phenomena we observe; but the circumstance of their implying action at a distance, is an additional source of obscurity, in which other kinds of force do not participate.\n\nIt certainly is inconceivable, that motion should be produced at a distance, when no connection can be traced between the body moved and that which is supposed to produce the motion. We are strongly impressed with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a>, that a body cannot act but where it is; and we find difficulty in admitting that the mere presence of two bodies, without the intervention of any mechanical means, can be a satisfactory cause of motion. On this account, Attraction has been classed by some with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCCULT\">occult</a> qualities of the schools; and the favourers of this doctrine have been reproached with reviving exploded notions in philosophy. Impulse is a principle of motion more familiar to us, and to which we are not disposed to make equal objection. Whenever the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> of motion can be traced to this source, we are satisfied that the effect is justly explained. Hence, many philosophers have been of opinion, that impulse is the only cause of motion that can be admitted in physical science; and many attempts have been made to reduce to this principle, all cases in which distant bodies act on one another.\n\nWith regard to these attempts, it will be sufficient to remark here, that they are all built upon hypothesis: no evidence is adduced to prove that such things exist, as the elastic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ETHER\">ether</a>, or gravific matter, which they set out with supposing. And, as far as such systems have no other object but to obviate the difficulty of action at a distance, this argument alone is sufficient to confute them, without adverting to the difficulties that attend each of them separately\u2014their inconsistency with the received laws of motion\u2014and the innumerable contradictions and improbabilities to which they are liable on every side.\n\nA little reflection is sufficient to show, that, in reality, we have no clearer notion of impulse as the cause of motion, than we have of attraction. We can as little give a satisfactory reason why motion should pass out of one body into another, on their Attraction contact, as we can, why one body should begin to move, or have its motion increased, when it is placed near another body. It is equally impossible in both cases to prove that there is a necessary connection between the related facts; in this respect, both the phenomena are alike inexplicable.\n\nWhen motion is produced by impulse, it is probably the circumstance of contact apparently taking place, which leads us to think that the effect is so clearly explained. It is in this manner only, or by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> contact, that we ourselves can move <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> objects. We have no power to produce motion in distant bodies, except by the intervention of other bodies on which we act immediately. Impulse is, therefore, a cause of motion familiar to us, and strikes us as the plainest, and most satisfactory, ultimate principle at which we can arrive. On the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, when one body attracts another at a distance, there is nothing familiar to us with which we can compare it; our curiosity is excited, and we are led to seek out some hidden connection between them.\n\nBut, it may be doubted whether there is actual contact in any case of the communication of motion. When a body is impelled by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, it will hardly be affirmed that the particles of that elastic fluid are in contact with one another, since there is no space, however small, within which a given bulk of it may not be compressed, by applying an external force sufficiently great. The particles of air, therefore, act on one another at a distance; and the same thing must be true of all other elastic fluids. And, by the way, what is here said is sufficient to prove, that no scheme, founded on the hypothesis of an elastic ether, will enable us to account for attraction; because such a contrivance can do nothing more than substitute one species of action at a distance in the room of another. There is good reason to think that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> contact never takes place in the component parts of the hardest and most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a> solid bodies. This seems to be an unavoidable consequence of the fact, well established by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, that all bodies <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> in their bulk by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, and expand by heat. It is, therefore, not only not impossible, but it is even in some degree probable, that the communication of motion may, in every instance, be a case of action at a distance.\n\nIf, then, we are apt to think that impulse is a clearer physical principle than attraction, there is, in reality, no good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a>; it has its origin in prejudice, and in our mistaking the proper object of natural philosophy. All our researches in nature are confined to the phenomena we observe, and to the laws by which they are regulated. A physical cause is no other than a general fact discovered by a careful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>, and an attentive comparison, of many particular and subordinate facts. We have no evidence, independent of experience, that any consequence, deduced from a physical cause, will actually take place. There is, in this case, no necessary connection from which we can, with absolute certainty, infer the expected event. If, then, we regard impulse and attraction as princi-\nAttraction. ples founded in fact, and regulated by laws, confirmed by observation and experiment, they are both equally entitled to be classed as physical causes, and they ought both to be admitted as of equal authority in explaining the phenomena of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSE\">universe</a>.\n\nIf we turn our attention to the different kinds of attraction enumerated above, and inquire what progress has been made in the investigation of their laws of action, we shall find that, generally speaking, this branch of physics is little advanced. We are very imperfectly acquainted with magnetical and electrical attraction. We know still less of those attractive powers which take place at small distances, and which are confined within such narrow limits, that their mode of action escapes the observation of our senses. Attraction is, indeed, much used by philosophers to account for many important natural phenomena; but their explanations are often vague, and destitute of that precision which ought always to be aimed at in physical science. There is only one class of phenomena in which the laws of attraction have been fully developed. We allude to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRAVITATION\">gravitation</a>, that principle which occasions the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> of heavy bodies at the surface of the earth, and which retains the planets and comets in their orbits. Referring the other species of attraction, which are little susceptible of general discussion, to their several heads, we shall now confine our attention to gravitation.\n\nTraces of the principle of gravitation are to be found in writers of great antiquity. But their speculations on this subject do not go beyond a vague notion of a tendency which the planets have to one another, or to a common centre. It would contribute little either to entertainment or instruction, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLECT\">collect</a> all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> authors that speak of this principle. The revival of the true system of the world by Copernicus, introduced the most admirable simplicity in the explanation of the planetary motions, and likewise led to more just conjectures concerning the laws by which they are upheld. Copernicus himself attributed the round figure of the planets to a tendency which their parts possess of uniting with one another; thus extending to all the planets which we observe at the surface of the earth. He stopt short, indeed, at this point; conceiving attraction to be confined to the matter of each planet, without making it extend from one planet to another, so as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTUATE\">actuate</a> all the bodies of the system. This step was made by the bold and systematic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> of Kepler. Adopting the opinion of Dr Gilbert of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLCHESTER\">Colchester</a>, that the earth is a great magnet, Kepler formed to himself a notion of attraction, in some respects remarkably just. He says that the earth and moon attract one another; and, were it not for some powers which retain them in their orbits, they would move towards one another, and would meet in their common centre of gravity. He attributes the tide to the moon's attraction (virtus tractive qua in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUNA\">luna</a> est), which heaps up the waters of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCEAN\">ocean</a> immediately under her. But in many respects, his notions of attraction were fanciful and extravagant; a more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> knowledge of the laws of motion than had been attained to in his time, and a new geometry, were both wanting, in order to guide him in this research without danger of wandering. Yet he was able to penetrate so far into the causes of the planetary motions, as to foresee that they would not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> continue latent; he tells us, he was persuaded that \"the full discovery of those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MYSTERIES\">mysteries</a> was reserved for the next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, when God would reveal them.\" So full an exposition of a physical system of the world, as is contained in the writings of Kepler, could not fail to draw the attention of succeeding philosophers. Many remarks concerning the principle of gravitation are to be found in the writings of Fermat, Roberval, Borelli, and other authors. But no one, before Newton, entertained so clear and systematic a view of the doctrine of universal gravitation as Dr Robert Hook. In his work on the motion of the earth, published in 1674, twelve years before the appearance of Newton's Principia, he lays down these three positions as the foundations of his system, viz.\n\n\"1st, That all the heavenly bodies have not only a gravitation of their parts to their own proper centre, but likewise that they mutually attract each other within their spheres of action.\n\n\"2ndly, That all bodies having a simple motion, will continue to move in a straight line, unless continually deflected from it by some extraneous force, causing them to describe a circle, or an ellipse, or some other curve.\n\n\"3rdly, This attraction is so much the greater, as the bodies are nearer.\"\n\nThe principle of universal gravitation is here very precisely enunciated. Dr Hook seems to have clearly perceived, that the planetary motions are the result of an attraction towards the sun, and of a rectilineal motion produced by a projectile force. Not having discovered the law according to which the force diminishes, as the distance from the sun increases, he contrived experiments to elucidate his theory. Having suspended a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> by means of a long thread, he placed another ball upon a table immediately under the point of suspension, and he caused the suspended ball to revolve round the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a> one. When the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOVEABLE\">moveable</a> ball was pushed laterally with a force properly adjusted to its deviation from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a>, it described an exact circle round the ball on the table; in other cases, it described an ellipse, or an oval resembling an ellipse, having the other ball in the centre. Dr Hook observed, that although this experiment, in some measure, illustrated the planetary motions, yet it did not represent them accurately; because the ellipses which the planets describe, have the sun placed in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FOCUS\">focus</a>, and not in the centre. Thus, at the appearance of Newton, many things were known, or rather surmised, that prepared the way for the discovery of the principle which regulates the celestial motions. This does not detract, in any degree, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> of Newton, who, discarding the conjectures of his predecessors, proposed to himself to investigate, with mathematical strictness, the law of the attractive force, and to ascertain, with precision, its sufficiency to retain the planets in their orbits. He invented a new kind of geometry, which was necessary to enable him to accomplish his purpose. With this help, and by admitting no-\nAttraction.\n\nthing without the sanction of the established principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DYNAMICS\">Dynamics</a>, he deduced from the motions of the celestial bodies, the law of universal gravitation, the most important and the most general truth hitherto discovered by the industry and sagacity of man, viz. \"That all the particles of matter attract one another, directly as their masses, and inversely as the squares of their distances.\" The particular occasion which gave rise to the speculations of Newton, on the subject of gravity, is noticed in the life of that great man in the Encyclopedia; and, in the article <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">Astronomy</a> (Part IV. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHAPTER\">Chapter</a> II.) there is an account of the several steps of the analytical process of reasoning, by which the above general law is inferred from the motions of the celestial bodies.\n\nHaving arrived at a principle which belongs to every part of matter, another inquiry comes into view. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SETTING\">Setting</a> out from this principle, it is now necessary to proceed in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERTED\">inverted</a> order, and deduce from it, by synthetical reasoning, the phenomena which we observe in the universe. The first step in this process, is to find out the attractive force of the planets, which arises from the united attractions of their component parts. Two things only are involved in this investigation, viz. the known law of attraction between the particles of matter, and the figure of the attracting bodies. This is a subject of great importance, and it is connected with some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of the system of the world, with the theory of the figure of the planets, that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-TIDES\">tides</a>, and many other phenomena. It is but imperfectly discussed in Newton's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMMORTAL\">immortal</a> work; and there is no part of his philosophy which has been improved more slowly by the labours of his followers. We now propose to treat of it at some length, endeavouring to lay before our readers as complete a view of this part of science as the nature of our work will permit.\n\nWe begin with laying down some definitions, and demonstrating some properties of elliptical spheroids.\n\nDef. 1. A solid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> by the revolving of an ellipse about either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol3.html#article-AXIS\">axis</a> is called a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPHEROID\">spheroid</a> of revolution. If the ellipse revolve about the less axis, the spheroid is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBLATE\">oblate</a>; if about the greater axis, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a>.\n\nLet \\( k \\) and \\( k' \\) denote the two axes of the spheroid, \\( k \\) being that of revolution; and let \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) be two coordinates of a point in the surface of the spheroid, having their origin in the centre, \\( x \\) being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to the axis of revolution, and \\( y \\) perpendicular to it; then the equation of the spheroid, whether oblate or oblong, will be\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x^2}{k^2} + \\frac{y^2}{k'^2} = 1.\n\\]\n\nDef. 2. An elliptical spheroid, in general, or an ellipsoid, is a solid bounded by a finite surface of the second order. Let ACB and ADE (Plate XXX. fig. 1). This figure represents one eighth of an ellipsoid contained in one of the solid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> formed by the three principal sections) be two ellipses that have the same axis AO, the same centre O, and their planes perpendicular to one another; from any point K in the common axis, let there be drawn ordinates in both ellipses, as KC and KD; then, having described an ellipse of which KC and Attraction. KD are the semiaxes, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIPHERY\">periphery</a> DMC of that ellipse will be in the surface of the ellipsoid. This solid figure has a centre; three axes crossing one another at right angles in the centre; and three principal sections made by planes passing through every two of its axes.\n\nLet \\( k, k', k'' \\), denote the three semiaxes; viz. \\( k = OB, k' = OE, k'' = OA \\); and let \\( x, y, z \\) denote three rectangular coordinates of a point M in the surface, the coordinates being parallel to the axes, and having their origin in the centre; viz. \\( MN = x, NK = y, OK = z \\); then the equation of the surface will be\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x^2}{k^2} + \\frac{y^2}{k'^2} + \\frac{z^2}{k''^2} = 1;\n\\]\n\nit is easy to prove from the foregoing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a>.\n\nThe ellipsoid becomes a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPHERE\">sphere</a>, when all the three axes are equal; it becomes a spheroid of revolution, when two of them are equal.\n\n1. If any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> cut an elliptical spheroid, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> will be an ellipse. In the spheroid of revolution, a section made by a plane perpendicular to the axis of revolution is a circle.\u2014All this follows so easily from the nature of the solids, that we need not stop to give a formal demonstration.\n\n2. If a straight line cut two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCENTRIC\">concentric</a> ellipses, that are similar and similarly situated, the parts of it between the outer and inner peripheries are equal to one another.\n\nLet AHBK and MDNC (Plate XXX. fig. 2.) be two similar and similarly situated ellipses that have the same centre O; and let the straight line AB cut them both; then AC and BD are equal. Bisect CD in L, and through L and the common centre draw the straight line HMNK to cut both ellipses. Because the ellipses are similar and similarly situated, and that CD is an ordinate of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a> MN, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> that AB will be an ordinate of the diameter HK; therefore, AB and CD being both bisected in L, AC is equal to BD.\n\n3. If there be two ellipses, one within the other, such that, any straight line being drawn to cut them, the parts of it between their peripheries are equal to one another; these ellipses are concentric, similar, and similarly situated.\n\nLet D (fig. 2.) be any point in the inner ellipse, and through D draw EF, terminating in the outer ellipse; then, if we make FG = DE, G must be a point in the inner ellipse. Hence all the points of the inner curve are determined, when the outer ellipse and the point D are given; wherefore there cannot be two different curves, both passing through D, that will answer the conditions. But an ellipse described through D, concentric with the outer ellipse, and similar to it, and similarly situated, will answer the conditions (2). Wherefore the two ellipses are concentric, and similar, and similarly situated.\n\n4. If a straight line be drawn to cut two elliptical spheroids, that have the same centre, and are similar and similarly situated, the part of it between the outer and inner surfaces will be equal to one another.\n\nConceive a plane, which contains the straight line, to pass through the common centre of the solids;\nAttraction. the sections made by the plane will be concentric ellipses (1.) ; and these will be similar and similarly situated, because the solids are so; wherefore the parts of the straight line between the surfaces are equal (2.).\n\n5. If two elliptical spheroids that have the same centre, and are similar and similarly situated, be cut by a plane, the two sections will be concentric ellipses that are similar and similarly situated.\n\nFor the sections are ellipses (1.) ; and, any straight line being drawn to cut them, the parts of it between the peripheries will be equal (4.) ; wherefore the ellipses are concentric, similar, and similarly situated (3.)\n\n6. Let ADE and CFG (fig. 3.) be two concentric ellipses that are similar and similarly situated; let AO and CO, in the same straight line, be two of their axes, and let DE, drawn through C, be perpendicular to AO; then if CF and CG be two chords of the interior ellipse that make equal angles with the axis CO, and if the chords DM and DN of the exterior ellipse be drawn respectively parallel to CF and CG; the sum of CF and CG will be equal to the sum or difference of DM and DN, according as they both fall on the same side, or on different sides of DE.\n\nFor draw EP parallel to CF, and it will likewise be parallel to DM. Because CF and CG are equally inclined to CO and to DE, it is plain that DN and RP, which are parallel to CF and CG, are likewise equally inclined to DE; consequently DN = EP.\n\nDraw a straight line through the common centre to bisect DM in L, and that straight line will likewise bisect EP, parallel to DM, in H; and because the ellipses are similar and similarly situated, the same straight line will likewise bisect the chord CF of the interior ellipse, in K. Because DC = CE, therefore DL + EH = 2CK = CF. Wherefore DM + DN = 2DL + 2EH = 2CF = CF + CG.\n\nThe demonstration of the other case, when DM and DN fall on different sides of DE, is entirely similar.\n\nSome general Properties, resulting from the Law of Attraction, that obtains in Nature.\n\n7. Let AB and EF (fig. 4.) be two indefinitely slender pyramids, that are similar to one another, and both composed of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMOGENEOUS\">homogeneous</a> matter, which attracts in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERSE\">inverse</a> proportion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> of the distance; the attractions of the pyramids upon particles placed at the vertices A and E, are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to the length of the pyramids.\n\nConceive each of the pyramids to be divided into an indefinitely great number of thin slices of equal thickness, by planes parallel to its base; then, if CD and GH be any two of these slices, their attractions upon particles placed at A and E, will be proportional to \\(\\frac{CD}{AC}\\) and \\(\\frac{GH}{EG^2}\\). Now, these are equal: for, the solids CD and GH, having the same thickness, they are proportional to the sections CM and GN, that is, to \\(AC^2\\) and \\(EG^2\\), because the pyramids are similar. Wherefore, the attraction of any one of the slices in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYRAMID\">pyramid</a> AB, upon a particle placed at A, is equal to the attraction of any one of the slices in EF upon a particle placed at E. Consequently, the whole attraction of the pyramid AB, is to the whole attraction of the pyramid EF, as the number of slices in AB to the number of slices in EF, that is, as the length AB to the length EF.\n\nCor. 1. The attractions of any portions of the pyramid, are as the lengths of the portions. For the attractions are proportional to the number of slices in the portions, that is, as the lengths.\n\nCor. 2. If the pyramids have different densities, their attractions are proportional to the lengths multiplied by the densities. For, in this case, the attraction of each slice will be proportional to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol7.html#article-DENSITY\">density</a>: wherefore, the attractions will be as the densities multiplied by the number of slices; or, as the densities multiplied by the lengths.\n\n8. If there be two similar solids composed of the same homogeneous matter, which attracts in the inverse proportion of the square of the distance; any two particles of matter, similarly situated with regard to the solids, will be attracted by them with forces that are proportional to any of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMOLOGOUS\">homologous</a> lines of the solids.\n\nBecause the solids are similar, they may be resolved into an indefinitely great number of slender pyramids, and frustums of pyramids, that are similar to one another, and similarly placed in the solids; each pyramid having its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERTEX\">vertex</a> at one of the attracted particles. The direct attractions of any corresponding pair of pyramids will have constantly the same ratio to one another: for they will be as the lengths of the pyramids or frustums (7.) ; that is, because the solids are similar, as any two homologous lines of the solids. Therefore, the whole attractive forces, compounded of all the direct attractions which act in directions that make the same angles with one another, will likewise have to one another the proportion of any two of the homologous lines of the solids.\n\nCor. If the two solids have different densities, their attractions will be proportional to the densities multiplied by any homologous lines of the solids (7. Cor. 2.).\n\n9. If there be two concentric elliptical spheroids that are similar and similarly situated, a particle placed anywhere within the inner surface will be in equilibrium, or will be urged equally in all opposite directions by the shell of homogeneous matter contained between the two surfaces, supposing the law of attraction to be that of the inverse proportion of the square of the distance.\n\nLet P (Plate XXX. fig. 5.) be a particle placed within such a shell, and let a slender double pyramid, having P for the common vertex, be extended to meet the surfaces of the solid on both sides of P. The portions of the pyramid, AGHB and CEF between the surfaces on opposite sides of P, will have equal lengths (4.) ; wherefore, these portions will attract a particle placed at P with equal forces (7. Cor. 1.). The same thing may be proved of all the pyramids which have their vertices at P, and fill the spheroids. Wherefore, P is attracted equally in all opposite directions by the homogeneous matter contained between the surfaces of the spheroids.\n\n10. To find the attractive force of an indefinitely slender <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRISM\">prism</a>, acting in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> parallel to the prism, upon a particle of matter placed anywhere.\nLet BC (Plate XXX. fig. 6.) be a prism of homogeneous matter, upon the indefinitely slender base CH, and let a particle of matter be placed at A; draw AB and AC to the extremities of the prism, and AE to any point in it; and draw <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AD\">AD</a> perpendicular to BC. Let S = base CH, and put AD = a, DE = x; the element of the prism is \\( S \\times dx \\); the element of the attraction in the direction AE, is \\( \\frac{S \\times dx}{AE^2} \\); and the element of the attraction in the direction parallel to the prism, is \\( \\frac{S \\times dx}{AE^2} \\times \\frac{DE}{AE} = \\frac{S \\times dx}{(a^2 + x^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}}} \\).\n\nNow, \\( \\int \\frac{S \\times dx}{(a^2 + x^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}}} = \\text{Const.} - \\frac{S}{\\sqrt{a^2 + x^2}} = \\text{Const.} \\)\n\n\\( \\frac{S}{AE} \\); and the constant quantity is determined by making the fluent begin at the end of the prism nearer to A; wherefore, the whole attractive force of the prism, in the direction parallel to the prism, is\n\n\\[ S \\times \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{AB} - \\frac{1}{AC} \\right\\}. \\]\n\nCor. In like manner may the attractive force of the prism be found, when the attraction of the particles is proportional to any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a> of the distance.\n\nLet \\( AB = f, AC = f' \\); suppose that \\( \\varphi(f) \\) is the function of the distance that expresses the law of attraction; and put \\( \\int df \\cdot \\varphi(f) = \\Psi(f) \\); then the attraction parallel to the prism, is\n\n\\[ S \\times \\left\\{ \\Psi(f) - \\Psi(f') \\right\\}, \\]\n\nobserving that the attraction is always positive.\n\nAttraction of Spheres.\n\n11. Spheres of the same homogeneous matter, attract particles placed on their surfaces, with forces proportional to their radii.\n\nSpheres being similar solid figures, this proposition is no more than a particular case of what was before proved (8.).\n\nCor. If the spheres have different densities, the attractions at their surfaces are proportional to their radii multiplied by their densities (8. Cor.).\n\n12. The force with which a particle, placed anywhere within a sphere of homogeneous matter, is urged towards the centre, is proportional to its distance from the centre.\n\nConceive a concentric sphere to be described, which contains the attracted particle in its surface; the matter between the two surfaces will exert no force on the particle (9.), which will therefore be urged to the centre, only by the attraction of the inner sphere, in the surface of which it is placed: but this force is proportional to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RADIUS\">radius</a> of the sphere, or to the distance of the particle from the centre (11.).\n\n13. Let PNQ and ABC (fig. 7.) be two spheres of the same homogeneous matter, which attracts in the inverse proportion of the square of the distance: let the centres of the spheres be at M and D, and take MR equal to the radius of the sphere ABC, and ED equal to the radius of the sphere PNQ; the attractions of the spheres upon particles placed at R and E are to one another as the squares of the radii of the spheres.\n\nIn the spheres draw two great circles perpendicular to the diameters PQ and AC, that pass through the points R and E; and let PpQ and AbC be two great circles, making equal indefinitely small angles NMp and BD6 with the great circles PNQ and ABC. Let HK and FG, parallel to PQ and AC, be any two chords of the circles PpQ and AbC, that subtend similar arcs, or arcs containing the same number of degrees; and through HK and FG, let planes perpendicular to the circles PpQ and AbC, be drawn to cut the portions of the spheres contained in the angles NMp and BD6: join RH, RK, MH, MK, DF, DG, EF, EG. Because the arcs subtended by HK and FG, are like parts of their circumferences, it is plain, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> RMH = EDF, and RMK = EDG. And because ED = MH = MK, and RM = DF = DG (hyp.), therefore RH = EF, and RK = EG.\n\nConceive the chords HK and FG, together with the planes passing through them, to change their place a little, so as to describe two slender prisms, or elements of the portions of the spheres contained in the angles NMp and BD6. It is plain that MR and DO, the distances of the chords HG and FG from the centres of their circles, are constantly proportional to MN and DB, the radii of the spheres; wherefore RT and OS, the perpendicular sections of the small prisms, are similar figures, and have to one another the same ratio that MX\u00b2 has to DO\u00b2, or MN\u00b2 to DB\u00b2. Now, the attraction of the prism HK urging a particle at R to the centre M, is\n\n\\[ XT \\times \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{RH} - \\frac{1}{RK} \\right\\} \\] (10.); and the attraction of the prism FG urging a particle at E to the centre D, is\n\n\\[ OS \\times \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{EF} - \\frac{1}{EG} \\right\\}. \\]\n\nBut, in consequence of what was proved,\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{RH} - \\frac{1}{RK} = \\frac{1}{EF} - \\frac{1}{EG}; \\]\n\nwherefore the attractions of the prisms are to one another as XT to OS, or as MN\u00b2 to DB\u00b2.\u2014The same thing may be proved of all the elements of the two portions of the spheres contained in the angles NMp and BD6; wherefore those portions attract particles at R and E with forces proportional to the squares of the radii of the spheres. But because the small angles NMp and BD6 are equal, each of the spheres may be divided into an equal number of such portions; wherefore the attractions of the whole spheres upon particles placed at R and E, are proportional to the squares of the radii of the spheres.\n\nCor. This proposition is true, when the particles of matter attract one another with forces proportional to any proposed function of the distance.\n\nLet RH = EF = f, and RK = EG = f'; then, adopting the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOTATION\">notation</a> as before (8. Cor.), the attractions of the prisms urging particles placed at R and E to the centres M and D, are respectively XT \\( \\times \\left\\{ \\Psi(f) - \\Psi(f') \\right\\} \\), and OS \\( \\times \\left\\{ \\Psi(f) - \\Psi(f') \\right\\} \\); consequently, those attractions have the same pro-\nportion that RT has to SO, or MN\u00b2 to DB\u00b2. Wherefore the attractions of the whole spheres are in the same proportion.\n\n14. A particle placed anywhere without a sphere of homogeneous matter which attracts in the inverse proportion of the square of the distance, will be urged to the centre of the sphere, with a force that is inversely proportional to the square of the particle's distance from the centre.\n\nLet ABC (Plate XXX. fig. 8.) be the sphere, O its centre, and P a particle without the sphere: conceive a concentric sphere PMN, of the same homogeneous matter with the sphere ABC, to be described with the radius PO. Then, by the last proposition, the attraction of the sphere ABC upon the particle P, is to the attraction of the sphere PMN upon a particle placed at A, as AO\u00b2 to PO\u00b2. But the attraction of the sphere PMN upon a particle placed at A, is equal to the attraction of the sphere ABC upon the same particle; for the attraction of the matter between the two spherical surfaces exerts no force upon a particle at A (9.). Therefore, in the proportion set down above, the two middle terms are constantly the same wherever the point P is placed without the sphere ABC. Consequently, the first term of the proportion must follow the inverse ratio of the last term; that is, the attraction of the sphere ABC upon the external particle at P is inversely proportional to PO\u00b2.\n\n15. The same law of attraction being supposed, a homogeneous sphere will attract a particle placed without it, with the same force as if all the matter of the sphere were collected in the centre.\n\nLet f denote the distance of the particle from the centre; then it follows, from the last proposition, that the attraction of the sphere upon the particle will have, for its measure, \\( \\frac{A}{f^2} \\); A denoting a constant quantity that will be determined by any particular case; that is, by the actual attractive force corresponding to any determinate distance from the centre. Let r denote the radius of the sphere, and M its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>; then no part of the matter of the sphere being nearer the attracted particle than \\((f-r)\\), and none of it more remote than \\((f+r)\\), the attraction of the sphere on the particle will be greater than \\( \\frac{M}{(f-r)^2} \\), and less than \\( \\frac{M}{(f+r)^2} \\). Therefore \\( \\frac{A}{f^2} \\) is always contained between those limits, which requires that \\( A = M \\). For, if A were greater than M, such values of f might be found as would make \\( \\frac{A}{f^2} \\) equal to, or greater than \\( \\frac{M}{(f-r)^2} \\); and, if A were less than M, such values of f might be found as would make \\( \\frac{A}{f^2} \\) equal to, or less than \\( \\frac{M}{(f+r)^2} \\).\n\nTherefore \\( A = M \\); and the attraction of the sphere is equal to \\( \\frac{M}{f^2} \\), or the same as if all the matter were collected in the centre.\n\nIf the radius of the sphere \\( = r \\), the density of the Attraction matter contained in it \\( = d \\); then the mass, or \\( M = \\frac{4\\pi r^3d}{3} \\) (\\( \\pi \\) being the circumference of the circle whose diameter is unit), and the attraction of the sphere at the distance \\( f \\) from the centre \\( = \\frac{4\\pi r^3d}{3f^2} \\). This is still true at the surface of the sphere when \\( f = r \\), so that the attraction at the surface \\( = \\frac{4\\pi rd}{3} \\); which expression, with the help of what is proved in (12.), enables us to compare the intensities of the attractions of homogeneous spheres, at all distances from the centre, without or within the surfaces.\n\nCor. 1. A shell of homogeneous matter contained between two concentric spherical surfaces, will attract a particle placed without it, with the same force as if all the matter of the shell were collected in its centre.\n\nFor the attractive force of such a shell is equal to the difference of the attractions of two concentric spheres of the same homogeneous matter with the shell.\n\nCor. 2. A sphere composed of concentric shells, that vary in their densities according to any law, will attract a particle placed without it, with the same force as if all the matter were collected in the centre.\n\nFor this having been proved of one shell (Cor. 1.), it must be true of any number of shells.\n\nIf \\( \\varphi(r) \\) denote the density at the distance \\( r \\) from the centre, the quantity of matter in the sphere will be \\( = \\int_0^r \\varphi(r) r^2 dr \\); and the attraction on a particle without the sphere at the distance \\( f \\) from the centre \\( = \\frac{4\\pi f \\varphi(r) r^2 dr}{f^2} \\).\n\n16. Two spheres, each composed of concentric shells of variable density, attract one another with the same force as if all the matter of each were collected in its centre.\n\nFor the attraction of a sphere A upon every particle of another sphere B will remain the same, if we suppose all the matter of A to be collected in its centre (15.). But the attraction of any particles of matter placed in A's centre, upon the sphere B, is equal and opposite to the attraction of B, upon the same matter so placed: and, again, the attraction of B upon all the particles placed in the centre of A, will remain unchanged, if we suppose the matter of B to be collected in its centre. Wherefore A attracts B with the same force as if the matter of each were collected in its centre.\n\n17. Supposing that the particles of matter attract with a force proportional to the distance, a body of any shape will attract a particle of matter placed anywhere with the same force, and in the same direction, as if all the matter of the body were collected in its centre of gravity.\n\nSuppose that the attracted particle is placed at P (fig. 9.), and the centre of gravity of the attracting body at G; join PG, and let any plane pass through that line. Let L be a small part, or element of the body, and\nAttraction. From L draw LK perpendicular to the plane passing through PG, and KF perpendicular to PG; join PL and PK. Put dm to denote the quantity of matter, or the mass of the element L; then its attractive force, urging the particle in the direction PL, is \\( PL \\times dm \\), which, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> of forces, is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to the two forces, \\( PK \\times dm \\) and \\( KL \\times dm \\); and, again, the single force \\( PK \\times dm \\) is equivalent to the two forces \\( FK \\times dm \\) and \\( PF \\times dm = PG \\times dm + GF \\times dm \\). Therefore, the attraction of the element L, upon the particle at P, is equivalent to these four separate forces, viz. \\( PG \\times dm \\), \\( GF \\times dm \\), \\( FK \\times dm \\), \\( KL \\times dm \\), which urge the particle P respectively in the directions, PG, GF, FK, KL. But, from the nature of the centre of gravity, the sum of all the forces, \\( KL \\times dm \\), that urge the particle P to one side of the plane passing through PG, is just equal to the sum of the forces that urge it to the other side of the same plane; and the sum of all the forces, \\( FK \\times dm \\), that urge P to one side of the line PG, is just equal to the sum of the forces that urge it to the other side of the same line; and the sum of all the forces, \\( GF \\times dm \\), that urge P towards the point G, is just equal to the sum of the forces that urge it from the same point. Therefore all the preceding forces mutually destroy one another, excepting the forces, \\( PG \\times dm \\), the sum of which, when extended to all the elements of the attracting body, is \\( = PG \\times \\text{mass of the body} \\). Therefore the whole attraction upon P is the same as if all the matter of the body were collected in its centre of gravity.\n\nCor. Supposing that the particles of matter attract with a force proportional to the distance, a homogeneous sphere will attract a particle placed anywhere in the same manner as if all the matter of the sphere were collected in the centre.\n\nFor the centre of gravity of a homogeneous sphere, is the same as the centre of its figure. This corollary is likewise true of a sphere composed of concentric shells of variable density; and it is easy to apply the demonstration of (16.) to prove that, in this law of attraction, two spheres, each composed of concentric shells of variable density, will attract one another with the same force as if the matter of each were collected in its centre.\n\n18. To investigate what are the laws of attraction, in regard to the distance, according to which a shell of homogeneous matter, contained between two concentric spherical surfaces, will attract a particle placed without it, in the same manner as if all the matter of the shell were collected in the centre.\n\nIt has been proved that this property actually belongs to homogeneous shells in the law of attraction which obtains in nature, and likewise when the particles of matter attract with a force proportional to the distance; but it is interesting to know whether it is confined to these two cases alone, or extends to other laws of attraction. This can only be discovered by a direct analysis.\n\nLet \\( r = PC \\) (fig. 10.), the distance of the attracted point from the centre of the shell; \\( u = CA \\) the radius of the inner surface of the shell; \\( f = PM \\), the distance of P from any point in the surface. Having drawn the diameter AD through P, let AMD and AND be two great circles, making, with one another, an indefinitely small angle MAN = \\( dq \\); and let two Attraction, small circles BMG, bmg, indefinitely near one another, of which A and D are the poles, meet the former circles in M, N, m, n; and draw MS, NS to the centre of the circle BMG. Put \\( \\delta \\) for the measure of the arc AM; then \\( MS = u \\sin \\delta \\); \\( MN = dq \\cdot u \\sin \\delta \\); \\( MM = u^2 dq \\cdot d\\delta \\sin \\delta \\); and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRILATERAL\">quadrilateral</a> space \\( MNmm = u^2 dq \\cdot d\\delta \\sin \\delta \\). We may suppose the thickness of the shell indefinitely small; since, if the property belong to an elementary shell indefinitely thin, it will be true of one of a determinate thickness, which can be resolved into such elements. Suppose the thickness of the shell to be \\( = du \\); then, the quantity of matter in the part standing upon the quadrilateral space \\( MNmm = u^2 du \\cdot dq \\cdot d\\delta \\sin \\delta \\). Let \\( \\varphi(f) \\) represent the direct attraction of a particle at M in the direction PM; then its attraction directed to the centre C \\( = \\varphi(f) \\times \\frac{PS}{PM} = \\frac{r - u \\cos \\delta}{f} \\times \\varphi(f) \\); and the attraction of the element of the shell in the same direction \\( = u^2 du \\cdot dq \\cdot d\\delta \\sin \\delta \\times \\frac{r - u \\cos \\delta}{f} \\cdot \\varphi(f) \\).\n\nThis expression is proportional to \\( dq \\), when \\( \\delta \\) and \\( f \\) remain constant; and, therefore (denoting by \\( \\sigma \\) the circumference of the circle whose diameter is unit), the attraction of the whole zone contained between the small circles BMG, bmg, will be \\( = 2 \\pi u^2 du \\cdot d\\delta \\sin \\delta \\cdot \\frac{r - u \\cos \\delta}{f} \\cdot \\varphi(f) \\); and the attractive force of the whole shell will be\n\n\\[ 2 \\pi u^2 du \\int d\\delta \\sin \\delta \\cdot \\frac{r - u \\cos \\delta}{f} \\cdot \\varphi(f) \\]\n\nthe fluent to be extended from \\( \\delta = 0 \\) to \\( \\delta = \\pi \\).\n\nAgain, the quantity of matter in the shell is \\( = 4 \\pi u^2 du \\); and the attraction of this matter placed in the centre, at the distance \\( r \\) from P, is \\( = 4 \\pi u^2 du \\cdot \\varphi(r) \\).\n\nIf now we equate the attraction of the shell, to the attraction of its matter placed in the centre, and leave out the factors common to both, we shall get\n\n\\[ 2 \\pi u^2 \\int d\\delta \\sin \\delta \\cdot \\frac{r - u \\cos \\delta}{f} \\cdot \\varphi(f) \\]\n\nthe limits of the integral being the same as before.\n\nBut \\( f^2 = r^2 - 2ru \\cos \\delta + u^2 \\); then \\( d\\delta \\sin \\delta = \\frac{fd\\delta}{ru} \\); also \\( r - u \\cos \\delta = \\frac{f^2 + r^2 - u^2}{2r} \\); wherefore, by substitution, we get\n\n\\[ 4 \\pi u^2 \\varphi(r) \\cdot u = \\int (f^2 + r^2 - u^2) \\cdot df \\cdot \\varphi(f) \\]\n\nor, which is equivalent, \\( 4 \\pi u^2 \\varphi(r) \\cdot u = \\int (f^2 + r^2 - u^2) \\cdot df \\cdot \\varphi(f) - 2 \\int fdf \\cdot \\int df \\cdot \\varphi(f) \\),\n\nthe limits of this integral being from \\( f = r - u \\) to \\( f = r + u \\), which correspond to \\( \\delta = 0 \\) and \\( \\delta = \\pi \\).\n\nNow let \\( \\int df \\cdot \\varphi(f) = \\psi(f) \\); and \\( \\int fdf \\cdot \\int df \\cdot \\varphi(f) = \\int fdf \\cdot \\psi(f) = \\psi'(f) \\); then, by taking the fluents between the proper limits, we get\nAttraction.\n\n\\[ \\varphi(r) = 2r \\left\\{ (r+u)^n - (r-u)^n \\right\\} - 2 \\left\\{ r^n + u^n \\right\\}. \\]\n\nIf we develope the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BINOMIAL\">binomial</a> functions in the last expression, all the even powers of \\( u \\) will disappear, and the odd powers only will remain; these last terms being all contained in this general formula,\n\n\\[ \\text{viz. } \\frac{4}{1,2,3 \\ldots 2n+1} \\left\\{ r \\cdot \\frac{d^{2n+1}}{dr^{2n+1}} \\varphi(r) \\right\\}^n. \\]\n\nand, observing that \\( \\frac{d}{dr} \\varphi(r) = r \\varphi(r) \\), the same expression will become\n\n\\[ \\frac{4}{1,2,3 \\ldots 2n+1} \\left\\{ r \\cdot \\frac{d^{2n+1}}{dr^{2n+1}} \\varphi(r) \\right\\}^n. \\]\n\nwhich, again, is more simply expressed thus, viz.\n\n\\[ \\frac{4}{1,2,3 \\ldots 2n+1} \\left\\{ r \\cdot \\frac{d^{2n+1}}{dr^{2n+1}} \\varphi(r) \\right\\}^n. \\]\n\nWherefore, by substituting the development instead of the functions, and then, by dividing by \\( 4r^2 \\), we get\n\n\\[ \\varphi(r) = \\frac{d}{dr} \\varphi(r) + \\frac{1}{1,2,3} \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{r} \\cdot \\frac{d^2}{dr^2} \\varphi(r) \\right\\}^n. \\]\n\nFrom the nature of the function \\( \\varphi(r) \\), we get \\( \\varphi(r) = \\frac{d}{dr} \\varphi(r) \\); therefore each of the remaining terms must be separately equal to nothing: Hence\n\n\\[ \\frac{d}{dr} \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{r} \\cdot \\frac{d^2}{dr^2} \\varphi(r) \\right\\} = 0; \\]\n\nfrom which we find \\( r \\varphi(r) = \\frac{1}{2} A r^2 + A' r - A'' \\),\n\n\\( A, A', A'' \\) being arbitrary constant quantities; and this value of \\( r \\varphi(r) \\), it is plain, will likewise render all the succeeding terms of the development evanescent. Therefore\n\n\\[ \\varphi(r) = \\frac{d}{dr} \\varphi(r) = A r + \\frac{A'}{r}. \\]\n\nThus the most general expression of the law of attraction, that possesses the property in question, is a combination of the two laws above mentioned, with each of which it coincides, according as we make the one or other of the constant quantities equal to nothing. We have therefore a direct proof, that the law of nature is the only one which will make the attraction decrease as the distance increases, and in which a spherical shell, or a sphere, will attract in the same manner as if all the matter were collected in the centre.\n\nLaplace has arrived at the same conclusion by a different process. (Mech. Celeste, Liv. 2d. Chap. 2. No. 12. Rem. Part.)\n\nAttraction of Spheroids of Revolution.\n\n19. Let \\( APBQ \\) (Plate XXXI, fig. 11.) and \\( CMDN \\) be two concentric ellipses, similar to one another, and similarly situated, of which \\( AB \\) and \\( CD \\) are either the greater, or less, axes; and let \\( PCQ \\) be perpendicular to \\( AB \\). Conceive the ellipse to revolve about \\( PQ \\) so as to describe an indefinitely small angle; then, supposing the law of attraction to be inversely proportional to the square of the distance, the thin solid of homogeneous matter described by the ellipse \\( APBQ \\) will attract a particle placed at \\( P \\), in a direction perpendicular to any plane passing through \\( PQ \\), with the same force that the thin solid of the same matter described by the ellipse \\( CMDN \\), will attract a particle placed at \\( C \\) perpendicularly to the same plane.\n\nFrom \\( C \\) draw \\( CM, CN \\), making equal angles with \\( CD \\), and \\( PR, PT \\) respectively parallel to \\( CM, CN \\); and let \\( Cm, Ca, Pr, Pt \\) be drawn in the same manner, and indefinitely near the former lines. While the ellipses revolve about \\( PQ \\), the small sectors will describe pyramids that have their vertices at \\( C \\) and \\( P \\).\n\nIt is manifest that the pyramids so described are similar; for their angles at \\( C \\) and \\( P \\) in the planes of the ellipses are equal; and their other angles described by revolving about \\( PQ \\) are likewise equal, because the sectors are equally inclined to that axis. Wherefore, the direct attractions of all the small pyramids upon the particles \\( P \\) and \\( C \\), are proportional to the lengths \\( PR, PT, CM, CN \\); and consequently the forces that urge the particles \\( P \\) and \\( C \\) in a direction at right angles to any plane passing through \\( PQ \\), are proportional to the perpendiculars let fall upon that plane from \\( R, T, M, N \\). But, because \\( PR, PT, CM, CN \\) are equally inclined to \\( PQ \\), they will make equal angles with any plane passing through \\( PQ \\); wherefore the perpendiculars drawn to the plane from \\( R, T, M, N \\), will be respectively proportional to \\( CM, CN, PR, PT \\). But \\( CM + CN = PR + PT \\); wherefore, the sum of the perpendiculars drawn to the plane from \\( M \\) and \\( N \\), will be equal to the sum of the perpendiculars drawn to it from \\( R \\) and \\( T \\). Consequently the force of the pyramids \\( PR \\) and \\( PT \\), which urges the particle \\( P \\) at right angles to the plane, is equal to the force of the pyramids \\( CM \\) and \\( CN \\), which urges the particle \\( C \\) in a parallel direction. The same thing is true of all the small pyramids that make up the thin solids described by the ellipses \\( APBQ \\) and \\( CMDN \\); and it is therefore true of the whole solids.\n\nIt is to be observed, that when the pyramids \\( PR \\) and \\( PT \\) fall on opposite sides of \\( PQ \\), it is the difference of their attractions which is equal to the sum of the attractions of \\( CM \\) and \\( CN \\); and it is the difference of the perpendiculars let fall from \\( T \\) and \\( R \\) on opposite sides of the plane, which is equal to the sum of the perpendiculars let fall from \\( M \\) and \\( N \\).\n20. Let \\( APBQ \\) be a spheroid of revolution, \\( PQ \\) the axis of revolution, and \\( ACB \\) a plane through the centre perpendicular to \\( PQ \\) (Plate XXXI, fig. 12.). If \\( D \\) be a particle in the surface of the spheroid, and \\( DL \\) perpendicular to the plane \\( ACB \\); then the attraction of the spheroid on a particle placed at the pole \\( P \\), will be to the force with which a particle placed at \\( C \\), is attracted in the direction \\( DL \\), as \\( PC \\) is to \\( DL \\).\n\nThrough \\( D \\) draw a plane parallel to the plane \\( ACB \\), and let the plane so drawn cut the axis \\( PQ \\) in \\( F \\): draw the straight line \\( DFE \\) to terminate in the spheroid, and describe another spheroid through \\( F \\), having the same centre with the spheroid \\( APBQ \\), and similar to it, and similarly situated. Conceive an indefinitely great number of planes, making indefinitely small angles with one another, to be drawn through \\( DE \\), so as to divide the two spheroids into an indefinitely great number of thin solids, or slices; then the sections which every one of the planes makes with the spheroids will be similar ellipses, having the same centre (\\( s_1 \\)); and it is manifest that a straight line drawn through \\( F \\) at right angles to \\( DE \\), in any one of the planes, will pass through the centre of the two ellipses contained in it, and will coincide with an axis of each. Therefore, the force with which every one of the slices, or elements, of the spheroid \\( APBQ \\) attracts a particle placed at \\( D \\) in the direction \\( DL \\), is equal to the force with which the corresponding slice, or element, of the spheroid \\( GFHK \\), attracts a particle placed at \\( F \\) in the direction \\( FC \\) (19.). Therefore, the whole attraction of the spheroid \\( APBQ \\) upon a particle at \\( D \\), in the direction \\( DL \\), is equal to the whole attraction of the spheroid \\( GFHK \\), upon a particle at \\( F \\). But the attractions of the spheroids \\( APBQ \\) and \\( GFHK \\), upon particles placed at \\( P \\) and \\( F \\), are to one another as \\( PC \\) to \\( FC \\) (8.). Therefore, the attraction of the spheroid \\( APBQ \\) upon a particle at \\( P \\), is to the force with which the same spheroid attracts a particle at \\( D \\), in the direction \\( DL \\), as \\( PC \\) is to \\( FC \\) or \\( DL \\).\n\n21. Let \\( APBQ \\) be a spheroid of revolution, and \\( PQ \\) the axis of revolution, as before. If \\( D \\) be a particle in the surface, \\( ADPB \\) (fig. 13.) a section through \\( D \\), and the axis \\( PQ \\), and \\( DL \\) perpendicular to \\( PQ \\); the attraction of the spheroid upon a particle at \\( A \\), will be to the force with which a particle at \\( D \\) is attracted, in the direction \\( DL \\), as \\( AC \\) is to \\( DL \\).\n\nThrough \\( D \\) draw a plane perpendicular to \\( AB \\), which cuts the section \\( ADB \\) in the straight line \\( DFE \\); and let a spheroid \\( FGHK \\) be described through \\( F \\), having the same centre with the spheroid \\( APBQ \\), and similar to it, and similarly situated. Then, conceiving the two spheroids to be divided into an indefinitely great number of thin slices by planes passing through \\( DE \\), the force with which every slice, or element, of the spheroid \\( APBQ \\) attracts a particle at \\( D \\) in the direction \\( DL \\), will be equal to the force with which the corresponding slice, or element, of the spheroid \\( FGHK \\) attracts a particle at \\( F \\) (19.). But the attractions of the spheroids \\( APBQ \\) and \\( FGHK \\) upon particles placed at \\( A \\) and \\( F \\), are to one another as \\( AC \\) to \\( CF \\) (8.). Therefore, the attraction of the spheroid \\( APBQ \\) upon a particle at \\( A \\), is to the force with which the same spheroid attracts a particle at \\( D \\), in the direction \\( DL \\), as \\( AC \\) to \\( FL \\) or \\( DL \\).\n\nThe two last propositions will enable us to find both the direction and the intensity of the attraction of a homogeneous spheroid of revolution upon a particle placed anywhere on the surface, when we have ascertained the attractive forces at the poles, and at the circumference of the circular section made by a plane through the centre perpendicular to the axis. For the whole attraction at any point, is the compound force arising from the attractions perpendicular to the axis, and parallel to it. The next object of our research is, therefore, to determine the two forces above-mentioned, viz. the attraction at the poles, and at the circular section, equally distant from both poles.\n\n22. Let \\( ADB \\) be an indefinitely slender pyramid, of which the base \\( BD \\) is perpendicular to the edge \\( AD \\) (fig. 14.): let \\( B = \\text{base } BD \\), and \\( f = \\text{length } AD \\); then \\( \\frac{B}{f} \\) is the attraction of the whole matter of the pyramid upon a particle placed at the vertex \\( A \\).\n\nLet \\( AM = x \\); then the section \\( MN \\) parallel to the base \\( BD = \\frac{Bx^2}{f^2} \\); and, \\( MP = \\text{element of the prism} = \\frac{Bx^2dx}{f^2} \\); and the attraction of the element upon a particle placed at \\( A = \\frac{MP}{AM^2} = \\frac{Bdx}{f^2} \\); the fluent of which is \\( \\frac{Bx}{f^2} = \\text{attraction of the pyramid } AM \\) upon a particle at \\( A \\). And, when \\( x = f \\), this becomes \\( \\frac{B}{f} = \\text{attraction of the pyramid } AD \\) upon a particle placed at \\( A \\).\n\n23. To investigate the attraction of a homogeneous spheroid of revolution, upon a particle placed at the pole.\n\nLet \\( P \\) (fig. 15.) be the pole, \\( PCQ \\) the axis of revolution, and \\( APBQ \\) a section of the spheroid by a plane passing through \\( PQ \\), and any point \\( M \\), in the surface; draw \\( PM, PM' \\) indefinitely near \\( PM \\), and \\( MM' \\) perpendicular to \\( PM \\). Conceive the plane \\( PMQ \\) to revolve about \\( PQ \\), so as to describe the indefinitely small angle \\( BCO \\); then the small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a> \\( MMP' \\) will describe a slender pyramid, having its vertex at \\( P \\), and of which the base is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECTANGLE\">rectangle</a>, contained by \\( MM' \\) and \\( RT \\); for the point \\( M \\) moving parallel to \\( R \\), it will describe a line equal and parallel to that described by \\( R \\), namely, to \\( RT \\).\n\nLet \\( PM = f \\); and the angle \\( KPM \\), which \\( PM \\) makes with a perpendicular to the axis, \\( = \\phi \\); and the indefinitely small angle \\( BCO = d\\phi \\). Then \\( MM' = f d\\phi \\); \\( RT = CR \\times d\\phi = f \\cos \\phi \\times d\\phi \\); and \\( B \\), the base of the slender pyramid described by the triangle \\( MMP' \\), \\( = d\\phi \\times d\\phi \\cos \\phi \\times f^2 \\); wherefore, the direct attraction of the pyramid on a particle at \\( P = \\frac{B}{f} \\) (22)=\nAttraction. \\( d\\varphi \\cdot d\\theta \\cos \\varphi \\cdot f \\); and the elementary attraction of the spheroid in the direction PC = direct attraction of the pyramid \\( \\times \\frac{PS}{PM} = d\\varphi \\cdot d\\theta \\cos \\varphi \\cdot f \\).\n\nAgain, let MR = x, CR = y, PC = k, AC = k'; then \\( y = f \\cos \\varphi; x = k - f \\sin \\varphi \\); if we substitute these values in the equation of the solid (1), we get\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(k - f \\sin \\varphi)^2}{k^2} + \\frac{f^2 \\cos^2 \\varphi}{k^2} = 1; \\quad \\text{whence}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{2k^2}{k^2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sin \\varphi}{\\cos^2 \\varphi + \\frac{k^2}{k^2} \\sin^2 \\varphi}.\n\\]\n\nBy substituting the value of \\( f \\) just found in the preceding expression of the elementary attraction of spheroid, it will become\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2k^2}{k^2} \\cdot \\frac{d\\varphi \\cdot d\\theta \\cdot \\sin \\varphi}{\\cos^2 \\varphi + \\frac{k^2}{k^2} \\sin^2 \\varphi};\n\\]\n\nwhich must be integrated from \\( \\varphi = 0 \\) to \\( \\varphi = 2\\pi \\);\n\nand from \\( \\theta = 0 \\) to \\( \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\); \\( \\sigma \\) denoting always the half-circumference when radius is unit.\n\nIn an oblate spheroid \\( k \\) is less than \\( k' \\); put \\( k'^2 - k^2 = k^2 e^2 \\), and \\( z = \\sin \\varphi \\); then the element of the attractive force will become, by substitution,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2k^2}{k^2} \\cdot \\frac{dz}{1 + e^2 z^2} = \\frac{2k^2}{k^2} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{edz}{1 + e^2 z^2} \\right);\n\\]\n\nand by integrating from \\( z = 0 \\) to \\( z = 1 \\), we get,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2k^2}{k^2} \\cdot \\left\\{ e - \\text{arc. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TAN\">tan</a>. } e \\right\\};\n\\]\n\nfor the force with which the matter between the planes PBQ and POQ urges the particle P to the centre.

To investigate the attraction of a homogeneous spheroid of revolution, on a particle placed in the circumference of the circular section, made by a plane through the centre, at right angles, to the axis of revolution.\n\nLet P (Plate XXXI. fig. 16.) be the pole, PC the axis of revolution. A, a point in the circular section AOB, made by a plane through the centre perpendicular to PC. Let M be any point in the surface of the spheroid; AMO a section through A and M by a plane perpendicular to AOB; AM a line in that plane indefinitely near AM, and MM perpendicular to AM; MR perpendicular to AO, and RS to AB. Conceive the plane AMO to revolve about A, so as to describe an indefinitely small angle OAM; then the triangle AMR will describe a slender pyramid, having its vertex at A, and of which the base is equal to a rectangle contained by MM and RT; for the point M moving parallel to the point R, it will describe a line equal to that described by R, namely to RT.\n\nLet AM = \\( f \\); the angle MAR = \\( \\varphi \\); and the angle OAQ = \\( d\\varphi \\); then MM = \\( f d\\varphi \\); and TR = AR \\( \\times \\) \\( d\\varphi \\) \\( = f \\cos \\varphi \\cdot d\\varphi \\). Wherefore, B = base of the pyramid described by MM = \\( d\\varphi \\cdot d\\theta \\cos \\varphi \\cdot f^2 \\); and the direct attraction of the pyramid in the direction AM = \\( \\frac{B}{f} \\)\n\n\\( = d\\varphi \\cdot d\\theta \\cos \\varphi \\cdot f \\).

An oblate spheroid of revolution being given, it is required to find the measures of the attractive forces that urge a particle placed anywhere in the surface, in a direction perpendicular to the axis, and in a direction parallel to it.\n\nLet $k$ and $k'$ be the semiaxes of the ellipse by the revolution of which the spheroid is described, $k$ being the axis about which it revolves; and let $b$ be the perpendicular distance of the particle from the axis, and $a$ its distance from the plane, drawn through the centre at right angles to the axis: Then, from which was proved in (20,) and (21,), the attractions sought will be found by multiplying the attractions at the pole, and at the circular section equally distant from both poles, by $\\frac{a}{k}$ and $\\frac{b}{k'}$.\n\nThus we get the attraction in the direction of $a$, equal to\n\n$$a \\times \\frac{3M}{k e^2} \\left\\{ e - \\text{arc.tan.e} \\right\\};$$\n\nand the attraction in the direction of $b$, equal to\n\n$$b \\times \\frac{3M}{2k^2 e^2} \\left\\{ \\text{arc.tan.e} - \\frac{e}{1 + e^2} \\right\\}.$$ \n\nThe same formul\u00e6 likewise serve for finding the attractions upon a particle placed anywhere within the spheroid. For the attraction upon a particle within the spheroid is equal to the attraction of a similar concentric spheroid, which contains the particle in its surface (9.) and it is evident, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COEFFICIENTS\">coefficients</a>, which multiply $a$ and $b$ in the above expressions, depend only upon the proportion of $k$ and $k'$; and they are therefore the same for all similar spheroids.\n\nIf we denote by $A$ and $B$ the coefficients of $a$ and $b$ in the expressions of the attractive force found above, the whole attraction of the spheroid, which is compounded of the forces $a \\cdot A$ and $b \\cdot B$, will be $\\sqrt{a^2 A^2 + b^2 B^2}$. And if $\\psi$ denote the angle which the direction of this force makes with $a$, or with the axis of the spheroid; then tan. $\\psi = \\frac{b.B}{a.A}$.\nAttraction.\n\nCor. In the very same manner we may determine the attractions of an oblong spheroid of revolution, upon a point in the surface, or within the solid.\n\n26.

But the two spheroids may be divided into an equal number of such portions; therefore the spheroids attract particles placed at G and g, in the directions GH and gh, with forces proportional to $k'k''$ and $k''k'$, or to the sections AMDE and amde.\n\nCor. 1. This proposition is true when the law of attraction is expressed by any function of the distance. The demonstration is the same as in the corollary of (13).\n\nCor. 2. If the two ellipsoids be so placed, that their centres, and the planes of their principal sections, shall coincide, the surface of the one will be entirely within the other. Also the point which one ellipsoid attracts, will be in the surface of the other, as is plain from the expressions of the coordinate. And hence, the attraction of one ellipsoid upon a point without the surface, is made to depend upon the attraction of another ellipsoid upon a point within the surface.\n\nCor. 3. When the ellipsoids become spheroids of revolution, the two principal sections through the axis of revolution become equal, and will be represented by any two sections whatever passing through the axis at right angles to one another. But, in this case, the attractions of the spheroids on the points may be reduced to two, one acting perpendicular to the axis, and one parallel to it: And it is plain, that these attractions will be to one another as the areas of the sections, perpendicular to their directions.\n\n27. To find the attraction of an oblate spheroid upon a particle placed without the surface.\n\nLet $k'$ be the radius of the equator, and $k$ the axis of revolution: and let $a$ be the perpendicular distance of the point without the spheroid from the plane of the equator, and $b$ its distance from the axis. In the first place, it is necessary to determine the semiaxis of another oblate spheroid that shall contain the given point in its surface, and such, that it shall have the same centre, and its equator in the same plane, as the given spheroid; and likewise, the difference of the squares of its semiaxes equal to the difference of the squares of the semiaxes of the given spheroid. Let $k'$ denote the radius of the equator, and $h$ the semiaxis of the required spheroid: then, because the attracted point is to be in the surface of the solid, we have\n\n$$\\frac{a^2}{k'^2} + \\frac{b^2}{k^2} = 1$$\n\nand, because\n\n$$k'^2 - k^2 = k'^2 - k^2 = v^2$$\n\nwe get\n\n$$\\frac{a^2}{k'^2} + \\frac{b^2}{k^2} = 1$$\n\nWhence,\n\n$$2k^2 = a^2 + b^2 - v^2 + \\sqrt{(a^2 + b^2 - v^2)^2 + 4a^2v^2}$$\n\nand when $h$ is determined, then $k' = \\sqrt{k'^2 + v^2}$.\n\nIn consequence of the equation $\\frac{a^2}{k'^2} + \\frac{b^2}{k^2} = 1$, we may suppose, $a = k \\sin m$, and $b = k' \\cos m$; let $a' = k \\sin m$, and $b' = k' \\cos m$; or $a' = \\frac{k}{h} a$, and $b' = \\frac{k'}{k} \\times b$: then the point determined by the coordinates $a'$ and $b'$ will be in the surface of the given spheroid, and, consequently, it will be within the surface of the other spheroid. Let $M'$ denote the mass of the spheroid of which the axis is $h$; and let\n\n$$e'^2 = \\frac{k'^2 - k^2}{k^2} = \\frac{k'^2 - k^2}{k^2}$$\n\nthen (25.) the attractions of this spheroid upon the point within its surface, determined by the coordinates $a$ and $b$, are these, viz.\n\nThat perpendicular to the equator, equal to\n\n$$a' \\times \\frac{3M'}{k^2 e'^2} \\left\\{ e' - \\text{arc. tan. } e' \\right\\}$$\n\nand that perpendicular to the axis, equal to\n\n$$b' \\times \\frac{3M'}{2k^2 e'^2} \\left\\{ \\text{arc. tan. } e' - \\frac{e'}{1 + e'^2} \\right\\}$$\n\nBut (26. Cor. 3.) the attractions of the given spheroid, whose semiaxis are $k$ and $k'$ upon the point without its surface determined by the coordinates $a$ and $b$, will be found by multiplying the preceding expressions respectively by $\\frac{k'^2}{k^2}$ and $\\frac{k^2}{k'^2}$. Let $M$ be the mass of the given spheroid; then\n\n$$M = \\frac{k'^2 k}{M'}$$\n\nconsequently\n\n$$\\frac{k'^2}{k^2} = \\frac{M}{M'} \\cdot \\frac{h}{k} = \\frac{M}{M'} \\cdot \\frac{a}{a'}$$\n\nand $\\frac{k^2}{k'^2} = \\frac{M}{M'} \\cdot \\frac{h}{k} = \\frac{M}{M'} \\cdot \\frac{b}{b'}$: Wherefore, the attractions of the given oblate spheroid upon a point, without the surface determined by the coordinates $a$ and $b$, are as follows, viz.\n\nThe attraction perpendicular to the equator, equal to\n\n$$a \\times \\frac{3M}{k^2 e'^2} \\left\\{ e' - \\text{arc. tan. } e' \\right\\}$$\n\nand that perpendicular to the axis, equal to\n\n$$b \\times \\frac{3M}{2k^2 e'^2} \\left\\{ \\text{arc. tan. } e' - \\frac{e'}{1 + e'^2} \\right\\}$$\n\nCor. In the very same manner we may determine the attractions of an oblong spheroid of revolution upon a point without the surface.\n\nAttractions of Ellipsoids.\n\n28. Let AMBN be one of the principal sections of an ellipsoid, C the centre, AB and MN the axes, D a point in the periphery of the section, and DO perpendicular to MN (Plate XXXI., fig. 18.); the attraction of the ellipsoid upon a particle placed at the pole A, is to the force with which a particle placed at D is attracted in the direction DO, as AC to DO.\nAttraction. Draw DFG perpendicular to AB, and through F describe an ellipsoid similar to the given ellipsoid, and similarly situated, and having the same centre. Conceive an indefinitely great number of planes making indefinitely small angles with one another, to be drawn through DG, so as to divide the two ellipsoids into an indefinitely great number of thin solids or slices; Then, the sections of the ellipsoids made by every one of the planes will be similar and concentric ellipses, each of them having an axis perpendicular to DG (5.). Wherefore the attractions of the elements of the ellipsoid FHKL upon a particle at F, are respectively equal to the attractions of the elements of the ellipsoid AMBN, upon a particle at D in the direction DO (19.). Therefore, the whole attraction of the ellipsoid FHKL upon a particle at F, is equal to the attraction of the ellipsoid AMBN upon a particle at D, in the direction DO. But the attractions of the ellipsoids AMBN, and FHKL upon particles at A and F, are to one another as AC to CF (8.). Therefore, the attraction of the ellipsoid AMBN upon a particle at the pole A, is to the force with which it attracts a particle at D in the direction DO, as AC to DO.\n\n29. The attractions of ellipsoids upon particles placed in the surface, urging them in directions perpendicular to any of the principal sections, are proportional to the distances of the particles from that section.\n\nLet AMBN be one of the principal sections of an ellipsoid, C the centre, AB and MN the axes of the section, and P a point in the surface of the solid; the attraction of the ellipsoid upon a particle at the pole A (Plate XXXI. fig. 19.), is to the force with which a particle at P is attracted in a direction parallel to AB, as the semiaxis AC is to the distance of P from the principal section perpendicular to AC.\n\nDraw PDQ perpendicular to the section AMBN, and let it meet the surface again in Q; through D describe an ellipsoid similar to AMBN, similarly situated, and having the same centre; and through P draw a section SPRQ perpendicular to AB. As before, divide the solids into an indefinitely great number of thin slices by planes drawn through PQ; the sections made by every one of those planes will be similar, and concentric ellipses having an axis of each perpendicular to PQ (5.). Wherefore, the attractions of the elements of the ellipsoid AMBN, upon a particle at P, in a direction perpendicular to the plane PRQS, are respectively equal to the attractions of the elements of the ellipsoid FHKL, upon a particle at D, in a direction perpendicular to the same plane (19.). Therefore, the attraction of the ellipsoid AMBN, upon a particle at P, in a direction parallel to the axis AB, is equal to the attraction of the ellipsoid FHKL, upon a particle at D in the same direction. But the ellipsoids AMBN and FHKL being similar, their attractions upon particles at A and F, are to one another as AC to CF (8.) ; and the attraction of the ellipsoid FHKL, upon a particle at the pole F, is to its attraction upon a particle at D, in a direction parallel to AC, as FC to CN (28.). Therefore (ex aequali), the attraction of the ellipsoid AMBN, upon a particle at the pole A, is to the force with which it attracts a particle at P, in the direction AC, as AC to CN.\n\nThis proposition will enable us to find the attractions of an ellipsoid on all points on the surface, or Attraction within the solid, when the attractions at the poles are determined.\n\n30.

Let \\( p = a \\sin^2 \\theta + b \\cos^2 \\theta \\); and \\( q = a \\sin^2 \\phi + c \\cos^2 \\phi \\); then the above expression will become\n\n\\[ \\int \\int \\frac{d \\phi \\cdot d \\theta \\cos \\theta \\sin^2 \\phi}{p \\sin^2 \\phi + q \\cos^2 \\phi}. \\]\n\nSuppose \\( \\sqrt{\\frac{p}{q}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sin \\phi}{\\cos \\phi} = \\frac{\\sin u}{\\cos u} \\); then the preceding expression will become, by substitution,\n\n\\[ \\int \\int \\frac{du \\cdot d \\theta \\cos \\theta \\sin^2 \\phi}{\\sqrt{p \\cdot q}}; \\]\n\nthe limits of \\( u \\) being from 0 to \\( 2\\pi \\); therefore, by integrating with regard to \\( u \\), and restoring the values of \\( p \\) and \\( q \\), the integral becomes\n\n\\[ 2 \\pi \\int \\frac{d \\theta \\cdot \\cos \\theta \\sin^2 \\phi}{(a \\sin^2 \\theta + b \\cos^2 \\theta)(a \\sin^2 \\phi + c \\cos^2 \\phi)} \\]\n\nand, by putting \\( x = \\sin \\theta \\), the integral, which is to be taken from \\( \\theta = 0 \\) to \\( \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\), or from \\( x = 0 \\) to \\( x = 1 \\), will become\n\n\\[ 2 \\pi \\int \\frac{x^2 dx}{\\sqrt{b + (a - b)x^2} \\cdot \\sqrt{c + (a - c)x^2}}. \\]\n\nIf now we take \\( a, b, c \\) so as to make the assumed expression coincide with the quantities \\( A, A', A'' \\), respectively, we shall get\n\n\\[ A = 4\\pi k \\int \\frac{x^2 dx}{\\sqrt{m + (1-m)x^2} \\cdot \\sqrt{n + (1-n)x^2}} \\]\n\n\\[ A' = 4\\pi k' \\int \\frac{m \\cdot x^2 dx}{\\sqrt{1 + (m-1)x^2} \\cdot \\sqrt{n + (m-n)x^2}} \\]\n\n\\[ A'' = 4\\pi k'' \\int \\frac{n \\cdot x^2 dx}{\\sqrt{1 + (n-1)x^2} \\cdot \\sqrt{m + (n-m)x^2}}. \\]\n\nThese expressions have the inconvenience of containing different factors in the denominators; but they may be reduced to others having the same factors, by putting \\( x = \\frac{r}{\\sqrt{m + (1-m)x^2}} \\) in the second, and \\( x = \\frac{r}{\\sqrt{n + (1-n)x^2}} \\) in the third; we thus get\n\n\\[ A = 4\\pi k \\int \\frac{x^2 dx}{\\sqrt{m + (1-m)x^2} \\cdot \\sqrt{n + (1-n)x^2}} \\]\n\n\\[ A' = 4\\pi k' \\int \\frac{m \\cdot x^2 dx}{\\sqrt{1 + (m-1)x^2} \\cdot \\sqrt{n + (m-n)x^2}} \\]\n\n\\[ A'' = 4\\pi k'' \\int \\frac{n \\cdot x^2 dx}{\\sqrt{1 + (n-1)x^2} \\cdot \\sqrt{m + (n-m)x^2}}. \\]\n\nNow let\n\n\\[ \\frac{1-m}{m} = \\frac{k^2 - k'^2}{k^2} = \\lambda^2; \\text{ and } \\frac{1-n}{n} = \\frac{k'^2 - k''^2}{k'^2} = \\lambda'^2. \\]\n\nAlso let the mass of the ellipsoid be \\( M = \\frac{4\\pi k' k''}{3 \\sqrt{mn}} \\); then \\( \\frac{3M}{k^3} = \\frac{4\\pi}{\\sqrt{mn}} \\): wherefore, by substitution, we get\n\n\\[ A = k \\cdot \\frac{3M}{k^3} \\int \\frac{x^2 dx}{\\sqrt{(1 + \\lambda^2 x^2) \\cdot (1 + \\lambda'^2 x^2)}} \\]\n\n\\[ A' = k' \\cdot \\frac{3M}{k'^3} \\int \\frac{x^2 dx}{\\sqrt{1 + \\lambda^2 x^2} \\cdot \\sqrt{1 + \\lambda'^2 x^2}} \\]\n\n\\[ A'' = k'' \\cdot \\frac{3M}{k''^3} \\int \\frac{x^2 dx}{\\sqrt{1 + \\lambda^2 x^2} \\cdot \\sqrt{1 + \\lambda'^2 x^2}}. \\]\n\nThe integrations extending from \\( x = 0 \\) to \\( x = 1 \\).\n\nThese integrals cannot be expressed in finite terms.

To find the forces with which a homogeneous ellipsoid attracts a particle placed in the surface, or within the solid, in directions perpendicular to the principal sections.\n\nLet \\( k, k', k'' \\), denote the semiaxes of an ellipsoid,\nAttraction, and \\(a, b, c\\) (respectively parallel to \\(k, k', k''\\)), the perpendicular distances of a particle placed in the surface, or within the solid, from the principal sections; then, from what is proved in (29.), the attractions we are seeking will be found by multiplying the polar attractions by \\(\\frac{a}{k}, \\frac{b}{k'}, \\frac{c}{k''}\\). Therefore the forces that urge the particle in the directions of \\(a, b,\\) and \\(c\\), are respectively,\n\n\\[a \\times \\frac{3M}{k^3} \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(1 + \\lambda^2)(1 + \\lambda'^2)}} + \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\left( \\frac{dF}{d\\lambda} \\right) + \\frac{1}{\\lambda'} \\left( \\frac{dF}{d\\lambda'} \\right) \\right\\};\\]\n\n\\[b \\times \\frac{3M}{k'^3} \\times \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\left( \\frac{dF}{d\\lambda} \\right);\\]\n\n\\[c \\times \\frac{3M}{k''^3} \\times \\frac{1}{\\lambda'} \\left( \\frac{dF}{d\\lambda'} \\right);\\]\n\nWhich formulas serve both for points in the surface, and within the solid, for the reason already explained in (25.).\n\n33. To find the attractions of an ellipsoid upon a particle placed without the surface.\n\nLet \\(k, k', k''\\) be the semiaxis of the ellipsoid, and \\(a, b, c\\) (respectively parallel to \\(k, k', k''\\)), the coordinates of a particle without the surface. Let \\(h, h', h''\\), so related to \\(k, k', k''\\), that \\(h^2 = k^2 - k'^2\\) and \\(h'^2 = k'^2 - k''^2\\), denote the semiaxis of another ellipsoid, which contains the attracted point in its surface, and has its principal sections in the same planes as the given ellipsoid; then, because the attracted point is in the surface, we have\n\n\\[\\frac{a^2}{h^2} + \\frac{b^2}{h'^2} + \\frac{c^2}{h''^2} = 1;\\]\n\nAnd, because \\(h'^2 = k'^2 - k''^2 = s^2\\), and \\(h''^2 = k''^2 - k'^2 = t^2\\), we get\n\n\\[\\frac{a^2}{h^2} + \\frac{b^2}{s^2} + \\frac{c^2}{t^2} = 1.\\]\n\nThis equation now contains only one unknown quantity; and it is plain, that one value of \\(h\\), and only one, can be found from it. For, when \\(h = 0\\), the function on the left hand side is infinitely great; And while \\(h\\) increases from 0 ad infinitum, the same function decreases continually from being infinitely great, to be infinitely little. When \\(h\\) is found, then \\(h' = \\sqrt{h^2 + s^2}\\), and \\(h'' = \\sqrt{h^2 + t^2}\\). Because \\(a, b, c\\), are the coordinates of a point in the surface of the ellipsoid, we may suppose \\(a = h \\sin m, b = h' \\cos m \\sin n, c = h'' \\cos m \\cos n\\); let \\(a' = k \\sin m, b' = k' \\cos m \\sin n, c' = k'' \\cos m \\cos n\\); or \\(a' = \\frac{k}{h} \\times a\\),\n\n\\[b' = \\frac{k'}{h'} \\times b, c' = \\frac{k''}{h''} \\times c;\\] then \\(a', b', c'\\) will be the coordinates of a point in the surface of the given ellipsoid, and consequently, it will be within the other solid. Let \\(M'\\) denote the mass of the ellipsoid of which \\(h, h', h''\\) are the semiaxes; also let \\(\\lambda^2 = \\text{Attraction.}\\)\n\n\\[\\frac{h'^2}{h^2} = \\frac{k'^2 - k''^2}{k^2}; \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\lambda'^2 = \\frac{h''^2}{h'^2} = \\frac{k''^2 - k'^2}{k'^2};\\]\n\nthen, \\(F\\) denoting the same fluent as before, the attractions of this ellipsoid upon the point within it, determined by the coordinates \\(a', b', c'\\), in the directions of those coordinates, are (32.) respectively equal to\n\n\\[a' \\times \\frac{3M'}{h^3} \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(1 + \\lambda^2)(1 + \\lambda'^2)}} + \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\left( \\frac{dF}{d\\lambda} \\right) + \\frac{1}{\\lambda'} \\left( \\frac{dF}{d\\lambda'} \\right) \\right\\};\\]\n\n\\[b' \\times \\frac{3M'}{h'^3} \\times \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\left( \\frac{dF}{d\\lambda} \\right);\\]\n\n\\[c' \\times \\frac{3M'}{h''^3} \\times \\frac{1}{\\lambda'} \\left( \\frac{dF}{d\\lambda'} \\right).\\]\n\nNow, the attractions of the given ellipsoid upon the point without the surface, determined by the coordinates \\(a, b, c\\), will be found (26.) by multiplying the preceding expressions respectively by \\(\\frac{k}{h}, \\frac{k'}{h'}, \\frac{k''}{h''}, \\frac{k}{h'}\\). Let \\(M\\) be the mass of the given ellipsoid; then\n\n\\[\\frac{M}{M'} = \\frac{k}{h} \\frac{k'}{h'} \\frac{k''}{h''}; \\quad \\text{consequently} \\quad \\frac{k'}{h'} = \\frac{M}{M'} \\frac{h}{k} = \\frac{M}{M'} \\frac{a}{a'};\\]\n\n\\[\\frac{b}{b'} = \\frac{M}{M'} \\frac{b}{b'}; \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{k''}{h''} = \\frac{M}{M'} \\frac{c}{c'};\\]\n\nwherefore, the attractions of the given ellipsoid upon the point without the surface, determined by \\(a, b, c\\), in the directions of those coordinates, are respectively equal to\n\n\\[a \\times \\frac{3M}{k^3} \\times \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(1 + \\lambda^2)(1 + \\lambda'^2)}} + \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\left( \\frac{dF}{d\\lambda} \\right) + \\frac{1}{\\lambda'} \\left( \\frac{dF}{d\\lambda'} \\right) \\right\\};\\]\n\n\\[b \\times \\frac{3M}{k'^3} \\times \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\left( \\frac{dF}{d\\lambda} \\right);\\]\n\n\\[c \\times \\frac{3M}{k''^3} \\times \\frac{1}{\\lambda'} \\left( \\frac{dF}{d\\lambda'} \\right).\\]\n\nThe preceding propositions contain a complete theory of homogeneous elliptical spheroids. They enable us to compute the attractive force with which a solid of this kind urges a particle placed anywhere in the surface, or within the solid, or without it. It remains, indeed, to find the exact value of the function \\(F\\) in its general form, to which we can do no more than approximate by series; but this is an analytical difficulty, which it is impossible to overcome; because the nature of this function is such, that it cannot be expressed in finite terms by the received notation of analysis.\nIn the preceding investigations, we have followed the method of Maclaurin for points situated in the surface of a spheroid, or within the solid. This method has always been justly admired; but neither its inventor, nor, as far as we know, any other Geometer, has applied it, excepting to spheroids of revolution; and it is here, for the first time, extended to ellipsoids. In regard to points without the surface, we have employed the method first given by Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IVORY\">Ivory</a>, in the Philosophical Transactions for 1809. The combination of these two methods has enabled us to derive the attractions of an ellipsoid on a point placed anywhere, from the attractions at the poles. Thus, this extremely complicated problem has, by geometrical reasoning of no great difficulty, been reduced to the investigation of the polar attractions, which are the only cases that require a direct computation.\n\n**Attraction of Mountains.** See Mountains, Attraction of, in the Encyclopedia, and in this Supplement.\n\n**Atwood (George),** an Author celebrated for the accuracy of his mathematical and mechanical investigations, and considered as particularly happy in the clearness of his explanations, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEGANCE\">elegance</a> of his experimental illustrations, was born in the early part of the year 1746. He was educated at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WESTMINSTER\">Westminster</a> school, where he was admitted in 1759. Six years afterwards he was elected off to Trinity <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">College</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>. He took his degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1769, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of third wrangler, Dr Parkinson, of Christ's College, being senior of the year. This distinction was amply sufficient to give him a claim to further advancement in his own College, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of which he stood foremost of his contemporaries; and, in due time, he obtained a fellowship, and was afterwards one of the tutors of the College. He became <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">Master</a> of Arts in 1772; and, in 1776, was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>.\n\nThe higher branches of the Mathematics had, at this period, been making some important advances at Cambridge, under the auspices of Dr Waring, and many of the younger members of the University became diligent labourers in this extensive field. Mr Atwood chose, for his peculiar department, the illustration of mechanical and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIMENTAL_PHILOSOPHY\">experimental philosophy</a>, by elementary investigations and ocular demonstrations of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> truths. He delivered, for several successive years, a course of lectures in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATORY\">Observatory</a> of Trinity College, which were very generally attended, and greatly admired. In the year 1784, some circumstances occurred which made it desirable for him to discontinue his residence at Cambridge; and soon afterwards Mr Pitt, who had become acquainted with his merits by attending his lectures, bestowed on him a patent office, which required but little of his attendance, in order to have a claim on the employment of his mathematical abilities in a variety of financial calculations, to which he continued to devote a considerable portion of his time and attention throughout the remainder of his life.*\n\nThe following, we believe, is a correct list of Mr Atwood's publications:\n\n1. *A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">Description</a> of Experiments to illustrate a Course of Lectures.* 8vo.

Part II. By the author of the first part. 4to, Lond. 1804. Dated 24th Nov. 1803.\n\n11. A Treatise on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPTICS\">Optics</a> is mentioned by Nichols as having been partly printed by Bowyer in 1776, but never completed.\n\nIt may be very truly asserted, that several of these works of Mr Atwood have materially contributed to the progress of science, by multiplying the modes of illustration, which experimental exhibitions afford for the assistance of the instructor; at the same time, they can scarcely be said to have extended very considerably the bounds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> knowledge, or to demonstrate that their author was possessed of any extraordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a> or energy of mind in overcoming great difficulties, or in inventing new methods of reasoning. The Analysis of a Course of Lectures has been little read: and it bears evident marks of having been composed before Mr Atwood had acquired a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of accurate reasoning on Physical subjects. In the first page, for example, the forces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-COHESION\">cohesion</a> and gravitation are completely confounded; and in the third we find the idea of perfect spheres touching each other in a greater or less number of points, notwithstanding the appearance of precision which the author attempts to maintain in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>.\n\nThe object of the paper on Reflection is, to illustrate and improve the construction of Hadley's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRANT\">quadrant</a>; and Mr Atwood proposes, for some particular purposes in practical Astronomy, two new arrangements of the speculums, by which the rays are caused to move in different planes, and which he considers as affording greater accuracy for the measurement of small angles than the common form of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a>, although not of general utility, nor very easily adjusted for observation.\n\nThe treatise on Rectilinear motion and rotation exhibits a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPENDIUM\">compendium</a> of the elementary doctrines of mathematical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICS\">Mechanics</a>; but it shows a great deficiency in the knowledge of the higher refinements which had been introduced into that science by Daniel Bernoulli, and Euler, and Lagrange. The properties of simply accelerated and retarded motion are first discussed, and the phenomena of penetration experimentally examined; the laws of varying forces are then investigated, and the properties of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-PENDULUM\">pendulum</a> demonstrated; the vibrations of an elastic chord are calculated, \"considering the whole mass to be concentrated in the middle point,\" as an approximation; and then, instead of imitating and simplifying the elegant but complicated demonstrations of the continental mathematicians, the author most erroneously repeats, in the words of Dr Smith, the exploded doctrine, that \"the string, during any instant of its vibration, will coincide with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARMONIC\">harmonic</a> curve.\" The subject of a resistance, varying as the square of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a>, is next examined; and some useful experiments on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> of bodies in water are stated in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> of the theory. On this occasion, the author observes, with regard to the formation of the different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRATA\">strata</a> of the earth, that bodies disposed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> masses, though specifically lighter, may easily have descended more rapidly through a fluid, than denser but more brittle bodies, so that the natural order of densities may thus have become inverted. He next examines the theory of rotation, and relates some very interesting experiments on rectilinear and rotatory motions; and he shows that Emerson and Desaguliers were totally mistaken in asserting \"that the momentum produced is always equal to the momentum which produces it.\" The last section of the work, which is devoted to the subject of free rotation, is the most elaborate of the whole; but it exhibits no material extension of the earlier investigations of the Bernoullis and Professor Vince; nor does it contain the important proposition of Segner, relating to the existence of three axes of permanent rotation, at right angles to each other, in every body, however <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a>.\n\nNotwithstanding these partial objections, the work may still, in many respects, be considered as classical. The paper on Watch-balances is principally intended to show the advantages which may be obtained, in Mr Mudge's construction, from the effect of subsidiary springs in rendering the vibrations isochronous, their actions being limited to certain portions of the arc of motion. If the author has here again omitted to follow the Continental Mathematicians in some of their refinements of calculation, it must be confessed that his view of the subject has, in this instance, not only the advantage of simplicity, but also that of a nearer approach to the true practical state of the question, than is to be found in the more complicated determinations which had been the result of the labours of some of his predecessors.\n\nBut, whatever may be the merits of these investigations, they appear to be far exceeded in importance by the papers on Ships, the first of which obtained for its author the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of a Copleian Medal. Its principal object is to show how much the stability of a ship will commonly vary, when her situation, with respect to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZON\">horizon</a>, is materially altered; and how far the assumptions of theoretical writers, respecting many others of the forces concerned in Naval <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">Architecture</a>, will generally differ from the true state of these forces when they actually occur in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEAMANSHIP\">Seamanship</a>. In the second part of the investigation, some errors of Bouguer and of Clairbois are pointed out, and the theoretical principles of stability are exemplified by a detailed calculation, adapted to the form and dimensions of a particular vessel, built for the service of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EAST\">East</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">Company</a>.\n\nThe latter years of our author's life do not appear to have been productive of any material advantage to Science. His application to his accustomed pursuits was unremitting; but his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> was gradually declining. He had no amusement, except such as was afforded by the continued <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of his mind, with\na change of the object only; the laborious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAME\">game</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHESS\">chess</a> occupying, under the name of recreation, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a> which he could spare from more productive exertions. He became paralytic some time before his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>; and though he partially recovered his health, he did not live to complete his 62d year.\n\nHis researches concerning the history of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ASSIZE\">Assize</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">Bread</a> must have required the employment of considerable diligence, and some judgment, in the discovery and selection of materials; although certainly the subject was not chosen for the purpose of affording a display of talent. His opinion respecting the operation of the assize, as favourable to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a>, may by some be thought to be justified by the want of success which has hitherto attended the experiment on its suspension; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol1.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a> of that measure would certainly not admit the trial of a year to be sufficient for appreciating its utility.\n\nThe title-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PAGES\">pages</a> of the works on Arches explain the occasion on which they were brought forwards, and at the same time exhibit a specimen of the want of order and precision which seems to have begun to prevail in the author's faculties: and the works themselves betray a neglect of the fundamental principles of Mechanics, which is inconceivable in a person who had once reasoned with considerable accuracy on mathematical subjects. An anonymous Critic, who is supposed to have been the late Professor Robison (British Critic, Vol. XXI. Jan. 1804), very decidedly, and, at the same time, very respectfully asserted Mr Atwood's error in maintaining, that there was no manner of necessity for the condition, that the general curve of equilibrium of an arch should pass through some part of every one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a> by which it is divided; and in fact we may very easily be convinced of the truth of this principle, if we reflect that the curve of equilibrium is the true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REPRESENTATIVE\">representative</a> of the direction of all the forces acting upon each of the blocks; and that if the whole pressure be anywhere directed to a point situated beyond the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIMIT\">limit</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a>, there can be nothing whatever to prevent the rotation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLOCK\">block</a> on the end of the joint as a centre, until some new position of the block shall have altered the direction of the forces, or until the whole fabric be destroyed. The Critic has also very truly remarked, that the effects of friction have never been sufficiently considered in such arrangements: but a later Author has removed a considerable part of this difficulty in an anonymous publication, by showing, that no other condition is required for determining these effects, than that every joint should be perpendicular to the direction of the curve of equilibrium, either accurately, or within the limit of a certain angle, which is constant for every substance of the same kind, and which he has termed the angle of repose.\n\nIn the appointment which enabled Mr Atwood to devote a considerable part of his life to scientific researches, he appears to have had no successor. It was held, and perhaps wisely, that such sinecures have regularly become, in process of time, mere instruments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PARTY\">party</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>, instead of being bestowed as encouragements to merit; and it seems to be the invariable maxim of the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">Government</a>, that talents deserve no protection, unless they are immediately employed in the service of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">Church</a> or of the State; that ornamental accomplishments repay their possessor by the splendour which they confer on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> existence, but that, in a commercial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, the actual utility of mental as well as of corporal powers, must be measured by their effects; and that these effects must be of a negotiable kind, in order to have a claim to reward. Other Nations, and other Sovereigns, have often thought and acted differently; and they have, perhaps, obtained a forced growth of Science or of Literature, which has contributed, in some degree, to the embellishment of their age; but where the native forest tree acquires so often a form at once beautiful and magnificent, though exposed to all the storms of the seasons, there is little reason to lament the want of the shelter of the Plantation, or of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> warmth of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSERVATORY\">Conservatory</a>.","sp":891,"ep":940},{"h":"CANCERIDES","t":"a Shore Crabs.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENUS\">Genus</a> 1.

It appeared under the sanction of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERIAL\">Imperial</a> Academy, to which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> had been in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> communicated; and it is said <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> page to be Instar Supplementi Comment. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol2.html#article-ACAD\">Acad</a>. Petropolitanae. The work indeed merited this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a>, as being the first systematic and successful attempt to apply mathematical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> to the subjects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTRICITY\">electricity</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNETISM\">magnetism</a>. Already the theory of Franklin, with regard to the former, was very generally received, and was supposed to afford a satisfactory explanation of the phenomena. But though it seemed sufficient for this purpose in\nthe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> and somewhat loose manner in which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> had hitherto been treated, it was not certain that the same would hold when the conclusions were accurately and mathematically deduced. To apply this test was what \u00c6pinus undertook, and what he has executed in a manner very satisfactory and complete. He has treated very fully, and perhaps has nearly exhausted what may be called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATICS\">statics</a> of electricity and magnetism, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> the equilibrium of their forces. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a> yet remains, where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of the electric fluid is to be considered, and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a> over the surfaces of bodies of a given <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>; where greater difficulties are to be encountered, and where the latest improvements of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEGRAL\">integral</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CALCULUS\">calculus</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of La <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">Place</a> and Poisson have begun to be applied. The investigations of \u00c6pinus in their own department led to very satisfactory results, and the exact agreement between them and the phenomena actually exhibited was extensively observed. Notwithstanding this agreement, we cannot consider the theory of positive and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a> electricity as being yet sufficiently established. Though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ASSUMPTION\">assumption</a> on which it is founded appear very simple at first, it is found more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPLEX\">complex</a> on a nearer inspection. The assumption is, that a fluid resides in the surfaces of all the bodies termed electrics, which is highly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a>, and strongly attracted, at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, by the particles of the body, and that while this fluid remains equally diffused over the surface of the body, no phenomenon whatever gives any information of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a>. By certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> operations, however, the equilibrium of this fluid may be destroyed; the fluid may be accumulated at one end, or on one side of a body, and entirely withdrawn from the opposite. It is when an electric is brought into this state that it exhibits the phenomena of electricity, between which, and the calculus instituted on the suppositions <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>, \u00c6pinus has everywhere remarked the most exact agreement. One great difficulty, however, still remains. The negative ends of two electrified bodies repel one another, just as much as the ends which are reckoned positive. But such an effect cannot result from the mere absence of a substance; when the electric fluid is withdrawn, if <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REPULSION\">repulsion</a> still continue, it must arise from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the particles of the body itself. Thus it would appear, that, in the absence of the electric fluid, the tendency of the particles of matter is to repel one another. This is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> part of the theory; and it is not accurate to say, that the doctrine of Franklin or \u00c6pinus supposes no more than the existence of an elastic fluid diffused over the surfaces, and strongly attracted by the particles of bodies. It supposes, besides, that those particles, in the absence of this fluid, mutually repel one another. This not only takes away from the simplicity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>, but it is obviously a very unnatural, not to say a contradictory supposition; because, when the electric matter is removed, how comes it to pass that the particles of the body, notwithstanding their mutual repulsion, still cohere together as firmly as before? This difficulty is acknowledged by \u00c6pinus himself; but it would seem that the theory had taken a strong hold of his mind before he was aware of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> from it, so that he became by degrees reconciled to a supposition which appeared to him at first not a little incongruous. This must not surprise us: It is not always that, even among philosophers, we meet with the candour, or perhaps we should say the courage, with which Newton suspended his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> in his own great discovery, the principle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> gravity, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> as the erroneous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> then existing, about the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, made the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>'s motion in her orbit appear inconsistent with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> of falling bodies.\n\nAnother remark, made by \u00c6pinus himself, involves in it a difficulty which should have induced him to view his theory with considerable diffidence. Though he considers the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of the two electricities to be the same as between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a> and defect, or to consist in this, that the fluid which is deficient in the one part is in excess in the other, he admits that no phenomenon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> out on which side the excess, or on which the defect lies. This is a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDICATION\">indication</a> that the difference is not of the kind supposed. We are not left at a loss to tell whether <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> is the absence of a substance which we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CALL\">call</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, or heat the absence of a substance which we call cold. If there were just as much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> for asserting the one of these propositions as the other, one would certainly be inclined to reject both. The same should be done with respect to electricity and magnetism.\n\nThe investigations of \u00c6pinus, however, are by no means rendered useless, even if the theory of positive and negative electricity, or of positive and negative magnetism be exchanged for that of two elastic fluids, each attracting the other, and both attracted by the particles of bodies. Most of his investigations may be easily accommodated to this supposition; and, therefore, they are, fortunately for themselves and for their author, of a more permanent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> than the principles from which they were deduced.\n\nIt is to be added to this, that \u00c6pinus was the first who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> between electricity and magnetism, in its full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, and perceived the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> that these two mutually <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> on one another. He instituted a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of experiments on the nature of the Tourmaline, on which he wrote a small treatise, published in 1762. He is to be regarded also as the inventor of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONDENSER\">Condenser</a> of Electricity, and of the Electrophorus, of which he gave the complete theory.\n\nA very excellent view of the theory of \u00c6pinus was published at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> by M. Ha\u00fcy, in 1787, in 8vo. The same author has, however, adopted the theory of the two fluids in his own treatise, Le\u00e7ons de Physique. There is a remarkable coincidence between \u00c6pinus's work on electricity and magnetism, and that of Mr Cavendish, given in the Philosophical Transactions for 1771, p. 584. The principles from which they set out, and the conclusions at which they arrive, are in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> the same. It appears, however, quite certain, that Mr Cavendish knew nothing of the work of the Russian philosopher till his own was completed. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of proceeding is more geometrical, and in some parts he has gone farther.\n\nThe researches of \u00c6pinus were not confined to the subjects now mentioned, but extended to most of the branches of natural philosophy. Beside the treatise\non the Tourmaline, he published, in 1762, a work, in 4to, *On the distribution of heat at the surface of the earth*; a work which, though translated into French, has hardly, we believe, made its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> into this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, and of which we are therefore unable to speak from our own knowledge. He is also the author of many valuable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEMOIRS\">memoirs</a> on different subjects in pure mathematics, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPTICS\">optics</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METEOROLOGY\">meteorology</a>, contained in the 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and 12th volumes of the *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVI\">Novi</a> Commentarii Petropolitanae*, and in the volumes of the *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BERLIN\">Berlin</a> Memoirs*, for 1755, 1756. In a memoir contained in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> of these is the first account of his experiments on the Tourmaline, which were conducted with great accuracy and judgment, and do <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> to the author as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> and philosophical understanding, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> instructed in the true principles of inductive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>. Indeed, notwithstanding the objections we have made to his theories of electricity and magnetism, we must acknowledge that this is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> produced by the perusal of his works. He appears to have been well acquainted with practical astronomy, and sometimes to have had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of the Imperial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATORY\">Observatory</a>. He made improvements on the Micrometer and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol16.html#article-RETICULUM\">Reticulum</a>, and wrote a memoir on the effects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARALLAX\">parallax</a> in the transit of a planet over the sun; a difficult subject, and one rendered at that time (1764) peculiarly interesting, on account of the transit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-VENUS\">Venus</a> which was just past, and that which was soon expected. (*Novi Com. Pet.* Tom. X. p. 433.) In the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> he has a memoir on the subject of accidental colours, which at that time had hardly been treated of by any author but Buffon; and another on the affinity between electricity and magnetism. In the 12th volume he notices, we believe for the first time, the electric <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of the Brazilian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMERALD\">emerald</a>. He was not aware that this emerald is in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a> the green Tourmaline (*Brogniart*, Tom. I. p. 418.), a variety of that mineral on which he had already exercised his ingenuity with so much success.\n\nIt is rare, in an advanced state of science, to have the satisfaction of making a new discovery with regard to a subject quite elementary, and one that has been long a subject of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>. This, however, happened to \u00c6pinus with respect to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEVER\">Lever</a>, and to the simplest kind of lever\u2014that which has equal arms; of which he has demonstrated a new property in the 8th volume of the *Commentaries* above referred to. It is this:\u2014If a lever, with equal arms, be acted on at its opposite ends by forces, in a given <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a> to one another, and having their directions <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to straight lines given in position, and if these forces be resolved each into two, one at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> to the lever, and the other in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of it: in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of equilibrium, the sum of the two forces, having the same direction with the lever, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be the greatest possible. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEOREM\">theorem</a>, remarkable for its simplicity, and for illustrating the connection between the equilibrium of bodies, and certain problems concerning the maxima or minima of variable quantities, occurred when he was pursuing some of his inquiries concerning magnetism. He seems not to have been very fortunate, however, in his investigation, which is more complex than is necessary, as the proposition admits of a geometrical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a>, remarkable for its simplicity.\n\n(*l.*) AEROLITE, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> recently, but perhaps improperly, applied to those singular substances commonly called METEORIC <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">STONES</a>.

E, the handles, attached to the end of the beam by a bolt, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> which they move so as that they may be set at any required elevation, having an iron <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTOR\">sector</a> c to confine them, by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PIN\">pin</a> which fastens it to the end of the beam; and there are several different holes in the sector. F is a wheel or roller, to support the end A of the beam; it is fitted in iron pieces, descending from the frame G, which, at one end, is fastened to the beam AB, by a bolt passing through all the three pieces. The frame G has an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> d, fixed to it, which passes through the beam, and is pierced with holes to fix the beam at any required elevation. The two pieces G are so inclined, that they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be sufficiently distant from each other at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> end, to form the sides of the frame which admits the windlass or roller K to work between them. Upon this windlass, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a> L is wound, when the windlass is turned round by the wheel and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PINION\">pinion</a> Z, with two handles X, as shewn in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> piece is framed between the two pieces G, and into this the iron arch d, and the wheel irons F, are fixed in the front. There is also an iron bolt extended from one piece G to the other, so that a frame is formed for the roller. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> chain L is passed through a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLOCK\">block</a> or pulley M, which is hooked into the eye, at the end of the shank of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANCHOR\">anchor</a> N, and the other end of the chain being conducted back to the plough, is hooked to a piece of notched iron fixed in the beam, behind the stem D of the share; by this means this windlass has a double purchase to draw the plough forwards with the greater power.\n\nIn the use of this plough, the anchor is carried forwards, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of the chain L, and being held by one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, with its point on the ground, whilst another man turns the windlass, it draws itself into the ground, which the other aids by striking it with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BEETLE\">beetle</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALLET\">mallet</a>.\u2014Fig. 2 shows the form of the drain made by the pressure of the iron cone or mole, without throwing out any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, no other mark being left on the surface, than the small opening through which the coulter passed, which closes in a few days.\n\nFig. 3.

The horse is harnessed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEVER\">lever</a> X, and, as he walks round, turns the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol3.html#article-AXIS\">axis</a> Y, which communicates <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> to the capstan A by the cog-wheels R W. NN are two wheels for the support of the frame of the capstan, and a third wheel, P, is situated at the end of the pole O, being fixed in a piece of iron r, which can be raised or lowered through the pole to incline the axis of the capstan from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a>, that the chain of traction B may wind upon the capstan regularly from one end to the other. By these three wheels, the capstan is also adapted to uneven ground, raising or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOWERING\">lowering</a> the roller P, through the end of\nExplanation of the pole O. Z is an anchor connected with the pole O by a chain n, or by two chains, if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRAIN\">strain</a> renders them necessary, by which the capstan is prevented from being moved by the force of the draught.\n\nThe manner of removing the capstan and frame is this: Suppose the chain wound up upon the capstan, and the plough, as shown in the figure, drawn up as near the capstan as it can move, without interfering with the horse path,\u2014the horse is unhooked from the end of the lever X, and put to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol18.html#article-RING\">ring</a> in the shank of the anchor at m, by which he raises the anchor, and draws along the capstan upon its wheels NN, the chain or rope B unwinding from the capstan as it recedes from the plough. When all the chain is unwound in this manner, the horse is taken back to the lever X, which he begins to turn round, and thus winds up the draught chain B, during which the anchor and the stays ll are again fixed in the ground.\n\nFigs. 8, 9, are segments or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> of wood, which are employed to increase the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a> of the capstan; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> advantage of this machine over others of the same kind, being the variety of powers which it possesses.\n\nFig. 6 is a Plough for making open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DRAINS\">drains</a>. The share A has a coulter B fixed to it, projecting upwards, to cut one side of the drain; which, when finished, will be as represented in fig. 7; D is another coulter fixed to the beam, and also to the share at the lowest end. The sod which is thus cut out, passes between the coulter D, and the mould-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOARD\">board</a> E, which lifts it clearly out of the trench; E and F are wheels, which, being fixed to irons e, regulate the depth to which the drains shall be cut. The beam, handles, and other parts, are evident from the figure. This plough is drawn sometimes by four, and sometimes by six horses, and may form a drain from five to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> inches deep.\n\nPlate III.\n\nFig. 1.

Into each of these are placed two running sleeves, as 1, 2, in the limber C; 3, 4, in the limber D, &c. GH, a frame fixed on the axle A and arms B; PI, shifting blocks upon this frame. In each of these blocks are placed two sleeves, over which pass the endless rope or chain P, 5, R, which connect the shifting blocks (see DD and 13 fig. 3); KLMNO, the hooks to which the horses are yoked, these hooks being fastened on the ropes 1, 3, G, and H, 7, 9.

Each horse is yoked to two hooks as 1, 2\u20143, 4, &c. By this means the draught will always press the collars upon the horses' shoulders, whether they incline to pull outward or inward, so that if one of the horses relax, he is thus excited to exertion. The figures represent the machine as worked by four horses, but the same apparatus may be applied to one worked by two or by six horses.\n\nFig. 4 is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSPECTIVE\">perspective</a> view of a small Thrashing Small mill worked by one or two men.

H. Rose, Esq. of Muddeford, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAMPSHIRE\">Hampshire</a>. ABE, the wooden handle, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a> and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> diameter, held in the mower's right <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> by the part AB, which is about five inches long. The part BE is 16 to 22 inches long, according to the height of the mowers.\nAt \\( \\<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ALPHA\">alpha</a> \\) is a leathern loop, through which the fore finger is passed, and there is a knob at the extremity which would prevent the hand slipping off, if the loop should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> or the finger slip out of it. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLADE\">blade</a> \\( EF \\) is about two feet long and \\( 2\\frac{1}{2} \\) inches broad at the middle. The handle is attached to the blade at \\( E \\) in such a manner as that its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> makes an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> with the handle \\( BE \\), by which the mower is able to cut a little upwards, but almost close to the ground, without stooping, while the handle \\( EB \\), inclines to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZON\">horizon</a> about 60 or 70 degrees. The line of the handle \\( AB \\), if produced, will nearly pass through the point of the blade \\( F \\), and this gives the means of controlling the point, whilst the forefinger in the loop commands the heel \\( E \\).\u2014Fig. 7, GH, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAFF\">staff</a> terminating in an iron hook \\( I \\), is used at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> with the scythe. The mower holds it in his left hand by the middle, the curved part of the hook over the scythe in a similar position to its blade \\( E F \\), and above it, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> being exactly above each other. In working, the mower moves both together, making the hook to pass behind the straw at about the middle of its height, to separate and bear it slightly down towards the left hand, while the blade follows with a motion from right to left to cut off the straw at two to four inches above the ground.\n\nIn order further to explain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of Hainault mowing, fig. 8 represents the corner of a field of corn, in the process of mowing by three mowers at \\( D E F \\), who are following each other with their respective swathes. The breadths of corn cut at every stroke, are carried forward by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> operation of the blade and the hook, and collected at the left hand of the mower, where he leaves them standing almost erect, but leaning to the left against the standing corn as at \\( n \\). When as much is cut as will make a sheaf, the mower turns to the left so as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a> the standing corn at \\( n \\), introduces his hook behind the middle of the leaning parcels, and at the same time the scythe point near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a>, then moving sideways to the left, returning over the ground he has mown, he draws and collects the cut corn, still, by means of the hook and scythe, preserving the erect position of the straw, to the place where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> collecting operation ended; then wheeling round to the left with the hook still embracing the middle of the whole cut corn, he stops the motion of the scythe, whilst the hook still moves forward to the left, so as to overset the corn and lay it evenly along on the stubble, as shown at \\( r r r \\), with the ears towards the right, ready for the binder. In oversetting the collected corn he uses his left foot if necessary. The mower now advances to the front and commences the cuts for a new sheaf as before, always working towards the standing corn and not from it. With the Hainault scythe, about twice as much corn, it is said, may be cut in the same time, as with the common reaping-hook, and a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> more of the straw is saved.\n\n**Plate V.**\n\nFig. 1. A perspective view of Mr Plucknet's Reaping-machine. \\( AB \\), the great wheels, having the wheel \\( C \\) upon their axis, to turn a pinion, on the lower end of a verticle spindle, which carries a wheel \\( D \\); \\( c \\) a small pulley fixed at the upper end of the axis \\( E \\), of the circular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUTTER\">cutter</a> \\( G \\); \\( F \\) the iron plate for supporting the axis beneath which the cutter is situated; and it is turned over the edge of the wheel \\( A \\), to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> the standing corn from it; \\( H \\) the handles, \\( K \\) the horse shafts, placed on the left side of the cutter, and fixed to the frame of the machine by hinges, and having irons \\( b \\), with various pin-holes.\n\nFig. 2. is an elevation, and fig. 3. a plan of Sal-Salmon's mon's Reaping-machine. \\( AA \\), two large wheels, not fixed fast upon their axle, but having clicks fitted upon the naves, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a> of wheels, \\( a \\), (fig. 3,) fixed fast to the axis; \\( b \\) is a contrate wheel, which turns a pinion, \\( c \\), (fig. 2,) fixed on the lower end of the perpendicular axle, which, at the upper end, has the cog-wheel \\( D \\), for the purpose of turning another vertical axis, \\( d \\), by means of a pinion, \\( E \\). The latter axis has a fly-wheel, \\( F \\), fixed on the upper end, to regulate the motion, and at the lower end a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CRANK\">crank</a>, which, by means of the rod \\( f \\), gives motion to the shears by which the corn is cut. These are marked \\( G \\), being four in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>. The fixed blades are firmly attached to an iron <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a>, \\( e \\), which is fixed across the frame of the machine, and the moving blades have their centre-pins fixed in the same bar, but the levers or tails are jointed to one iron rod, \\( g \\), which is at one end connected with the rod, \\( f \\), of the crank; therefore, by its revolution, it moves the rod backwards and forwards, and causes all the shears to open and shut together. In order to make the shears cut perfectly, the rod \\( g \\) is suspended by a small iron rod at each end, one of which is seen at \\( h \\) in the elevation, fig. 2; these pass through mortises in the upper cross-rail of the frame, and have nuts upon them, by which they can be made to draw up the rod \\( g \\), and thus press the cutting parts of the blades together, to make them cut properly, although the rods \\( h \\) are at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> to vibrate sufficiently for the motion of the rod \\( g \\).\n\nThe tails of the shears are covered with a sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATFORM\">platform</a>, of iron plate, omitted in the plan, but shewn edgways by the dark line \\( H \\), in the elevation. This plate comes as far as the centre-pins, and turns up against the front of the frame, so as to prevent the corn which the shears cut from falling down into the shears, but the butts, or cut ends of the corn rest upon this plate until a sufficient parcel is collected, and it is then removed sidewise by the rake \\( K \\). This consists of a light frame of wood, composed of three upright bars and cross braces; it is guided by passing through between two rails, \\( k \\), supported by uprights, \\( r \\), fixed to the frame of the machine, but has liberty to rise and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a>, and also to move out of the perpendicular, by means of a light crank, \\( m \\), of considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RADIUS\">radius</a>, which is fixed upon the extremity of a spindle, \\( L \\), which receives motion by a small bevelled wheel, \\( l \\), upon the end of it, from another bevelled wheel, fixed upon the vertical axis. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of this motion is, that the points of the rake will, as in the figure, rest upon the iron plate \\( H \\), which covers the shears, and the motion of the crank advancing them across it, they remove the corn sidewise, laying it on the ground. The forward part of the machine is supported by the wheel \\( M \\), which is fitted in a fork at the lower end of an iron rod \\( N \\), and this passing through a mortise in the frame, has pin-\nholes to fix it at any required height. This regulates the height at which the shears cut. The wheel M is, in part, sunk into the thickness of the board O, and a piece of iron plate is fixed on the outside of it, to guard the corn from entanglement. The pointed edge of the board O, is made sharp, for the purpose of separating the corn which is intended to be cut, from that which is to be left standing. From this a curved rail, P, is extended, and also made sharp. From the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> end of the frame a light iron rod, Q, is extended, with a gradual curve, as the figures shew, and it is fixed at the opposite end to the other part of the frame. This rod acts as a stay, and also to gently <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BEND\">bend</a> down the heads of the corn, so that the straw may come to the shears in an inclined position, to be removed by the rake.\n\nThe machine is guided by a man, who holds the two handles S in the manner of a wheelbarrow, and he has, just before him, a wedge, R, which, being thrust inwards by his knee, will lift up the pinion e, (fig. 2,) upon its axle, and thus disengage it from the teeth of the great wheel b. In this state the machine can be wheeled without turning the machinery; but, on withdrawing the wedge, as in the figure, the pinion descends to its proper place, and the motion is communicated to the whole machine when it is wheeled along. As the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> was made from an experimental machine, to which the horse shafts were never applied, they are omitted in the figure, but their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> may be easily conceived.\n\nThe manner in which the machine operates is evident from the description. The stems of the corn are received in the open shears, being gathered in by pieces of iron plate, s, (fig. 3,) which are fixed upon the bar e, carrying the fixed blades, and, as these are pointed, they separate the corn, and conduct the whole into one or other of the shears; and it is cut when they close up. The fixed blades of the shears are made double, as shewn in the separate view, fig. 4; and the moving blades, having edges on both sides, cut either in opening or shutting; for, as the machine is constantly advancing, a space must always be left open for the reception of the corn, whilst the parcel already included within the shears is cutting off.\n\nOn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> of this machine, it was found that it did not effect a separation when the ears of the corn were entangled by wind, so that the cut corn frequently had an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-EAR\">ear</a> or two attached to that which remained standing, by which it was thrown into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a>. But this defect, it is hoped, may be obviated.\n\nPlate VI.\n\nFig. 1 represents a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROFILE\">profile</a> of Mr Smith's Reaping-machine, complete, and in operation, the near horse and carriage-wheel being however removed, that the view of the framing and gearing may not be obstructed. It will be seen by this figure and fig. 2 (which is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BIRD\">bird</a>-eye view of the machine), that the horses are yoked one on each side of a pole, which runs back from the frame of the carriage. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> who drives the horses and directs the machine walks behind, having command of the horses by a set of common plough reins, and directing the machine by a hold of the end of the pole. The horses draw from a cross bar at the end of the pole by common plough chains, the back-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of the carriage resting on their common cart-saddles, by means of an apparatus such as is used in curricles. On the fore part of the carriage is hung a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> circular cutter, surmounted by a drum, the blade of the cutter projecting 5\u00bd inches beyond the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIPHERY\">periphery</a> of the lower end of the drum. When the carriage is moving forward, a rapid rotatory motion is communicated to the cutter and drum, from the motion of the carriage wheels, by means of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of wheels, pinions, and shafts. The diameter of the cutter projects beyond the carriage-wheels on each side, so as to cut a breadth sufficient to allow the carriage and horses to pass along without risk of treading down the uncut corn. The corn being cut by the rapid motion of the cutter, the lower ends rest upon the blade of the cutter, and the upper parts coming in contact with the drum, the whole is carried round, and thrown off in a regular row at the side of the machine. The lower ends taking the ground first, the heads fall outwards, the stalks lying <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to each other, and at nearly a right angle to the line of motion of the machine. The corn lying thus in regular rows, is easily gathered into sheaves by the hand, or by a rake, fork, or other convenient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a>, and is bound in the usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">Minute</a> Description of the Plate.\n\nFigs. 1 and 2. A, the frame of the carriage, made of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OAK\">oak</a>, or other strong wood, and put firmly together, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a>-bolts screwed into the cross bars B, C, the pole, made fast to the cross bars. D, a cross bar, at the extremity of the pole, from which the horses pull; this bar is of iron, in order to give sufficient weight on the horses' backs. E, the carriage-wheels, 5 feet diameter, and 6 inches broad in the tread. F, the cutter, 5 feet 4 inches in diameter, composed of six segments bolted to an iron ring, 1\u00bd inch broad and \u00bd inch thick, which ring is connected to the foot of the upright spindle, Z, by the cross arms, G.\u2014Fig. 6 shews one of these segments on a larger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a>; a is of hard wood, 3\u00bd inches broad and 1 inch thick; b &c are of German <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a>, and of a scythe temper, 3\u00bd inches broad, and \u00bd inch thick at the back; they overlap the wood, to which they are rivetted, 1\u00bd inch, their upper side being flush with the wood; c, a small iron stop, to keep the segments from shifting at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a>; d, holes through which the ring-bolts pass. Fig. 5 is a transverse section of fig. 6.\u2014H, figs. 1 and 2, a conical drum of slight tin-plate or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BASKET\">basket</a>-work, whose lower periphery is 5 inches within the edge of the cutter, but whose upper periphery extends as far as that of the cutter. This drum is two feet deep, connected to the same ring with the cutter below, and to the spindle above, by another ring, with four arms. The drum is covered on the outside with canvas, on which perpendicular strips of soft rope are sewed, being one inch thick, and three or four inches apart, as shewn at I; these give sufficient friction to carry round the cut corn, whilst, from their softness, they have no tendency to shake or thrash it. The horses are yoked to the cross bar D by common plough\nExplanation chains; an upright rod J, and cross rod K, serve the purpose both of belly-band and back-band, the ends of the cross rod passing through iron eyes, screwed temporarily to the wooden ridge of common cart saddles, which are kept firm on the horse's back by a strong extra girth, L. The breeching-chains are linked to the draught chains. M, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a> chain passing through a ring made fast to the hames, and drawn up to an eye N, on the side of the pole. Fig. 4, is an inside view of the naves of the carriage wheels; a, a transverse section of the axle; b, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATCH\">ratch</a> wheel made fast on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> of the axle; c, catches, moveable on pivots made fast to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NAVE\">nave</a>; d, slight springs to keep the catches in gear. By this means the wheels carry the axle in revolution with them when the carriage is moved forward, but move round upon it when the carriage is drawn in a contrary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> is necessary, to facilitate the turning of the machine. The axle moves in two cast iron seats with caps, on which the frame of the carriage rests. A wheel O, (figs. 1 and 2,) of 24 teeth of 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inch pitch, works into an intermediate wheel of the same dimensions. This wheel is in gear of a pinion P of 12 teeth, fast on the end of the cross <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHAFT\">shaft</a>, Q. At the centre of this shaft, two bevelled wheels, R, with long sockets, are fitted loose. These wheels have each 28 teeth of 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inch pitch; in the bosom of these is a double reversing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CATCH\">catch</a>, which will be best explained by reference to fig. 3, which is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONGITUDINAL\">longitudinal</a> section of the cross shaft with the wheels and catch; a, the shaft; b, the pinion, P, of fig. 2.; c, the bevelled wheels, R, of fig. 2, having long sockets fitted loose on the shaft; d, a double catch, which is moveable longitudinally on the shaft, but is carried in revolution with it, by means of the feather e upon the shaft, fitted into a corresponding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROOVE\">groove</a> in the catch. This catch can be put into gear of either of the wheels at pleasure, by means of the lever, f, (figs. 1 and 2,) moveable on a stool at T, and kept to its place when set, by notches in an iron stand at U. Both of the wheels are constantly in gear of a pinion of 14 teeth, V, (figs. 1 and 2,) and f, (fig. 3.)\u2014By thus reversing the gearing, the cutter and drum can be made to revolve to the right or left, and consequently, will throw the cut corn to either side of the machine at pleasure. On the opposite end of the shaft, W, (figs. 1 and 2,), on which the pinion V is fixed, is a bevelled wheel X of 28 teeth, in gear of a pinion Y of 14 teeth on the upright spindle, Z. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a> is so raised by these wheels and pinions, that the cutter makes 128 revolutions per minute, when the machine moves at the rate of 2\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) miles per <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>, the edge of the cutter passing through 92 feet per second. The pinion Y has a long socket with a groove, to which is fitted a feather, one inch long, on the upright spindle Z, by which the spindle is moveable up and down in the socket, whilst it is carried in revolution with it. The spindle Z has three bearings, one in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a> bush, a, fixed in an iron stay-frame, b; a second <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> in a wooden bush with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAP\">cap</a> on the front of the cross bar at c; and a third in a socket resting on the small wheels, d. These wheels serve to keep the cutter always at an equal height from the ground. The particular construction of these wheels, with that of the frame and socket, will be better understood by reference to figs. 7 and 8. Fig. 8. a perpendicular section of the foot of the upright spindle and socket; a, the spindle, b, the socket; c, a groove in the spindle, into which the points of two screw pins, d, passing through the sides of the socket, are fitted. These are necessary to keep the spindle in its place, and to bear up the wheels when the spindle is raised. Fig. 7, is a bird-eye view of the wheels and carriage, with a transverse section of the socket and spindle; a, the wheels, 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches in diameter and 3 inches broad; b, the axle, to which is fastened an iron frame, c, moveable on a pivot at d, on the point of the iron bar, f, and in a socket at e: the bar f is one inch square, having a long ruff at g, which is turned and fitted to the eye e of the socket, fig. 8. The bar is bent so as to pass close under the cutter at e, (fig. 1,) and runs up to the pole, having a joint at f. This bar is necessary to relieve the point of the upright spindle of the resistance opposed to the wheels in moving along. The cutter can be placed higher or lower on the spindle, so as to cut the straw to any height, by means of a series of holes through the spindle; pins passing through holes in the sockets of the arms, and the most suitable of the series. The cutter can also be screwed to any height from the ground, from two to eighteen inches, by means of an iron lever, g, on the point of which is a brass socket, in which the upright spindle runs, and on which it rests by means of a ruff at h. The lever is hung by an iron chain, i, passing over a pulley at j, and joining two iron rods at k, which connect it with a screw box, l, which is moved backwards and forwards, by turning round the screw, m. To the end of this screw is connected an iron rod, which runs along the upper side of the pole to a bearing at n. At the end of this rod is a winch, o, of 9 inches radius, by which the person who guides the machine can turn round the screw, and so raise or lower the cutter at pleasure. This is principally of use to raise the cutter when passing over a deep furrow, or in going from one field to another: p, is a hollow piece of wood put upon the end of the rod, by which the man holds with one hand when guiding the machine. In most cases, the cutters will cut \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACRE\">acre</a> without requiring to be sharpened, which can be done in two minutes by a common scythe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, two of which are conveniently carried in two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a> pockets, q, fig. 2. When it is necessary to go with the machine to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a>, the upright spindle, with the drum and cutter, are taken from their place, and placed on the top of the carriage; and the small wheels are drawn close up to the cross bar. The draught bar, D, is taken from the end of the pole, and placed near the frame of the carriage in the mortice, r, fig. 1. The horses are turned to draw from it, and can in this way travel any distance, and over any roads.\n\nWe are happy to learn that this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> machine has been again tried (in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEPTEMBER\">September</a> 1815), and with much success. A Scotch acre (\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) acre English) of beans was cut down with ease in an hour and a quarter. The trials made with it on wheat, though not extensive, were satisfactory; and in reaping oats, the corn was laid down in the most regular manner, at a right angle to the path of the machine.","sp":422,"ep":427},{"h":"GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE AGRICULTURE OF BRITAIN","t":"The Husbandry of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, both in respect to the cultivation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> and the breeding and management of live stock, is confessedly superior to that of any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">General</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> and value of its products, considering the Observa- character of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as the industry, wealth, and respectability of its husbandmen, are without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a>, either in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> times. We find from Columella, that, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, the produce of the greater part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a> was less than four times the seed (lib. iii. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>. 3); and this notwithstanding an unproductive fallow every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> year, and apparently a much greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to minutiae, than would be compatible with the more extensive concerns of the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">Farmer</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> crops of Britain have been stated so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> times the seed; and certainly, wherever the management is tolerably correct, cannot be less than double the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> assigned by Columella to the richer soil and more genial climate of Italy. Of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a> of France before the Revolution, a very full and accurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> has been furnished by Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARTHUR\">Arthur</a> Young, from which it is sufficiently evident how much the general produce of that country, the best cultivated perhaps next to Britain, was inferior to that of even our middling lands; and the progress it has made since, has not, according to the latest and apparently exaggerated accounts, been marked by any very great improvement either in live stock or machinery, the two most distinguishing parts of British husbandry.\n\nIt is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> to ask\u2014to what causes this superiority is owing?\u2014And why it is confined to a part of our territory, instead of being extended, as our great demand of late for foreign corn would have led us to expect, to all soils that are capable of profitable improvement? <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">On</a> these two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> we now propose to offer a few very general remarks; and we shall submit them to the reader without affecting that precision of arrangement which more ample details would have required.\n\n1. The territory of Britain is not engrossed by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">Division</a> few individuals, as that of the northern countries of Europe, nor divided into such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> portions as that of some of the small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> of the Continent. The vast tracts of country held by a Russian or Polish nobleman, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIMINUTIVE\">diminutive</a> possessions of the Swiss, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">Large</a> and more lately of the French peasantry, are almost Estates; equally inconsistent with the more productive systems of rural economy. The former are too large for the superintendence of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a>, with a view to profitable cultivation; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> of such extensive properties implies the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEGRADATION\">degradation</a> and poverty of the great body of the people, and the absence of a middle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a>, possessed of disposable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a>, or at least of opportunities for its investment in the soil. Minute The latter, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, afford no room for the employment of capital, nor of those inventions by which the charges of cultivation are diminished, and its products augmented. Such small landed properties return little more than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol21.html#article-WAGES\">wages</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANUAL\">manual</a> labour by which they must necessarily be cultivated. Their small surplus produce, which every bad season annihilates, cannot afford subsistence to those other classes, whose labours are necessary to national prosperity and individual comfort; and a part of the families of the cultivators themselves, having neither\nfood nor employment at home, must either emigrate or perish. To a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> these consequences have been already experienced, both in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a> and the Highlands of Scotland; for it would be idle to maintain, that a minute division of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> in tenancy, does not produce all the unhappy effects which must result from the minute division of land in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>.\n\nOf two countries, in one of which estates are in general too large for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> superintendence of the proprietors, and, in the other, the land is parcelled out into shires, little more than sufficient for the subsistence of their owners, the condition of the great body of the people must be very much alike. In neither can there exist that middle class, from which all valuable improvements proceed, nor any of those inventions which multiply and augment the productive powers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> industry. Both of these states of property must appear decidedly hostile to national prosperity, when measured by this unerring test\u2014the quantity of the products of the soil which remains after defraying the charges of obtaining them; for upon this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">net</a> surplus depend all the enjoyments of mankind beyond the mere necessaries of life, as well as the means of repelling foreign aggression, and preserving internal tranquillity.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a> of the landed property of Britain is equally distant from both these extremes. Though it is necessary, perhaps, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of the country, that there should be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of large estates, yet their extent is seldom so great as to produce any of the bad effects <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> mentioned, even within the bounds of a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a>. Over the rural economy of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> these large properties exert scarcely any influence at all, excepting such of them as are held by entail, which is certainly a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TENURE\">tenure</a> greatly at variance with the full improvement of the soil. Many instances might be pointed out, of very extensive estates, fully as well cultivated, and yielding as large a surplus for the general consumption, as our agriculture, in its present state, obtains from any equal extent of similar land. It is true, that to increase the political influence of great proprietors, too many of these estates are possessed by tenants at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a>; but this grievance is not peculiar to estates of this class; the largest estates of Scotland being occupied on leases. This most serious obstacle to spirited cultivation, must therefore be ascribed to political causes, and not to the engrossing of landed property.\n\n2. Another arrangement, which may serve to account for the superiority of British agriculture, is somewhat akin to that division of labour, by which all the arts have been carried to so great a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a> in this country. Few great proprietors, comparatively, cultivate their own lands beyond the demands of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> and convenience. The far greater part of Britain is cultivated by professional men, with their own capital, and for their own profit. The price which they must pay for their temporary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> in the soil, in the shape of rent, instead of checking their exertions, has a powerful tendency to promote every profitable improvement, to discourage dangerous speculation, and to restrain wasteful expenditure. And as it is clearly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> of such General men, still more than of proprietors themselves, to obtain the largest produce at the least possible expense, the intermediate portion of the produce\u2014that which is disposable for the general consumption\u2014is consequently as large as industry and economy, in the present state of our agriculture, can make it. It is true, almost to a proverb, that farming, upon an extensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a>, is never profitable to a great landholder; and, with a view to the interest of the nation, it ought to be discouraged, as both wasteful and unproductive. In some countries this mode of farming is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a>,\u2014as in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> of Europe, where a class of free tenants does not exist;\u2014in others, the business of cultivation must be carried on as a sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARTNERSHIP\">partnership</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> concern between the proprietor and tenant, as on the metairies of France. Fortunately, the general distribution of wealth has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> since removed the necessity for either of these methods in Britain.\n\nTo give full effect to the professional <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a>, it is necessary that the rights of the landlord and tenant, respectively, should be clearly defined, and well secured by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a> and the private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> of the parties. The principle general principle which should regulate the terms of this connection seems to be, that, while the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARM\">farm</a> ought to be restored to the owner at the expiration of the tenant's interest, at least without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DETERIORATION\">deterioration</a>, the tenant should be encouraged to render it as productive as possible during his possession. In both of these views, a lease for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> of years is scarcely less necessary for the interest of the landlord than of the tenant; and so much is the public interested in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, that it has been proposed by intelligent men, to impose a penal tax on the rent of lands held by tenants at will.\n\nThat the value of the property is enhanced by the security which such a lease confers on the tenant, will be put beyond all doubt, if the rents of two estates for half a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a> back are compared; the one occupied by tenants at will, and the other by tenants on leases for a moderate term, and where the soil and situation are nearly alike in every respect. If the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> be made between two tracts, originally very different in point of value, the advantages of leases will be still more striking. While that which is held by tenants at will remains nearly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a>, the other is gradually, yet effectually, improved, under the security of leases, by the tenant's capital; and, in no long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, the latter takes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> of the former, both in the amount of the revenue which it yields to the proprietor, and in the quantity of produce which it furnishes for the general consumption. The higher rents and greater produce of some parts of Scotland, than of many of the English counties, where the soil, climate, and markets are much more favourable, must be ascribed to the almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> practice of holding on leases in the former country, in a much greater degree than to any of the causes which have been frequently assigned. Less than a century ago, what are now the best cultivated districts of Scotland were very far behind the greater part of England; and, indeed, had made very little progress from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of the\nfeudal system. It is not fifty years since the farmers of Scotland were in the practice of going to learn from their southern neighbours an art, which was then very imperfectly known in their own country. But in several parts of England there has been little or no improvement since, while the southern counties of Scotland have uniformly advanced; and at present exhibit, very generally, a happy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTRAST\">contrast</a> to their condition at the middle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> century.\n\nIn respect to farmers themselves, it cannot be necessary to point out the advantages of leases. It may be true, that, under the security of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of an English landlord, tenants at will have been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> in possession from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a> to generation, and acquired wealth which he has never, like the landholders of some other countries, attempted to wrest from them. But there are few individuals in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of life, who continue for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> of time to sacrifice their just claims on the altar of pure generosity. Something is almost always expected in return. A portion of revenue in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> is exchanged for power, and that power is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> not only in the habitual degradation of the tenantry, but in the control over them, which the landlord never fails to exert at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a> of members of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a>, and on all other political emergencies. No prudent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> will ever invest his fortune in the improvement of another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a>'s property, unless, from the length of his lease, he has a reasonable prospect of being reimbursed with profit; and the servility which holding at will necessarily exacts, is altogether <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a> with that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of enterprise which belongs to an enlightened and independent mind.\n\nThe people at large are evidently most deeply affected by every measure which has a tendency to fetter the productive powers of the soil, and, at the same time, to depress one of their largest and most valuable classes. It is clearly their interest, that corn and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> should be supplied in abundance; and the people of England may justly complain of the want of leases, as one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> causes which checks the improvement of their own territory.\n\nWhat ought to be the term of a lease, can only be determined by a reference to the circumstances of each particular case. Lands naturally rich, or such as have already been brought to a high degree of fertility, requiring no great investment of capital, and returning all or nearly all the necessary outlay within the year, may be advantageously held upon short leases\u2014such perhaps as give time for two, or at most three, of the rotations or courses of crops to which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of the soil is best adapted. The practice of England in this respect is extremely various,\u2014almost every term, from twenty years downwards, being found in different parts of it. In Scotland, by far the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> period is nineteen years, to which it was formerly the practice, in some places, to add the life of the tenant. In that country, even when it is thought expedient to agree for a much longer term, this is still expressed in periods of nineteen years,\u2014a sort of mysterious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CYCLE\">cycle</a>, which seems to be no less a favourite with the courts of law, than with landholders and farmers. Yet this term is somewhat inconvenient, as it can never correspond with any number of the recognized rotations of arable General Observations.\n\nIt has been maintained by several writers, that a lease for twenty years is not sufficient to reimburse a Long tenant for any considerable improvements, and landholders have often been urged to agree to a much of longer term, which, it is alleged, would be not less for their own interest than for that of the tenant. This is a question which our limits do not permit us to discuss, but, after viewing it in different lights, assisted by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> of long leases in different parts of Scotland, we cannot help expressing some doubts of their utility, even in so far only as regards the parties themselves; and we are decidedly of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that a greater produce will be brought to market, from any given extent of land held on successive leases of twenty years, for half a century, than if held on one lease of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>, whether the term be specified, or indefinite, as in the case of a lease for life. As a general mode of tenure, leases for lives seem to us particularly objectionable.\n\nThe great advantages of a lease are so well known <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> in Scotland, that one of her best agricultural writers, Kames himself a landed proprietor, has suggested a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of conferring on it the character of perpetuity, to period, such an extent as, he thinks, would give ample security to the tenant for every profitable improvement, without preventing the landlord from resuming possession upon equitable terms, at the expiration of every specified period. But the author of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> (Lord Kames), in his ardent wishes for the advancement of agriculture, at that time in a very backward state in his native country, seems to have overlooked the difficulties that stood in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADOPTION\">adoption</a>; and the great advance in the price of produce, and consequently in the rate of rents, since his Lordship wrote, have long since put an end to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a> which his proposal excited. For a form of a lease on his plan, the reader may consult <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELL\">Bell</a>'s Treatise on Leases; and the objections to the plan itself are shortly stated in the supplement to the sixth edition of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol10.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">Gentleman</a> Farmer, recently published.\n\nThere have been instances of long leases granted, Long upon condition of receiving an advance of rent at the Leases, end of a certain number of years; but covenants of this kind, meant to apply to the circumstances of a distant period, cannot possibly be framed in such a manner as to do equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> to both parties; and it ought not to be concealed, that, in every case of a very long lease, the chances are rather more unfavourable to the landholder than to the farmer. If the price of produce shall continue to rise as it has done, till very lately, for the last forty years, no improvements which a tenant can be expected to execute will compensate the landlord's loss; and if, on the other hand, prices shall decline, the capital of most tenants must be exhausted in a few years, and the lands will necessarily revert to the proprietor, as has been the case late in many instances. Hence a landholder, in agreeing to a long lease, can hardly assure himself that the obligations on the part of the tenant will be fully discharged throughout its whole term, while the obligations he incurs himself may always be easily enforced. He runs the risk of\ngreat loss from a depreciation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, but can look forward to very little benefit from a depreciation of produce, except for a few years at most. Of this advantage a generous man would seldom avail himself; and, indeed, in most instances, the advantage must be only imaginary, for it would be overbalanced by the deterioration of his property.\n\nWhere the circumstances of a landholder, the state of his property, and the wealth and enterprising character of the tenantry, are such as to render long leases, or leases for an indefinite period, expedient, the most equitable mode, in regard to rent, would be to make it rise and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> with the price of corn or other produce. A rent paid in corn is, indeed, liable to serious objections, and can seldom be advisable in a commercial country. It necessarily bears hardest on a tenant when he is least able to discharge it. In very bad seasons, his crop may be so scanty as scarcely to return seed and the expenses of cultivation, and the share which he ought to receive himself, as the profits of his capital, as well as the quantity allotted to the landlord, may not exist at all. Though, in this case, if he pays a money-rent, his loss may be considerable, it may be twice or three times greater if the rent is to be paid in corn, or according to the high price of such seasons. In less favourable years, which often occur in the variable climate of Britain, a corn-rent would, in numerous instances, absorb nearly the whole free or disposable produce, as it is by no means uncommon to find the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> produce of even good land reduced from twenty to fifty per cent. below an average, in particular seasons. And it ought to be considered, in regard to the landlord himself, that his income would thus be doubled or trebled, at a time when all other classes were suffering from scarcity and consequent dearth; while, in times of plenty and cheapness, he might find it difficult to make his expenses correspond with the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIMINUTION\">diminution</a> of his receipts. It is of much importance to both parties, that the amount of the rent should vary as little as possible from any unforeseen causes, though tenants in general would be perhaps the most injured by such fluctuations.\n\nTo obviate these and other objections to a corn-rent, and to do equal justice at all times to both landlord and tenant, a plan has been lately suggested for converting the corn into money, adopting for its price, not the price of the year for which the rent is payable, but the average price of a certain number of years. The rent, according to this plan, may be calculated every year, by omitting the first year of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a>, and adding a new one; or, it may continue the same for a certain number of years, and then be fixed according to a new average. Let us suppose the lease to be for twenty-one years, the average agreed on being seven years, and the first year's rent, that is, the price of so many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of corn, will be calculated from the average price of the crop of that year, and of the six years preceding. If it be meant to take a new average for the second and every succeeding year's rent, all that is necessary is, to strike off the first of these seven years, adding the year for which the rent is payable, and so on during all the years of the lease. But this labour, slight as it is, may be dispensed with, by continuing the rent without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> for the first seven years of the lease, according to the average price of the seven years immediately preceding its commencement, and, at the end of this period, fixing a new rent, according to the average price of the seven years just expired, to continue for the next seven years. Thus, in the course of twenty-one years, the rent would be calculated only three times; and for whatever quantity of corn the parties had agreed, the money payments would be equal to the average price of fourteen years of the lease itself, and of the seven years preceding it; and the price of the last seven years of the old lease, would determine the rent during the first seven years of the new one.\n\nThe landlord and tenant, it has been thought, could not suffer either from bad seasons or any change in the value of the currency, should such a lease as this be extended to several periods of twenty-one years. The quantity of corn, to be taken as rent, is the only point that would require to be settled at the commencement of each of these periods; and though this would no doubt be greater or less, according to the state of the lands at the time, yet it may be expected, that, in the twenty-one years preceding, all the tenant's judicious expenditure had been fully replaced. Instead of the twofold difficulty in fixing a rent for a long lease, arising from uncertainty as to the quantity of produce, which must depend on the state of improvement, and still more perhaps from the variations in the price of that produce, the latter objection is entirely removed by this plan; and in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> where land is already brought to a high degree of fertility, the question about the quantity of produce may likewise be dispensed with.\n\nUpon this plan we shall take leave to observe, that, if it be applied to leases of nineteen or twenty-one years, the inconvenience resulting from uncertainty as to the amount of rent, as well as other difficulties which must necessarily attend it, would be as great as one year, perhaps as any advantages which it holds out to either of the parties. If it be said that a rent, determined by a seven years average, could not suddenly nor materially alter, this is at once to admit the inutility of the contrivance. The first thing which must strike every practical man is, that corn is not the only produce of a farm, and in most parts of Britain, perhaps not the principal source from which rent is paid; and there is no authentic record of the prices of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUTCHER\">butcher</a> meat, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a>, cheese, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a>, and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol8.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> in every county to refer to, as there is of corn. This is not the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> to inquire whether the price of corn regulates the price of all the other products of land, in a country whose statute books are full of duties, bounties, drawbacks, &c., to say nothing of its internal regulations; but it is sufficiently evident, that, if corn does possess this power, its price operates too slowly on that of other products, to serve as a just criterion for determining rent on a lease of this duration. Besides, in the progress of agriculture, new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> or varieties of the cerealia themselves are established even in so short a period as twenty-one years, the price of which may be very different from that of the corn specified in the lease. What security for a full rent, for instance, would it give to a landlord, to make the rent payable according to the price of\nbarley, when the tenant might find it more for his interest to cultivate some of the varieties of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> wheat lately brought from the Continent? Or, according to the price of a particular variety of oats, when, within a few years, we have seen all the old varieties superseded, throughout extensive districts, by the introduction of a new one, the potatoe-oat, which may not be more permanent than those that preceded it? There can be no impropriety, indeed, in adopting this plan, for ascertaining the rent of land kept always in tillage, but it would be idle to expect any important benefits from it, during such a lease as we have mentioned.\n\nWith regard to much longer leases, this plan will no doubt diminish the evils which we think are inseparable from them, but it cannot possibly reach some of the most considerable. Its utmost effect is to secure to the landholder a rent, which shall in all time to come be an adequate rent, according to the state of the lands and the mode of cultivation known at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a> of the lease. But it can make no provision that will apply to the enlargement of the gross produce from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> improvement of the lands themselves, or of the disposable produce from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of machinery and other plans for economizing labour. And the objections just stated, in reference to a lease of twenty-one years, evidently apply much more forcibly to one of two or three times that length. Old corn-rents therefore, though much higher at present than old money rents, are seldom or never so high as the rents that could now be paid on a lease of twenty-one years. But, independent of these considerations, which more immediately bear upon the interests of the parties themselves, one insuperable objection to all such leases is, that they partake too much of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of entails, and depart too far from that commercial character which is most favourable to the investment of capital, and consequently to the greatest increase of land produce.\n\nA lease for a term of years is not, however, in all cases, a sufficient encouragement to spirited cultivation; its covenants in respect to the management of the lands may be injudicious; the tenant may be so strictly confined to a particular mode of culture, or a particular course of crops, as not to be able to avail himself of the beneficial discoveries which a progressive state of agriculture never fails to introduce. Or, on the other hand, though this is much more rare, the tenant may be left so entirely at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, that either the necessity of his circumstances during the currency of the lease, or his interest towards its expiration, may lead him to exhaust the soil, instead of rendering it more productive. When a lease therefore is either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUNDANT\">redundant</a> or deficient in this respect\u2014where it either permits the lands to be deteriorated or prevents their improvement,\u2014the connection between landlord and tenant is formed upon other views, and regulated by some other principle, than the general one on which we think it should be founded.\n\nNotwithstanding the high authority of Dr Smith, restrictive covenants are always necessary to the security of the landlord, and in some cases beneficial also to the tenant. Their expediency cannot well be questioned, in those parts of the country where an improved system of agriculture has made little progress. A landholder, assisted by the advice of experienced men in framing these covenants, cannot adopt any easier or less offensive plan for the improvement of his property, and the ultimate advantages of his tenantry. Even in the best cultivated districts, while farms continue to be let to the highest responsible offerers, a few restrictive covenants cannot be dispensed with. The supposed interest of the tenant is too feeble a security for correct management, even during the earlier part of a lease, and in the latter part of it, it is thought to be his interest, in most cases, to exhaust the soil as much as possible, not only for the sake of immediate profit, but frequently in order to deter competitors, and thus to obtain a renewal of his lease at a rent somewhat less than the lands would otherwise bring.\n\nWith tenants at will, and such as hold on short leases, restrictive covenants are more necessary than with tenants on leases of nineteen or twenty years; but, in many instances, they are too numerous and complicated, and sometimes even inconsistent with the best courses of modern husbandry. The great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> lies, in prescribing rules by which a tenant is positively required to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a>\u2014not in prohibiting such practices, and such crops, as experience has not sanctioned. The improved knowledge, and the liberality of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, have now expurgated the most objectionable of these covenants; and throughout whole counties, almost the only restriction in reference to the course of crops is, that the tenant shall not take two culmiferous crops, ripening their seeds, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> succession. This single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STIPULATION\">stipulation</a>, combined with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBLIGATION\">obligation</a> to consume the straw upon the farm, and to apply to it all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANURE\">manure</a> made from its produce, is sufficient not only to protect the land from exhaustion, but to ensure, in a great measure, its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> cultivation; for half the farm at least must, in this case, be always under either fallow or green crops. The only other necessary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COVENANT\">covenant</a>, when the soil is naturally too weak for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> annual crops without intermission, is, that a certain portion of the land shall be always in grass, not to be cut for hay, but depastured. According to the extent of this will be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> between the succession of corn crops on the same fields: if it is agreed that half the farm, for instance, shall always be under grass, there can be only two crops of corn from the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a> in six years. In this case not more than two-sixths being in corn, one-sixth in green crops or fallow, and three-sixths in clovers or grasses, it becomes almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to exhaust any soil at all fitted for tillage. There are few indeed that do not gradually become more fertile under this course of cropping. It is sufficiently evident, that other covenants are necessary in particular circumstances, such as permission to dispose of straw, hay, and other crops from which manure is made, when a quantity of manure equal to what they would have furnished, is got from other places; and a prohibition against converting rich old grazing lands or meadows into corn lands. In this place we speak only of general rules, such as are applicable to perhaps nine-tenths of all the arable land of Britain, and such as are actually observed in our best cultivated counties.\n\nFor the last four years of a lease, the same cove-\nnants are generally sufficient, only they require to be applied with more precision. Instead of taking for granted, that the proportion of the farm that cannot be under corn will be properly cultivated, from the tenant's regard to his own interest, it becomes necessary to take him bound to this effect in express terms; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> generally being to enable the tenant, upon a new lease, to carry on the cultivation of the lands, as if the former lease had not terminated. What these additional stipulations should be, must depend in part on the season of the year at which the new lease commences, and in part on the course of crops best adapted to the soil, and the particular circumstances of every farm.\n\n3. The enlargement of farms to such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> as admits of arrangements and machinery for saving labour is the natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the progress of agriculture, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACQUISITION\">acquisition</a> of capital by cultivators, and becomes, in its turn, the cause of further improvements. We have not room to examine here the various objections to large farms which were urged by Dr Price, Lord Kames, and most of the economical writers of the last century. Much stronger reasons, certainly, than any that have been hitherto advanced, must be required to justify the interference of the Legislature with the rights of the agricultural classes\u2014with that of a landholder to draw the greatest revenue from his property, and with that of a farmer to extend his concerns as far as his capital and abilities will permit. Even though it should be conceded to Dr Price, that a given extent of land yields a greater produce in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of several small farmers than of one great farmer, it still remains to inquire, what part of that produce can be spared for the general consumption?\u2014and whether the labour of these people might not be employed with more advantage than on such minute portions of land as yield, even in the best seasons, little more than food for their own subsistence? In Britain, of which the families employed in agriculture are to those of the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> only as 1 to 2.84, and in which the proportion of lands cultivated, or that may be cultivated, is not four acres to every individual, the great object ought certainly to be, to increase the disposable produce of the country for the supply of the general population.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> objection to large farms, that they depopulate the country, is not supported by facts. The population of the country has not only greatly increased since the enlargement of farms, but, in the ten years from 1801 to 1811, this increase appears to have been only two per cent. less than that of the town population. The fact is, that the increase of the rural population has been in a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a> than that of the town population, in those counties, such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-NORTHUMBERLAND\">Northumberland</a>, where very large farms abound; and where, indeed, as is usually the case, this state of things is combined with a spirited and productive system of agriculture. Even in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-LANCASHIRE\">Lancashire</a>, the ratio of increase is only two per cent. in favour of the towns; but no one will ascribe this to the enlargement of farms. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> seems to be, that, wherever agriculture has made the greatest progress, whatever may be the size of farms, the increase of employment has been attended with a corresponding increase of population; and that the ratio of increase General has been kept <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> below that of towns, by no other causes than the stationary condition or slow progress of agriculture in some parts, and the superior allurements of manufactures and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> in others.\n\nIt is farther to be remarked, that, throughout the whole of the arable districts of Scotland, the number of people is proportionally greater on large than on small farms. The number of hands required on the former is too great to be lodged in the farmer's own Married <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>; and, therefore, on all such farms cottages are Farm-Servants built for their residence. These cottages are generally inhabited by married men, whose families find employment in hoeing green crops, and other easy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, from a very early age. In the less improved counties, on the other hand, where small farms still prevail, unmarried servants are preferred, as, on such farms, there is little or no employment for the families of married servants. Our limits do not permit us to inquire how far the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> laws of England operate against the employment of married servants, living in cottages on every farm; but the happy effects of this arrangement are manifest in the southeastern counties of Scotland, as we shall notice immediately.\n\nThe possession of land is held by some writers to Cottage-be so important, with a view to the comforts of the Farms, labouring classes, as well as to the increase of the rural population, that they have not been contented with objecting to large farms, but have proceeded to recommend what are called cottage-farms, for country labourers generally. Of this plan we might say at once, that it must be limited everywhere by the demand for labour; and that, wherever such small allotments are required by the state of agriculture, they will gradually be formed from motives of interest, without the necessity of any higher control. They are at this time common in many parts of Britain; and a different system has been established in other parts, for no other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> than because of its superior advantages to all concerned. Yet, as cottage-farms bear a very plausible appearance in the eye of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a> men, it seems necessary to offer some farther remarks on a question which has been so often agitated.\n\nIf every labourer had a comfortable cottage, and four acres of land at a moderate rent, as recommended by some of the correspondents of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOARD\">Board</a> of Agriculture, there is reason to believe that his condition might be much improved for a few years, supposing the demand for labour to continue the same as at present. Even the colonies which this class would every year send forth in quest of new cottages might be supplied for a time; and though the wages of labour must sink very fast, still this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREMIUM\">premium</a> might enable the labourers to multiply with little interruption for several generations. At last, however, the multiplication of cottage-farms must necessarily stop, and a great proportion of the people, without land and without the means of employment, would either sink into helpless misery, or be driven by despair to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> of every species of enormity. Such was the state of England at the breaking up of the feudal system, the policy of which also was to increase the number of the people, without regard to\nthe means of their employment; and such, though in a much less degree, is the present state of those parts of the united <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> in which cottage-farms are the most prevalent.\n\nThe whole question, we think, is capable of being most satisfactorily decided, by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> mercantile criterion of rent. If a hundred labourers, each of them possessing four acres, can pay a higher rent than one farmer can pay for the whole four hundred, buildings, fences, and repairs, being estimated, we can see no reason why they should not be preferred; but if this be not the case, we are greatly at a loss to conceive with what justice landholders can be called upon to submit to sacrifices which no other class of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a> is ever expected to make. We might, with just as much reason and justice, require a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANUFACTURER\">manufacturer</a> to employ a certain number of hands in proportion to the amount of his capital, however unprofitable to him might be their labour.\n\nBut, farther, in all our best agricultural counties, there are two sorts of cottages occupied by two distinct classes of labourers. Of the first sort are the small agricultural villages, where those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a> and other labourers reside, who could not find full employment on any one farm. To such men small farms are advantageous, or otherwise, according to the nature and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTANCY\">constancy</a> of their employment.\n\nThe other class of cottagers, to which we have already alluded, are ploughmen and other servants employed throughout the year on a particular farm. To these men small possessions of land are almost as unsuitable as they would be to a country gentleman's domestics. But a small garden is usually attached to each cottage; and they are also allowed to keep a cow, as part of their wages,\u2014not upon any particular spot of their own, but along with their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>'s cows. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol10.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a> is carried home by their master's teams, and a part of his own field, ready dressed, is assigned them for raising potatoes, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAX\">flax</a>, or other crops for their families. Thus, with little risk from the seasons or markets, and without any other demand on their time than a few leisure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a> will satisfy, these people enjoy all the advantages which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCCUPANCY\">occupancy</a> of land can confer on a labourer. And there is not a more useful, we may also add, a more comfortable, body of men among the industrious classes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>.\n\nTo give this class of labourers four acres of land, along with every cottage, would be to render them bad servants, and worse farmers; and either a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol7.html#article-NUISANCE\">nuisance</a> to the person on whose farm they reside, or his abject dependents for employment. The only proper residence for men who do not choose to engage, or are not wanted, as constant labourers, is in such central agricultural villages as we have just mentioned, and not on separate farms, where they are excluded from the general market for labour.\n\nBut it is needless to proceed further with this discussion. Of all the witnesses examined before the late Committees of Parliament on the corn laws, there is only one whose sentiments are opposed to the general feeling of all well-informed men, regarding the advantages that have resulted from the enlargement of farms. We shall, therefore, content ourselves with noticing what appears to be the natural progress in the size of farms,\u2014the circumstances which prevent any possible enlargement of them from ever becoming injurious to the public,\u2014and the influence which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> liberty in this respect has exerted in the improvement of our agriculture.\n\nDuring the feudal system, that part of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESTATE\">estate</a> which was not cultivated under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of the proprietor himself, was let out in small allotments to his vassals, from whom he received <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> or other services, or a portion of the produce, in return. In these times of turbulence and ferocity, the power of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> mainly depended on the number of his tenants; and it was therefore his policy to increase them as much as possible, by dividing his land into very small possessions. That they might assist one another in their rural labours, and in repelling the incursions to which they were incessantly exposed, these tenants were collected in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VILLAGE\">village</a> near the castle of their lord. A certain extent of arable land was appropriated to it, on which they raised corn, and a much larger tract of waste or wood land, where their live stock pastured in common. Spirited cultivation could never be introduced into this system of occupancy; nothing more than the means of subsistence was sought by the tenantry, and power, not revenue, was the great object of the landholder.\n\nFor a long time after the fall of the feudal system, this arrangement continued to prevail with little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a>; its vestiges are still to be traced in every part of Britain; and it exists in several counties, though in a modified form, even at the present time. The common fields and commons of England, and the infield and outfield divisions of Scotland, did not originate in any regard for the welfare of the lower classes, to whom the tenancy of land is now thought to be so necessary, but in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANARCHY\">anarchy</a> and oppression of those dark ages in which all the landed property of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> was engrossed by a few great barons.\n\nWhen these petty sovereigns were at last overthrown, and when commerce and the arts held up to them new objects of desire, and to their depressed tenantry new modes of employment and subsistence, the bond which had hitherto connected the landholder and cultivator became more and more feeble, and it was soon found necessary to establish it upon other foundations than those of feudal protection and dependence. The connection between landlord and tenant came gradually and generally to assume that commercial form, which is at once most conducive to their own interest, and to the general welfare.\n\nOne great obstacle to this change was the want of capital ready to be embarked in agricultural pursuits. Under the feudal system there could be little or no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCUMULATION\">accumulation</a>. Property in land was the only means of obtaining the command of labour, and a share of the produce its only recompense. Accordingly, upon the breaking up of the feudal system, large tracts were taken into the immediate possession of landholders themselves, because no suitable tenants could be found. The constant superintendence required in cultivating corn-lands, as well as the absurd restrictions of those times upon the corn-trade, and the constant demand for British wool on the Conti-","sp":414,"ep":420},{"h":"GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE SKELETON","t":"I. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADULT\">Adult</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">Male</a>.\n\n169. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SKELETON\">skeleton</a> of the body may be regarded as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> frame-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> which supports and contains the softer parts.\n\n170. It is made up of 254 separate pieces of osseous substance, most of which contain a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> called marrow, and are surrounded with a membrane denominated periosteum. These separate pieces, with their appendages, have the appellation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BONES\">bones</a> usually applied to them; and they are connected to each other in various ways.\n\n1. Of Bones in their separate State.\n\nA. Their Osseous Substance.\n\n171. In almost all bones, the osseous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> presents itself under two forms. Externally it assumes the form of an uninterrupted shell <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> covering, which is called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a> part, and a very delicate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEXTURE\">texture</a> of fine plates or fibres intersecting each other, and leaving small spaces between them, projects internally from this, which is called the cellular or reticulated part. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> of these two, varies in different bones.\n\nB. Of the Marrow.\n\n172. The chemical properties of the oily matter of the marrow, have not yet been sufficiently investigated.\n\nC. The Periosteum.\n\n173. This covering distinctly possesses the structure of tendinous substance.\n\n174. We cannot regard it as correct, that it is prolonged from one bone to another over <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a>. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> it covers the whole outer surface of the compact substance, except at those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> where one bone is united to another.\n\n2. The Connections of Bones.\n\n175. The connections between bones are of two kinds; some admit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, others do not.\n\nA. Connections admitting Motion.\n\n176. It may be remarked of those bones which are united in such a manner as to enjoy motion <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> each other, that their touching surfaces never consist of bare osseous substance, nor even of osseous substance covered with periosteum. They are either provided with separate crusts or prolongations of cartilage, the surfaces of which play directly on each other, constituting what is denominated a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> or articulation; or they are united to one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> intermediate substance, which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEXIBLE\">flexible</a>, or admits of compression.\n\na. Articulations or Joints.\n\na. The Cartilages.\n\n177. The surfaces of the portions of cartilage, which are in contact with each other in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of connection, are always as smooth as the finest polished <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IVORY\">ivory</a>.\n\n178. It was affirmed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> ago by Dr Nesbit (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">Human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OSTEOLOGY\">Osteology</a>), and Dr Hunter (Phil. Trans. 1743), and has been much insisted on of late years by Bichat (Anat. G\u00e9n\u00e9r.), that these surfaces are covered with a very delicate prolongation of synovial membrane. We are very much inclined to think, however, from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of experiments, that these anatomists have been mistaken.\n\nb. The Ligaments.\n\n179. All articulated bones are partly held together by means of ligaments. These are composed of tendinous substance, and may be divided into fascicular and capsular. The fascicular ligaments are disposed in cords, at intervals, around the joint; the capsular form a continuous web, including the united surfaces in a kind of shut sac.\n\n\u03b3. The Synovial Membrane.\n\n180. In all the intervals between fascicular ligaments, portions of synovial membrane may be distinctly seen filling up these intervals. They are attached to the ligaments on the one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, and to the articulated bones on the other, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> at the edge of the cartilaginous surfaces.\n\n181. It does not seem to us, however, to have been yet satisfactorily ascertained, whether this synovial membrane be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> over the inner surface of the fascicular ligaments; or how it is disposed in joints, of which the ligaments are of the capsular kind.\n\nb. Without Articulation.\n\n182. The small bones of the spine called vertebrae, are united to each other chiefly in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>. The portions of them denominated their bodies, are directly connected to pieces of a flexible and compressible substance, somewhat between cartilage and tendon in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, one piece being common to two vertebrae.\n\nB. Connections not admitting Motion.\n\n183. These may be divided into two kinds, suture and synchondrosis.\n\na. Suture.\n\n184. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>, the bones are united by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> contact of their osseous substance. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTIGUOUS\">contiguous</a> parts, however, are in general more or less indented or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERRATED\">serrated</a>, the projecting parts of the one being fixed into holes or grooves in the other. The periosteum passes across the line of junction, and does not dip <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> between the united surfaces.\n\nb. Synchondrosis.\n\n185. In this mode, a piece of cartilage, or some\n3. Dimensions and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">Weight</a> of the Skeleton.\n\n186. The height of the skeleton of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> five feet eight inches, we believe, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be found in general to be about five feet seven inches.\n\n187. Soemmerring (De Corp. Hum. Tab. I.) has made some trials of the weight of the skeleton; and, according to him, it varies from 150 to 200 ounces. But we are uncertain as to the weights he employed, and ignorant of the manner in which his estimates were made.\n\nII. In the Adult <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEMALE\">Female</a>.\n\n188. The same general remarks which have just been made with respect to the skeleton of the adult male, apply equally to that of the adult female; only the skeleton of the latter is a little lower, and not so heavy. According to Soemmerring, it weighs in general only from 100 to 150 ounces.\n\nIII. Before and after Maturity.\n\n189. Parts corresponding to the skeleton may be distinctly perceived in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMBRYO\">embryo</a> of seven or eight weeks. At this early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, however, osseous substance has not yet appeared. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> bones, we find either a pellucid substance like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JELLY\">jelly</a>, moulded into their general form, and surrounded with periosteum, or else a simple membrane resembling the periosteum in structure. Some bones are wholly gelatinous, others wholly membranous, and others partly in the one state and partly in the other.\n\n190. About the end of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OSSIFICATION\">ossification</a> begins. It does not commence, however, in all parts of the skeleton at once, but takes place at different periods in different bones, or even in different parts of the same bone. Its commencement in some is delayed until a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> after birth.\n\n191. When we attend to the progress of ossification in those parts of the fetal skeleton which are at first gelatinous, we observe, that if any of these parts are converted into osseous substance so early as the second or third month after conception, they seem to undergo very little previous change of consistence. If they are not ossified, however, till the fourth or fifth month, they gradually lose their resemblance to jelly, becoming firmer, more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a>, and more opaque; and if the ossification is still further delayed, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPACITY\">opacity</a>, firmness, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTICITY\">elasticity</a>, rapidly increase, they acquire a pearly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, and are converted into a substance in every respect the same as cartilage.\n\n192. When the ossification commences in this gelatinous or cartilaginous basis, the first part which is ossified is always observed to be situated towards the centre of the jelly or cartilage; and from this point the process gradually extends in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>. In early ossifications, the parts are so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a>, that it is difficult to perceive the appearances in the gelatinous basis which immediately precede the formation of the osseous substance. But in those which commence at a later period, the parts of the cartilage which are just about to be converted into bone, uniformly exhibit a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of vascularity; and a number of little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> specks are observed in them, in each of which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CAPILLARY\">capillary</a> blood-vessel seems to terminate, and in which the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BONY\">bony</a> particles that are formed generally appear.\n\n193. When ossification commences in a membranous part of the fetal skeleton, the osseous substance first appears in the form of a fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">net</a>-work of slender fibres, confined to a small spot in the middle of the membrane. But by the formation of additional osseous particles, this net-work is converted into a plate of bone of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> thinness and delicacy, and having a layer of the membrane covering each surface, which may be regarded as its periosteum. Innumerable bony fibres are then observed to shoot out, in a radiated direction, from the margins of this little plate, and these are soon connected by short transverse threads of osseous substance, in such a manner, as to give the bone for a time a slightly reticular appearance. The spaces between the fibres seem entirely filled up by blood-vessels.\n\n194. In this manner, the ossification extends through the whole membrane, splitting it, as it proceeds, into two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAYERS\">layers</a>, which become the periosteum of the opposite surfaces of the new bone, but remain united into one single membrane around the whole of its margin. At the same time, however, that the bone is thus enlarging in breadth, it is also increasing in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOLIDITY\">solidity</a>, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEPOSITION\">deposition</a> of new osseous particles between those already formed. At <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a>, it assumes the form of a continuous plate of compact substance, the different parts of which are proportioned in their thickness to the corresponding parts of the future bone; and if the adult bone contains any reticulated substance, the cells are generally developed in the middle of this compact plate.\n\n195. No sooner are the cancelli developed in any part of a young bone, than they are lined with a very vascular medullary membrane. This membrane, however, contains only a slightly viscid, reddish, and transparent fluid. It does not appear to begin to receive any admixture of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> till after birth. At first, the proportion of oily matter is small, and it increases in general so gradually, that the fluid does not acquire the consistence or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of true medullary oil, until the period of maturity.\n\n196. In old persons, the medullary membrane seems to become less vascular, and the oil acquires a yellower colour.\n\n197. The periosteum in the fetus is much thicker, and more tender than in the adult. It is more vascular too, and particularly at those parts of a bone where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> ossification is going on. In old persons, it is thinner and less vascular.\n\n198. As soon as the soft <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> of the future bones are visible in the fetus, divisions may be observed in them corresponding to the articulations and synchondroses, but none to the sutures.\n\n199. The ligaments and synovial membranes in the young person seem to differ in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> only from those of the adult.\n200. For a considerable time after the margins of bones, that are intended to be united by suture, first come into contact, they adhere so slightly to each other, that the bones seem chiefly held together by the periosteum which passes from the one to the other. By degrees, however, as the bones are more fully developed, they are locked more firmly into each other.\n\n201. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> of the articulations seems to undergo very little change in the decline of life. But it is not unusual, in very advanced <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, to find the cartilages partially converted into osseous substance. On the approach of old age too, we may almost always observe that the sutures begin to be obliterated. Particles of osseous substance are formed between the margins of the bones, the line of the suture is gradually filled up, and at last the bones are fairly continued into each other.","sp":524,"ep":526},{"h":"INSECTA","t":"Subclass I.

Wings two, with halteres or balancers at their base. Mouth tubular, formed for sucking. (Metamorphosis incomplete or subcoarctate.) Plate XXV.\n\nThe generic characters of insects, and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a> into families and stipes, will be given under the article Insecta, which see.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLASS\">CLASS</a> V.\u2014VERMES.\n\nThe Vermes comprehend all those annulose animals which have no distinct head, no antenn\u00e6, and no legs. Many of them inhabit the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, others fresh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, and some few damp places, or even under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>. Their classification is not understood; an extensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a> is therefore open to any naturalist, who may hereafter have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, inclination, and opportunity to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> them.\n\nLamarck and others have arranged them, from the position of their respiratory organs, into two orders, which we have adopted; but the arrangement of the Vermes genera appears to be very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a>, although <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> calculated to assist the views of the student.\n\nOrder I. Cryptobranchia. Organs of respiration concealed, or internal.\n\nOrder II. Gymnibranchia. Organs of respiration naked, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a>.\n\nOrder I. Cryptobranchia.\n\nA. Body rounded, furnished with little spines.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENUS\">Genus</a> 1. Lumbricus, 2. Thalessemia.\nB. Body rounded or flattened; each extremity furnished with a sucker.\n\nGenus 3. Pontobedella, 4. Hirudo.\n\nC. Body flattened, naked, smooth; extremities without suckers.\n\nGenus 5. Planaria.\n\nD. Body flattened; sides with set\u00e6.\n\nGenus 6. Na\u00efs.\n\nA.\n\nGen. 1. Lumericus of authors.\n\nBody naked, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, cylindric, articulated; rings fleshy, contractile; with short fasciculae of spines; anterior extremity conic; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POSTERIOR\">posterior</a> extremity somewhat flattened, obtuse.\n\nOne <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> only has been accurately determined by naturalists. This species is hermaphrodite, and deposits its eggs. There is an excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> its structure, by De Montegue, published in the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the M\u00e9moires du Mus\u00e9um d'Histoire Naturelle.\n\nSp. 1. Terrestris of authors. Plate XXVI.\n\nThis is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> earth-worm, whose use, in the economy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, seems to be, that of rendering the earth more porous, by its innumerable holes, and thus facilitating the growth of vegetables, which it manures by the leaves, &c. that it draws into its haunts.\n\nGen. 2. Thalessema. Cuvier, &c.\n\nBody with its hinder extremity much thicker than the anterior, which resembles a conic funnel; neck with two hooks below.\n\nThe Thalessema inhabit the shores of the sea.\n\nSp. 1. Aquatica.\n\nB.\n\nThe animals of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> are denominated Leeches or Blood-suckers. One of the genera inhabits the sea, the other fresh-water.\n\nGen. 3. Pontobedella. Leach. (Sea-leech.)\n\nBody <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a>, round, slightly contractile; both extremities (especially the anterior extremity) attenuated; skin subcoriaceous.\n\nSp. 1. Spinulosa. Body Spinulose.\n\nPlate XXVI.\n\nThis species is common in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">North</a> British seas, adhering to skates, whence it is commonly called skate-sucker. When bruised it emits a dark liquor, which stains of a beautiful purple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>.\n\nGen. 4. Hirudo of authors. (Leech.)\n\nBody oblong, more or less flattened, very contractile; anterior extremity very gradually attenuated; skin tough.\n\nSp. 1. Medicinalis. (Common leech.)\n\nPlate XXVI.\n\nThis species inhabits rivers and lakes. It is the common leech used by medical people.\n\nC.\n\nGen. 5. Planaria. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MULL\">Mull</a>., &c.\n\nBody horizontally depressed, subgelatinous; mouth terminal; belly with two openings beneath; one for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a>; the other for the passage of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXCREMENT\">excrement</a>.\n\nThe species are numerous, and of various shapes: They inhabit fresh waters; some have one, two, three, four, or even no eyes; some have tentacles, others none. On this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a>, as Cuvier observes, they should be distributed under several generic heads.\n\nD.\n\nGen. 6. Na\u00efs. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MULLER\">Muller</a>, &c.\n\nBody naked, long, slender, somewhat depressed, articulated; sides with long set\u00e6, disposed in bundles.\n\nSp. 1. Proboscidea. Reddish, mouth produced, filiform.\n\nInhabits fresh waters. Its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of generation is curious. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> of the body by degrees separates and forms an entire animal.\n\nObs. The other Na\u00efdes of authors (at least those whose economy is known) <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEPOSIT\">deposit</a> eggs. This genus may therefore be divided hereafter, when the exact structure of each species shall have been accurately determined.\n\nOrder II. Gymnobranchia.\n\nA. Body free.\n\na. Mouth with jaws.\n\nGenus 7. Nereis.\n\nb. Mouth without jaws; labial palpi distinct.\n\nGenus 8. Amphionome, 9. Aphrodita, 10. Lepidotus.\n\nc. Mouth without jaws; labial palpi none.\n\nGenus 11. Arenicola.\n\nB. Body inclosed within a tube.\n\na. Tube composed of fragments of shell or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>; head with tentacles.\n\nGenus 12. Teredella, 13. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-AMPHITRITE\">Amphitrite</a>.\n\nb. Tube composed of fragments of shell or sand; head without tentacles.\n\nGenus 14. Cistena.\n\nc. Tube testaceous, open at each end.\n\nGenus 15. Dentalium.\n\nd. Tube testaceous, open at its anterior end only.\n\nGenus 16. Serpula, 17. Spirorbis.\n\nA. a.\n\nGen. 7. Nereis of authors.\n\nBody composed of rings; rings on each side with processes of various forms in the different species. Mouth with tentacles.\n\nThe Nereides are often called Sea-centipedes, from their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> resemblance to the Scolopendrid\u00e6. They require to be investigated. Their tentacles vary in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a>, and in situation. The characters for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> are therefore very obvious. Their mouth varies very much in the structure of its parts, in the size of its jaws, in the form of the lateral processes, &c.\n\nSp. 1. Margaritacea. Body pearly; terminated by two long set\u00e6; tentacles eight; head trilobate; exterior lobes, with their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> attenuated and very slightly knobbed; middle lobe with two little incurved processes.\n\nPlate XXVI.\n\nThis species is common at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELL\">Bell</a>-Rock, and is subject to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> in colour; being sometimes greenish-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRONZE\">bronze</a>, at other times with a purple line running <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the middle of its back.\n\nA. b.\n\nThe three genera of this division form a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUP\">group</a>.\nGen. 8. **Amphinoe**, Brugui\u00e8re, &c.\n\nOrgans of respiration long, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PLUMOSE\">plumose</a>.\n\nSp. 1. Tetraclada.\n\nAphrodita rostrata. Pallas.\n\nGen. 9. **Aphroditae** of authors.\n\nOrgans of respiration short, covered. Back membranaceous, naked; sides very bristly; bristles intermingled with silky down.\n\nSp. 1. Aculeata of authors.\n\nInhabits the European <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCEAN\">Ocean</a>. It is often named the sea-mouse by our fishermen.\n\nGen. 10. **Lepidonotus**, new genus.\n\nOrgans of respiration short, covered. Back covered by a double <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of scales.\n\nThis genus contains many species: We possess about eleven kinds found on our coasts.\n\nSp. 1. Clavatus.\n\nAphrodita clava.\n\nMontagu, Trans. Linn. Soc. ix. tab. 7.\n\nInhabits the British Seas.\n\nA. c.\n\nGen. 11. **Arenicola**, Lamarck, &c.\n\nBody round, each extremity rounded, obtuse; posterior extremity narrowest; anterior extremity with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TUBERCLES\">tubercles</a> on each side terminated by set\u00e6; organs of respiration placed externally behind the tubercles of the middle of the body.\n\nSp. 1. Carbonaria. Body coal-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>.\n\nInhabits the Firth of Forth at the Black Rocks, near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEITH\">Leith</a>, under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>. Plate XXVI.\n\nSp. 2. Tinctoria. Body yellowish inclining to cinereous, beautifully banded with blue; organs of respiration blood-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>; tail greenish.\n\nInhabits the sand of the sea, in which it burrows, and is extracted by the fishermen, who use it as a bait for fish. When living the tail secretes a fluid which stains the fingers of a fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> colour.\n\nLumbricus marinus of Linnaeus belongs to this genus, of which we possess two other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIGENOUS\">indigenous</a> species.\n\nB. a.\n\nGen. 12. **Terrebellia**, Linn\u00e9, &c.\n\nBody cylindric. Tentacles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CAPILLARY\">capillary</a>, numerous.\n\nThis genus has been confused with Amphitrite, by several authors. The Linnean character \"tentacula capillaria\" will however apply to this alone.\n\nSp. 1. Lapidaria. Linn\u00e9.\n\nInhabits the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a>.\n\nGen. 13. **Amphitrite**, M\u00fcller, &c.\n\nBody annulated. Tentacles acuminate, plumose, versus, numerous.\n\nSp. 1. Volutacornis. Tentacles convoluted; stem with long ciliated fibres on one side, spirally turned two or three times.\n\nAmphitrite volutacornis.\n\nMontagu, Trans. Linn. Soc. xi. 81. tab. 7. fig. 10.\n\nInhabits the southern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of Devon, where it was first discovered by Montagu. Plate XXVI.\n\nB. b.\n\nGen. 14. **Cistena**, new genus.\n\nMouth with two pectinated scales, of a brilliant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> colour. Plate XXVI.\n\nSp. 1. Pallaxtii.\n\nNereis cylindrica.\n\nPall. Miscel. Zool. 181. tab. ix. fig. 3.\n\nSabella tubiformis.\n\nPenn. Brit. Zool. iv. 148. tab. 92. fig. 163.\n\nNereis conchilega.\n\nPenn. Brit. Zool. iv. 47.\n\nInhabits the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a> shores of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>.\n\nB. c.\n\nGen. 15. **Dentalium** of authors.\n\nHead with tentacles. Tubes slightly bent.\n\nThe species of this genus are distinguished by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCULPTURE\">sculpture</a> of their shelly tubes.\n\nSp. 1. Entaliz of authors.\n\nInhabits the European Ocean.\n\nB. d.\n\nGen. 16. **Serpula** of authors.\n\nTentacles forming two bundles.\n\nThe species of this genus are very numerous, and are but little known; they are to be distinguished by their shelly tubes.\n\nGen. 17. **Spirorbis**, Daudin, &c.\n\nTentacles six in number, resembling palpes.\n\nThe Spirorbis form an extensive genus, the species of which are distinguished by their shells.\n\nThe classification of the Vermes, as we have before observed, is so very imperfectly understood, that the above enumeration of the genera can be of use only to the student.\n\nThe other genera formed by Montagu and Fleming, will be given in the article <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZOOLOGY\">Zoology</a>, their situation in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> not having been determined by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of the animals.\n\n(v.)\n\n### INDEX OF GENERA\n\n| Page | Page | Page | Page |\n|------|------|------|------|\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACARUS\">Acarus</a> | 444 | Anthura | 427

The very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a>, who draws from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISHING\">fishing</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> hunting a precarious support for himself and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, is eager, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> his return home, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNT\">count</a> over the produce of his toilsome exertions. But the leader of a troop is obliged to carry farther his skill in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMERATION\">numeration</a>. The systematic practice of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-WAR\">war</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> has ever distinguished our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> from other animals of prey. The chieftain who prepares to attack a rival <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a>, marshals his followers; and, after the bloody conflict has terminated, he reckons up the slain, and marks his unhappy and devoted captives. If those numbers were small, they could easily be represented by very portable emblems, by round <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEBBLES\">pebbles</a>, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DWARF\">dwarf</a>-shells, by fine nuts, by hard grains, by small beans, or by knots tied on a string. But to express the larger numbers, it became necessary, for the sake of distinctness, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> those little objects or counters in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> rows, which the eye could comprehend at a single glance; as, in the telling of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, it would soon have become customary to dispose the rude counters, in two, three, four, or more ranks, as circumstances might suggest. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> would then be less distracted, resting chiefly on the number of marks presented by each separate row.\n\nLanguage insensibly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOULDS\">moulds</a> itself to our wants. But it was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to furnish a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> for each particular number: No <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> could supply such a multitude of words as would be necessary, and no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> could ever retain them. The only practical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of proceeding was to have recourse, as on other occasions, to the powers of classification. By conceiving the individuals of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> to be distributed into successive ranks and divisions, a few component terms might be made sufficient to express the whole. We may discern around us traces, accordingly, of the progress of numeration, through all its gradations.\n\nThe earliest and simplest mode of reckoning was by pairs, arising naturally from the circumstance of both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> being employed for the sake of expedition. It is now familiar among sportsmen, who use the names of brace and couple, words that signify pairing or yoking.\u2014To count by threes was another step, though not practised to the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>. It has been preserved, how-\never, by the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a> of men, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEASH\">leash</a>, meaning the strings by which three dogs and no more can be held at once in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>.\u2014The numbering by fours has had a more extensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a>: It was evidently suggested by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>, in rapid tale, of taking a pair in each hand. Our fishermen, who generally reckon in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CALL\">call</a> every double pair of herrings, for instance, a throw or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a>; and the term <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-WARP\">warp</a>, which, from its German origin, has exactly the same import, is employed to denote four, in various <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol8.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of trade.\n\nThose simple arrangements would, at their first application, carry the reckoning but a very little way. To express larger numbers, it was necessary to repeat the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of classification. The ordinary steps, by which language ascends from particular to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> objects, might point out the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> path. A collection of individuals forms a species; a cluster of species makes a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENUS\">genus</a>; a bundle of genera composes an order; and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUP\">group</a> of orders perhaps constitutes a class. Such is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> indispensably required in framing the successive arrangement of the almost unbounded subjects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">Natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a>. A similar mode is pursued in the subdivision and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a> of the members of a vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>.\n\nIn following out the classification of numbers, it seemed easy and natural, after the first step had been made, to repeat the same procedure. If a heap of pebbles were disposed in certain rows, it would evidently facilitate their enumeration, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> each of those rows into similar parcels, and thus carry forward the successive subdivision till it stopped. The heap, so analysed by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of partition, might then be expressed with a very few low numbers easily formed, and capable of being distinctly retained. The particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> adopted, would soon become clothed with terms borrowed from the vernacular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IDIOM\">idiom</a>.\n\nLet us endeavour to trace the steps by which a child or a savage, prompted by native curiosity, would proceed in classing, for instance, thirty-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> similar objects. He might be conceived first to arrange them by successive pairs. Selecting thirty-nine of the smallest shells or grains he could find, he would dispose these in two rows, each containing nineteen counters, with one over. Having thus reduced the number to nineteen, he might subdivide this again, by representing only one of the rows with shells twice as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> as before. He would consequently obtain two rows of nine each, with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a> of one. Instead of these shells, were he to employ shells of a double <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIZE\">size</a>, it would be sufficient to denote one of the rows, or to dispose it into two rows. These rows contain only four counters with one over. Again, by adopting counters of a double size, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> row might be represented by one pair, each containing only two marks exactly. These again could be denoted by a single pair of counters, having twice the former dimensions. As a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a>, one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTER\">counter</a>, of double dimensions, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> express the last row.\u2014Hence the number thirty-nine, decomposed by repeated pairing, would be denoted by one counter of the sixth order, one of the third, one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, and another of the first.\n\nSuppose a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> should attempt to represent the same number, by triple rows of shells or counters. He would first have thirteen of the smallest shells in each row, and no more. Then, expressing one of the rows by shells of three times the size or value, it would be again resolved into three rows, each containing four counters, with an excess of one. Taking the last of these rows, therefore, and employing counters of triple size, it would be represented by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> of single counters, with one over. Finally, this column would be marked by a single tripled counter.\u2014The number thirty-nine is thus expressed, on the system of triplication, by a counter of the fourth order, one of the third, and another of the second.\n\nLastly, conceive the number thirty-nine to be reckoned by double pairs or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRUPLE\">quadruple</a> rows. Each row would then contain only nine counters, with an excess of three. But a single row would express the same as all these four, if each counter in it were changed into another of quadruple size or value; and, consequently, this row might be again distributed into four ranks, each consisting of only two marks, with one left. Retain one of these ranks, and substitute counters of quadruple effect, and two such will express the whole amount.\u2014Hence thirty-nine, analysed by the system of double pairs or warps, would be represented by two counters of the third order, one of the second, and three of the first.\n\nIn the ruder periods of society, a gradation of counters, accommodated to such a process of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMERICAL\">numerical</a> analysis, was supplied by pebbles, grains, or shells of different sizes. This series, however, is very limited, and would soon confine the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANGE\">range</a> of decomposition. To reach a greater extent, it was necessary to proceed by a swifter analysis; to distribute the counters, for instance, successively into ten or twenty rows, and to make pebbles, shells, or other marks, having their size only doubled perhaps or tripled, to represent values increased ten or twenty\nBeyond this stage in the progress of numeration, none of the various tribes dispersed over the vast American Continent seem ever to have passed. In the Old World, it is probable that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PAUSE\">pause</a> of improvement had ensued among the nations which were advanced to the same point in the arts of life. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a>, in such arithmetical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOTATION\">notation</a>, of employing the natural objects to signify a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> more than their relative size imports, would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> at last to a most important step in the ascent. Instead of distinguishing the different orders of counters by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a>, they might be made to derive an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> value from their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> alone. It would be sufficient, for that purpose, to employ marks all of the same kind, but disposed on a graduating series of vertical bars or columns. The augmented value which these marks acquire in rising through the successive bars, would evidently be quite arbitrary, depending, in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KEY\">key</a> to be fixed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVENTION\">convention</a>. This point in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a> of discovery was attained by the Greeks at a very early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, and communicated to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>, during their whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CAREER\">career</a> of empire, to practise a sort of tangible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ARITHMETIC\">arithmetic</a>, which they transmitted to their successors in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. The Chinese also have, from the remotest antiquity, been accustomed to employ a similar mode of calculation, which they are said to manage with singular skill and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a>.\n\nResuming, therefore, the number thirty-nine; if it were distributed by successive pairing, it would be thus denoted on a series of six vertical bars.\n\nThe same number, decomposed by a repeated trisection, will assume a simpler appearance, being comprised in four bars.\n\nBut thirty-nine, when analysed by a succession of double pairs, would require for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> six counters arranged on three bars.\n\nSuppose the objects to be reckoned were so numerous, that one hundred and sixty-five counters might be required to represent them. Placed in a single row, these counters would only give the very confused idea of multitude. But, if counted by pairs, or divided into two rows of eighty-two each, with an odd one, they would become a little more distinct. Were every counter now, in each row to denote a pair, a single row of them would have the power of both. Let this row be reckoned again by pairs, and it will change into two higher rows, each consisting of forty-one counters, without any excess. But one of these third rows would be sufficient alone, if each counter in it were esteemed equal to a pair in the second rows, or equal to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUPLICATE\">duplicate</a> pair, or four in the first row. Again, tell one of the third rows over by pairs, and the forty-one counters will be converted into two fourth rows, containing twenty each, and one over. In like manner, each counter of a fourth row, being conceived equal to a pair in the third row, or a triplicate pair, that is, eight on the first row, a Palpable single row, including twenty of those higher counters, would have the same effect. Now, this twenty would be reduced to a pair of rows of ten counters each. Let each counter in the fifth row have the power of two in the fourth row, or of a quadruplicate pair, or sixteen in the first row; and ten such counters would be sufficient. But ten would give five pairs of sixth rows, one of which might denote the whole, if each counter in it were held equal to two in the preceding row, or to a quintuplicate pair, or thirty-two on the first row. Again, the last five counters would be divided into two pairs and one counter, and these two pairs into a single pair of a higher order.\n\nThis analysis appears tedious when so detailed, but it would proceed with great ease and rapidity in practice. The number one hundred and sixty-five would, therefore, on the system of successive pairings, be expressed by one septuplicate pair, one quintuplicate pair, one duplicate pair, and one. The language seems very uncouth, merely from its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a> and inaptness to our idiom; but its elements are extremely clear and simple. If a few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol7.html#article-COGNATE\">cognate</a> words had been devised to express the several combinations of pairs, or the ascending <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a> of the powers of two; it would have removed every objection.\n\nThis arrangement, whereby a number is analysed into certain elements by the operation of distributing it and its sections into successive pairs or duads, may be called the Binary Scale, of which two is the root or index. This scale, resting on so narrow a basis, expands slowly, and is therefore not very fit for expressing large numbers by words. But it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> adapted for the simplicity of emblematic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXHIBITION\">exhibition</a>. Suppose marks or counters were placed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> rows or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> bars, proceeding from the right hand to the left, such that a counter on any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> should be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to two laid on the bar immediately before it. Instead of putting the hundred and sixty-five counters on the first bar, it would be the same thing to leave one on that bar, and place eighty-two on the next. But instead of eighty-two counters on the second bar, the effect would be the same, to pass over it, and put forty-one on the third bar. Counting these forty-one also by pairs, we should leave one on the third bar, and carry twenty to the next. But twenty divided into successive pairs, would leave the fourth and fifth bars vacant, and throw five on the next. The five again would, after bisection, leave one on the sixth bar, and transfer two to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEVENTH\">seventh</a>; or, passing over this, they would carry one to the eighth bar. The decomposition thus effected would appear as below; where only four counters, and as many blanks, are sufficient to exhibit the number one hundred and sixty-five. By this elementary arrangement, a very distinct idea is conveyed: The eye can easily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CATCH\">catch</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a>, and the memory preserve it.\n\n**BINARY SCALE**\n\nA similar effect would be produced, though much less clearly, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of strokes, or of Runic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCULPTURE\">sculpture</a>, as thus represented.\nThe advantages of the binary scale of notation were prodigiously extolled by the celebrated Leibnitz, who condescended even to write a discourse on its use and mode of adaptation. This very learned, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a>, and indefatigable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>, had the satisfaction to discover, from the researches of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> Missionaries, and particularly from the letters of Father Bouvet, some feeble traces of the Binary Notation in the early history of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHINA\">China</a>. Fou-hi, the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">Emperor</a> and founder of that vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONARCHY\">monarchy</a>, is venerated in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EAST\">East</a> as a promoter of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">Geometry</a>, and the inventor of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>, the knowledge of which has been since lost. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMBLEM\">emblem</a> of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCCULT\">occult</a> science consists of eight separate clusters of three parallel lines or trigrams, drawn one above another, after the Chinese manner of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>, and represented either entire or broken in the middle. Those varied trigrams were called Koua or suspended symbols, from the circumstance of their being exposed in the public places. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of such varied clusters, it was not difficult for the sagacity of Leibnitz to perceive the application of the Binary Scale carried only to three ranks, or as far as the number eight. The entire lines signify one, two, or four, according to their order, while the broken lines are void, and serve merely to indicate the rank of the others. Before this invention, the only mode of reckoning used in China was by knots tied on a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CORD\">cord</a>. In Plate XXVII. the Emperor is figured, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTING\">pointing</a> with a stylus at the two-fold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROGRESSION\">progression</a>; being copied exactly from the third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the M\u00e9moires sur les Chinois, omitting only the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GROTESQUE\">grotesque</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PORTRAIT\">portrait</a> of the Sage. Those emblems were besides intended to convey a store of mystical or mythological knowledge. In the trigrams of Fou-hi, the pious and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORTHODOX\">orthodox</a> Missionaries could not fail to discover certain edifying traces of the mystery of the Trinity, at an epoch perhaps as remote as that of the Deluge.\n\nThe next Emperor, Chen-noung, devoted his attention chiefly to the improvement of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>. But he likewise extended the Kona or the dualic system of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREDECESSOR\">predecessor</a>, employing hexagrams instead of trigrams. These hexagrams were formed with six parallel lines, broken or entire, and placed one above the other. In short, they were the first six bars of the binary scale, of which the last term would represent thirty-two, and all the terms together would reach to sixty-four. Chen-noung contrived that the hexagrams should likewise exhibit sixty-four varieties of combination, by placing them in eight rays issuing from the same central space which was occupied by one of the eight trigrams. See M\u00e9moires sur les Chinois, Tome II. p. 189, Planche viii.\n\nThe Ternary Scale of numeration, which reckons by successive threes or triads, advances with more speed. Thus, suppose, as before, that one hundred and sixty-five were to be exhibited on it. Counted by threes, or, in the sportsman's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHRASE\">phrase</a>, by leashes, no counter would be left on the first bar, but fifty-five thrown to the next bar or that of the simple triads. These fifty-five counters, being again told by threes, would leave one on the second bar, and carry eighteen to the third bar, or that of duplicate triads. This eighteen, counted twice in succession, would pass over the fourth and fifth bars, and throw two marks to sixth bar, or that of quintuple triads. The original number so decomposed, might therefore be denominated two quintuple triads, and one single triad. It is denoted by three counters, as in the form here annexed.\n\nThe number might likewise be readily expressed, though less perfectly, by combined strokes or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>.\n\nIt is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> that the Ternary Scale, though more powerful than the Binary, requires two sets of marks or counters. In the example now taken, each counter on the ascending bars represents three, nine, twenty-seven, or eighty-one; and the number itself is consequently split into two eighty-ones and three.\n\nLet still the same number be arranged on the Quaternary Scale which proceeds by Fours or Tetrad. One hundred and sixty-five, told over by double pairs or warps, would leave one counter on the first bar, and carry forty-one to the next. This forty-one again, reckoned by warps or throws, would drop one counter on the second bar, and transfer ten counters to the third bar. The ten being now counted, would leave two counters on the next bar, and carry two to the fourth bar. The original number would therefore be described as containing two triplicate tetrads, two duplicate tetrads, one tetrad and one; and it would be designated in this manner:\n\nOr, if the less satisfactory mode of strokes were employed, one hundred and sixty-five would be thus exhibited.\n\nThis number is analysed into twice sixty-four, twice sixteen, four, and one. Three sets of counters would evidently be required to fit this scale for its application.\n\nThe Quaternary Scale may be considered as a reduplication of the Binary, each bar of the former comprising two bars of the latter. This effect will appear more conspicuous by comparing the same number as it was exhibited on both scales. It is alleged that the Guaranis and Lulos, two of the very lowest races of savages which inhabit the boundless forests of South <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>, count only by fours; at least that they express five by four and one, six by four and two, and so forth. We may gather from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>, that a certain tribe of Thracians were accustomed to use the quaternary scale of numeration; for he says that they proceeded no farther than four.*\n\n*Mosse \u1f00\u03bd \u03b4\u03b5\u03ba\u03b1\u03c0\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f48\u03c1\u03c7\u03b1\u03af\u03c9\u03bd \u03b3\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03a4\u0395\u03a4\u03a4\u0391\u03a0\u0391. Arist. Problemata. xv. 3.\nwhich they would doubtless continue to repeat. If such was the historical fact, those simple people must have never advanced beyond the early practice of reckoning successively by casts or warps. It seems probable that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYTHAGORAS\">Pythagoras</a> was acquainted with the quaternary system, which he brought from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>. Hence perhaps the mystical veneration which the followers of that philosopher professed to entertain for the tetractys or quaternion, the root of the scale, which contains besides, within itself, the number denoting the elementary musical proportions. Near the end of the seventeenth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, Weigelius seriously proposed, in Germany, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADOPTION\">adoption</a> of the Tetractys or Quaternary numeration, which he explained, with copious detail, in a learned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> entitled Aretologistica.*\n\nTo advance a step farther, let the same number be represented on the Quinary Scale, which reckons by the series of fives or pentads. Classed in this way, it would pass over the first bar, and throw thirty-three counters to the second. Told over again, it would leave three counters on the second bar, and carry six to the third; and the six, reckoned by fives, would drop one counter on the third bar, and advance one to the next. One hundred and sixty-five would therefore be denominated one triplicate pentad, one duplicate pentad, and three single pentads; and it would be thus denoted:\n\nThis number might also be exhibited on the same scale by the combination of strokes with dots:\n\nBy this classification, the number one hundred and sixty-five is divided into one hundred and twenty-five, twenty-five, and three fives. The root or index of the scale being five, it would require four sets of counters to adapt it for practice.\n\nThe first bar of the Quinary Scale is actually used in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> among traders. In reckoning articles delivered, the person who takes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of the tale, having traced a long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> line, continues to draw, alternately above and below it, a warp or four vertical strokes, each set of which he crosses by an oblique score, and generally, we believe, calls out <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TALLY\">tally</a>! as often as the number five is completed.\n\nThe Quinary system has its foundation in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, being evidently derived from the practice of counting over the fingers of one hand. It appears accordingly, at a certain stage of society, to have been adopted among different nations. Thus, the Omaguas and the Zanucas of South America reckon generally by fives, which they call hands. The Toupinambos, a most ferocious and warlike <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> that inhabit the wilds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRAZIL\">Brazil</a>, would seem, according to the relation of Lery, to use the same kind of numeration. To denominate six, seven, and eight, those tribes only join to the word hand, the names for one, two, and three. The same mode, as we learn from Mungo <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-PARK\">Park</a>, is practised by some African nations; particularly the Yolofs and Foulahs, who designate ten by two hands, fifteen by three hands, and so progressively. The Quinary Numeration seems likewise, at a former period, to have obtained in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a>, for the word pentcha, which denotes five, is obviously derived from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RADICAL\">radical</a> term pendji, signifying a hand.\n\nWhen the index of the scale is larger, it often becomes inconvenient to place so many counters as are wanted on the same bar. But this notation may be abridged in the case where the index is even, by adopting a counter of greater dimensions, to signify the half of it. Suppose one hundred and sixty-five to be disposed in the Senary Scale, which proceeds by successive sixes or hextads. Parted into six rows, that number would leave three counters on the first bar, and cast twenty-seven to the next; this twenty-seven, being reckoned by sixes, would drop three counters on the second bar, and transfer four to the third bar. The original number would hence be described as four duplicate hextads, three single hextads, and three. But instead of placing three counters on the first and second bars, and four on the third bar, one large counter may supply the place of three; as in the form here annexed.\n\nThe Senary arrangement has few advantages to recommend it; yet it seems at one period to have been adopted in China, at the mandate of the Emperor Che-hoang-ti. This capricious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRANT\">tyrant</a>, who murdered the literati and burnt their books, having conceived an astrological fancy for the number six, commanded this to be used in all concerns of business or learning throughout his vast Empire. He directed a sort of arithmetic to be composed, with six for its basis; and he enjoined, that all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-WEIGHTS_AND_MEASURES\">weights and <a class</a>=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> should be arranged on the same scale. He divided China into six times six, or thirty-six, provinces; and was so much enamoured of this favourite number, as to order his chariot to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> six feet long, and to be drawn by six horses, with only six attendants.\n\n* This writer even goes so far as to invent names for the several orders of his Tetractys System. They will appear to have a sufficiently German <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, though not harsher than the terms we now use.\n\nSecond Order, or 4, - Erff.\nThird Order, or 16, - Zwerrf.\nFourth Order, or 64, - Secht.\nFifth Order, or 256, - Schock.\n\nSixth Order, or 1024, - Erff Schock.\nSeventh Order, or 4096, - Secht Schock.\nEighth Order, or 16384, - Schock mahl schock.\n\nWeigelii, Aretologistica vel Logistica Virtutum Genetrix. Norimbergae, 1687.\nLet this Octary Scale, which proceeds by successive eights or octads, be treated in a similar way. The original number, being reckoned by eights, would leave five counters on the first bar; and throw twenty to the next; and this twenty being told over again by eights, would leave four counters on the second bar, and carry two to the third. If, therefore, the large counter signify half the index, or four, one hundred and sixty-five will be thus denoted:\n\nThe number is denominated two duplicate octads, four single octads, and five; and it has been decomposed into two sixty-fours, four eights, and five.\n\nSuppose now that the Denary Scale of Notation were employed. The same number, reckoned by tens or decades, would leave five counters on the first bar, and cast sixteen to the next bar; which, being told again, would leave six counters on the second bar, and carry one to the third. This arrangement furnishes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DENOMINATION\">denomination</a> of one duplicate decad, six single decades, and five; which is simpler than any of the former appellations, and yet it sounds uncouth, owing merely to our want of familiarity with the terms. It would be marked in this way:\n\nWe are thus conducted by successive advances to that system of numeration which has prevailed among all civilized nations, and become incorporated with the very structure of language. This almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> consent clearly bespeaks the influence of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> principle. Nor is it difficult to perceive that the arrangement of numbers by tens would naturally flow from the practice so familiar in the earlier periods of society\u2014that of counting by the fingers on both hands. Aristotle in his Queries points at this origin, but with a less decided <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TONE\">tone</a> than might have been expected from him. The philosopher even hints at other concurring causes, some of which appear to be very fanciful. Such, for instance, is his conjecture, that the root of the denary scale might be derived from the summation of the numbers one, two, three, and four, included in the Pythagorean tetractys. If the original import and composition of the Greek terms \u1f11\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd, \u1f11\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd, \u1f11\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd, and \u03bc\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 for ten, a hundred, a thousand, and ten thousand, could be safely traced, we might discern the influence of the denary system in the formation of those words. The Roman terms for numerals proceed not farther than mille, a thousand; but they are evidently of the same family, with some of the slighter modifications.\n\nBut the origin of the names imposed on the radical numbers, appears most conspicuously <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> in the nakedness of the savage dialects. The Muyseca Indians, who formerly occupied the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> of Bogota in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of Grenada, were accustomed to reckon first as far as ten, which they called quihicha or a foot, meaning no doubt the number of toes on both feet, with which they commonly went bare and exposed; and, beyond this number, they used terms equivalent to foot one, foot two, &c., corresponding to twelve, thirteen, &c. Another tribe, who likewise inhabits South America, the Sabiconos, call ten, the root of the scale, tunca, and repeat only the same word, to signify an hundred and a thousand, the former being termed tunca-tunca; and the latter tunca-tunca-tunca.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ETYMOLOGY\">Etymology</a>, guided by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, furnishes a sure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> for disclosing the monuments of early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a>, preserved though disguised, in the structure of language. Our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIALECT\">dialect</a> as immediately derived from its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOTHIC\">Gothic</a> stem, betrays a composition not less rude or expressive than the simple articulation of the Sabiconos. According to the authorities collected by a celebrated German philologist, the late very laborious and accurate Aedelung, the word eleven was most anciently written ciilif or ciilicin, being compounded of ei or one and the verb liban, to leave, and therefore signified merely one, leave; that is, retain one, and set aside no doubt ten, the root of the scale. Twelve has the same etymon. The names twenty, thirty, forty, &c., have the terminating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYLLABLE\">syllable</a> ty, which corresponds to zig in German, and zig or zuch among the oldest writers of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a> tongue. This termination is derived from the verb ziehen, to draw, and hence twenty means simply two drawings, thirty, three drawings, &c., intimating evidently, that so many tens are separated from the heap. The term hundred, which also runs unvaried through all the filiations of the Gothic, is formed of hund, which anciently signified only ten, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> or ret, a participle from the verb recitan, to reckon or place in rows: The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> would therefore intimate as much as ten times told, that is the reduplication of ten, or ten added ten times.\n\nIn the Gothic Translation of the Gospels made by Ulphilas, in the fourth century, one hundred is expressed by tackund tackund, or the word for ten merely doubled; exactly like the tunca tunca of the Sabiconos of South America. But in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANGLO_SAXON\">Anglo-Saxon</a> version, which was made about three centuries later, one hundred is denoted by hund teontig, meaning ten of ten drawings. In the same curious monument of our early language, hund seafontig, or ten of\n\n---\n\n*\u0394\u03b9\u1f70 \u03c4\u03af \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u1f00\u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9 \u1f51\u03c0\u1f78 \u0392\u03b1\u03b2\u03c5\u03bb\u1ff6\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f10\u03ba \u1f00\u03bb\u03b7\u03b8\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f10\u03be \u1f21\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b4\u03b9\u03ce\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9, \u1f22 \u1f10\u03ba \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bb\u03b7\u03b8\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f10\u03be \u1f21\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03b9\u03ce\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9, \u1f22 \u1f10\u03ba \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bb\u03b7\u03b8\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f10\u03be \u1f21\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03b9\u03ce\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9, \u1f22 \u1f10\u03ba \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bb\u03b7\u03b8\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f10\u03be \u1f21\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03b9\u03ce\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9, \u1f22 \u1f10\u03ba \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bb\u03b7\u03b8\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f10\u03be \u1f21\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03b9\u03ce\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9, \u1f22 \u1f10\u03ba \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bb\u03b7\u03b8\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f10\u03be \u1f21\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03b9\u03ce\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9, \u1f22 \u1f10\u03ba \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bb\u03b7\u03b8\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f10\u03be \u1f21\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03b9\u03ce\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9, \u1f22 \u1f10\u03ba \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bb\u03b7\u03b8\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f10\u03be \u1f21\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03b9\u03ce\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9, \u1f22 \u1f10\u03ba \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bb\u03b7\u03b8\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f10\u03be \u1f21\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03b9\u03ce\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9, \u1f22 \u1f10\u03ba \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bb\u03b7\u03b8\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f10\u03be \u1f21\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03b9\u03ce\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9.* And, after throwing out some loose conjectures, he subjoins: \"*\u1f21 \u1f41\u03c4\u1f76 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u1f51\u03c0\u03ae\u03c1\u03c7\u03b1\u03bd \u1f00\u03b8\u03c1\u03bf\u03af\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2, \u1f10\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03ad\u03c2 \u03b4\u03ad\u03ba\u03b1 \u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03cd\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2; \u1f45\u03c4\u03b9 \u1f10\u03bd \u1f11\u03c0\u03c4\u03ac\u03c2 \u1f10\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03ad\u03c2 \u03c4\u1ff7 \u03b5\u1f30\u03ba\u03b1\u03af \u1f00\u03c1\u03b9\u03b8\u03bc\u03bf\u1fe6, \u03c4\u1ff7 \u03c4\u1ff7 \u03c0\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1 \u1f00\u03c1\u03b9\u03b8\u03bc\u03bf\u1fe6.\" Arist. Problemata xv. 3.\nIt seems probable, that *hund* and *ten* or *teon* were only variations of the same word. The term *thousand* is merely an abbreviation of *divis-hund*, its earliest form. The prefix *divis* is the same as the word *twice*, and *hund* was probably contracted for *one hundred*. The combined expression would, therefore, signify a redoubled hundred, or one hundred repeated ten times.\n\nIt is remarkable that the Peruvian language was actually richer in the names for numerals than the polished dialects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Rome or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>. The Romans, we have seen, went not farther than *mille*, a thousand; and the Greeks made no distinctive word beyond *myriar*, or ten thousand. But, the inhabitants of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-PERU\">Peru</a>, under the Incas, following the Denary System, had the term *hue*, to denote one; *chacan*, ten; *pachae*, one hundred; *huarancay*, a thousand; and *hunu*, a million. These words are either original, or have been formed, like our numerical terms, by the abbreviation of certain compound expressions.\n\nPhilosophers, from Aristotle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to Locke, have too hastily given <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> to the vague reports of travelers, concerning the very scanty knowledge which savages possess of the art of numeration. Even the cautious and discriminating historian Dr Robertson, thinks himself warranted to conclude, from authorities which he quotes, that certain tribes of native Americans could reckon no further than ten; or perhaps twenty, while others advanced not beyond three. But, it is utterly repugnant to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONGRUITY\">congruity</a>, to suppose that any people should be found so destitute of mental faculties, as not to rise above those low numbers. It seems far more probable, that such numbers were merely the roots of the systems of classification adopted by the several tribes, and mistaken by unphilosophical travellers for the whole extent of their numeration. Every savage <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> must surely be supposed capable of reckoning up the bands of warriors which they can bring into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a>, amounting generally to hundreds, and often to thousands.\n\nRoger Williams, one of the earliest settlers of New England, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>, though deeply tinged with the enthusiasm of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, published in 1643, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMALL_KEY\">small Key</a> to the language and manners of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> nations who then surrounded that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANT\">infant</a> colony, in which he gives an ample <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of the numerals employed by the native tribes. It hence appears, that those people used the Denary Scale of arrangement, and had a set of distinct words to express the numbers as far as a thousand, and could even advance as high as one hundred thousand, by help of combined terms. Thus, one they named *niqui*; ten, *piuck*; an hundred, *piwuck*; and a thousand, *mittonug*. But these words are apparently compound, and would doubtless be found to throw much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> on the subject of numeration, if we had any means of analysing them. The same author assures us, that the Indians, employing grains of corn for symbols, were very expert in their computations.\n\nAccording to the testimony of Leems, a respectable Moravian missionary, the Laplanders, in their computations, join very significantly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARDINAL\">cardinal</a> to the ordinal numbers. Thus, to express eleven and twelve, they say *auft nubbe lokkai*, and *gouft nubbe lokkai*; that is, one to the second ten, and two to the second ten. In like manner, to signify twenty-one and twenty-two, those rude people use the expression *auft gouft nubbe lokkai*; and *gouft gouft nubbe lokkai*, meaning one added to the third ten, and two added to the third ten. This procedure affords a curious and very happy illustration of the principle of numeral arrangement.\n\nThe Duodenary System of arrangement was introduced at a more advanced stage of society. It plainly drew its origin from the observation of the celestial phenomena, there being twelve months or lunations commonly reckoned in a solar year. The Romans adopted that index, to mark their subdivision of the unit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> or of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>. They distinguished the foot into three hand-breaths or palms, and each palm into four lengths of the thumb-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGIT\">digit</a>; and, in like manner, they first bisected the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POUND\">pound</a>, next bisected this again, and then divided the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> into three final portions. The twelfth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of a foot and that of a pound were alike termed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNCIA\">uncia</a>, which has branched into the modern words <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a> and ounce, applied more discriminately with us to the subdivisions of measure and of weight.\n\nThe mode of reckoning by twelves or dozens has been very generally adopted in the wholesale trade. Nor is its application confined to the first term of the progression; but extends to the second or even the third. Twelve dozen, or an hundred and forty-four, makes the long or great hundred of the Northern Nations, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROSS\">Gross</a> of traders. Twelve times this again, or seventeen hundred and twenty-eight, forms the Double Gross.\n\nLet the same number, one hundred and sixty-five, as before, be reckoned on the Duodenary Scale. It contains thirteen dozen and nine, or one gross one dozen and nine, and consequently, will be represented as here annexed.\n\nNext to the Denary Scale itself, the system of counting by progressive scores or twenties, derived from the same source, appears to have been the most prevalent. The savage who had reckoned the fingers on both hands, and then the toes on both feet, making twenty in all, might seem to have reached the utmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIMIT\">limit</a> of natural calculation. The Guaranis, a very simple and inoffensive tribe, who live on the shores of the Maranon, are accordingly said to proceed no farther in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> numeration. When these people want to signify an hundred, they only place in a row five heaps of maize, each composed of twenty grains. The Mexicans, however, being more advanced in society, were accustomed to employ the higher terms of the same progression, thus combining the Denary with the Binary scales. In the ancient hieroglyphic paintings of that unfortunate race, units, as far as a score, are exhibited by small balls; and twenty is denoted by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, which some authors, and particularly Clavigero, have mistaken for a club, but which was really a small standard or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAG\">flag</a>. In the same curious monuments, twenty scores, or four hun-\nPalpable dred, is signified by a spreading open feather; probably, because the grains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>, lodged in the hollow of a quill, represented, in some places, money or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDIUM\">medium</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a>. This symbol has, from the rudeness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a>, been taken at times for a pine-apple, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-EAR\">ear</a> of maize, or even the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of a spear; but its application to intimate the duplicate scores is certain and invariable. A sack or bag, was also painted by those ingenious people, to represent twenty times twenty scores, or eight thousand. It was of the same form as a purse called xiquipilli, and supposed to hold eight thousand grains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CACAO\">cacao</a>. To avoid the multiplication of the balls, and other symbols, the Mexicans sometimes divided the flag denoting a score by two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> lines, and coloured the one half of it to signify ten, or covered three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of it with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> to mark fifteen. This mode of abbreviating the signs was evidently capable of farther <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a>. Plate XXVII. exhibits the series of Mexican hieroglyphic numerals, copied from Humboldt's splendid work entitled Vues des Cordilleres; and to illustrate their application, we have represented the current year 1816, by help of them, having its circle prefixed as indicating a complete revolution of the four seasons.\n\nTraces of numeration by scores or twenties still exist in the old continent. The expression three score and ten, in our own language, is more venerable than seventy; and the compound quatre-vingts et dix, is the ordinary mode in French for signifying ninety. The Arabians, according to Sylvestre de Sacy, counted no farther than four hundred or twenty scores, before the sixth century of the Hejira, which corresponds to about the middle of the eleventh century of the Christian era. To denote nine hundred, they had recourse to the clumsy expedient of redoubling the alphabetic character of four hundred, and joining to it the character of one hundred. The inhabitants of the province of Biscay, and of Armorica, people descended from the ancient Celts, are said to reckon like the Mexicans, by the powers of twenty, or the terms of progressive scores.\n\nAnother progression, still swifter in its operation than that by scores, and long familiar to Astronomers, was introduced into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALEXANDRIAN\">Alexandrian</a> school by the famous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMY\">Ptolemy</a>, who had the merit of digesting the results of celestial observations into a body of regular science. We allude to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEXAGENARY\">Sexagenary</a> Scale, which proceeds, as its name implies, by the successive powers of Sixty. This arrangement of numbers appears quite artificial, and was no doubt suggested by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of the circle founded on astronomical phenomena. Since the year is composed of twelve months, containing each about thirty days, the round number, three hundred and sixty, was chosen as the most convenient for subdividing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECLIPTIC\">ecliptic</a> into degrees. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RADIUS\">radius</a> of the circle, was naturally employed as a standard for the measuring of lines and arcs in general; and this being nearly the sixth part of the circumference, and comprising, therefore, about sixty degrees, the arcs themselves, or their multiples, when expressed by degrees, came to be reckoned by Sixties. The notation was effected by annexing a single dash for Sixty, two dashes for its duplicate, and three dashes for its triplicate.\n\nSince, in the notation by numeral scales, the import of a counter depends on the position of the bar on which it stands, any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> of the place of units must produce a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> change on the value of the whole amount of an expression. Thus, in the binary classification, the shifting of the bar of units one place lower, would, in effect, double all the preceding terms, and a second shift would double these again. In like manner, to carry the beginning of the scale a bar lower would, in the denary system, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> the units into tens, the tens into hundreds, and the hundreds into thousands; thus augmenting the whole tenfold. On the contrary, if the units were moved to a bar higher, the amount of any expression, would, in the binary scale, be reduced to one-half, and, in the denary, to the tenth part of its former value. Hence, to multiply or divide by the index of any scale or its powers, we have only to change the names of the bars, or to shift the place of the units.\n\nThe systems of progressive numeration are as well adapted to represent a descending as an ascending series; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> which greatly facilitates and simplifies the exhibition of fractions. Suppose, for example, it were sought to express eleven-sixteenths on the Binary Scale. Since a counter depressed by four bars will signify only the sixteenth of its original value, so eleven, reckoning upwards from the low bar, will express the value required.\n\nBut the analysis of the fraction might be performed otherwise. It is evident, that eleven-sixteenths on the first bar, or the bar of units, are only equivalent to twenty-two such parts, that is, one counter and sixteen-sixteenths, placed on the next descending bar. This excess again corresponds to twelve parts on the second bar, or twenty-four carried to the third bar, making one counter and eight-sixteenths. But these eight-sixteenths are equivalent to a whole counter on the fourth bar, where the exhibition stops. Hence the fraction proposed appears to consist of one-half, one-eighth, and one-sixteenth.\n\nOn the Quaternary Scale, this fraction would require only two bars, since sixteen is only the second power of the index four.\n\nBut the second mode of decomposition is, on the whole, simpler. The eleven-sixteenths of a counter on the bar of units, are equivalent to forty-four, or two counters, and twelve such parts on the next bar; and these twelve-sixteenths correspond to forty-eight, which compose three entire counters on the third bar. The original fraction is thus analysed into two-fourths and three-sixteenths.\n\nTo express the fraction on the Senary Scale, more bars are wanted. It is now equivalent, on the bar immediately after that of units, to sixty-six-sixteenths, or four counters and two parts. This small excess corresponds to twelve on the third bar, or seventy-two on the fourth bar, making four counters and eight\nThe fraction is thus resolved into four-sixths, four-two-hundred and sixteenths, and three-twelve-hundred and ninety-sixths.\n\nLet the same fraction be represented on the Denary Scale. It might be found, that sixteen, multiplied by six hundred and twenty-five, produces ten thousand, or the fourth power of the index, ten. Wherefore eleven times six hundred and twenty-five, or six thousand, eight hundred and seventy-five, reckoned upwards from the fourth bar; below the rank of units, will denote the fraction proposed.\n\nBut the expression of this fraction on the descending scale is more easily and directly obtained, by the process of successive decomposition. Ten times eleven sixteenths, or one hundred and ten parts on the bar immediately below the units, make six counters and fourteen parts. These fourteen parts are equivalent to one hundred and forty parts, or eight counters and twelve parts on the third bar. This excess again gives one hundred and twenty parts, or seven counters and eight parts, for the fourth bar. And lastly, these remaining eight parts are represented by five counters placed on the fifth bar. The fraction eleven sixteenths is thus analysed into sixteenths, eight-hundredths, seven-thousandths, and five-ten-thousandths.\n\nThere is not the same facility, however, in decomposing all fractions, and reducing them to the terms of a descending scale. It often happens that the expressions for these will run through many bars, or even maintain a perpetual circulation, without ever drawing to a termination. Suppose, for example, that four sevenths were to be represented on the Binary Scale: It would correspond to eight-sevenths, or a counter and one part of the second bar; which excess would be equivalent to two parts on the third bar; four on the fourth, eight, or a counter and one part on the fifth bar. This bar would therefore leave out the same portion as the second bar; and consequently the notation would be continually repeated at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> of three bars.\n\nIt is curious to remark with regard to the present example, that if the expression on the Denary Scale were multiplied by any number whatever, the same counters, and after the same order, would always appear to occupy the inferior bars: Thus, when doubled, it will assume this form, commencing like the fourth bar of the single expression.\nIf the expression for four-sevenths be tripled, it will show the same aspect, only beginning at the third bar:\n\nA little reflection will discover the case to be an unexpected result. Since the perpetual succession of six bars, or only one less than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DENOMINATOR\">denominator</a>, was necessary to represent the value of the given fraction; it follows, that every possible remainder arising from the repeated subdivision or decomposition by seven, must have some corresponding bar from which the same recurrence will take place. Thus, in the analysis of four-sevenths, the remainders on the successive bars were five, one, three, two, four and six; and consequently every fraction having seven for its denominator would belong to one of these.\n\nTo reduce a fraction to any descending scale, may therefore prove a tedious, and often impossible task. But the converted expression approximates rapidly to its true value, and a very few terms will be sufficient for every practical use. The numerical scales are thus equally fitted by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> for ascending or descending,\u2014whether for exhibiting huge multitudes or the minutest subdivision of parts. But men were, in general, very slow to perceive or to avail themselves of this most valuable though distinguishing property of such progressions. The Chinese are the only people who have for ages been accustomed to employ the descending terms of the Denary Scale, or to reckon by Decimal parts in all their commercial transactions. The same uniform system directs the whole subdivision of their weights and measures; an advantage of the highest importance, since it gives to the calculations of those ingenious traders the utmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of simplicity and readiness. The natives of India, who have so long been acquainted with the use of the Denary Scale of numeration, are yet ignorant of its application to denote fractions. Below the place of unity they change the rate of progression, and descend merely by a continued bisection, adopting successively the half, the fourth, the eighth, and the sixteenth; beyond which partition they seldom advance.\n\nPtolemy, and succeeding Astronomers, having adopted the Sexagenary Scale in their measures and calculations of the lines about a circle, likewise employed its descending terms to express the fractional parts. This sexagesimal subdivision, called sometimes logistic arithmetic, is still retained in expressing arcs by degrees, minutes, and seconds; though it has at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> been superseded by the decimal system, in the exhibition of chords, or of the sines and tangents which came to displace these in the modern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIGONOMETRY\">Trigonometry</a>. Nor was the latter improvement embraced, or even contemplated at once. The Arabs, though well acquainted with the advantages of the Denary Scale, appeared satisfied with the sexagenary numeration derived from their Greek instructors. The great restorer of mathematical science in Europe, George Purbach of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIENNA\">Vienna</a>, a man of original and extensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a>, who died at an early age in 1462, in the tables for sines which he computed to every ten minutes of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRANT\">quadrant</a>, distinguished the radius into six hundred thousand parts; thus blending the sexagesimal with the decimal notation. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a> and successor, John M\u00fcller, commonly styled Regiomontanus from K\u00f6nigsberg, the name of his place of birth, after some hesitation laid aside this subdivision of the radius in 1464, and enlarged it to a million of parts, having recalculated the sines, and likewise joined to them tables of tangents. But his work lay many years after his decease in manuscript, and was not printed until 1533. A very long period still elapsed before mathematicians were trained to the use of decimals. Simon Stevinus, a celebrated Flemish geometer and engineer, was the first who composed, in 1582, a distinct treatise on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of those fractions.\n\nWe might suppose that the properties of the Denary Scale, whether in ascending or descending, would soon be discerned and reduced to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> practice. But the use of fractions is associated with a more advanced state of society. Men very seldom take large and connected views of things; they generally grope their way step by step, as actual wants and circumstances chance to direct them. In the subdivision of the unit, they have often proceeded by bisection, sometimes by trisection, and frequently by joining together these modes, or combining them with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECIMATION\">decimation</a>. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> and unsteady procedure is apparent in our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISSECTION\">dissection</a> of weights and measures. The simplest division is that of halving, which seems very naturally to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> from the competition between seller and buyer.\u2014Our dry measure is, accordingly, broken down by a series of bisections. Thus, the chaldron is divided by a redoubled bisection into four quarters, each of these by a triple bisection into eight bushels, each of these again by a redoubled bisection into four pecks, each peck bisected into two gallons, each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GALLON\">gallon</a> by a redoubled bisection divided into four quarts, and each of these bisected into two pints. The avoirdupois weight, which is the sort generally used in business, appears both to ascend and descend, from a common point. The pound is divided by a quadruple bisection into sixteen ounces, and each of these again into sixteen drams. But were it desired that a hundred pounds should constitute the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUINTAL\">quintal</a>, this would be reduced, by a successive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTERING\">quartering</a>, to six and a fraction. Wherefore the nearest round number, seven, was taken, which being doubled gives fourteen pounds for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> of horseman's weight, and this doubled again makes twenty-eight for the quarter, which consequently furnishes one hundred and twelve pounds for the nominal hundred weight. Twenty times this composes the ton. In the subdivision of money, the progression is still more irregular. The pound is\nPalpable Arithmetic is first divided into twenty shillings, next each of those into twelve pence, and then each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PENNY\">penny</a> into four farthings.\n\nAll the calculations in theoretical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol1.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a> are now conducted invariably on the decimal scale. The same kind of subdivision has, to a certain extent, been introduced, for the sake of its great convenience, into the practice of gauging and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a>-surveying. But we may despair of ever seeing the decimal progression adopted in the general intercourse of society. The French have, indeed, set an example to the rest of Europe, in this case, at least, perfectly harmless, and highly worthy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a>,\u2014by framing a consistent and universal system of measures, weights, and coins, drawn from nature itself, and disposed with admirable simplicity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEGANCE\">elegance</a>. Yet, even in France, that seductive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> has, amidst the collision of opposite views and interests, experienced only a partial success. National <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a>, inflamed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a>, is too often opposed to every species of improvement; and the influence of a country, now shorn of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>, is not likely to extend beyond her own frontiers.\n\nWhen the index of a Numerical Scale is large, the notation may be conveniently abridged, by marking only what counters are wanted to complete any bar, or render its expression equivalent to that of an additional counter placed on the bar immediately before it. Thus, instead of eight counters on a particular bar, it would be sufficient to join one to the preceding bar, and put two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFECTIVE\">defective</a> or open counters in the Denary Scale, or four such counters on the Duodenary Scale. The same mode of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a> is alike applicable to the expression of integers, or of fractions. For the sake of illustration, let some of the former examples be resumed. The number one hundred and sixty-five was thus represented on the Octary Scale; there being one counter, and the substitute for four on the first bar, the same substitute on the second bar, and two counters on the first bar. Now add a counter to the second bar, and lay three open counters on the third bar, and this will be changed into the form annexed.\n\nThis expression again is, by a similar process, converted into another, consisting of three open counters on the first and on the second bar, with three full counters on the third bar. Hence the number proposed, must consist of three duplicate octads, abating three octads and three, or is equal to one hundred and ninety-two, diminished by twenty-seven.\n\nOn the Denary Scale, the same number was denoted as under I. and will be successively changed into two other forms.\n\nThe last expression, therefore, signifies two hundred, abating thirty-five.\n\nAgain, the number one hundred and sixty-five, which, on the Duodenary Scale, stood as annexed, will be reduced to the simpler expression; by changing the three counters, and six on the first bar for three open counters, and an additional counter on the second bar, intimating one gross and two dozens, abating three.\n\nThis method of employing open or deficient counters is applicable likewise to the notation of fractions. Thus, eleven-sixteenths expressed on the Quaternary Scale, may have these three different forms:\n\nOn the Senary Scale this fraction will admit of more varieties:\n\nVOL. I. PART II.\nOn the Denary Scale, this fraction may have its first expression changed, by successive modifications, into a simpler form.\n\nThe fraction four-sevenths, which, on the Denary Scale, formed a perpetual recurrence, may be abbreviated in the same way. The first expression is converted into another more commodious one, by changing the counters that exceed five on any bar into deficient counters.\n\nWe shall now investigate some general properties of those Numerical Scales. Suppose, in the Binary Progression, there was standing but a single counter on a high bar. It is obvious, that this might be removed, and two placed on the inferior bar. But one of these might likewise be removed, and two counters substituted for it on the next bar lower. The same process could be pursued through any number of bars, the removed counters being always marked by a dot, and the one which is finally rejected placed on the outside of the last bar with two dots over it. It hence appears, that one placed on any bar of the Binary Scale, is equal in value to one joined to the sum of a series of units running through all the inferior bars. Thus, in the example now produced, one counter occupying the sixth bar, and therefore indicating the number thirty-two, is equal in effect to one annexed to the sum of sixteen, eight, four, two, and one.\n\nLet similar modifications be introduced into the Ternary Scale. Suppose a single counter to stand by itself, all the rest of the bars being empty. It may be taken away, and three counters substituted for it on the next inferior bar. But one of these may be withdrawn, and three others placed on the following bar: Of this triplet, the undermost might again be removed, and three substituted for it on the next bar. The same process, it is evident, could be repeated, till the change reached the lowest bar, leaving out an excess of one, marked by two dots to signify its being transferred. Hence the single counter on the Ternary Scale is, by successive mutations, converted into two rows of counters extending through all the inferior counters, and leaving an excess of one. Thus the number two hundred and forty-three, the value of a counter placed on the fifth bar of the Ternary Scale, is equal to one added to double the sum of eighty-one, twenty-seven, nine, three, and one, the values of counters occupying all the inferior bars.\n\nIn like manner, if a solitary counter in the Quaternary Scale be withdrawn, four counters may be substituted on the next bar. Remove the undermost of these, and set four more on the succeeding bar. Take away one of these again, and put other four counters on the adjacent bar. Proceed in the same way, till the quaternion reaches the last bar, and is reduced to a triplet, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCLUSION\">exclusion</a> of one counter. By this analysis, therefore, the simple counter is resolved with an excess of one, into three rows of counters which run through the whole of the lower bars. In the present instance, the number two hundred and fifty-six, the import of a counter on the fifth bar of the Quaternary Scale, is equivalent to one joined to triple the sum of sixty-four, sixteen, four, and one, the values of all the succeeding bars.\n\nIt may seem scarcely necessary to pursue this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> farther; but we shall extend it likewise to the Quinary Scale. A single counter, it is obvious, may now be removed, and five substituted for it on the next bar. The undermost of these again may be withdrawn, and five placed instead of it on the following bar. One of these may then be taken away, and five substituted for it on the adjacent bar. The same procedure is repeated to the last bar, leaving four rows, with an excess of one counter. In the present instance, a single counter on the fourth bar, and corresponding, therefore, on this scale the number to six hundred and twenty-five, is equivalent to one added to four times the sum of one hundred and twenty-five, twenty-five, five, and one, the values of all the inferior bars.\nWe may hence conclude in general, that if one be taken from any power of the index of any numerical scale, the remainder will be equal to all the inferior powers repeated as often as the index, when diminished by one, contains unit. Wherefore if the counters, reckoned as mere units, be separated from any compound expression, the whole will be converted into as many trains of counters, occupying all the inferior bars as correspond to the index of the scale diminished by one. Suppose, for example, the expression here noted, which is disposed on five bars, of the Quaternary Scale, and is equivalent to seven hundred and eleven.\n\nBy decomposing separately each successive bar, and placing the excluded counters <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> beside the place of units, it will be changed into this regular but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPLEX\">complex</a> form, which consists of three rows of double counters, leaving out two; three rows of triple counters, leaving out three; a single counter, leaving out one; and three counters on the last bar left out. If we omit the nine excluded counters, and take only each single row of the rest, the result will be greatly simplified. This reduced expression corresponds to two hundred and thirty-four. But seven hundred and eleven, diminished by nine, the number of counters at first employed, leaves seven hundred and two; and this again, being divided by three, gives two hundred and thirty-four.\n\nApplying this principle to the Denary Scale, it must follow, that if the sum of the integers be subtracted from any number, the remainder will be divisible by nine, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUOTIENT\">quotient</a> will be equal to the sum of the separate numbers denoted by each of those integers repeated through all the inferior places.\n\nAnother similar property, belonging to numerical Palpable scales, may be deduced from the combination of the deficient or open counters. Let us begin with the Binary System. Suppose a solitary counter to occupy the sixth bar. It may be removed, if two counters be placed in its stead on the next bar. But, without changing its value, we may to this pair evidently join another, composed of a full and an open counter, which perfectly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> each other. Withdraw the open counter that stands undermost, and substitute for it two open counters on the fourth bar.\n\nTo these again, add a balanced pair, consisting of an open and a full counter. Take away the undermost counter, set two similar counters on the third bar, and to this pair annex a full and an open counter. By continuing this process, the single counter will be decomposed into three rows of counters, alternately full and open; with an excluded counter, which is open when the number of the bars, as in the present case, is even, but a full counter if that number be odd. Thus thirty-two, the value of the counter on the sixth bar, is equal to three times all the inferior alternating bars, or the excess of sixteen above eight, joined to the excess of four above two, and together with one, that is, eleven; abating, however, the excluded counter which is here open; but thrice eleven, omitting one, is thirty-two.\n\nLet a similar analysis be applied to the Ternary Scale. Change the solitary counter for three counters laid on the next bar, and to these join a balanced pair consisting of a full and an open counter. Remove this open counter, and substitute three open counters for it on the succeeding bar, and to the triplet annex an open and a full counter. Take away the full counter, and place three such counters on the following bar. Repeat the procedure, till the first bar comes to be occupied; and there will evidently emerge four rows of counters extending through all the inferior bars, and alternately full and open, with an excluded counter of an opposite character to those which terminate the decomposition. In the present instance, where the single counter stood on the fifth bar, a counter of the ordinary kind is left out. Wherefore the number eighty-one is equal to four times the amount of the excess of twenty-seven above nine, and of that of three above one, or twenty, together with the unit excluded.\n\nIt may be deemed sufficient for grounding a general conclusion, to repeat the same process on the\nPalpable Arithmetic.\n\nQuaternary Scale. Instead of the solitary counter, place four counters on the next bar, and conjoin with these a balanced pair of counters, composed of a full and an open one. Remove the undermost of these, and substitute four open counters on the following bar. To these again, add an open and a full counter, which will not affect the value of the column. Pursue the operation till all the bars are occupied by counters, and one excluded. It is evident therefore that, on the Quaternary Scale, the decomposition of a single counter produces five rows of alternating counters through all the inferior bars, with an excluded counter of an opposite nature to that of the row which completes the analysis. In the example now given, the number two hundred and fifty-six, the value of the counter on the fifth bar, is equal to five times the amount of the excess of sixty-four above sixteen, and of four above one, or fifty-one, together with the unit left out.\n\nThe conclusion may, therefore, be extended to any progressive scale: If the value of unit on a separate bar be increased or diminished by one, according as the rank is even or odd, the remainder will be divisible by one greater than the index of the scale, and the quotient will be equal to the amount of the values of units alternating in excess and defect through all the inferior bars.\n\nThe same property, it is evident, could be transferred to any compound expression: Nothing is wanted but to change the counters on each successive bar into alternating rows. Thus, in the Binary Scale, the expression which signifies one hundred and seven, will be converted into another composed of triple and alternating rows, with an exclusion of two counters in excess, and three in defect, or the balance of an open counter.\n\nIf this arrangement be now divided by three, the result, after restoring the deficient unit, will be\n\nBy collecting and condensing the counters on each bar, the whole will be reduced to another very simple form; which indicates thirty-six, the third part of one hundred and eight.\n\nLet another example be selected from the notation of the Quaternary Scale. The counters on these six bars will represent the number two thousand three hundred and fifty-four. The excluded counters will stand thus; and, consequently, there is on the whole an excess of four counters which must be rejected. The original number is therefore reduced to two thousand three hundred and fifty, of which the fifth part will be denoted by repeating the counters alternately full and open on the lower bars.\n\nThis last expression being condensed and abridged will stand thus,\nIn all these decompositions, we have stopped at the bar of units; but if we pursue the analysis through the descending bars, we shall discover trains of equivalent fractions which never terminate. Thus, to begin with the Binary Scale: A counter on the bar of units may be taken away, and two counters placed instead of it on the following bar. Of this pair again, one may be removed, and another pair substituted for it on the next lower bar. One of these again may be withdrawn, and two placed on the following bar. The same operation of exchange, it is obvious, may be repeated for ever. Wherefore, the value of a single counter is here the same as that of a single row of counters, extending indefinitely over the lower bars. But the counter on the bar immediately below the place of units, indicates one-half, that on the next one-fourth, that on the following bar one-eighth, and so forth continually. Wherefore the sum of the fractions one-half, one-fourth, one-eighth, one-sixteenth, extended without limit, must always approach to one.\n\nLet a similar transformation be carried through the Ternary Scale. Suppose a half counter to stand on the bar of units: It may be removed, and three half counters, or a whole counter and half of one substituted on the next bar. Take away this half counter, and set three such, or a counter and a half on the succeeding bar. Repeat the same process continually, and the half counter on the bar of units, will be converted into a single row of entire counters, extending without limitation through all the inferior bars. But these successive counters signify one-third, one-ninth, one-twenty-seventh, &c. Whence the fraction one-half is equal to the sum of one-third, one-ninth, one-twenty-seventh, &c. continued <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AD\">ad</a> infinitum.\n\nIn the Quaternary Scale, let the third of a counter occupy alone the bar of units. It may be withdrawn, and four such parts, or a whole counter, and the third of one placed in its stead on the next bar. This third again may be removed, and a counter, with another third, substituted for it on the following bar. The same procedure being repeated, the third part of a counter in the place of units will be changed into a row of entire counters running through all the inferior bars. It therefore follows, that the fraction one-third, is equal to the sum of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFINITE\">infinite</a> series one-fourth, one-sixteenth, one-sixty-fourth, &c.\n\nAgain, let similar modifications be carried through the Quinary Scale. The fourth of a counter on the bar of units may be exchanged for five such parts, or one counter and a quarter on the following bar; and this quarter may now be removed, and five quarters, or one counter and a quarter set on the next bar. The process of decomposition may thus be continued perpetually, leaving, instead of the fourth of a counter, an unlimited range of counters stretching over the interior bars. Consequently the fraction one-fourth is equal to the aggregate terms of the progressive one-fifth, one-twenty-fifth, one-hundred and twenty-fifth, one-six hundred and twenty-fifth, continued without termination.\n\nFrom these very simple analyses, we may therefore conclude in general, that the fraction of unit, which has for its denominator one less than the index of any numerical scale, is equal to the sum of all the descending powers, or the value of a single row of counters, extending indefinitely through the inferior bars. Thus one-ninth is equal to a tenth, a hundredth, a thousandth, &c. or one-eleventh is equal to a twelfth part, a hundred and forty-fourth, a thousand seven hundred and twenty-eighth, &c.\n\nBut the summation of a descending series, whose terms <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a>, may with equal facility be discovered, by introducing the admixture of deficient counters. Thus, in the Binary Scale, if the third part of a counter stood on the bar of units, it could be removed, and two-thirds of a counter, that is, a whole counter abating the third part, substituted for it on the next bar. But this open part of a counter might be taken away, and a whole open counter diminished by the third part of a full counter placed on the following bar. This third again could be withdrawn, and a full counter with a deficient third part of one set on the next bar. This alternate exchange might easily be repeated over the suc-\ncessive bars. The third part of a counter is thus converted into an unlimited row of full and open counters. Hence the fraction one-third is equal to the sum of one-half abating one-fourth, of one-eighth abating one-sixteenth, of one-thirty-second abating one sixty-fourth, or equal to the excess of the continued series one-half, one eighth, one thirty-second, &c. above the corresponding series one-fourth, one-sixteenth, one sixty-fourth, &c.\n\nThe substitution may, in like manner, be performed on the Ternary Scale. Suppose the fourth part of a counter to occupy the bar of units. Remove this fragment and substitute three-quarters, or a whole counter abating one-quarter, on the next bar. Instead of this deficient quarter again, place three such, or one open counter, conjoined with the quarter of a full one, on the succeeding bar. Pursue the same procedure, and the quarter of a counter will be transformed into a single row of counters, alternately full and open, extending without limitation over the lower bars. Therefore the fraction one-fourth is equal to the sum of one-third abating one-ninth, of one twenty-seventh abating one eighty-first of one two hundred and forty-third, abating one seven-hundred and twenty-ninth, &c.; or one-fourth is equal to the excess of the perpetual series one-third, one twenty-seventh, &c. above the similar series, one-ninth, one eighty-first, &c.\n\nAnother instance will be sufficient to point out the general principle. Let one-fifth part of a counter stand on the bar of units in the Quaternary Scale. It may be removed, if four-fifths, or one counter wanting a fifth, were placed on the next bar. Instead of this open fifth, let four open fifths, or one open counter, joined to a fifth of excess, be put on the following bar. Change this fifth again for a full counter, with a deficient fifth on the following bar. A series of alternating counters is thus successively formed. Whence the fraction of one-fifth is equal to the continued series one-fourth, abating one-sixteenth, one sixty-fourth, abating one two hundred fifty-sixth, &c.\n\nWe may hence infer generally, that the fraction of unit, divided by one greater than the index of a numerical scale, is equal to the amount of all the descending powers taken alternatively as additive and subtractive. Thus, one-eleventh part is equal to the excess of a tenth above a one-hundredth, that of a thousandth above a ten-thousandth, that of a hundred thousandth above a millionth, and so forth continually. In like manner, on the Duodenary Scale, the thirteenth part is equal to a twelfth, abating the hundred and forty-fourth, the seventeen-hundred and twenty-eighth, abating the twenty thousand seven hundred and thirty-sixth, &c.\n\nIn all these transformations of fractions, arising from the index of the numerical scale, increased or diminished by one, the operation is repeated or alternated at each successive bar. But similar changes may be made on fractions derived from the same modifications of the powers of the index, which will regularly circulate along the bars at a corresponding interval. Thus, on the Binary Scale, the fraction one-third, or the second power of the index two diminished by one, will form by decomposition an intermitting row, or a perpetual circulation, passing over the successive alternate bars. For one-third of a counter on the bar of units is equivalent to two-thirds on the following bar, which again are equal to four-thirds, or an entire counter and a third, on the next bar. Pursuing the same analysis, a row of counters emerges on the alternate bars. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a>, if the intermediate bars, which here serve only for the transit of the pair of thirds, were left out altogether, the notation would pass into that of the Quaternary Scale, and obey the general rule.\n\nAgain, on the same Binary Scale, the fraction one-seventh, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECIPROCAL\">reciprocal</a> of the third power of two, diminished by one, will be found to circulate at every third bar. Thus, one-seventh of a counter on the bar of units gives two such parts for the second bar, four for the third and eighth, or a whole counter and an excess of one-seventh for the fourth counter; and if this kind of decomposition be carried forward, another counter will appear on the seventh bar, a third on the tenth bar; and so forth in perpetual succession.\n\nBut the same conclusion might also be drawn from the general principle, if we consider that the Binary Progression, by omitting always two consecutive bars, is converted into the Octary Scale.\n\nIt is not difficult to perceive, that every fraction is capable of being either exactly represented on any given scale, or of being denoted by an expression which circulates after an interval of fewer bars than the denominator of the fraction contains units. In fact, the moment the same set of fractional counters comes to appear a second <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, the whole expression must evidently recur in the same order. But all the possible variations or series of remainders must ever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> within the number itself, which constitutes the di-\nvisor. Thus, it was found that the expression for any fraction having the denominator seven, circulates on the Binary Scale; at the interval of three bars. The same fraction represented on the Quaternary Scale has a like recurrence; but, on the Octary Scale, the expression is renewed at every two bars, while it does not circulate till after passing over six bars, in the Ternary, Quaternary, Quinary, and Denary Scales. Employing a similar decomposition, it will appear that a fraction, with eleven for its denominator, will, in the Quaternary and Quinary Scales, circulate on five bars, but will embrace no fewer than ten bars, by its circulation in the Ternary, Quaternary, Senary, Octary, and Denary Scales.\n\nWe may hence reverse the operation, and determine the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> value of any circulating expression, or discover the fraction of which it is only the continued <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPANSION\">expansion</a>. Suppose the group of counters here presented to circulate perpetually, at an interval of six bars on the Quinary Scale. If these counters were all transferred to the seventh, or last bar, they would signify four thousand four hundred and sixty-four.\n\nBut another scale might be substituted, such that each single bar shall correspond in effect to this condensed seventh bar. Consequently the index of this new scale, or the sixth power of five, being diminished by one, will denote the denominator of the absolute fraction; which is therefore four thousand four hundred and sixty-four divided by fifteen thousand six hundred and twenty-four, or by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> two-sevenths.\n\nIn like manner, on the Denary Scale, let a set of counters always circulate, spreading over six successive bars. Conceive them transferred to the last bar, and they will express seventy-six thousand nine hundred and twenty-three. But if another scale were adopted, each bar of which had a power equal to six of these bars, its index would be a million. One less than this is consequently the denominator of the fraction, which is therefore equal to one thirteenth.\n\nHaving considered at some length the properties of numerical scales, and their various transformations, we have now to explain the ordinary operations performed on numbers themselves. These operations are all reducible to two very simple changes,\u2014the conjoining and the separating of numbers. When two or more numerical expressions are conjoined, that is, condensed into a single expression, or collected into one sum, the process is called Addition. But palpable when one numerical expression is separated or drawn out from another, leaving only a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> or remainder, the process is called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUBTRACTION\">Subtraction</a>. If the addition should be employed merely in repeating the same number, it admits of abbreviation, and is then termed Multiplication. On the contrary, if the subtraction be limited to the continued withdrawing of the same number from another, the process becomes capable of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol2.html#article-ABRIDGMENT\">abridgment</a>, and is termed Division.\n\n**Addition.**\n\nThe whole operation consists in collecting and condensing the separate expressions. Beginning with the lowest bar, the counters are gathered together, and if they exceed the index of the scale, this excess only is retained, and one counter annexed or carried to the next bar. But if the counters on any bar should contain the index more than once, the number of repetitions is transferred a place higher, while the remainder of the reckoning is left as it stood. A very few examples will render the mode of proceeding quite clear. Let it be required to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLECT\">collect</a> the expressions here disposed on the Quaternary Scale.\n\nOn the bar of units, two counters occur, which are brought together at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a>. Two counters are likewise found on the next bar, and each of the three following bars has each three counters. But four counters are found on the next bar, which are equal to one transferred to the highest bar, leaving a blank in their own place. In this case very little change in the notation is wanted; and except in a single transfer to a higher bar, the counters are merely brought closer together, and form the expression at the bottom. This again might be somewhat abridged by introducing open counters, as represented here, below the other. The sum of the three compound numbers thus represented on the Quaternary Scale, is therefore by reduction nine thousand two hundred and ten.\n\nSuppose the same numbers were converted into the Denary Scale. They would be respectively three thousand five hundred and twenty-eight, one thousand and seventy-three, and four thou-\nPalpable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> six hundred and nine; which are thus exhibited successively on four bars. Now, collecting all the single counters on the first bar to the right, they amount to ten, which joined to the two fives make twenty; they consequently, in their summation, leave that bar void, and throw two counters to the next. These two counters now joined to the four which occur on the second bar, make six, and again with the five, eleven, leaving one counter on the second bar, and furnishing one to the next. This counter, with another already on the third bar, leaves two; while the two fives on it deliver one on the fourth bar. The result, as before, is nine thousand three hundred and ten. The final expression may be somewhat abridged, by employing deficient counters; it gives ten thousand, abating one thousand, and two hundred and ten, the same result as before.\n\nBut perhaps it is more natural and more like the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPONTANEOUS\">spontaneous</a> practice of uninstructed men, to proceed by successive steps, and only conjoin two numbers at the same time. Nor is it requisite, in this mode of proceeding, that the numbers to be severally added should be actually expressed; it may be sufficient, at each step, to retain them mentally. Thus, when the second number is to be added to the first, the three counters which should occupy the first bar being joined, the three single ones already noted make six, or leave one, and change the other five into ten, which furnishes one counter to the second bar; and one counter on the fourth bar increases its stock to four. Again, when the third number is added, it would give nine counters to the first Palpable bar, and hence change it into ten, leaving the Arithmetic bar void, and throwing a counter to the next bar. But the six counters on the third bar, convert the five counters into ten, and thus furnish one to the next bar, while they leave two counters behind them.\n\nThe working of this example would be simplified by employing the notation of deficient counters. Thus the several numbers are changed into other expressions as here expressed. On the first bar, the full and the open counters, being three of each kind, exactly balance each other; but, on the second bar, the full counters leave an excess of one. The full counters on the third bar, being eight in all, exceed the open ones by two; while, on the fourth bar, they leave a defect of one.\n\nLet another example be taken of addition from numbers arranged on the Quinary Scale. The counters on the first bar amount to six, which leaves one counter, and furnishes one to the next bar. This bar now holds eight counters, leaving three consequently, and throwing one to the third bar. The third bar has then ten counters, or is left void, and gives two counters to the next bar. This bar, holding eleven counters, leaves one, and supplies two to the highest bar. The total amount of the numbers is therefore three quadruplicate pentads, one triplicate pentad, three pentads and one, or by reduction, two thousand and sixteen.\nBy introducing deficient counters, the process might be simplified and abridged. The first bar continues the same as before; but in the next bar, after one had been carried to the second bar, and joined to the full counters, there yet is an excess of three full counters. In the third bar, the opposite counters, being two each, are quite balanced, and leave a void; but the fourth bar yields an excess of one full counter, while the fifth collects three full counters. The result is every way the same as before.\n\nLet these numbers be transformed on the Denary Scale. They will stand as here expressed, occupying three bars. The first number furnishes to the successive bar two, three, and six counters; the next number gives seven, eight, and two; the third number delivers four to the third bar, passes over the second, and deposits seven on the first; and the last number, supplies five, nine, and two to the successive bars. In the first bar, the single counters collected together make six, and the two fives contribute one to the next bar. The second bar, holding four fives with a surplus counter, leaves one, and throws two to the next bar. This increase raises the third bar to four fives, and therefore, leaving it void, advances two counters to the fourth bar. The amount of the addition is therefore, as before, being two thousand and sixteen.\n\nIf the operation were performed in its utmost simplicity, by annexing one of the numbers always after the other, the progress of summation would be thus exhibited. The first number being actually represented by counters, the second, which is only retained in the memory, changes by its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSORPTION\">absorption</a> the several bars, and produces one thousand and seventeen. To this again is joined mentally the third number, which gives one thousand four hundred and twenty-four, as another step in the progress. And, lastly, the fourth number, being annexed to this, completes the transformation, and produces the final result, two thousand and sixteen.\n\nBut, in most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, the work of summing different numbers may be sensibly shortened, by a judicious application of open counters; which, by their intermixture, effecting in a long operation a sort of balance, will, for the most part, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol16.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> the trouble of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> to the higher bars. Whenever the full counters on a bar exceed half the index of the scale, it is preferable to substitute for them open counters. Thus, in the last example, the four numbers to be added may be denoted as here expressed. In the first bar, there is, on the whole, an excess of four open counters; in the second, an excess of two full counters; but, in the third bar, the opposite counters are exactly balanced, and leave a void. The result is consequently two thousand and twenty, abating four.\nIt is evident that all these operations are conducted in the same way, whether the counters occupy the bars of an ascending or of a descending series. The position of the bar of units determines the values of all the rest. Decimal fractions are, therefore, no more entitled to a separate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a> than those derived from any other scale.\n\n**Subtraction**\n\nis the process by which a number is separated or extracted from another; the difference sought being the remainder left after this operation. If the counters representing the larger number should exceed on each bar those denoting the subtrahend, we have only to mark the several excesses. But, if the upper number has fewer counters on any bar than the subtrahend, it will be necessary to take one from the higher bar, and augment the expression of the other, by joining as many counters as the index of the scale contains units. Suppose it were required on the Senary Scale to subtract two thousand seven hundred and forty-five, from six thousand three hundred and eighteen. The numbers will appear thus arranged. The upper bar of units being vacant, we put six on it, and withdraw or borrow from the next bar an equivalent counter marked with a dot. The three counters on the corresponding bar of the subtrahend, being then set aside, leave other three counters for the difference. On the next bar, a counter, answering to the one below, being removed from the two remaining counters, gives a difference of one. On the third bar, the four counters of the subtrahend cannot be taken away from the single counter above, till it has been augmented to seven, at the expense of one counter withdrawn from the next bar, and therefore marked with a dot. The fourth bar leaves all its four counters, and the fifth bar drops its excess of two.\n\nThe operation is varied and shortened, by adopting open counters. To take away the three open counters on the bar of units from the vacancy above it, substitute for that void the counterpoise of three full and three open counters, and then separating the last, there are left three full counters. On the second bar, one counter only remains. The single counter of the third bar may have annexed to it two full and two open counters, and the latter being removed, will consequently leave three full counters.\n\nOn the fourth bar, conceive an open and a full Palpable counter to be joined, and then, omitting the latter, there will remain two open counters. The single open counter of the fifth bar may likewise have a pair of open and of full counters combined with it without changing its import, and consequently three open counters will be left. On the sixth bar the single counter is left standing. The same expression is easily denoted by full counters, and gives, on reduction, the number three thousand five hundred and seventy-three, as the result of the subtraction.\n\nSuppose the same numbers were expressed on the Denary Scale. Beginning with the bar of units, the five counters corresponding to those of the subtrahend being set aside, leave three. In the next bar, the single counter is first increased by ten, which are equivalent to a counter withdrawn from the third bar, and then four being separated from these, gives seven for a remainder. In the third bar, a single counter borrowed from the next, furnishes two fives, one of which, with the remaining two counters, being taken away, leave five. The counters on the last bar, now reduced to five, leave only three, after the separation of the two in the subtraction. The remainder is consequently three thousand four hundred and seventy-three.\n\nIn every instance where a counter is borrowed from a higher bar, the effect would evidently be unaltered, if a counter were added on the same bar to the number below. This modification of the process is what has been generally termed carrying. It is\nMultiplication is nothing but a process of repeated Addition. When the terms, however, to be multiplied are complex, and the index of the Numerical Scale is large, the operation will admit of being very considerably abridged. It has been already shown, that a number is virtually multiplied by the index of the scale, by advancing its expression one bar; that it is multiplied by the second power of that index by advancing it two bars; and so forth continually, according to the progressive powers. Again, if any term of the multiplier be great, it is preferable, instead of repeating the counters of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MULTIPLICAND\">multiplicand</a>, to collect them mentally, and only mark the result. The ready performance of multiplication depends entirely on the right application of these two principles. A few examples will elucidate the process.\n\nSuppose it were required to multiply the number forty-five by twenty-three, that is, to add the units contained in forty-five twenty-three times. First, let those numbers be disposed on the Binary Scale. The counter on the unit bar of the multiplier shows that the whole of the multiplicand is to be set down once as it stands.","sp":769,"ep":789},{"h":"PLATE VII","t":"The names of the different figures, and of the divisions of fig. 5, being marked <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the engraving itself; no further explanation can be necessary.

Two pinions, k l, are placed upon the ends of the axles of the two rollers, and by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a> acting together, they compel the two rollers to accompany each other. The surfaces of the rollers are filled with indentations and strong teeth, which penetrate and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> the bones to pieces. This is accomplished, by employing separate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> iron <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHEELS\">wheels</a> placed side by side upon an axis, to compose the rollers; the wheels have coarse teeth similar to those of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a>, or ratchet wheel; each wheel of the lower <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROLLER\">roller</a>, F, is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a> thick; and they are placed at distances of an inch and a half asunder, having circles of hard wood or iron, placed between them, which are two inches less in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a>. Thus they leave grooves, between the toothed wheels, which have the effect of rendering the teeth upon the surface of the roller insulated. The wheels of the opposite roller, E, are 1\u00bd inch wide, and the spaces between them only 1 inch; and the two are so situated, with respect to each other, that the teeth upon one, are opposite to the spaces between the teeth of the other, as is clearly explained by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPPER\">hopper</a>, II, is fixed above the machine, over the rollers, and into this the bones are filled, so that they rest upon the two rollers, and are drawn in by their motion, the teeth penetrating and breaking every piece however <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> it may be. The bones should be supplied rather gradually to the machine at first, to avoid choking it, and the rollers should then be adjusted to a considerable distance asunder; but when the bones have once passed through in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>, the rollers are screwed closer by the screws, h h, and the fragments <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>.

The pinions must have deep cogs, to enable them to take deep hold of each other, when the rollers are set at only half an inch distance to grind fine, and without the cogs being liable to slip when the centres are separated, so far as to leave a space of 1 inch, or 1\u00bd inches, between the rollers, for the passage of the large bones the first time. The rollers will act most effectually, if the different wheels are fixed upon their axles in such a position, that the teeth will not correspond, or form lines <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to the axes, and then no piece of bone can escape without being broken by some of the teeth. The bones which have passed through the rollers, slide down the inclined <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOARD\">board</a>, R, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLECT\">collect</a> at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> in a large heap. When all the stock of bones are thus coarsely broken, a labourer takes them up in a shovel and throws them again to the hopper, to be ground a second time.\n\nFig. 3.

This cylinder is situate beneath a hopper B, into which the potatoes are thrown, and thence admitted into a kind of trough C, where they are forced against the cylinder, which, as it revolves, grinds the potatoes to a pulp. Motion is given to the machine by a handle fixed upon the end of the axis of the grating cylinder A, and on the opposite extremity of this axis is a fly-wheel D, to regulate and equalize the movement. The potatoes, when put into the hopper, press by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> upon the top of the cylinder, and, as it revolves, they are in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> grated away.

Their shell, although apparently bivalve, is formed but of one piece, open in front. Their head is terminated by a kind of pointed but immovable beak. Their mouth is placed within the shell. The eye is absolutely single, and not formed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNION\">union</a> of two eyes, and is covered by granules. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of legs is not known. One of the species is called Pulex caudatus by Scheffer, 1755, t. 1. f. 1. 8. and in the Encyclopaedia Britannica, Pl. 37. fig. 1, a species is rudely figured as an animalcule.\n\nSp. 1. Pulex.

Cypris, M\u00fcll. Latr.

The members of the body of the cyprides are not known; they move with such quickness whilst living, and are so soft when dead, that it is scarcely possible to investigate their characters more fully. Their antennae are long, and very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEXIBLE\">flexible</a>; these organs are furnished at their tips with a brush or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a>, composed of hairs. The hinder part of their bodies is formed of a tail, which is almost entirely concealed within their shell. Their head is terminated by an elongate point, and they have but one eye. Of their economy nothing is known, but they have been observed to change their covering like other Entomostraca.\n\nPlate XX. fig. 1. Cypris nephroides natural size; 2. magnified.\n\nSp. 1.

Latr. Bosc, Leach.*\nAntennae simply pilose.\n\nThis genus was first discovered and established by M\u00fcller, who first observed all the species described in his Entomostraca. It is distinguished from *Cypris* by the antennae, which are not terminated by a pencil of hairs. The legs are eight in number, and are rarely drawn within the shell, which is really bivalve.\n\nThe Cytheres have no tail, and their antennae, like those of the Cyprides, have their articulations pilose. They have but one eye. All the species inhabit the sea, and may be found among the conservae and corallines, which fill the pools left by the tide in most of the rocky coasts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>.\n\nSp. 1. *Viridis.* Shell reniform, velvety, and green.\n*Cythere viridis,* *M\u00fcll.

The females carry their eggs in a pouch resembling a bunch of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAPES\">grapes</a> on each side of the tail. The organs of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a> of the male are placed in the antennae; those of the female beneath the belly, at the base of the tail, which is abruptly narrower than the abdomen. The antennae are hairy at the base of their joints.\n\nSp. 1. *Geoffroyii.* Tail strait and bifid; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> brownish.\n\nMonoculus quadricornis.\n\n*Linn.

Is very common in fresh waters.\n\nGeoffroy, in his *Histoire Naturelle des Insectes* (tom. ii. 656, pl. 21, f. 5.), has described and figured this species under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> *Le Monocle \u00e0 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEUE\">queue</a> fourchue.* It was first noticed by Leuwenhoeck, and his observations were afterwards increased by those of Baker, Roesel, and De Geer.\n\n*Gen. 14. Calanus.*\n*Cyclops,* *M\u00fcll. Latr. Bosc, Leach.*\nBody ovate conic, elongate. Eye one, situated on the thorax. Antennae two, simple. Legs eight.\n\n*Cyclops longicornis.*\n*M\u00fcll. Entomost. 115, t. 19, f. 7, 9.*\n*Latr. Gen. Crust. et Insect. i. 20.*\n*Bosc, Hist. Nat. des Crust. ii. 229.*\n*Leach, Edin. Encycl. vii. 389.*\n\nMonoculus longicornis.\n\n*Fabr. Ent. Syst. ii. 501.*\n\nInhabits the Norwegian and German Ocean. It was first discovered by the celebrated Gunnerus in the Finnmarkian Sea, and was described by M\u00fcller in his *Zoologie Danica Prodromus,* under the title Cyclops Finnarchicus, which name he afterwards changed in his *Entomostraca.*\n\n*Gen. 15. Polyphemus,* *M\u00fcll. Latr. Bosc, Leach.*\n*Cephaloculus,* *Lamarck.*\nEye one, forming the head; legs ten; two bifid, elongate, and extended horizontally.\n\nThis genus, containing one species, was established by M\u00fcller. Naturalists have generally considered it as the larva of some other genus, but the multiplied observations of M\u00fcller, Lamarck, and Bosc, have cleared up all doubts on the subject, and it is now generally admitted as a distinct and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> animal. The head is round, distinct from the thorax, and apparently composed of one large eye. The body is divided into two parts by a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a>; the anterior part contains the legs and tail; the posterior part contains only the eggs and the young. The tail is long, and is attached to the under part of the body, being terminated by two setae.\n\nThe *polyphemus* inhabits marshes and moves quickly by the combined efforts of its short legs and bifid oars, generally swimming on its back.\n\nSp. 1. *Oculus.* Body luteous, with a few blue spots.\n\nPolyphemus oculus.\n\n*M\u00fcll. Entom. 119, pl. 20, f. 1, 5.*\n*Latr. Gen. Crust. et Insect. i. 20.*\n*Bosc, Hist. Nat. des Crust. ii. 290, pl. 18, f. 5, 6.*\n*Leach, Edin. Encycl. vii. 389.*\n\nCephaloculus stagnorum.\n\n*Lam. Syst. des Animaux sans <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERT\">Vert</a>. 170.*\n\nInhabits lakes and marshes. In the *Edinburgh Encyclopaedia,* Dr Leach stated it as probable that there were several species that had been confounded with *P. oculus,* but repeated observations have since convinced him of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> of this conjecture, and led to the conclusion that there is but one, which is subject to very considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> in size and colour.\n\nDivision IV.\n\n*Gen. 16. Branchiopoda.*\n*Lam. Latr. Bosc, Leach.*\nBody filiform and very soft. Head divided from the thorax by a very narrow but distinct neck. Eyes two, lateral. Antennae two, short, two-jointed, capillary inserted behind and above the eyes. Front with two moveable processes (which are broader towards the apex in the male <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEX\">sex</a>), that are notched, those of the female furnished with a papilla at their point.\n\nSubsidiary Observations. In the front of the male, at the base of the moveable processes on the front, are two long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>-like filaments, and the clypeus is, as it were, double. In both sexes, the mouth is armed with a hooked rostriform papilla, supported by four little processes. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a> of the body is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KEEL\">keel</a>-shaped, and is formed of eleven joints, each of which is furnished with two branchial feet, the anterior pair with two, the posterior pairs with three lamellae. The tail is about the length of the body, composed of\nCrustacea, six or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> obscure joints, the oval segment bearing two fins.\n\nThe organs of generation are situated at the base of the tail.\n\nSp. 1. Stagnalis. Body transparent, of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> colour, slightly tinged with green or blue, particularly on the head and legs.\n\nCancer stagnalis. Linn. Fa. S. 2043.\n\nBranchiopoda stagnalis.\n\nLam. Syst. des Anim. sans Vert. 161.\nLatr. Gen. Crust. et Ins. i. 22.\nLeach, Edin. Encycl. vii. 389.\n\nWe shall transcribe the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> observations made on this species by the late Dr Shaw of the British Museum, published in the first volume of the Transactions of the Linnaean Society of London.\n\n\"It is generally found in such waters as are of a soft <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, and particularly in those shallows of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a>-water which are so frequently seen in the spring and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUTUMN\">autumn</a>, and in which the Monoculus pulex of Linnaeus, and other small animals, abound. At first sight, it bears some resemblance to the larva of a dytiscus; but, when viewed closely, it is found to be of a much more curious and elegant appearance than that animal. The legs, of which there are several pair (eleven?) on each side, are flat and filmy, and have the appearance of so many waving fins, of the most delicate structure imaginable. The whole animal is extremely transparent, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> colour is brown, slightly tinged with blueish-green.\n\n\"Monoculus conchaceus\" of Linnaeus very frequently assaults them, and adheres with such force to their tails and legs, as sometimes to tear off a part in the struggle. It delights much in sunshine, during which it appears near the surface of the water, swimming on its back, and moving in various directions, by the successive undulations of its numerous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FIN\">fin</a>-like legs, and moving its tail in the manner of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RUDDER\">rudder</a>. On the least disturbance, it starts in the manner of a small fish, and endeavours to secret itself, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVING\">diving</a> in the soft mud. It changes its skin at certain periods, as is evident from the exuviae or shoughs being frequently found in the water in which these animals are kept.\n\n\"In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a>, the females <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEPOSIT\">deposit</a> their eggs without any settled order, and perfectly loose in the water. They appear to the naked eye, like very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> globules of a light brown colour. Each ovum, when magnified, closely resembles the farina of a mallow. It is thickly beset with spines on every side, and coated over with a transparent gelatinous substance, reaching <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> to the extremities of the spines, and is most probably intended to assist in causing them to adhere to the substances on which they may chance to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a>, or as a security from the attacks of smaller animals. In about a fortnight or three weeks, the eggs are hatched, and the young animals may be seen to swim with great liveliness, by means of three very long pair of arms or rowers, which appear disproportionate to the size of the animal, and indeed it bears, in this very small state, not much resemblance to the form it afterwards assumes; but, in the short space of a very few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a>, the body assumes a lengthened form, and begins to acquire the tail-fin. The eyes in this state do not appear pedunculated. On the seventh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> after hatching, they approach pretty nearly the form of the perfect animal; they, however, still retain the two first pairs of rowers or arms. The legs are at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> very visible. About the ninth day it loses the long ears, and appears still more like the animal in its advanced state.\"\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOCTOR\">Doctor</a> farther observes, that it is highly probable, that a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> elapses before the animal assumes its full size, but the time he was unable to determine, as those he kept died before they had acquired any considerable size. When first hatched, they are scarcely larger than the common mite.\n\nSubclass II. MALACOSTRACA.\n\nThis subclass has occupied a very considerable portion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, the result of which shall be given in the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PAGES\">pages</a>.\n\nLegion I. PODOPHTHALMA. Eyes pedunculated or elevated on footstalks.\n\nOrder I. BRACHYURA. Tail short and simple at its extremity.\n\nOrder II. MACROURA. Tail lengthened with appendices at its extremity.\n\nLegion II. EDRIOPHTHALMA. Eyes sessile.\n\nLegion I. PODOPHTHALMA.\n\nThe Malacostraca podophthalma include those animals, which, in common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, are denominated Crabs, Lobsters, Cray-fish, Prawns, Pandals, and Shrimps, all of which have the power of reproducing their claws when they are lost.\n\nCrabs and Lobsters are said \"to change their crust annually,\" but this, like many other statements in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZOOLOGY\">zoology</a>, is incorrect. We have seen Maja squinado and the common Lobster (Astacus gammarus) so overgrown with Ostreae, Anomiae, Flustra, Sponge, and Sertulariae, as scarcely to be enabled to move the joints of their legs, and as the oysters were of a year's growth; and as the anomiae were above them, and the coralline matters upon the anomiae, there can be no doubt but the crust was at least two years old.\n\nOrder I. BRACHYURA.\n\nLatreille arranges the Brachyura (from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> breadth and length of the thorax or shell) into two families; but the discovery of genera, unknown to that illustrious Entomologist, has convinced us that such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a> is extremely unnatural; and although, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANT\">infant</a> state of our knowledge, we cannot venture to propose named divisions; yet we shall endeavour to dispose the genera into what appear to be natural groupes.\n\nSynopsis and distribution of the Genera.\n\nA.

It is very common on the sandy shores of southern Devon, from Torcross to the mouth of the river Ex, and is frequently found entangled in the shore-nets of the fishermen, or thrown on the shore after storms.\n\nIt is distinguished from every other discovered species, by the rounded dentations of the front, the very slight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELEVATION\">elevation</a> of the lines on the hands, and by the convexity, remarkable smoothness, and marbled appearance of the shell.\n\nYoung specimens are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> brown, and much resemble the young of P. depurator, from which they may very easily be separated by their more considerable convexity.\n\nGen. 8.

Anterior pair of legs equal, the arms anteriorly spinose; hinder pair very much compressed. Abdomen of the male with the fourth joint much lengthened, much narrower than the third. Shell very transverse, furnished on each side with nine teeth, the last of which is the longest.\n\nThis genus was instituted by Dr Leach in the Edinburgh Encyclopaedia, and has since been given, with amended characters, in the Zoological Miscellany, and in the eleventh volume of the Transactions of the Linnean Society. As far as we have been enabled to learn, all the species inhabit the Great Ocean, harbouring amongst floating marine plants, swimming with great swiftness and ease near the surface of the water.\n\n* Shell on each side terminated by a very long spine.\n\na.

Shell margined behind; orbits behind with one fissure, and externally with one fold; beneath with one fissure and externally with one fold. Anterior pair of legs unequal.\n\nSp. 1. Pagurus. Shell granulated with nine folds on each side; front with three lobes.\n\nCancer pagurus of authors.\n\nThis species is the common crab of Britain. It is considered to be in season between Christmas and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EASTER\">Easter</a>, and about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARVEST\">harvest</a>, being much esteemed as an article of food. Its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\">natural history</a> is but little known. During the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> months, it is very abundant on all our rocky coasts, especially where the water is deep. At low tide, they are often found in holes of rocks, in pairs, male and female; and if the male be taken away, another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be found in the hole at the next recess of the tide. By knowing this fact, an experienced fisherman may twice a day take, with little trouble, a vast number of specimens, after having once discovered their haunts.\n\nIn the winter, they are supposed to burrow in the sand, or to retire to the deeper parts of the ocean. They are taken in wicker-baskets, resembling mousetraps, or in large nets with open meshes, which are placed at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> of the ocean, and baited with garbage.\n\nGen. 11. Xantho. Leach.\n\nExternal antennae very short, inserted in the internal corner of the eye; internal antennae received in foveole under the prominent margin of the clypeus, the peduncle sublinear. External double palpi, with the second joint of the internal footstalk notched at the internal apex.

Soc. xi. 320.\n\nThis species was first described by Montagu, who Crustacea considered it to be the Cancer floridus of Linn\u00e9; but an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of the characters in the Amoenitates Academicae, will readily convince the naturalist of the incorrectness of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>; nor is it the Cancer floridus of Herbst; which induces me to believe that some one must have misled Mr Montagu with regard to the synonym, as he could never have considered them the same, had he examined the reference.\n\nCancer donone of Herbst, probably is referable to the genus Xantho.\n\nGen. 12. Calappa. Dald. Fabr. Lam. Latr. Bosc, Leach.\n\nShell with the hinder angles arched, receiving the legs when contracted.

Of the economy of the genus nothing is known, but, from the general structure of the parts, it is probably similar to that of Cancer.\n\nSp. 1. Granulatus.

Leach.\n\nExternal double palpi, with the internal footstalk composed of two nearly equal joints; palpi inserted beneath or within; anterior pair of legs, unequal; claws and tibiae spinose; shell truncate-subcordate.\n\nThere are probably many species of this genus, but their characters have not been made out by naturalists. Travellers speak of three sorts. Their economy is very curious, and is detailed by Sloane, Catesby, and others.\n\nThey inhabit the mountains of the Antilles. In the beginning of the year they descend from the mountains in vast numbers, and deposit their eggs in the sea. During this march, which is said to be conducted with great regularity, and to be under the guidance of a commander, the strongest proceed first. They are often obliged to halt for want of rain, and to go into the most convenient encampment until the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> change. The main body is said to consist of females, which never leaves the mountains till the rain be set in. They chiefly proceed during the\nCrustacea, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>, sheltering in hollow trees and in shady places during the hot part of the day.\n\nSp. 1. *Ruricola*.

External double palpi, with the internal footstalk, one-jointed. Anterior pair of legs unequal. Eyes thick. Shell ovate-orbicular, orbiculate-quadrate, or transverse-subquadrate.\n\nAll the species of this most interesting genus inhabit the bivalve shells of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACEPHALOUS\">acephalous</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOLLUSCA\">Mollusca</a>, and were supposed by the ancients to be consanguineous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INMATES\">inmates</a> with the animal, bound by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FABLE\">fable</a> is beautifully told by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OPPIAN\">Oppian</a>, and is alluded to by Cicero. \"Pinna vero (sic enim Graece dictatur), duabus grandis patulis conchis, cum parva squilla quasi societatem coit comparandi cibi. Itaque cum pisciculi parvi in concham hiantem innotaverint, tum admonita a squilla pinna morsu, comprimit concham.\" *Nat. Deor. Lib.* ii. sec. 48.\n\nAristotle supposed them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> as sentinels, and believed that they guarded the pinna (the animal in whose shell they were first observed), from the attacks of its enemies. Rondeletius and some other naturalists held the same opinion.\n\nSp. 1. *Cranchii*. Shell orbiculate-subquadrate, soft, very smooth, with the sides dilated behind; front strait, obscurely submarginate; hands <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a>, below and the thighs above with a ciliated line; thumb subcarinate; abdomen very broad, the sides of the segments arcuate, the second, and following ones distinctly notched; the fifth segment somewhat broader; the last narrower than the preceding segment. Female.\n\nPinnotheres Cranchii.\n\nLeach, *Malacost. Podophth. Britann.* tab. 14, fig. 4-5.\n\nThe male of this species, which was discovered by Mr. J. Cranch, whose name it bears, is unknown. It is distinguished from *P. pisum* (the common species), by the form of the front of the shell, which is strait and slightly notched; by the dilated hinder part of the shell, and by the abdomen, all the joints of which, excepting the first, are distinctly notched behind.\n\nPlate XXI.\n\nDivision III.

They inhabit the shores of the sea; and, as their name indicates, run with great swiftness.\n\nSp. 1. *Ceratophthalma*.

They multiply very much, and serve as food to otters, bears, birds, crocodiles, &c. The females carry about their eggs under the abdomen. They live on animal substances, which they devour with avidity. Their motion is rapid; Sir J. Banks assures us that he could never come up with them when running, and that the only means by which he could take them was by running to and stopping their holes before they could reach it, and which he effected by lying in ambush until the animals had gone to a very considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> from their haunts.\n\nSp. 1. *Una*.

They burrow laterally in the clay or slime, making two entrances to their hole; entering by one, and going out by the other. We have seen several fossil species inclosed in marle, that appear to belong to this genus.\n\nSp. 1. *Bispinosa*.

The abdomen is naked and slender, being covered merely with a skin of a delicate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEXTURE\">texture</a>; but its extremity is furnished with appendages, by means of which it secures itself within the shell of which it makes choice. It is really astonishing with what facility these animals move, bearing at the same time the shell, which is destined to preserve the body from injury, and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> these animals from the attacks of fishes, who would otherwise devour them. All the species are termed indiscriminately Soldier-crabs and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERMIT\">Hermit</a>-crabs, from the idea of their living in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TENT\">tent</a>, or retiring to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CELL\">cell</a>.\n\nSp. 1.

They breed during the early summer months, and are very prolific, Baxter having counted no less than 12,444 eggs under the abdomen. In warm weather they are very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a>; they have the power of springing backward in Crustacea, the water to a most astonishing distance into their holes in the rocks, as has been repeatedly observed by naturalists of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a>. Their food consists of dead animal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, and, it is said, also of sea-weeds. The female is stated to deposit her eggs in the sand, but the young state is not known.\n\nThe common lobster inhabits the European Ocean.

The apex is generally notched above, but in two instances we observed the point to be entire. The situation of the teeth on the upper edge is variable, but in most instances the second tooth is at a greater distance from the first than the rest, which are generally equidistant, and rarely extend far beyond the middle, the rostrum from that part being edentate, with the exception of the emarginate apex.\n\nHerbst, Latreille, and Dr Leach, formerly considered this species as Cancer squilla of Linne, but Dr L. has, since the publication of the error, met with the true C. squilla of that author, and has described it in the eleventh volume of the Transactions of the Linnean Society, p. 348.\n\nPalemon serratus of Fabricius is distinct, and, if his description be correct, it is not even referable to this Genus, he having expressly given, as its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIFIC\">specific</a> character (\"Antennae posticis bifidis\"), hinder antennae bifid; whereas, in his generic character, he has stated these organs to be trifid (\"Antennae superiores trifidae\").\n\nGen. 64.

The specific name Locusta is probably derived from the form of its protruded mouth, which has a general resemblance to the same part in the gryllides.\n\nIt has never been observed in the water; it burrows in the sand, and leaps about on the shore.\n\nTalitrus litoralis, described in the seventh volume of the Edinburgh Encyclopedia, is merely the female of T. locusta.\n\nThe use of this animal (which is generally denominated sand-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPPER\">hopper</a>) in the economy of nature, appears to be that of contributing to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a> of putrid animal and vegetable matter; serving in return as food to the shore-birds, who devour it with avidity.\n\nGen. 3.

His pupil J. C. Fabricius, in the Supplement to his Entomologia Systematica, placed them in a particular class named Mitosata, comprehending all the species, like Linn\u00e9, under the generic appellations of Julius and Scolopendra. G. Cuvier, in his Tableau \u00c9l\u00e9mentaire, arranged the Myriapoda with Insects, in which he was followed by A. M. C. Dum\u00e9ril, who has, however, adopted the new genera proposed by Latreille.\n\nThey were arranged in the older works of Latreille along with Insects; but in his last work he has placed them in a peculiar order of the class Arachnides, which he has denominated Myriapoda; and has divided them into two families, namely,\n\nFam. I. Chilognatha. Gen. 1. Glomeris. 2. Julius. 3. Polydesmus. 4. Pollyxenus.\n\nFam. II. Syngnatha. Gen. 5. Scutigera. 6. Scolopendra.\n\nLamarck arranged them with the Arachnides, into three genera, 1. Scolopenda; 2. Scutigera; 3 Julius; and in his last work, he had adopted a fourth genus, Pollyxenus.\n\nHaving given a slight sketch of what has been done by systematic writers, we may observe, that we differ from them merely in considering them as constituting a distinct class, and in disposing the species under some additional generic heads, which a minute examination of their structure has most fully warranted.\n\nClassification.\n\nAll the Myriapoda have their head distinct from Myriapoda, the body, furnished with two antennae. Mandibles simple, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INCISIVE\">incisive</a>.

Henry VIII. made his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> son, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">Duke</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RICHMOND\">Richmond</a>, Lord High Admiral of England, when he was but six years old. When the High Admiral, however, went to sea in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a>, he had usually a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEAL\">seal</a>, appointing him admiral and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">captain</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a>, sometimes with powers to confer knighthood, and generally to punish with life and limb. Such a commission was granted by Henry VIII. to Sir Edward Howard, who executed indention with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> to furnish 3000 men, 18 captains, 1750 soldiers, 1232 mariners and gunners; the pay of himself to be 10s. a-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, of a captain 1s. 6d., of the rest 5s. as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol21.html#article-WAGES\">wages</a>, and 5s. for victuals each man, for twenty eight days, together with certain dead shares.\n\nIt appears, from Mr Pepys's Naval Collections, that the Lord High Admiral did anciently wear, on solemn occasions, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> whistle, set with precious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, hanging at the end of a gold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a>. The whistle, it would seem, has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> since descended to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a>-swain and his mates. (k.)\n\nADMIRALTY (HIGH <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">COURT</a> OF). This is a court of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, in which the authority of the Lord High Admiral is excercised, in his judicial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a>, and wherein all causes are determined appertaining to the sea, and all offences tried that are committed thereon. Very little has been left on record of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREROGATIVE\">prerogative</a> of the Admirals of England. For some time after the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> of the office, they judged all matters relating to merchants and mariners, which happened on the main sea, in a summary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>, according to the laws of Oleron, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMULGATED\">promulgated</a> by Richard I. These laws, which were little more than a transcript of the Rhodian laws, became the universally received customs of the western part of the world. \"All the sea-faring nations,\" says Sir Lionel Jenkins, \"soon after their promulgation, received and entertained these laws from the English, by way of deference to the sovereignty of our kings in the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCEAN\">ocean</a>, and to the judgment of our countrymen in sea affairs.\"\n\nIn the patents granted to the early admirals, between the latter end of the reign of Henry III. and until the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of that of Edward III., no mention is made of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">marine</a> perquisites, or of civil power, nor does it appear that the Admirals enjoyed either; but, after the death of the latter, new and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> powers were granted to them, and it would appear that they usurped others. The preamble to the statute of 13th Richard II. sets forth, that \"forasmuch as a great and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> clamour and complaint hath been oftentimes made before this time, and yet is, for that the Admirals and their deputies hold their sessions within divers places of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REALM\">realm</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a> to them greater authority than belongeth to their office, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> of our lord the King, and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a> and impoverishing of the common people;\" and it is therefore directed that the Admirals and their deputies, shall not meddle, from henceforth, of any thing done within the realm, but only of a thing done upon the sea: and two years afterwards, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, as stated in the preamble of the statute, \"of the great and grievous complaint of all the commons;\" it was ordained that the Admiral's court should have no cognizance of any contracts, pleas, or quarrels, or of any thing done or arising within the bodies of counties, whether by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> or by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, nor of wreck of the sea; but that the Admiral should have cognizance of the death of a man, and of main-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HORN\">horn</a> done in great ships, being and hovering in the main stream of great rivers, yet only beneath the bridges of the same rivers nigh the sea. He may also arrest ships in the great floats for the great voyages of the king, and of the realm; and have jurisdiction over the said floats, but during the said voyages only. But if the Admiral or his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">lieutenant</a> exceed that jurisdiction, then, by 2d Henry IV., the statute of 13th Richard II. and common law may be holden against them; and if a man pursues wrongfully in the Admiralty Court, his adversary may recover double damages at common-law, and the pursuant, if attainted, shall incur the penalty of L. 10 to the King.\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, which, according to Spelman, is absolutely subject to the jurisdiction of the Admiral, is the sea; which, however, comprehends public rivers, fresh waters, creeks, and all places whatsoever, within the ebbing and flowing of the sea, at the highest water, the shores or banks adjoining, from all the first bridges to the seaward; and, in these, he observes, the Admiralty hath full jurisdiction in all causes, criminal and civil, except treasons and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> of wreck. Lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COKE\">Coke</a> observes, that \"between the high-water mark and the low-water mark, the Admiral hath jurisdiction super aquam, when the sea is full, and as long as it flows, though the land be infra corpus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMITATUS\">comitatus</a>, at the reflow, so as of one place there is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> imperium at several times.\"\n\nBut, though the statute restraineth the Lord High Admiral, that he shall not hold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLEA\">plea</a> of a thing rising in the body of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, he is not restrained from making execution upon the land, but is empowered to take either body or goods upon the land; otherwise his jurisdiction would often prove a dead <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a>. He also can and does hold his court in the body of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a>. So, likewise, the civil power may apprehend and try persons who may have been guilty of offences cognizable at common law, though committed in the fleet, in any port or harbour of Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, or at sea, provided such persons have not already been tried for such offences, either by court martial, or in the Admiralty Court; and in all ports, harbours, creeks, &c. lying in any county, the High Admiral and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SHERIFF\">sheriff</a>, or coroner, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> may be, have concurrent jurisdiction.\n\nThe Lord High Admiral is assisted in his judicial functions by the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> officers:\n\n1. The Vice-Admiral.\n2. The Judge.\n3. The Registrar.\n4. The Marshal.\n5. Advocate-general.\n6. Procurator-general.\n7. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNSELLOR\">Counsellor</a>.\n8. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLICITOR\">Solicitor</a>.\n\n1. The Vice-Admiral. This officer is the admiral's deputy, or lieutenant, mentioned in the statutes of 13th and 15th Richard II., and was the person most probably who presided in the court. At present the Vice-Admiral of England is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> sinecure, generally conferred on some naval officer of high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> and distinguished character in the service, having a salary attached to it in addition to his half pay of L. 469, 5s. 8d. per annum. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REAR\">Rear</a>-Admiral of England is the same, and the salary, in addition to his half pay, is L. 370, 4s. 3d. per annum. Each county of England has its Vice-Admiral, which is little more than an honorary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a>, though the patent gives to him all the powers vested in the Admiral himself. Similar powers were also granted to the judges of the Admiralty county courts; but this was found so inconvenient and prejudicial to those who had suits to commence or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFEND\">defend</a> before them, that the Duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a>, when Lord High Admiral in 1663, caused instructions to be drawn up in order to ascertain to each his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a>; whereby the whole judicial power remained with the judge, and the upholding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> of the Admiral, and levying and receiving his perquisites, &c. appertained to the Admiralty.\n\nVice-admiral.\n\nEach of the four provinces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a> has its Vice-Admiral: there is one Vice-Admiral for all Scotland, who has a salary of L. 1000 a-year on the ordinary estimate of the navy, and one for the Shetland and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORKNEY_ISLANDS\">Orkney islands</a>. The governor of most of our colonies has a commission of Vice-Admiral granted to him by the Lord High Admiral, or Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty; and generally a commission from the king, under the great seal, grounded on the 11th and 12th William III. and farther confirmed by 46th Geo. III. by which he is authorized to try all piracies, felonies, or robberies committed on the seas, where the parties are taken into custody in places remote from England; the court to consist of seven persons at the least, of which the governor, the lieutenant-governor, the vice-admiral, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAG\">flag</a>-officer, or commander in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUADRON\">squadron</a>, the members of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a>, the chief <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, judge of the vice admiralty court, captains of men of war, and secretary of the colony, are specially named in the commission; but any three of these, with four others selected from known merchants, factors, or planters, captains, lieutenants or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARRANT\">warrant</a>-officers of men of war, or captains, masters, or mates of merchant ships, constitute a legal court of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIRACY\">piracy</a>.\n\nThe Vice-Admiralty courts in the colonies are of two descriptions. The one has power to inquire into the causes of detention of enemies, or neutral vessels, to try and condemn the same for the benefit of the captors, as well as to take cognizance of all matters relating to the office of the Lord High Admiral. The other has power only to institute inquiries into misdemeanours committed in merchant vessels, and to determine petty suits, &c. and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> the privileges of the Admiral. The former are usually known by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIZE\">Prize</a> Courts; the latter by that of Instance Courts.\n\nThe following are the colonies and foreign possessions in which Prize Courts have been established in the course of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAST\">last</a> war. Gibraltar, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALTA\">Malta</a>, Newfoundland, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HALIFAX\">Halifax</a>, Bermuda, Bahama Islands, Barbadoes, Antigua, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TORTOLA\">Tortola</a>, Jamaica, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol4.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> of Good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">Hope</a>, Ceylon, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOMBAY\">Bombay</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MADRAS\">Madras</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CALCUTTA\">Calcutta</a>. The following colonies had Instance Courts only; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMINICA\">Dominica</a>, Grenada, St Vincents, St Christophers, Trinidad, St Cervix, Martinique, Berbice, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEMERARA\">Demerara</a>, and Essequibo; in addition to which is a court established at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIERRA_LEONE\">Sierra Leone</a> for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONDEMNATION\">condemnation</a> of captured slaves only.\n\nIn none of the patents to the Lord High Admiral, Vice-Admiral, or Judge, is any mention made of prize jurisdiction. Lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANSFIELD\">Mansfield</a> had occasion to search into the records of the Court of Admiralty in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOCTOR\">Doctor</a>'s Commons, to ascertain on what foundation this jurisdiction was exercised by the judge of the Admiralty, but he could not discover any prize-act books farther back than 1649: no sentences farther back than 1648. The Registrar could go no farther back than 1690. \"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> records,\" says his Lordship, \"are in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a>, illegible, and without index.\" The prize jurisdiction may therefore be considered as of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> authority, and distinct altogether from the ancient powers given to the Admi-\nAdmiralty. To constitute the authority for trying prize causes, a commission under the great seal issues to the Lord High Admiral, at the commencement of every war, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> and require the Court of Admiralty, and the lieutenant and judge of the said court, his surrogate or surrogates, to proceed upon all manner of captures, seizures, prizes, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REPRISALS\">reprisals</a>, of all ships and goods that are or shall be taken; and to hear and determine according to the course of the Admiralty, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW_OF_NATIONS\">law of nations</a>, and a warrant issues to the Judge of the Admiralty accordingly.\n\nThe Admiralty Court being in this respect a court in which foreigners of all nations may become suitors, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> may be had from its decisions to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMITTEE\">committee</a> of the Lords of His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJESTY\">Majesty</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-PRIVY_COUNCIL\">Privy Council</a>, who hear and determine according to the established laws of nations.\n\nAt the breaking out of a war, the Lord High Admiral also receives a special commission from the crown, under the great seal, to empower him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> letters of marque and reprisals against the enemy, he having no such power by his patent. These letters are either general or special;\u2014general, when granted to private men to fit out ships at their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> to annoy the enemy;\u2014special, when in the case of any of our merchants being robbed of their estates or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> by foreigners, the king grants them letters of reprisal against that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, though we may be in amity with it. Before the latter can be sued for, the complainant must have gone through the prosecution of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> in the courts of the state whose subjects have wronged him; where if justice be denied, or vexatiously delayed, he must first make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of his losses and charges in the Admiralty Court here; whereupon, if the King is satisfied he has pursued all lawful means to obtain redress, and his own interceding should produce no better effect, special letters of reprisal are granted; not, however, as must be evident, until a very strong case has been made out. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>, which we may now consider as obsolete, seems to be a remnant of the law of ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>, called androlepsia, by which, if a man was slain, the friends and relations of the deceased might <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> on any three citizens of the place where the murderer took refuge, and make them slaves, unless he was delivered up. Both Oliver Cromwell and King <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol6.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> II. have granted letters of reprisal. In 1638, the Duc d'Epernon seized on the ship Amity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, for the service of the French king against the Spaniards, promising full satisfaction; but none being made, the owners obtained letters of reprisal from the usurper, and afterwards, in 1665, from Charles II. In 1666, Captain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUTLER\">Butler</a> Barnes had letters of reprisal against the Danes. The Dutch having burnt six English merchant ships in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELBE\">Elbe</a>, within the territories of Hamburgh, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, instead of giving any assistance or protection, hindered the English from defending themselves, letters of reprisal were granted to the sufferers against that city. Lastly, one Justiniani, a noble Genoese, being indebted in a great sum to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMO\">Como</a>, a merchant in London, which he had several years solicited for, but could get no satisfaction, Captain Scott, commander of his Majesty's ship the Dragon, stationed at that time in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a>, received orders to make reprisals upon the ships of that republic; upon Admiralty, which the debt was paid.\n\n2. The Judge. The patents to the Judge of the Admiralty and Vice-Admiralty courts run pretty nearly in the same manner as those of the Lord High Admiral, and point out the several matters of which he can take cognizance. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> of 1640 established the office of Judge of the Admiralty court in three persons, with a salary of L.500 a-year to each. At the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESTORATION\">Restoration</a>, there were two judges of the High Court of Admiralty, which sometimes proved inconvenient; for when they differed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> no judgment could be had. These judges, before the Revolution, held their appointment only during <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>. At that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, Sir Charles Hedges was constituted judge under the great seal of England, quamdiu se bene gesserit, with a salary of L.400 a-year, and an additional L.400 out of the proceeds of prizes and perquisites of the Admiralty; but in the year 1725 the latter sum was diminished from the ordinary estimate by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUSE\">House</a> of Commons. Sir William Scott, the present judge, in consequence of the extraordinary increase of the business in the Admiralty Court, has a salary of L.2500 a-year on the ordinary estimate of the navy.\n\nThe judges of the Vice-Admiralty courts in certain of the colonies, limited by 41st George III., are allowed a salary not exceeding to each the sum of L.2000 a-year, to be paid out of the consolidated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUND\">fund</a> of Great Britain; together with profits and emoluments, not exceeding to each the further sum of L.2000 per annum out of the fees to be taken by the said judges, of which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> is directed to be hung up in some conspicuous place in the court; and no judge is to take any fee beyond those specified, directly or indirectly, on pain of forfeiture of his office, and being proceeded against for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTORTION\">extortion</a>: and on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RETIREMENT\">retirement</a> from office, after six years' service, his Majesty may, by authority of the act above mentioned, grant unto such judge an annuity for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> of his life, not exceeding L.1000 per annum. This liberal provision puts the judges of the colonial courts of Vice-Admiralty above all suspicion of their decisions being influenced by unworthy motives; a suspicion they were not entirely free from when their emoluments depended mainly on their fees.\n\nDuring the late war, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SESSION\">session</a> of oyer and terminer to try Admiralty causes was held at the Old Bailey twice a-year. The commission for this purpose is of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> with those that are granted to the judges when they go the circuits: that is to say, to determine and punish all crimes, offences, misdemeanours, and abuses; the end of both being the same, their limits different; the one relating to things done upon the land, the other to things done upon the water. The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, all the members of the Privy-Council, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">Chancellor</a> and all the judges, the Lords of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TREASURY\">Treasury</a>, the Secretary of the Admiralty, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURER\">Treasurer</a> and Commissioners of the navy, some of the Aldermen of London, and several Doctors of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CIVIL_LAW\">civil law</a>, are the members of this commission, any four of whom make a court, the quorum being the Lords of the Admiralty, Judge of the Admiralty, the Twelve Judges, and the Doctors of the civil law.\nThe session of oyer and terminer lasts generally from one to three days, and the court is entertained each day with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DINNER\">dinner</a> at the expense of the Lord High Admiral, that is to say, of the public.\n\nThe proceedings of the court are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> de die in diem, or, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a> of the court is, from tide to tide.\n\n3. The Registrar of the Admiralty has hitherto held his place by patent from the Lord High Admiral generally for life, though the admiral himself; and the Lords Commissioners of Admiralty hold their places only during pleasure; and what is still more remarkable, the office of Registrar has sometimes been granted, and is now vested in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVERSION\">reversion</a>. He had no salary; the amount of his emoluments depending on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of captures, droits, &c., condemned by the court; which, during the late war, were so enormous, that in 1810, an act was passed for regulating the offices of Registrars of Admiralty and prize courts, by which it is enacted, \"that no office of registrar of the high court of admiralty, or of the high court of appeals for prizes, or high court of delegates in Great Britain, shall, after the expiration of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> now vested in possession or reversion therein, be granted for a longer term than during pleasure, nor be executed by deputy; that an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> be kept in the said offices respectively of all the fees, dues, perquisites, emoluments, and profits received by and on account of the said Registrars, out of which all the expenses of their offices are to be paid; that one-third of the surplus shall belong to the Registrar and to his assistant, (if an assistant should be necessary,) and the remaining two-thirds to the consolidated fund of Great Britain, to be paid quarterly into the Exchequer, the account of such surplus to be presented to the court at least fourteen days before each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> day, and verified on oath.\"\n\n4. The Marshal. This officer receives his appointment from the Lord High Admiral or Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, and holds his situation by patent under the seal of the High Court of Admiralty, during pleasure. His duties are to arrest ships and persons, to imprison in the Marshalsea, to bear the mace before the judge, and to attend executions. His emoluments depend chiefly on the number of prizes brought into port for condemnation, and the number of ships embargoed, and may probably be reckoned in time of war, communibus annis, from L. 1500 to L. 2000 a year, out of which he has to pay about L. 400 a year to a deputy. In peace, the whole emoluments are probably not sufficient for the payment of the deputy's salary.\n\n5. The Advocate-General. This officer is appointed by warrant of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty. His duties are, to appear for the Lord High Admiral in his Court of Admiralty, Court of Delegates, and other courts; to move and debate in all causes wherein the rights of the Admiral are concerned, for which he had ancienly a salary of twenty marks a year, and an additional allowance granted to him in 1695, of L. 200 a year. At present he has L. 213, 6s. 8d. a year, voted on the ordinary estimate of the navy. Formerly, the Admiral's Advocate was always retained as leading <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNSEL\">counsel</a>, but since the droits were transferred to the crown, he has gradually been supplanted by the King's Advocate, who is generally retained in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, the Admiralty Advocate acting only as junior counsel; and while the former makes sometimes from L. 15,000 to L. 20,000 a year, the latter rarely receives from his professional duties more than from L. 1500 to L. 2000 a year. This difference however, may probably be owing in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> character of the men who hold the two situations.\n\n6. The Procurator. The Admiralty's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROCTOR\">Proctor</a> stands precisely in the same situation to the King's Proctor, that his advocate does to that of the King, though there is not quite so great a difference in their emoluments. They act as the attorneys or solicitors in all causes concerning the King's and the Lord High Admiral's affairs in the High Court of Admiralty and other courts. All prize causes are conducted by the King's Proctor, which the captors are disposed to consider as a grievance, but which the gentlemen of Doctors Commons on the contrary maintain to be for their convenience and advantage. It is supposed, that in some years of the war, the King's Proctor did not receive less than L. 20,000 a year.\n\n7. The Counsel of the Admiralty is the law officer who is chiefly consulted on matters connected with the military duties of the Lord High Admiral; his salary is L. 100 a year besides his fees, which, in time of war, may be reckoned to amount from L. 1200 to L. 1800 a year.\n\n8. The Solicitor to the Admiralty, is also an officer more immediately connected with the military functions of the Admiralty. He is stated sometimes assistant to the counsel; his salary is L. 400 in lieu of all fees; and his disbursements for the naval departments in time of war, amount to L. 14,000 or L. 15,000 a year.\n\nThe Judge Advocate of the fleet is a sinecure appointment, with a salary of L. 182, 10s. a year, on the ordinary estimate of the navy; but the Deputy Judge Advocate resides at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PORTSMOUTH\">Portsmouth</a>, and assists at all courts martial held at that port, for which he is allowed an annual salary of L. 146. See Navy, in this Supplement.","sp":281,"ep":285},{"h":"THIS COUNTY BY NO","t":"s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTY\">County</a> by no means abounds with wood; nor are fruit-trees cultivated in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> abundance, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> with very much success. Of the apple, however, several new, and valuable varieties have lately been introduced, and advantageously cultivated.\n\nAntrim has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> been distinguished for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol13.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> manufacture; but latterly, the manufacture of cotton has, in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, supplanted it, especially in the vicinity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELFAST\">Belfast</a>. In the year 1800, about 23 years after the introduction of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COTTON_MANUFACTURE\">cotton manufacture</a>, 13,500 people were directly employed in it; and including all manner of persons occupied in it in various ways, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> was 27,000, within a circuit of 10 miles; comprehending, however, the towns of Belfast, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LISBURN\">Lisburn</a>. The cotton <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol20.html#article-YARN\">yarn</a> is chiefly brought from Scotland.\n\nThe linen manufacture, notwithstanding, is still the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAPLE\">staple</a> manufacture of Antrim. It is a peculiarity of this manufacture, as it is established in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>, that it does not remove the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEASANT\">peasant</a> from the comforts and healthiness of rural life. In Antrim, the weaver and the labourer of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> are united in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSON\">person</a>. Many weavers have small farms, and only employ themselves in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEAVING\">weaving</a> during the intervals of their farming occupations; and almost all who pursue this trade, possess gardens, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> for potatoes. Many of the houses have three looms, which cost from four to five guineas each: Children are hired to attend a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOOM\">loom</a> at from 13s. to 17s. the half year, with diet, washing, and lodging: they bring a weaver eight guineas per annum. A good weaver <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WILL\">will</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> 10s. per web, and if he worked every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, he could weave a web in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>. A loom will employ four spinners, who are all females, and will spin five hanks in a week, the price of which is 2s. 8\u00bdd.\n\nThe consumption of food per week, by a manufacturing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, consisting of six persons, in this Peasantry County, is 3\u00bd bushels of potatoes; 14 herrings; 9 quarts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>; and one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>: the cost of which may be estimated at five shillings. The expense of a family, consisting of the same number of persons, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of which works at agricultural labours, will be 7s. 6d. per week, as he occasionally uses meat, milk, and pork.\n\nThere is a considerable salmon-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISHING\">fishing</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of Antrim, at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARRICK\">Carrick</a>-a-rede. This Fishing place is separated from the mainland by a chasm 60 feet in width, over which, every year, at the commencement of the fishery, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a> formed of two strong cables, and a number of boards, is thrown.\n\nThe antiquities of this County consist of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CAIRNS\">cairns</a>, cromlechs, mounts, forts, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> remains, round towers, &c. There are three round towers, viz., one near the town of Antrim; one at Ardmore; and one in Ram <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">Island</a>, in Lough Neagh. A few years ago, a double <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATERA\">patera</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>, weighing 19 ounces, 10 dwts. was found in this County.\n\nThe number of houses in the County of Antrim, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">Population</a> in the year 1777, was 22,184; of which 20,519 paid for one hearth; 3667 for two or more; 1066 were newly inhabited; and 3002 belonged to paupers. In the year 1788 the number of houses was 28,254, and the population was estimated at 160,000. At this rate there were about 13 acres to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, and about 48 persons on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILE\">mile</a>. In the year 1791, the number of houses was 30,514, of which 22,353 paid for one hearth, and 8746 were inhabited by paupers. The number of men returned, in the year 1810, between the ages of 16 and 45, fit to serve in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITIA\">militia</a>, was 24,425. Mr Dubourdieu, in his Statistical Survey of Antrim, estimates the present population at 240,000.\n\nAntrim is supposed to contain a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> of Protestants than any other County in Ireland; and of the Protestants a very great majority is Presbyterian; being connected with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">General</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYNOD\">Synod</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ULSTER\">Ulster</a>, or with the Burghers and Antiburghers of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">Church</a> of Scotland.
