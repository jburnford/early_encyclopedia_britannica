In 1648, as the Russians assert, a person named Deschneew sailed from the river Kalyma, and passed round <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> Shelatskoi to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KAMTSCHATKA\">Kamtschatka</a>. His account of this voyage was generally discredited in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, and scarcely engaged any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> in Russia itself; where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> were taken to verify the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NARRATION\">narration</a> till the year 1725, when Behrings was equipped for northern discovery, and, in 1728, succeeded in passing through the straits separating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a> from America, which have since borne his name. In that and the following year, with Tschirkoff and Spangberg, he reached the latitude 67\u00b0 18', and next year explored the Kurile <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">Islands</a>. In 1730 and 1731, Gwosdew and Krupischew made the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> of America, in latitude 66\u00b0, and Behrings himself that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> which lies in latitude 58\u00b0 28'. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> Cook, in 1778, explored the whole of this coast, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> as latitude 70\u00b0 44'; and has since been followed by the other English navigators Clarke, Vancouver, Dixon, Portlock, and Meares; by the Frenchman Peyrouse, and by the Russian Billings. These several officers have given names to the different capes, inlets, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>. The Russian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> was desirous to appropriate to itself the beneficial trade in furs which this extensive district furnished. With this view the American <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">Company</a> was formed in 1799. It soon established its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-FACTORY\">factory</a> on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> Kodjah, and founded several smaller dependant branches along the American shore from latitude 55\u00b0, and even to Badoga, in latitude 38\u00b0 50', in the vicinity of the Spanish settlements. It does not appear, by any accounts that have reached us, how far the government of Russia laid claim to the exclusive right of trading with those countries till the year 1822; when an Ukase was issued, asserting a right, not only to the whole coast from latitude 51\u00b0 northwards, but to the seas which border them, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of 100 leagues from the shores. Notice to this effect has been formally given to the British and United <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">States</a>' ships; and the trade hitherto carried on by them has been prohibited. The British claim the whole coast from latitude 51\u00b0 to 56\u00b0 30'; whilst the Americans have some pretensions to portions of it.\n\nWithout entering farther into the different views which may be entertained by the several claimants to the dominion of the countries, designated by us as New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ALBION\">Albion</a>, New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HANOVER\">Hanover</a>, New Cornwall, and New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORFOLK\">Norfolk</a>, we shall consider the territory of Russia as extending from 56\u00b0 30' to 71\u00b0 north; and from the point of Alaska to Mackenzie's River from west to east; thus extending over 14\u00b0 30' of latitude, and 27\u00b0 40' of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a>. Unless we knew the trending of the land between Mackenzie's River and Behring's Straits, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be ascertained <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> Captain Parry should succeed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of his present voyage, any estimate of its extent can only be an approximation to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>. The medium calculation would make it extend over 512,000 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> miles. The several Russian factories on this coast contain from 800 to 1000 people on the whole, who traffic with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABORIGINES\">Aborigines</a> for peltry, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> such of them as have been reduced to obedience, and a kind of civilization, as to the spots which they shall select for hunting.

A rich people is the foundation of a rich <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURY\">treasury</a>. Public wealth is merely a portion of private wealth transferred from individuals to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">Government</a>; and the greater the wealth of individuals, the greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be the magnitude of the portion they can conveniently spare for public purposes.\n\nThough <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-TAXATION\">taxation</a> be necessary, it ought always to be kept within the narrowest limits possible. All taxes occasion inconvenience and privations. The best are those which are lightest; but there are none so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> as not to be productive either of an increase of toil, or of a diminution of enjoyments, or of fortune. All taxes must ultimately <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> either on the revenue of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, or on its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> or stock. Perhaps there is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> one tax whose produce has not been partly derived from the one of these funds, and partly from the other. There can be no doubt, however, that by far the largest proportion of all taxes judiciously imposed, and not carried to too great a height, is paid out of revenue. The desire which every one has to preserve his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>, stimulates most people to exert themselves to defray their taxes, either by increased industry, or by making a corresponding diminution in their expenditure, without allowing them to encroach on their capitals. But the power to make increased exertions, and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> from expense, though not easily defined, is not illimitable. Every fresh increase of taxation must obviously contribute to its exhaustion: and whenever this has been effected, whenever the burden of taxation is not fully compensated by increased production, or increased saving, it must encroach on the means of future production, and the country will begin to retrograde. Taxation, when carried to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, is one of the severest scourges to which any people can be subjected. By diminishing capital, or the funds destined to support productive industry, it lessens the revenue of the people, the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUND\">fund</a> out of which taxes can be permanently paid; and thus lays the sure foundation of national poverty and disgrace, in the destruction of individual fortunes. Like falling bodies, which are precipitated with a constantly and rapidly increasing velocity, a system of taxation acting on capital multiplies pauperism and distress in a geometrical proportion, and destroys alike the desire and the means to reproduce.\n\nIt would, however, be an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> to suppose, that a tax is necessarily a tax on capital, because it is laid on capital, or a tax on income, because it is laid on income. A moderate tax laid on capital may be, and generally is, defrayed out of a saving of income; while an oppressive tax laid on income has in most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> to be paid from capital. But of all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of taxes, those are plainly the most injurious which necessarily fall on capital, without giving the contributors an opportunity to defray them from revenue. Every such tax, by diminishing the funds for the maintenance of labour, must in so far diminish the future taxable income of the country. The legacy-duty is, as we shall afterwards show, chiefly censurable on this ground.\n\nMost of the writers on finance, patronized by the Governments of the different European countries, have laboured to show that taxation is never a cause of diminished production; but that, on the contrary, every new tax creates a new ability in the subject to bear it, and that every increase of the public burdens becomes the cause of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> increase in the industry of the people. The fallacy and absurdity of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> has been ably exposed by Mr Hume in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> on Taxes. It is indeed true, as we have already stated, that the desire to preserve their capitals unimpaired, and to improve their condition, will stimulate most men to endeavour to discharge the burden of a moderate tax, by an increase of labour and exertion, or by a saving in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of unproductive expenditure, without allowing it to encroach on their capitals, or even to lessen the rate at which they may have been previously increasing them. But although this holds good in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of moderate taxes, we are not to conclude from thence that it continues to hold good to whatever extent they may be carried! An individual might be able to defray a tax of L.50, by increased exertion and economy, while it might be utterly impossible for him to defray a tax of twice or three times that amount without sacrificing a portion of his capital. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> is, that the effect of exorbitant taxes is not to stimulate industry, but to destroy it. No <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> will ever be really and perseveringly industrious, whose industry does not yield him a visible increase of comforts and enjoyments. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> taxation be carried so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> as to swallow the whole, or even the greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a>, of the produce of industry above what is required to furnish us with more necessaries, it must, by destroying the hope and the means of rising in the world, take away the most powerful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a> to industry and frugality, and, instead of producing increased exertion, will produce only despair. The stimulus given by excessive taxation to industry has been not unaptly compared to the stimulus given by the lash to the labour of the slave\u2014a stimulus which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> of all ages and nations has proved to be as ineffective as it is inhuman, when compared to that which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a> of improving his condition, and of enjoying the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> of his industry without molestation, gives to the productive energies of the moderately taxed citizen of a free state.\n\nIt would be easy to illustrate the effects of oppressive taxation in destroying industry, by references to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> of most European nations.*\n\n* For an instructive account of the effect of heavy taxes on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> and industry of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, see the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of M. Luzac, De la Richesse de la Hollande.\nGeneral Ob-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a> they have been particularly fatal. The decline of that country has been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> ascribed to the expulsion of the Jews and Moors, and to the emigrations to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>. But had the policy of the Spanish Government been otherwise sufficiently liberal\u2014had industry been properly protected, and moderate and equal taxes levied, the losses occasioned by the expulsion of so many of her most industrious citizens would have been gradually repaired, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMIGRATION\">emigration</a> to America would have acted only as a stimulus to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a>. But oppressive taxes have not only prevented Spain from recovering from the wounds inflicted on her by the bigotry of her rulers, but have gone far to extinguish the very spirit of industry. Of the taxes most instrumental in producing this effect, the alcavala is justly entitled to the pre-eminence. The alcavala is a tax originally of ten, but subsequently of fourteen per cent., <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> on all commodities, whether raw or manufactured, as often as they are sold, and rated always according to their selling price. Such a monstrous impost was of itself sufficient to annihilate all industry. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a> of Castile and the other provinces subjected to its destroying influence were irretrievably ruined.\n\nAnd Ustariz, Ulloa, and Campomanes, Spanish authors of the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a>, agree in opinion with Mr Townsend, that it is to their exemption from this odious tax that the comparatively flourishing state of industry in Catalonia and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VALENCIA\">Valencia</a> is entirely to be ascribed.\n\nBesides contending that the effect of taxes is to create a new ability in the people to bear them, the Government financiers have also contended that the value of the taxes is not really lost to the consumers, but that it is again restored to them by the expenditure of Government and its agents! And notwithstanding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> and almost obvious fallacy which this statement involves, it still forms the substance of the answers most commonly made to those who complain of the injurious effects of heavy taxes. To show its absurdity, let us suppose that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">farmer</a> is taxed to the extent of L.50, and let us endeavour to ascertain whether the expenditure of this sum by the public functionary, or individual to whom it has been paid by the tax-gatherer, affords any compensation to the farmer for its loss. If the receiver of the tax does not lay it out on commodities produced by the farmer, it is obvious it cannot again return to him, and he can derive no advantage whatever from its expenditure. But let us suppose, which is the most favourable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> for the argument we are combating, that the tax receiver comes to the farmer to buy produce from him, and let us trace the successive steps and effect of the whole transaction. First of all, then, the farmer sold as much corn, or other produce, as was worth L.50; he next paid away these L.50 to a tax-gatherer; and the person who received the L.50 from the tax-gatherer now comes to the farmer and offers them back to him, on condition of his receiving an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> in corn or other produce.\n\nThis is the way in which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> drawn from the General Ob-pockets of the public by taxation always reverts to them; and if it enriches any one, it is obvious it must do so by making him pay twice for the same sum of money! It is to no purpose to endeavour to escape from this reductio <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-AD\">ad</a> absurdum, by telling us that industry is always benefited by every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of the market, and that the consumption of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> and sailors is advantageous, because it increases demand! To benefit industry a market must be a real, not a nominal one\u2014it must be one in which the demanders have themselves produced the equivalents they offer for commodities. It is plainly absurd to suppose that either individuals or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> can ever receive the smallest benefit from the demand of those whom they have been previously obliged to furnish with the means of buying. Such, however, is always the case with the demand of those who live on the produce of taxation; and to keep up useless regiments and overgrown establishments, on pretence of encouraging and stimulating industry by increasing demand, is to the full as inconsequential and irrational, as if a shopkeeper were to attempt to increase his business and get rich, by furnishing his customers with money to buy his goods.\n\nThe fallacy of the doctrine against which we have been contending has been forcibly illustrated by Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAMILTON\">Hamilton</a>. \"To argue,\" says he, \"that the money raised in taxes being spent among those who pay it, is, therefore, no loss to them, is no less absurd than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of a housebreaker, who, being convicted of carrying off a merchant's money, should plead that he did him no injury, for the money would be returned to him in the purchase of the commodities in which he dealt.\"\n\nIt is obvious, therefore, that the services rendered by the public functionaries, or by those who receive taxes, form the only compensation given by them to those who pay them. And when neither the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> nor the salary of those functionaries is too great, these services are a sufficient return for the sums they receive. But every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHILLING\">shilling</a> that is drawn from the people by means of taxes, to be expended in maintaining unnecessary functionaries, or in paying them higher salaries than would suffice to procure the services of others, is absolutely and totally lost to them\u2014as much so as if it were thrown into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> or the fire.\n\nThat security, protection, and good government, which it is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of taxation to procure, are highly valuable, cannot be disputed. But they are like all other values\u2014the smaller the sacrifice for which they can be obtained, so much the better. Every means by which the expences of Government can be diminished and taxation reduced, is an advantage to the public precisely of the same kind that a diminution in the cost of procuring any useful or agreeable commodity is to an individual. There is really no mystery whatever in the manner in which Government is supported and taxation operates.\n\n* This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOPHISM\">sophism</a> is equally well exposed in the Lettres d'un Citoyen sur les Vingtiemes, &c. (p. 113), published in 1768.\nGeneral Ob-Government is not a producer: its expenditure is not defrayed from the produce of its own labour, but from the produce of the labour of its subjects. And hence it is obvious, that the higher the expenses of Government become, the deeper must they encroach on the income or capital of its subjects; and conversely. In other words, all countries are impoverished by an increase of taxation, and enriched by its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a>: and M. Say is perfectly correct when he says, that the best system of finance is to spend little; and the best of all taxes, the least.\n\nLe meilleur de tous les plans de finance est de d\u00e9penser peu, et le meilleur de tous les imp\u00f4ts est le plus petit.\n\nVarious and very discordant opinions have been entertained respecting the ultimate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INCIDENCE\">incidence</a> and effect of particular taxes. Mr Locke in England, and M. Quesnay and his followers in France and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, contended that all taxes, in whatever manner they might be imposed, fell ultimately on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a>. This erroneous opinion proceeded from their supposing the industry employed in the cultivation of the land to be the only really productive species of industry; whereas it is in no respect more productive than the rest. The truth is, that every burden, directly or indirectly, affecting those engaged in the production of any class of commodities, falls ultimately on its consumers. A tax on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-HATS\">hats</a>, for example, must raise the price of hats, as a tax upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a> must raise the price of shoes; for, if this were not the case, the profits of the hatter and shoemaker would be reduced below the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a>; and as there can be no reason why they should be satisfied with a lower rate of profits than their neighbours, they would begin to withdraw their capital from such losing businesses, and would continue to do so until the diminution of the supply of their particular commodities had raised their prices to their proper height, or to such a height as would yield them the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> profits of stock exclusive of the tax. There are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> limits, however, to the extent to which taxes on commodities can be carried; and their effects are widely different according as they are laid on commodities required for the consumption of the labouring class, or on those which are exclusively consumed by the higher classes. But before proceeding to examine the effects of particular taxes, we shall make a few observations on the following maxims laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> by Dr Smith with regard to all taxes, and which are drawn up with singular judgment and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPREHENSION\">comprehension</a>, viz:\n\nFirst maxim. \"The subjects of every state ought to contribute towards the support of the government, as nearly as possible, in proportion to their respective abilities; that is, in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state. The expense of Government to the individuals of a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> is like the expense of management to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> tenants of a great estate. In the observation or neglect of this maxim consists what is called the equality or inequality of taxation.\"\n\nSecond, \"The tax which each individual is bound to pay ought to be certain, and not arbitrary. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of payment, the manner of payment, the quantity to be paid, ought all to be clear and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> to the General Ob-contributor and to every other person. When it is otherwise, every person subject to the tax is put, more or less, in the power of the tax-gatherer, who can either aggravate the tax upon any obnoxious contributor, or extort, by the terror of such aggravation, some present or perquisite to himself. The uncertainty of taxation encourages the insolence and favours the corruption of an order of men who are naturally unpopular, even where they are neither insolent nor corrupt. The certainty of what each individual ought to pay is, in taxation, of so great importance, that a very considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of inequality, it appears, I believe, from the experience of all nations, is not near so great an evil as a very small degree of uncertainty.\"\n\nThird, \"Every tax ought to be levied at the time and in the manner in which it is most likely to be convenient for the contributor to pay it. A tax upon the rent of land, or of houses, payable at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> at which rents are usually paid, is levied at the time when it is most likely to be convenient for the contributor to pay, or when he is most likely to have wherewithal to pay. Taxes upon such consumable goods as are articles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a> are all finally paid by the consumer, and generally in a manner that is very convenient for him. He buys them by little and little, as he has occasion to buy the goods; and as he is at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, too, either to buy or not to buy as he pleases, it must be his own fault if he ever suffers any considerable inconvenience from such taxes.\"\n\nFourth, \"Every tax ought to be so contrived as both to take out and to keep out of the pockets of the people as little as possible, over and above what it brings into the public treasury of the state.\"\u2014(Wealth of Nations, III. p. 255.)\n\nA system of taxation may be pronounced to be either good or bad, according as it approaches to or recedes from these maxims. For example, the great defect in the system of taxation in France and Spain under the old r\u00e9gime, consisted not so much in its magnitude, or in the oppressive manner in which it was collected, as in its inequality. Instead of all the citizens contributing to supply the wants of the state in proportion to their respective abilities, those who had the largest fortunes, and who, consequently, derived the greatest advantage from the security and protection afforded by Government, were entirely relieved from the burden of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> taxation. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a> and clergy, at the same time that they engrossed every situation of power and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol6.html#article-EMOLUMENT\">emolument</a> to themselves, were, as far as possible, exempted from contributing any thing to the support of Government. And it is now no longer a question that the disgust occasioned by this inequality of taxation, the impatience of the feudal privileges of the nobility, and the desire of equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a>, were the leading causes of those revolutions which have made so much havoc amongst the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> institutions of the Continent.\n\nThe system of taxation generally established in Eastern countries has the defect of not corresponding with the second maxim laid down by Dr Smith. The amount of the contribution is fluctuating and arbitrary, not fixed and certain. In despotic coun-\nSir Robert Walpole appears to have had a very clear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> of the injurious consequences of this system; and it was the object of the famous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXCISE\">Excise</a> Scheme, proposed by him in 1733, to allow the importers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOBACCO\">tobacco</a> and wine to deposit them in public warehouses, and to relieve them from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of paying the duties chargeable on such commodities until they chose to withdraw them for home consumption. The celebrity of this scheme, and the misconceptions that have been so very generally entertained respecting it, incline us to think that we shall only be gratifying our readers by quoting the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> from the speech made by Sir Robert on submitting his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> to the consideration of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">House</a> of Commons.\n\n\"The duties now payable upon tobacco, on importation,\" said Sir Robert, \"amount to 6d. and one-third part of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PENNY\">penny</a> per <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>; all which must be paid down in ready money upon importation, with the allowance of ten per cent. upon prompt payment; or otherwise there must be bonds given, with sufficient sureties, for the payment thereof; which is often a great loss to the public, and is always a great inconvenience to the merchant importer. Whereas, by what I am to propose, the whole duties to be paid for the future will amount to no more than 4d. and three farthings per pound weight; and this duty not to be paid till the tobacco comes to be sold for home consumption. So that, if the merchant exports his tobacco, he will be quite free from all payment of duty, or giving bond therefor, or finding out proper sureties for joining in such bond: he will have nothing to do but unload his tobacco on board a ship for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPORTATION\">exportation</a>, without being at the trouble to attend, for having his bonds cancelled, or for taking out debentures for the drawbacks; all which, I conceive, must be a great ease to the fair trader; and to every such trader, the preventing of frauds must be a great advantage, because it will put all the tobacco traders in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> upon the same footing; which is but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> and equal, and what ought certainly to be accomplished, if it be possible.\n\n\"Now, in order to make this ease effectual to the fair trader, and to contribute to his advantage by preventing as much as possible any frauds in time to come, I propose, as I have said, to join the laws of excise to those of the customs, and to leave the one penny, or rather three farthings, per pound, called the further subsidy, to be still charged at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM_HOUSE\"><a class=\"xr</a>ef\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>-house upon the importation of any tobacco; which three farthings shall be payable to his Majesty's civil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIST\">list</a> as heretofore. And I propose, that all tobacco, for the future, after being weighed at the custom-house, and charged with the said three farthings per pound, shall be lodged in a warehouse or warehouses, to be appointed by the commissioners of the excise for that purpose, of which\n\n* For an excellent account of the effects of the arbitrary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of Eastern taxation, see Volney, Voyage en Syrie, Tom. II. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>. 38, and cap. 37.\nGeneral Ob-warehouse the merchant importer shall have one observation on lock and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KEY\">key</a>, and the warehouse-keeper to be appointed by the said commissioners shall have another, in order that the tobacco may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> safe in that warehouse till the merchant finds a market for it, either for exportation or home-consumption. And if his market be for exportation, he may apply to his warehouse-keeper, and take out as much for that purpose as he has occasion for, which, when weighed at the custom-house, shall be discharged of the three farthings per pound with which it was charged upon importation; so that the merchant may then export it without any farther trouble. But if his market be for home-consumption, that he shall then pay the three farthings charged upon it at the custom-house upon importation; and that then, upon calling his warehouse-keeper, he may deliver it to the buyer, on paying an inland duty of 4d. per pound weight to the proper officer appointed to receive the same.\"\n\nSir Robert concluded his speech by saying, \"I look upon this as a most innocent scheme; it can be hurtful to none but smugglers and unfair traders. I am certain it will be of great benefit to the revenue, and will tend to make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> a free port, and, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, the market of the world. If I had thought otherwise of it, I should never have ventured to propose it in this place.\"\n\nNothing can be more clear and explicit than this statement; and no doubt can now remain in the mind of any one, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADOPTION\">adoption</a> of the scheme would have been of the greatest advantage to the commerce and revenue of the country. But such and so powerful was the delusion <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> in the public mind with respect to it, that its proposal had well nigh caused a rebellion. Most of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> had availed themselves of the facilities which the existing system afforded of defrauding the revenue; and they dexterously endeavoured to thwart the success of a scheme which would have given a serious check to such practices, by making the public believe that it would be fatal to the commercial prosperity of the country. The efforts of the merchants were powerfully assisted by the spirit of party, which then ran very high. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> opponents of the ministry, anxious for an opportunity to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> them in the public estimation, contended that the scheme was only the first step towards the introduction of such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> system of excise, as would inevitably prove alike subversive of the comfort and liberty of the subject! In consequence of these artful misrepresentations, the most violent clamours were everywhere excited against the scheme. On one occasion the minister narrowly escaped falling a sacrifice to the ungovernable fury of the mob, which beset all the avenues to the House of Commons: and after many violent and lengthened debates, the scheme was ultimately abandoned.\n\nThe disadvantages of the old plan, and the benefits General Ob to be derived from the establishment of the warehouses, were very clearly and forcibly stated by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAN\">Dean</a> Tucker in his Essay on the Comparative Advantages and Disadvantages of Great Britain and France with respect to Trade; published in 1750. But so powerful was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> made by the violent opposition to Sir Robert Walpole's scheme, and such is the force of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> and ignorant prejudice, that it was not until 1803 that this obvious and signal improvement\u2014the greatest, perhaps, that has been made in the financial and commercial system of the country\u2014was adopted.\n\nThe comparative facility and cheapness with which taxes can be collected, ought to be particularly attended to in their imposition. Every tax should, as Dr Smith has stated in his fourth maxim, be contrived so as to take out, and keep out, of the pockets of the people as little as possible above what it puts into the public treasury. The principle of this maxim is obvious\u2014it is the nett produce of taxation, or the sum which it yields after the expenses of collection are deducted, that is alone applicable to national purposes; and to impose taxes which it costs a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> to collect, is to impose a heavy burden on the people for the sake of a small advantage to Government. It is stated by Sully, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a>, as an unquestionable fact, that the expense of collecting a nett revenue of thirty millions of livres in France in 1598, cost the enormous sum of 120 millions; or, in other words, that of a sum of 150 millions taken from the people by means of taxation, only thirty millions found their way into the coffers of the treasury! Under the administration of M. Necker, a revenue of about 557 millions of livres was collected at an expence of 58 millions; being about 10% per cent.\n\nThe expence of collecting the public revenue of Great Britain, for the year ended the 5th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1822, amounted to L.6, 6s. 7d. per cent. on the nett produce; while in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a> its expence for the same year amounted to L.22, 2s. 9d. per cent. or to more than three times as much as in England. A good deal of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of expence must be ascribed to the different situation of the two countries; but a good deal is also owing to the more defective system of taxation established in Ireland, and to the greater corruption of the officers. The difference in the cost of collecting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POST_OFFICE\"><a class=\"x</a>ref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POST\">Post</a>-office revenue of the two countries is the most extraordinary. In Britain the nett produce for the year ended 5th January 1822 was collected at an expence of L.38, 18s. 10d. per cent.; while in Ireland it cost L.148, 4s. 10d. per cent.! The adoption of the plans and suggestions of the commissioners appointed to inquire into the state of Irish revenue, will undoubtedly be productive of a great saving in the expence of its collection.\n\nTaxes may be collected by officers employed by\n\n---\n\n* Tindal's Continuation of Rapin, VIII. p. 154. ed. 1769; Coxe's Sir R. Walpole, I. p. 372, 4to ed. Had the resolutions with respect to tobacco been carried, those regarding wine, which were to have been exactly similar, would have been proposed.\nGovernment to receive them directly from the contributors; or Government may let them in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARM\">farm</a> to individuals for a rent certain, giving to such individuals or their servants the power of collecting them. The question, Which of these modes of collection should be adopted? depends on a variety of circumstances, and does not admit of any general solution. Where a tax is very well defined, and its collection may be effected without requiring any very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> inspection of the private concerns of individuals, it may be almost uniformly farmed with advantage. In such a case the proceedings of the farmers could not excite the prejudices of the contributors; and the greater skill and economy with which all businesses carried on by individuals on their own account are conducted, would enable the farmers to pay, exclusive of the profits made by them, a larger sum to Government on account of the tax, than it would have any chance of receiving from its own agents. But if a tax were not very well defined, or if it required a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of the affairs of individuals to assess it fairly, there cannot, we think, be a doubt that it ought to be directly collected by the servants of Government. It is indeed extremely probable that such a tax would be more productive were it farmed; but this, though an important one, is not the only consideration to be attended to. All taxes which occasion any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> into the private concerns of individuals are necessarily unpopular; and it is obvious that this unpopularity must be immeasurably greater when these investigations are conducted by those who have a direct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> in prosecuting them with the greatest strictness, than when they are conducted by the agents of Government\u2014by persons who, in most cases, derive none, and in all cases only a very slender benefit from the increased productivity of the tax. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of the people would most assuredly ascribe much of the hardship of such taxes to the vigilance and keenness of the farmers; and would be disposed to believe that a considerable portion of their produce went into their pockets, and that they were not only assessed to defray the charges of the State, but to add to the fortunes of a class of persons who are universally objects of popular indignation. We admit that these suspicions and complaints are in most cases totally destitute of foundation. The farmers can only enforce payment of a tax according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a> imposing it; and if its pressure is either unequal or severe, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of its collection vexatious and troublesome, it is plain the fault lies with those who imposed it, and not with the farmers. But however groundless the public prejudice against the farmers of the revenue may be supposed to be, it is one which will always exist, and ought to be respected. Perhaps we overrate its influence; but really we have very little doubt that, had an income-tax of 5 or 6 per cent., let in farm, been established in the place of the late income-tax of 10 per cent., it would have been generally considered as the most oppressive and vexatious of the two! Although, therefore, we cannot concur with Dr Smith, in his opinion, that all taxes ought to be collected by the officers of Government (III. p. 386), neither can we concur with Mr Bentham, who has endeavoured to prove that farming is in every case the preferable mode of collection. (Theorie des Peines et des Recompenses, Tome II. p. 209.) We certainly think that all taxes laid on such articles as stamped <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, houses, windows, horses, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARRIAGES\">carriages</a>, &c., and perhaps also the duties on exportation and importation, might be very advantageously collected by letting them to farmers; but any attempt to farm taxes on income, or taxes which require an examination of and interference with private affairs, would excite the most violent clamour and irritation, and could not be otherwise than pernicious.\n\nThe corv\u00e9e system, or the compelling of individuals to execute public works by requisitions of labour, is one of the worst species of taxation. Those who get no pay for their labour, and who are made to work against their will, waste their time and industry; and there is, besides, a very great loss incurred by the interruption of the regular pursuits of the labourers. When Turgot entered on his administration, he sent a circular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">Road</a>-surveyors and Engineers of the different provinces of France, ordering them to transmit estimates, framed on the most liberal scale, of the sums of money for which the usual repairs might be made on the old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a>, and the ordinary number of new ones constructed. The aggregate of the different estimates showed that a money contribution of about ten millions of livres a-year would suffice for the repair and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of all the roads in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>; whereas Turgot showed, that the execution of these repairs and constructions by contributions of forced-labour, or corv\u00e9es, cost not less than forty millions, or four times as much as the other! (Say, Trait\u00e9 d'Economie Politique, II. p. 345.)\n\nThe method of repairing roads, by contributions of labour instead of money, was at one time general throughout <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, and is still acted on in many countries. In Scotland the agricultural population of the country were compelled, by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> passed in 1669, to work six days each year at the public roads. This contribution was denominated statute-labour, and was commuted, in the early part of the reign of his late Majesty, for a tax on land, rated according to its valuation in the cess-books. This commutation has been productive of the greatest advantage. Previously to its taking place, our roads were, perhaps, the very worst, and they have since become among the very best in Europe.\n\nPART II.\u2014DIRECT TAXES.\n\nIt is impossible, for the reasons we have stated in the previous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">section</a>, to regard such taxes as really fall on capital as a permanent source of public income. Capital consists of that portion of the produce of industry which has been saved from immediate consumption, and which is applied partly to maintain those who are engaged in the great work of production, and partly to facilitate their labours. It is by its amount that the amount of the productive industry of every country must always be regulated. And such being the case, it is plain that whatever has a tendency to diminish capital, or to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> it into revenue, must, by diminishing the means of em-\nploying and facilitating labour, and consequently the annual produce of the country, be a most fruitful source of pauperism and misery. This, however, would be the precise effect of taxes on capital; and it is for this reason that they ought always to be regarded in the light of an extraordinary resource, and ought never to be imposed except in cases of very urgent necessity. The misapplication and destruction of the means of production which they infallibly occasion, would not only defeat every attempt to render them permanent, but would, by impoverishing and exhausting the country, render all other taxes comparatively unproductive.\n\nIt is not from capital, therefore, but from revenue, that all permanent taxes ought to be derived. And the revenue of every individual in every country, who does not subsist on the produce of taxation, being derived either from rent, profit, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WAGES\">wages</a>, it is plain that all taxes which do not fall on capital must, however imposed, ultimately fall on one or other of these three sources. Without further <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-PREFACE\">preface</a>, therefore, we shall now proceed to trace the ultimate incidence and effect of such taxes as are laid directly on rent, profit, and wages; and when we have ascertained the way in which they operate, it will be comparatively easy to investigate the effect of those direct taxes which are meant to fall equally on all the various sources of income.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">Sect</a>. I.\u2014Taxes on Rent.\n\n1. Taxes on the Rent of Land.\u2014A tax on the rent of land, properly so called, or on the sum paid by a tenant to a landlord for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of the natural and inherent powers of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, would fall wholly on the landlord. Rent is entirely a consequence of the decreasing productiveness of the capital and industry successively applied to the land. If capital could have been always applied to the best soils with equal advantage, it is plain no one would ever have thought of resorting to those of an inferior degree of fertility, and no such thing as rent would ever have been heard of. But this is not the case. The best lands in every improving country are speedily exhausted; and it is always found to be more advantageous to lay out capital on the inferior soils, which require a greater expenditure to make them yield the same supplies, than to continue forcing the best lands. Suppose, to illustrate the effect of this constantly operating principle, that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of soils of various degrees of fertility are in cultivation, and that they respectively yield, in return for the same expenditure of capital, 100, 90, 80, 70, 60, &c. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>, it is plain, as there cannot be two prices of the same article, at the same time and in the same market; that, when two or more of these soils are cultivated, their produce must all sell for the same price; and it is farther plain, that this price must be such as will sufficiently remunerate the cultivators of the worst soil, for otherwise they would not continue to employ their capital in its cultivation. But the price which will remunerate the cultivators of the worst land, will more than remunerate the cultivators of the more fertile lands, precisely in proportion to the greater quantity of produce obtained from them. Now, as there cannot be two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATES\">rates</a> of profit in the same country, any more than two prices, this excess of produce necessarily constitutes rent. Thus, when five qualities of land are cultivated, the rent of the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> would be 40 quarters; for such is the difference between its produce (100), and the produce (60) of the fifth and last quality of land cultivated. In like manner, the rent of the second quality would be 30 quarters, or 90\u201460; the rent of the third 20 quarters, or 80\u201460; and the rent of the fourth 10 quarters, or 70\u201460. But it is obvious no rent would be paid by the cultivators of the soil of the fifth quality, and which was last taken into cultivation; nor is it really possible to conceive a case in which rent could enter, for any considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, into the cost of that portion of the produce of a country which is raised by the agency of the capital last applied to the soil, whether it be laid out on new land or in the improvement of the old. For, if it did, it would be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a> was the best of all businesses, and, in consequence, capital would be immediately attracted to the land, and would most certainly continue flowing in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> until the produce raised by the portions last employed in cultivation would only yield the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> and ordinary rate of profit. It may, therefore, be laid down as a general principle, and one from which there are really no exceptions; that, wherever industry is free, raw produce is always sold at its necessary price\u2014that is, at the price which is just sufficient to yield the common and average rate of profit, and no more, to the producers of that portion of the necessary or required supply which is raised in the most unfavourable circumstances, or by means of the capital last laid out on the soil.*\n\nIt results, from this principle, that a tax on rent would have to be entirely defrayed by the landlords. Such a tax would neither raise the price of raw produce, nor operate as a discouragement to cultivation; for, as we have just seen, that portion of Prices, and raw produce which regulates the price of all the rest pays no rent, it is impossible it could be affected by its imposition. In fact, all sorts of farm produce would continue at precisely the same price after the tax had been laid on as before, and there would be just the same motives to extend cultivation. In so far, therefore, as the income of the landlords really consists of rent, it might be entirely taken from them by means of direct taxes, without its being possible for them to elude their pressure, and without their occasioning any injury to the other classes of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a>. This arises from the circumstance of the landlords not being producers, but only receivers of income. Rent is altogether <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTRINSIC\">extrinsic</a> to the cost of production. It really consists of the excess, or of the value of the excess, of the produce\n\n* For a further account of the origin and nature of rent, see the Article Political Economy, Part III. Sect. 3, in this Supplement.\nobtained from the best soils, or by the agency of the capital first laid out on the land, over that which is obtained from the worst soils under tillage, or by the agency of the capital last laid out on the land. That the consumers must pay the value of this excess to some one or other is certain; for such payment is one of the absolutely indispensable conditions to their obtaining the necessary supplies of raw produce, and must be made the moment that the increase of population has compelled recourse to be had to inferior soils. But it is plainly of no consequence whatever to them whether they have to pay it to the proprietors of the land, or to a tax-gatherer.\n\nIt must be observed, however, that a tax on rent, in the common acceptation of the word, would not have quite the same effect that we have now stated, and would not wholly fall on the landlord. By rent is commonly meant the whole sum paid by a tenant to a landlord, as well for the use of the buildings, fences, &c., on a farm; as for the use of the natural and inherent powers of the soil. But the sum paid by a tenant for buildings and improvements is not really rent, but interest on the capital expended on them. To whatever extent, therefore, the gross or nominal rent of a farm is made up of interest on capital, to the same extent would a tax on it operate to raise the price of its produce. Suppose, for example, that the gross rent of a farm is \u00a3500, and that \u00a3250 are interest of capital laid out on its improvement. If a tax of 10 per cent. were laid on rent, only \u00a325 would have to be permanently paid by the landlord. The other \u00a325 might be paid by him for a short period; but, as it would form a deduction from profits, capital would, in consequence, be withdrawn from the soil until the diminished supply of produce had raised prices to their proper level\u2014that is, to such a level as would yield the common and ordinary rate of profit on the capital still employed in cultivation. This part of a tax on gross rent would not, therefore, fall on the landlord, or the farmer, but on the consumer of raw produce.\n\nThe circumstance of rent, unavoidably arising in the progress of society, inclines us to think that it would be good policy for the governments of countries such as the United States, who are possessed of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> tracts of fertile and unappropriated land, to retain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of this land in their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, and to let it by public auction, in such portions, and for such a number of years, as might be deemed advisable. Such a system might perhaps discourage some of those expensive and ostentatious undertakings entered into by individuals who have the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> property of the lands which they occupy; but there are no grounds whatever for thinking that it would contribute in the smallest degree to prevent any of those improvements which are really conducive to the raising of raw produce. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LEASES\">leases</a> might be made of such a length as to encourage every necessary outlay of capital; and the tenants who had the State for their landlord would certainly run a less risk than those who occupy the estates of individuals of being disturbed in their possession, or of being harassed by vexatious prosecutions. But if no real disadvantage would arise from the adoption of this system, it would be productive of many very great advantages. According as population increased, and as the expenses of Government were necessarily augmented, an increasing revenue would be provided to meet them\u2014a revenue, too, it must be recollected\u2014raised without hardship to any individual whatever\u2014and which, even though the Government should not take it, would notwithstanding exist, and have to be paid by the consumers of raw produce. \"Under such a system the owners of capital would enjoy its profits; the class of labourers would enjoy their wages, without any deduction whatsoever; and every man would employ his capital in the way which was really most advantageous, without receiving any inducement, by the mischievous operation of a tax, to remove it from a channel in which it was more, to one in which it would be less productive to the nation.\"\u2014(Mill's Elements of Political Economy, p. 199.)\n\nBut after land has been appropriated and converted into private property, it would certainly be unjust to lay the burden of supporting the State exclusively on the landlords. Mr Mill is, however, of opinion, that this exemption from exclusive taxation ought only to extend to the present rent, and that the State has a just <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to enact that all future increase of rent shall be applied to its use. We cannot assent to this proposition. When an absolute right of property has once been established in land, the owners seem to us to be fairly entitled not only to all the advantages now derivable from it, but to all those of which it may hereafter be made productive. Mr Mill contends, that inasmuch as Government may, by their own act, and without any effort on the part of the landlords, raise rent, there can be no good reason why they should not appropriate to themselves all the excess they have created. But if we establish this principle in one instance, it is difficult to see why it should not be established in others. It is possible for the Government, by repealing the corn laws, and admitting the free importation of raw produce, to raise the profits of stock. But no one would, therefore, contend, that Government would be justified in laying a tax on profits equivalent to the rise that had thus been occasioned; and if not, why should they be justified in laying an exclusive tax on rent when it rises in consequence of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of theirs? All classes should be made to contribute, in the same proportion to their means, to the support of the State. But it would certainly be a departure from this just principle to tax those who have acquired a property in land to a greater extent than others, or to give to the State all the advantages they would otherwise have derived from the growing prosperity and improvement of the country.\n\nThe greater part of the revenues of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> monarchies of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a> seems, in all ages, to have been derived from the soil. \"The land has been held by the immediate cultivators, generally in small portions, with a perpetual and transferable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a>; but under an obligation of paying, annually, the government demand, which might be increased at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> of the sovereign, and seldom amounted to less\nThe scutages on knights' fees, the assessment of hydage on otherlands, and the subsidies chargeable on the proprietors of estates, so often referred to in the history of England, were, to all intents and purposes, land-taxes. (Blackstone, I. p. 312.) But the existing land-tax has supplanted all those more ancient assessments. This tax was first imposed in 1693; a new valuation of all the lands in the kingdom having been made in the previous year. According to this valuation, it was found that a tax of 1s. on the pound of the ascertained rental, afforded an annual clear revenue of \u00a3500,000. No change has ever been made in the valuation of 1692. The tax, which was at first an annual one, has been generally as high as 4s. a pound of the valued rent: In 1798, it was made perpetual at that rate, leave being, at the same time, given to the proprietors to redeem it.\n\nThe land-tax was very unequal at its first imposition. For such proprietors as were friendly to the Revolutionary establishment, generally returned their estates at a much higher value than the proprietors who were attached to the Stuarts. The different degrees of improvement that have since taken place in the various districts of the country, have, in some instances, tended to correct the inequalities in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> imposition of the land-tax, and, in others, to increase them.\n\n2. Taxes on the Rent of Houses.\u2014The principal part of the rent of houses generally consists of the profits of the capital laid out in their construction, or, as it is more commonly termed, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> rent, a comparatively small part only being ground rent, or rent payable for the soil on which they are erected. It is evident, therefore, from the principles already established, that, if the supply of houses could be as easily diminished and increased as the supply of raw produce, a tax on their rents would fall entirely on the occupiers and ground landlords, in the proportion that the profits of the capital laid out on them bore to the rent of the land on which they stood. But as the supply of houses is not susceptible of speedy diminution, the builders would have no means of immediately raising rents when a tax was laid on them; and, unless the capital of the country, and, consequently, the population and demand for houses, were rapidly increasing, a considerable number of years would necessarily elapse before they would be able to relieve themselves of the tax. Houses, however, though slowly, are yet certainly perishable; and, as no more of them would be built after they had been taxed, until the increasing demand had raised their rents so as to indemnify the builders for the tax, and to elevate their profits to the common level, there can be no question that, in the end, the tax would be thrown wholly on the occupiers and ground landlords in the proportions already mentioned.\n\nSect. II.\u2014Taxes on Profits.\n\nA tax proportioned to the nett profits derived from the capital employed in every branch of industry would fall wholly on profits.\n\nSuch a tax would affect all capitalists to precisely the same extent. When 5 or 10 per cent. was laid on the profits of the farmer or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANUFACTURER\">manufacturer</a>, an equal would affect 5 or 10 per cent. would be laid on the profits of the merchant, the ship-owner, and of all the other employers of capital. It is evident no individual could hope to evade the burden of such a tax by changing his business; and it could not, therefore, occasion any transference of capital from one employment to another. Neither would it occasion any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> in the supply and demand of commodities, nor in their money price. For, as the tax does not fall on capital, but on profits, the means of producing would not be impaired by its imposition; the means of purchasing possessed by those who live on profits, previously to the imposition of the tax, would indeed be diminished; but, as the means of purchasing, possessed by the Government and its agents who receive the tax, would be proportionally augmented, the aggregate demand of the society would continue the same\u2014and hence, as the tax could neither lessen the quantity of capital in the country, nor the power to purchase its produce, it is obvious it could not, supposing the value of money to continue invariable, occasion any variation in the money prices of commodities.\n\nThe immediate effect of an equal and universal tax on profits would, therefore, be to sink them in the same proportion. And as the power to accumulate capital, and consequently to feed and employ an additional number of people, must ever be in direct proportion to the rate of profit, it follows that the tendency, and, when they are carried to such a height as to prevent them being balanced by increased exertion and economy, the ultimate and necessary effect of all such taxes is, to check the accumulation of capital and the progress of population.\n\nA tax laid only on the profits of the capital employed in a particular business would have a different effect: it would raise prices, and would not, therefore, fall on the capitalists, except in so far as they were themselves consumers of their own produce. Suppose, for example, that a tax of 10 per cent. is laid exclusively on the profits of the shoemaker. The slightest consideration will show that such a tax must make an equivalent addition to the price of shoes; for, if it did not, the shoemakers would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> less profit than was gained by those engaged in other businesses, and they would, in consequence, have an immediate inducement to withdraw.\n\nFor a full and excellent account of the taxation of Eastern countries, see the same author's History of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>, Vol. I. chap. Taxes. Some curious and valuable details, with respect to the land-taxes of the ancient Egyptians, may be found in the first volume, liv. i. \u00a7 4, of the admirable work of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">President</a> De Goguet, Sur l'Origine des Loix, &c.\nfrom their employment; nor can there be a question that they would continue so to withdraw, until, by diminishing the supply of shoes, their price had reached such a height as would yield the common and average rate of profits, exclusive of the tax. For the same reason, an exclusive tax on the profits of the hatter, the clothier, the farmer, &c. would make a proportional addition to the price of hats, cloth, and agricultural produce, &c. In these cases the capitalists have the power to raise prices, and consequently to throw the burden of the tax on the consumers; because they have the power to withdraw from those businesses in which profits are taxed, and to employ their capital in those which are not taxed. But, when the profits arising from the capital employed in every different business are equally taxed, the capitalists are deprived of this resource; and have no means either of raising prices or of evading the tax.\n\nIt is easy to see, from the principles we have already established, that a general and equal tax on the profits of agricultural and other capital could not occasion any diminution of rent. When the farmers are taxed equally with all other producers, there will obviously be no motive to induce them to withdraw capital from the land, and no variation will take place in the price of corn; nor, as rent consists in the excess of the produce obtained by the capital first applied to the land over that which is obtained by the capital last applied, will it be affected by such a tax. But if the tax, instead of being a general and equal one, were laid exclusively on the profits of the farmer, it would really cause an immediate increase of rent. No rent, as we have shown in the preceding section, ever enters into the cost of producing that portion of the required supply of raw produce raised by the agency of the capital last laid out on the land. It is plainly impossible, therefore, that its raisers could indemnify themselves for any burdens laid on them by making an equivalent deduction from rent. And hence, when a tax is laid exclusively on the profits of agricultural capital, the price of raw produce must sustain a corresponding rise; for in the event of its not rising, the producers of that portion which pays no rent would abandon their business, and the necessary supplies would not be obtained. Inasmuch, however, as the rise of price which is required to remunerate those who raise corn that pays no rent, after a tax is imposed on profits, must be universal, it must raise rent. Thus, on our former supposition, that five equal capitals applied to soils of various degrees of fertility, respectively yield 100, 90, 80, 70, and 60 quarters, their corn rents would be 40, 30, 20, and 10 quarters; and if the price required to remunerate the cultivators of the fifth and worst quality of land which pays no rent were L. 4 a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>, the money rent of the first quality would be L. 160, of the second L. 120, of the third L. 80, and so on. Suppose, now, that an exclusive tax is laid on the profits of agricultural capital, and that, to remunerate the cultivators of the worst land, the price rises from L. 4 to L. 4, 10s. a quarter, it is plain the rent of the first quality would be immediately raised to L. 180, the second to L. 135, the third to L. 90, and so on; being an increase of L. 20 on the rent of the first, of L. 15 on the rent of the second, of L. 10 on the third, &c.\n\nThis is a principle of the highest importance. It shows the unfounded nature of the complaints made by the landlords of the injuries they suffer from the operation of taxes on agricultural industry: It shows that such taxes as fall equally on agriculture and on other businesses neither affect rents nor prices, and cannot, therefore, be injurious to the landlords; And it further shows that such taxes as fall exclusively on agricultural profits must, by raising the relative value of corn, raise rents, and materially improve their condition! \"That the profits of the farmer,\" says Mr Ricardo, who was the first to discover and establish this important principle, \"only should be taxed, and not the profits of any other capitalist, would be highly beneficial to the landlords.\" It would, in fact, be a tax on the consumers of raw produce, partly for the benefit of the state, and partly for the benefit of the landlords.\" (Principles of Political Economy, 3d edit. p. 241.)\n\nIn estimating the profits of the farmers under the mode of esti- late income-tax act, it was assumed that in England the they amounted, in all cases, to three-fourths, and Farmer un- in Scotland to a half of the rent; and power was der the In- given to the commissioners to make a new valuation come-Tax of the farm at the end of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> years during the currency of the lease, and if they found it was then worth a higher rent than was paid by the tenant, his income-tax was proportionally augmented. Many complaints were made against this method of assessing the profits of farmers; and certainly nothing could be more arbitrary and fallacious than the assumed rule for estimating them. But, notwithstanding the general opinion to the contrary, it is not very difficult to discover that the inequalities it occasioned in the collection of the tax were really advantageous to the farmer. The reason is, that while the farmers who occupied rich and well-situated lands, whose rents were comparatively high, were taxed far above their profits, those who occupied poorer lands, the rents of which were comparatively low, were not taxed to the extent of their profits. In these circumstances, the tax had necessarily a two-fold operation: In the first place, its effect was to lower the profits of the capital employed in farming proportionally to its pressure on those tenants who occupied the worst lands\u2014for it is by the profits that they make that the profits of all other stock whatever must be regulated: And, in the second place, it had the effect of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOWERING\">lowering</a> the rent of the superior lands, by burdening it with all the excess of tax falling on the profits of those by whom they were occupied, over that which fell on the profits of the occupiers of the inferior lands. Such was the only way in which, as the tax was actually imposed, the indestructible level of profit among the farmers of the various descriptions of land could be preserved. And it is plain, that if the tax had pressed to its full extent on the occupiers of the worst lands in cultivation, it would have made a much greater deduction from the profits of all classes of farmers, at the same time that it would have made no deduction from rent.\n\nThe income-tax fell equally on the profits derivable from the other branches of industry as on those\nof the farmer: If his profits had been exclusively taxed, the inequalities in the tax would have been corrected, and the burden thrown off his shoulders to those of the consumers, partly by a rise of prices, and partly by a decline of the rents of the best lands.\n\nThe taille, such as it subsisted in France at the epoch of the Revolution, was intended to be a tax on the profits of the farmer. Instead, however, of attempting to estimate these profits by the amount of his rent, or by endeavouring to ascertain the value of the produce remaining in his possession after his rent and other outlays had been deducted, they were commonly estimated by the amount of the capital employed by him in cultivation. In consequence of resorting to this criterion for estimating profits, the tax had the effect of inducing the farmer to employ the smallest possible quantity of capital, and of deterring him from making any considerable or expensive improvement. The taille was also injurious in another respect; for, as it did not affect the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBLES\">nobles</a> who farmed their own lands, but fell exclusively on those who rented lands of another, or who possessed lands held by a base <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TENURE\">tenure</a>, it was considered as a degrading tax, and as a mark of the ignoble, or rather servile condition of those by whom it was paid. All who made anything by farming were thus rendered anxious to withdraw from so degraded a business; while rich merchants and capitalists were prevented from becoming tenants. Not only, therefore, did the taille hinder the greater part of the capital generated on the land from being laid out on it, but it turned from it all the capital that had been accumulated in other employments! It is very difficult to suppose that any tax could have been devised better calculated to retain agriculture in a rude and infant state, and to extinguish all emulation and enterprise among the farmers. And considering the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> period to which France was subjected to this tax, our wonder is, not that her agriculture was in a very backward and depressed condition at the Revolution, but that it was so far advanced as it really was.*\n\nThe present French land-tax\u2014contribution fonci\u00e8re\u2014equally affects all lands, by whomsoever they may be occupied. It amounts, according to Garnier, to about an eighth part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">net</a> produce of the land\u2014that is, of its produce, exclusive of the expenses of cultivation, but inclusive of rent. Garnier says that the tax is very fairly assessed, and that it is very moderate compared with the various charges with which landed property is burdened in most other countries. It is certainly a very great improvement on the old system. (Richesse des Nations, par Garnier, Tome VI. p. 404.)\n\n**Sect. III.\u2014Taxes on Wages.**\n\nThe common and ordinary effect of direct taxes on wages, or on the commodities necessary for the subsistence of the labourer, is to cause a proportional increase of wages and fall of profits.\n\nIn every discussion respecting the effect of taxes on wages, or on the necessaries consumed by the labourer, it is of the greatest importance to distinguish between the natural or necessary rate of wages, or the rate which is required to enable the labourers to exist and continue their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>, and the market rate, or the rate which they really receive at any particular period.\n\nThe natural or necessary price of labour, like the natural price of every thing else which is bought and sold, and which may be indefinitely increased or diminished, is determined by the cost of its production. The capacity of the labourer to support himself, and to rear as many children as may be required to keep up the supply of labourers, does not, it is plain, depend on the quantity of money he receives as wages, but on the quantity of food, necessaries, and conveniences essential to his support, for which that money will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a>. The natural rate of wages must, therefore, depend on the cost of producing the food, and other necessaries, required for the maintenance of the labourer. A rise in the market rate of wages does not always coincide with a rise in the price of necessaries; but they can never be very far separated. However high the price of necessaries may rise, the labourers, it is quite clear, must always receive such a quantity as is sufficient to enable them to support themselves and to continue their race. For if wages were to fall below this necessary level, the labourers would be left destitute; there would, in consequence, be a rapid diminution of their numbers; and this diminution would raise wages: and if, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, they were to rise considerably above it, a proportional stimulus would be given to the principle of population, and the increase of labourers would lower wages.\n\nThe opinion maintained by those who contend that the rate of wages does not depend on the cost of producing the articles consumed by the labourers, but on the demand for their exertions compared with their numbers, has obviously originated in their confounding the principles which govern the market price of labour, at a particular period, with those which govern its natural or necessary price. It is undoubtedly true that the market price of labour at any given moment depends on the state of the supply as compared with the demand; but it is easy to see that the supply cannot be permanently brought to market unless the rate of wages is such as will suffice to maintain and bring up labourers\u2014that is, unless the cost of their production be paid. From whatever point of the political compass we may set out, this is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> principle to which we must always come at last. Let us suppose, to illustrate this principle, that, owing to a scarcity, the price of the quartern loaf rises to 5s.: It is plain, insomuch as the same number of labourers would be seeking for employment after the rise as before, and as there is no reason why a scarcity should increase the demand\n\n---\n\n* For a farther account of the taille the reader is referred to Forbonnais, Recherches sur les Finances de France, Tome I. p. 107; Wealth of Nations, III. p. 303; and to Storch, Cours d'Economie Politique (ed. de Say), III. p. 191.\nfor labour, that wages would not be advanced; the labourers would, in consequence, be forced to economise, and the rise of price would thus have the effect of lessening consumption, and of distributing the pressure equally throughout the year. But suppose that the rise, instead of being occasioned by a deficient crop, has been occasioned by an increased difficulty of production, and that it will be permanent, the question is, Will wages continue at their former rate, or will they rise? Now, in this case, it is plain that wages must rise: For the comforts of all classes of labourers would be greatly impaired by the rise of prices; and those who, previously to its taking place, had only wherewithal to subsist, would be reduced to a state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> destitution, or rather, we should say, of absolute famine. In such circumstances, an increase of mortality could hardly fail to take place; while the greater difficulty of providing subsistence would interpose a powerful check to the formation of matrimonial connections and the increase of population.\n\nBy these means, therefore, either the amount of the population, or the ratio of its increase, or both, would be diminished; and this diminution would continue until the smaller supply of labourers in the market had enabled them to raise wages to their natural rate; that is, as Dr Smith has defined it, to such a rate as would enable them to obtain \"not only the commodities which are indispensably necessary for the support of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, but whatever the custom of the country renders it indecent for creditable people, even of the lowest order, to be without.\"\n\nIf a given specific quantity of certain articles were necessary to enable the labourers to exist, it would clearly and directly follow that the rate of wages could not be reduced, for any considerable period, below what would procure them these articles. But there is no such absolute standard of natural wages. It depends essentially on custom and habit. The articles considered as necessaries are perpetually changing. The labourers of Hindostan principally subsist on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICE\">rice</a>, those of Ireland on potatoes, and those of England on wheaten <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a> and beef. In one country it is discreditable for the lowest class of labourers to be destitute of comfortable clothing, and of shoes and stockings, while in others shoes and stockings are looked upon as luxuries to be used only by the rich. In many provinces of France and Spain a certain allowance of wine is considered indispensable to existence; and in England the labouring class entertain nearly the same opinion with respect to beer and porter. Nor have the habits of the people, and the standard by which the natural rate of wages has been regulated at different periods in the same countries, been less fluctuating and various. The articles which custom and habit have rendered necessary for the comfortable subsistence of the English and Scottish labourers of the present day are as widely different from those which were judged necessaries by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>, in the reigns of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a>, James I., and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> I., as they are from those which form the ordinary subsistence of the labourers of France and Spain. The standard of natural wages has been raised, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> have been taught to form much more elevated notions respecting the quantity and the species of the articles which it would be disgraceful for them to be without.\n\nThe natural rate of wages is not, therefore, a fixed Supply of Labour nor unvarying quantity; and though it be strictly true that the market-rate of wages can never, when reference is made to periods of average <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>, be accommodated sunk below its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">contemporary</a> natural rate, it is no less in the rate of true that the natural rate has a tendency to rise when the market rate rises, and to fall when it falls. The reason is, that the supply of labour in the market can neither be speedily increased when wages rise, nor speedily diminished when they fall; and it is also on this circumstance that the powerful influence which fluctuations in the market rate of wages have on the condition of the labouring classes principally depends. If the supply of labour could be suddenly increased when wages rise, that rise would be of no advantage whatever to the existing labourers. It would increase their number, but it would not enable them to mount in the scale of society, or to obtain a greater command of the necessaries and conveniences of life. And, on the other hand, if the supply of labour could be suddenly diminished when wages fall, that fall would merely lessen the numbers of labourers, without having any tendency to degrade the habits or to lower the condition of those who survived. But in the actual state of things no rise of wages can ever be counteracted by an increased supply of workmen coming into the market until eighteen or twenty years after it has taken place; for there are few or no branches of industry in which an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> and skilful labourer can be bred in a shorter period. During all this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a>, therefore, the labourer is placed in a greatly improved situation. He has a greater supply of wholesome and nutritious food; he has better clothes and better habitations; he is rendered more attentive to personal cleanliness; and as he rises higher in the scale of society, he naturally uses more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">providence</a> and circumspection in the forming of matrimonial connections. In short, his opinions respecting what is necessary for his decent and comfortable subsistence are raised, and the natural rate of wages is in consequence proportionally augmented.\n\nBut it is equally impossible suddenly to diminish the number of the labourers when wages fall. Such a fall of wages cannot, as we have already stated, be effected otherwise than by the operation of increased mortality, or by a decrease in the number of births. But unless the fall were very sudden and extensive, it would require a considerable number of years to render the effects of increased mortality very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a>; and it is so difficult to change the habits of a people, that, though the demand for labour were to decline, it would, notwithstanding, continue for a while to flow into the market with nearly the same rapidity as before. Nor would the ratio of the increase of population be sufficiently diminished, until the misery occasioned by the restricted demand on the one hand, and the undiminished supply on the other, had been very generally and widely felt.\n\nIn whatever way, therefore, wages may be restored to their natural level when the market rate declines\u2014whether it be by an increase of mortality, or\na decrease in the number of births, or both\u2014it can never be the work of an instant. It must always require a considerable time before it can be effected; and there is in consequence an obvious risk lest the habits of the labouring class should be degraded in the interim. When wages are considerably reduced the poor are obliged to economise; and should the coarse and scanty fare that is thus, in the first instance, forced upon them by necessity, ultimately become congenial from habit, no check would be given to population, and the natural rate of wages would be permanently reduced. In such a case the cost of raising labourers would be diminished; and it is by this cost that the natural rate of wages, with which the market rate must generally correspond, is always regulated. A fall of wages is, therefore, as peculiarly injurious to the labourers as a rise of wages is peculiarly beneficial to them. Its obvious tendency is to sink the natural rate of wages, and to degrade the condition of the largest and not least valuable class in society; and wherever the labourers can bear to retrench, or to descend from a higher to a lower station, it will have this effect, unless their desire to preserve their place in society should occasion a greater prevalence of moral restraint, and a slower increase of population. It is certain, indeed, that to whatever extent wages may fall, the labourers always possess the means of raising them to their former, or to a higher level. If they understock the market with labour, wages will continue high, notwithstanding the means of employment should be diminished; while, if they overstock the market with labour, wages will be low, notwithstanding these means should be very considerably increased. The labourers are thus really in a great measure the arbiters of their own fortune. Nor is there any very great reason to think that their condition will ever be materially improved until they are made acquainted with the circumstances which govern the rate of wages, and are impressed with a full conviction of the important truth, that they are themselves the masters of the only means by which their command over the necessaries and luxuries of life can be really extended.\n\nDr Smith has said, that, \"while the demand for labour and the price of provisions remain the same, a direct tax on the wages of labour can have no other effect than to raise them somewhat higher than the tax.\" (III. p. 323.) It is plain, however, from the principles we have just laid down, that in the event of the demand for labour continuing the same after the tax had been imposed as before, the rise of wages could only be gradually effected; and it would, in consequence, depend entirely on the circumstance of the opinions and habits of the people undergoing no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEGRADATION\">degradation</a> during the period of the rise taking place, whether wages would regain their former elevation. But Mr Ricardo has shown that, in the great majority of cases, the demand for labour would not, as Dr Smith has supposed, continue the same after the imposition of the tax. Suppose, for the sake of illustration, that Government lays a direct tax on wages; as no part of this tax is taken from the capital of the masters, it is obvious it cannot lessen their means of employing labour; and it is equally obvious that it must make an equivalent addition to the means of employing labour, or of purchasing the produce of labour, possessed by the Government or its agents who have received the tax. As soon, therefore, as these increased means are brought into market, the greater competition will infallibly raise wages, so as to place the labourers in their previous condition.\n\nThis is the way in which taxes are generally expended. But if we suppose that the produce of the tax, instead of being laid out at home, had been remitted as a subsidy to a foreign state, the demand for labour would not be increased in consequence of the competition of Government, and wages could only be raised by slow degrees in the way we have previously described. In all those cases, however, in which the produce either of direct or indirect taxes on wages is laid out at home, they never fail to occasion an equal and immediate rise of wages. The agents of Government then enter the market for labour with means of purchasing which have not been derived from the capitalists, but from the labourers themselves, and wages are thus necessarily raised precisely in proportion to these additional means; or, in other words, to the amount of the tax. Although, therefore, Dr Smith failed in demonstrating his proposition, that a direct tax on the wages of labour is never defrayed by the labourer, the proposition is, nevertheless, strictly true in all those cases in which the tax is laid out at home; and it is also true in those cases in which it is sent abroad as a subsidy, provided the habits of the people and their opinions, respecting what is necessary for their comfortable subsistence, undergo no change after the tax is imposed.\n\nWe have already shown that every rise of wages must necessarily occasion a corresponding fall in the rate of profit.* It is, therefore, really the same to the capitalists whether a tax on labour, which is to be spent at home, be laid directly on profits or on wages. The capitalists must defray it either at first or second hand. And hence it is that the real injury which such taxes inflict on the labourer does not consist in their immediate but in their remote effects. By falling on profits, their direct tendency is to diminish the power to accumulate capital; and when carried so far as to have this effect, they must, unless the stimulus previously given to population be at the same time diminished by the more powerful operation of the principle of moral restraint, depress the condition of the labourers, and lower the natural rate of wages.\n\nIt must, however, be observed, that this is not an effect peculiar to a tax laid directly on profits or wages, but to every tax which is not defrayed either from rent or from a duty on exported goods. Labourers cannot, in any circumstances, be made to\n\n* Art. Political Economy, Part III. \u00a7 5, in this Supplement.\ncontribute considerably to the wants of the state; and if they were sufficiently alive to their own interests, and made a proper use of the power which they possess of regulating the quantity of labour in the market, no tax, even though the produce were remitted to a foreign country, could ever occasion any permanent reduction of the natural rate of wages. It is from profits and rent, therefore, that almost all taxes must be derived. And it is not really of much importance, provided the sum demanded of a capitalist be ascertained, whether he is made to pay it by a direct tax or by taxes on expenditure. If L. 500, for example, be his fair proportion of the revenue required by the state, \"the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of taxation consists in making sure that he shall pay this sum, neither more nor less.\" (Ricardo's Principles, &c. p. 183, 3d edit.)\n\nIt is alleged, however, and the allegation is undoubtedly true, that, when the rate of profit, in a particular country, is as low, or but very little higher than the rate of profit among the countries in the vicinity, a heavy direct tax on profits or wages would, by reducing the rate of profit below the common level, have a powerful tendency to cause the transfer of capital to other countries, whereas heavy taxes on expenditure merely occasion the emigration of individuals or families, without prompting them to take their stock along with them. But, although it cannot be doubted that an efflux of capital is much more injurious than an emigration of individuals, still, as the emigrants would thereby avoid taxes laid on expenditure, it is obvious, that if no taxes were laid directly on profits and rents, they would escape taxation altogether, and a disproportionally heavy burden would, consequence, be thrown on those who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to reside at home. The truth is, that it is quite impossible to carry either direct or indirect taxes beyond moderate limits, without encountering difficulties. Inasmuch, however, as equality of pressure is one of the very highest recommendations of a system of taxation, and inequality of pressure one of its greatest defects, the objection to such direct taxes as can be fairly assessed, that they tend to force capital abroad, ought not to be held as conclusive. So long as an individual derives a revenue from capital, so long ought that revenue be made to contribute, in the same proportion as the rest, to the supply of the wants of the country in which the capital is employed. If you cannot draw the L. 500 of taxes, which a capitalist ought to pay, from him, by means of duties on wines, horses, or coaches, or any other article of expenditure, you ought certainly to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a> to direct taxation: For, if you do not, this capitalist will not furnish his proper quota of the public revenue, and other individuals will have to pay the portion not paid by him. To prevent taxes on profits or expenditure from forcing either capital or individuals abroad, the only way is to keep them as low as possible. In this respect, as in most others, there is no difference between the expenditure of a state and that of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>. And in both it will be found, as Cicero long ago observed, that Optimum, et in privatis familis, et in respublica rectigal est, parsimoniam.\n\nHaving thus endeavoured to trace and exhibit the effects that would result from the imposition of taxes separately affecting rent, profits, and wages; we shall now proceed briefly to inquire into the effects that would result from the imposition of a tax proportioned to the income of each individual.\n\nSect. IV.\u2014Taxes on Income.\n\nAs all income must either be derived from rent, profit, or wages, the effects of a tax on income would necessarily vary according as the incomes of the contributors were derived from one or other of these sources. In so far as income is derived from rent, a tax on it would be really a tax on rent, and would fall wholly on the landlords; and in so far as income is derived from profits, a tax on it would be really a tax on profits, and would fall wholly on the capitalists: But such would not be the case with a tax laid on that part of the income of a country which consists of wages; for, we have already shown, that when the produce of a tax on wages is laid out at home, it causes them to rise to an equal extent; and is, therefore, really the same in its effects as if a tax calculated to raise the same sum were laid directly on profits; and that, when the produce of the tax is remitted abroad, the same rise is brought about, though not so immediately, by the operation of increased mortality, or by a diminished increase of population.\n\nBy tracing the effects of this principle, we discern No injustice done to Professional Men by Taxing their Incomes, from whatever sources they may be derived. There is certainly a great appearance of truth in the statement of those who affirm that it is a monstrous hardship and injustice to make the same deduction from the income of a lawyer or a physician, on whose exertions a numerous family may perhaps be dependent, as from the rent of a landlord or the profit of a capitalist. But if it can be shown that the condition of professional men must be affected by every tax laid exclusively on the incomes of landlords and capitalists, exactly to the same extent as if it had been extended to them, these objections must obviously fall to the ground, and there can be neither hardship nor injustice in making the tax universal. Now it is not very difficult to demonstrate that this would really be the case; and that, in point of fact, it is altogether immaterial to professional men whether, when a tax is laid on income, they pay their full share, or obtain a total exemption.\n\nThe revenue or wages of professional men depends partly on the expense necessarily incurred in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>, and partly on the peculiar habits of the society in which they live, and the station they must support. If their wages amounted only to a bare compensation for the expenses of education, it is easy to see they could not be permanently affected by a tax on income; for, as soon as the tax was imposed, their wages would become insufficient for their remuneration, and while young men would thus be deterred from entering on professional pursuits, those already engaged in them would have a powerful temptation to withdraw; nor would this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> operation cease, until it had, by diminishing the supply, raised the wages of those who remained to their proper level;\u2014that is, until it","sp":670,"ep":683},{"h":"FLUENTS","t":"VOL.

Few disquisitions in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a> have greater practical utility than those concerning the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> and interpolation of the terms of numerical progressions. But the modes of solution generally proposed, however ingenious and refined, are often too complex for ordinary purposes. We therefore avail ourselves of this opportunity to point out a procedure of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> simplicity and most ready application. It <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> embrace any system of numbers, but seems peculiarly fitted for the computation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOGARITHMS\">logarithms</a>.\n\nNapier first published, in 1614, his canon Mirificus Logarithmorum, comprised in a very thin and small quarto <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a>, exhibiting, as far as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> places, the logarithms only of the sines and tangents to every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRANT\">quadrant</a>; those of the ordinary numbers being left to be deduced from the nearest sines or tangents. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> following, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIGGS\">Briggs</a>, then Professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">Geometry</a> in Gresham <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">College</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, who was enchanted by that noble discovery, paid a visit to its illustrious author at Merchiston, in the vicinity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>. During an agreeable stay of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>, it was concerted between them, to change the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> system of logarithms into another of a more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> form, but adapted to our denary scale of notation, the labour of the calculation, however, being devolved upon Briggs, as younger and enjoying robust <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>. Next season, Briggs performed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> journey to Edinburgh, and showed to Napier a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> which he had computed of the new logarithms for the first chilid or thousand of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of natural numbers. But the great inventor was now fast declining in years, and expired on the 3rd of April 1618. Briggs employing most skilfully all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABBREVIATIONS\">abbreviations</a> which ingenuity could <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEVISE\">devise</a>, prosecuted his most arduous task with such vigour and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> perseverance, as to compute, in the space of seven years, to fourteen places of figures, not only the logarithms of...\nthe sines and tangents of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> and centesimal minute of the quadrant, but also the logarithms of thirty chilids of numbers. These tables were printed, in 1624, in a folio volume, entitled *Arithmetica Logarithmica*. In his anxiety, however, to bring out this stupendous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, Briggs contented himself with calculating the logarithms from unit to 20,000, and from 90,000 to 100,000, leaving the computation of the seventy intervening chilids to be afterwards supplied. The very ingenious author annexed a full explanation of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of framing the tables, grounded chiefly on the consideration of differences, and he thus traced the first steps of that important <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a>. But he likewise gave instructions for the reader filling up of the intermediate logarithms, abridging the toil of calculation no doubt, yet detailing a procedure sufficiently irksome and complicated.\n\n\"To encourage some skilful persons to perform this task, he offered to furnish them with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> he had by him, ready prepared, and divided into columns proper for that purpose, as likewise to inform them at what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> to begin, that they might not interfere one with another; and promised, when the whole was finished, to endeavour to procure a new edition of the work so completed.\" This slender boon seems not to have tempted the mathematicians in England. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, however, Adrian Vlacq, chancing to meet two years afterwards with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> of the work, and prompted only by his patriotic zeal, had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> to revise and compute the whole canon, reducing it to ten places of figures, which he printed in folio at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOUDA\">Gouda</a>, as early as 1628. The same able calculator, only five years afterwards, published, likewise in folio, at Gouda, a very extensive system of logarithmic sines and tangents, to every ten seconds of the quadrant, having restored the sexagesimal subdivision, which Briggs had partly changed into a centesimal one. These two volumes may be deemed a precious *thesaurus* of logarithms, from which succeeding compilers have drawn very liberally. They form the basis of the *Tables* published by Vega at Leipsic in 1794, which are esteemed the best and completest now extant.\n\nBut though the *Tables* of Vlacq, carried only to ten places of figures, are sufficiently accurate for every ordinary purpose, and even for the most delicate calculations in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a>, yet many persons have often regretted that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> system of Briggs was never completed. The celebrated Legendre has employed that table, imperfect as it is, in some of his most refined numerical investigations. It is well known that Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARON\">Baron</a> Masseres devoted a considerable portion of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, and of his fortune, to the republication of the works of the early writers on logarithms. In the course of this extensive undertaking, he entertained some thoughts of giving a new edition of the *Arithmetica Logarithmica*, and expressed an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARNEST\">earnest</a> wish that the vacant chilids were filled up. To promote the liberal designs of the Baron, the Author of this Article was induced to bestow some reflection on the subject, and a very simple mode occurred to him, which would have reduced the labour of computing those logarithms to little more than the trouble of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> transcription. But the project of completing the canon was deferred for a time, and afterwards gradually forgotten. The method of interpolation then proposed seems, however, to deserve notice on account of its great simplicity, and its ready application, not only to the immediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>, but to other questions of a similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>. We shall, therefore, now state the principle, and illustrate its application by a few examples.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> root of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> $a^2 + 1$ is evidently expressed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> fraction $\\frac{a+1}{2a}$. If two terms only of the fractional part be taken, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> will become $\\sqrt{a^2 + 1} = \\frac{4a^2 + 3a}{4a^2 + 1}$, and consequently $\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{a^2 + 1}{a^2}\\right)}$ or $\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{2b^2 + 2}{2b^2}\\right)} = \\frac{4a^2 + 3}{4a^2 + 1}$, a very near approximation. Put $b = 2a$, and by substitution $\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{b+2}{b}\\right)} = \\frac{2b+3}{2b+1}$; therefore\n\n$$\\frac{1}{2} \\log_b \\frac{b+2}{b} = \\log_b \\frac{2b+3}{2b+1}.$$ Hence half the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> differences of the logarithms of the series $b, b+1, b+2, \\ldots$ added to the logarithm of $2b+1$, must give the logarithm of $2b+3$. By this simple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> then, any table of logarithms is carried to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> its actual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> through all the odd numbers, those of the even ones being found by the mere addition of the logarithm of 2.\n\nTo find the limits of approximation, let three terms of the fractional series be taken, and $\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{a^2 + 1}{a^2}\\right)} = \\frac{8a^4 + 8a^2 + 1}{8a^4 + 4a^2}$, or $\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{b+2}{b}\\right)} = \\frac{2b^3 + 4b^2 + 6b + 1}{2b^3 + 10b^2 + 10b + 1}$. Whence\n\n$$\\frac{1}{2} \\log_b \\frac{b+2}{b} = \\frac{2b+3}{2b+1} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{(2b+3)(2b+1)b}\\right).$$\n\nand, therefore, since this last quantity exceeds unit only by a very minute <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a>, $\\frac{1}{2} \\log_b \\frac{b+2}{b} = \\log_b \\frac{2b+3}{2b+1} + \\frac{M}{(2b+3)(2b+1)b}$, where $M$ denotes the modulus of the system. If the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> $2b+3$ or $2b+1$ be expressed by $N$, this small correction will amount but to $\\frac{M}{N^3}$ or $\\frac{2M}{N^3}$. Consequently $\\log_b \\frac{2b+3}{2b+1} = \\frac{1}{2} \\log_b \\frac{b+2}{b} - \\frac{2M}{N^3}$. It may hence be computed, that the correction on the first approximation will only reach unit in the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> for the numbers un-\nThe corrections needed in Briggs's Tables will therefore correspond to these limits,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARRAY\">array</a>}{ccc}\n85150 & -2 & 23151 \\\\\n90706 & -3 & 22143 \\\\\n27899 & -4 & 21290 \\\\\n25898 & -5 & 20557 \\\\\n24372 & -6 & 19913\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nSuppose it were required to find the logarithms of the odd numbers above 300, to seven places of decimals. Assuming the logarithms of the series of half those numbers, let their alternate differences be taken, and these again bisected.\n\n| Numbers | Logarithms |\n|---------|------------|\n| 150     | 2.1760913  |\n| 151     | 2.1789769  |\n| 152     | 2.1818436  |\n| 153     | 2.1846914  |\n| 154     | 2.1875297  |\n| 155     | 2.1903317  |\n\n| Alternate Differences | Their Halves |\n|-----------------------|--------------|\n| 57523                 | 28761        |\n| 57145                 | 28572        |\n| 56771                 | 28386        |\n| 56403                 | 28201        |\n\nHence the logarithms of the doubles are formed by the mere addition of these halves.\n\n| Numbers | Logarithms |\n|---------|------------|\n| 301     | 2.4785665  |\n|         | 28761      |\n| 303     | 2.4814426  |\n|         | 28572      |\n| 305     | 2.4842998  |\n|         | 28386      |\n| 307     | 2.4871384  |\n|         | 28201      |\n| 309     | 2.4899585  |\n\nIn this manner, the operation may be continued; but, to prevent any accumulation of errors, the logarithms of the composite numbers should serve as standards, being formed by the addition of the logarithms of their several factors.\n\nThe logarithms of the intermediate even numbers, 302, 304, 306, 308, and 310, are easily determined by adding .3010300 to the logarithms of 151, 152, 153, 154, and 155.\n\nTo extend the process a little farther, let Vlacq's logarithms be computed for the numbers above 4000.\n\n| Numbers | Logarithms |\n|---------|------------|\n| 2000    | 3.3010299957 |\n| 2001    | 3.3012470886 |\n| 2002    | 3.3014640731 |\n| 2003    | 3.3016809493 |\n| 2004    | 3.3018977172 |\n| 2005    | 3.3021143770 |\n\n| Alternate Differences | Their Halves |\n|-----------------------|--------------|\n| 4340774               | 2170387      |\n| 4338607               | 2169303      |\n| 4336441               | 2168220      |\n| 4334277               | 2167139      |\n\nWhence are derived,\n\n| Numbers | Logarithms |\n|---------|------------|\n| 4001    | 3.8021885514 |\n|         | 2170387     |\n| 4003    | 3.6023855901 |\n|         | 2169303     |\n| 4005    | 3.6026025204 |\n|         | 2168220     |\n| 4007    | 3.6028193424 |\n|         | 2167139     |\n| 4009    | 3.6030360563 |\n\nAgain, to compute the logarithms in Briggs's Canon.\n\n| Numbers | Logarithms |\n|---------|------------|\n| 9995    | 3.99978279845419 |\n|         | 4344682707     |\n| 9996    | 3.99982624745441 |\n|         | 4344248108     |\n| 9998    | 3.999913241658  |\n|         | 4343813596     |\n| 10000   | 4.00000000000000 |\n|         | 4343379171     |\n\nThe additive parts here consist of those differences diminished by 11 and the last one by 10, since the numbers now approach to the limit 20557.\n\nThe first mode of interpolating, thus derived from the nature of logarithms, and so commodious for their computation, might likewise be deduced from general considerations. Let \\(A, B, C, D, E, \\ldots\\) represent any series of numbers. If they advance regularly and slowly, their first differences, \\(B-A, C-B, D-C, E-D, \\ldots\\) may be viewed as constituting an arithmetical progression. Wherefore the sum of the extremes will be equal to that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> terms, or \\((E-D) + (B-A) = (D-C) + (C-B)\\), that is, \\(E-A = 2D-2B\\), and therefore \\(D-B = \\frac{E-A}{2}\\), whence \\(D = B + \\frac{E-A}{2}\\). Applying this to the logarithms of eight places of figures, let \\(A, B, C, D, E, \\ldots\\) represent...\nthe logarithms of 500, 501, 502, 503, 504, &c., then\n\n\\[\n\\log_5 503 = \\log_5 501 + \\frac{\\log_5 504 - \\log_5 500}{2} = \\log_5 501\n\\]\n\n\\[\n+ \\frac{\\log_5 252 - \\log_5 250}{2} = 2.69983773 + \\frac{1}{2}(2.40140054\n\\]\n\n\\[-2.59794001) = 2.79156799; \\text{ the halves of the alternate differences of the logarithms of 250, 251, 252, 253, &c. being thus taken, as before, to compose by their additions the logarithms of the odd numbers 503, 505, 507, &c.}\\]\n\nBut since \\(E-A=2D-2B\\), it follows that \\(E=A+2(D-B)\\). Therefore, in any series, the fifth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> will be found nearly, by adding to the first term the double the difference between the second and fourth terms. In this way the tables of natural sines, tangents, and secants, could easily be framed. Thus, the logarithmic sines of the successive arcs, 50\u00b0, 50\u00b0 1', 50\u00b0 2', and 50\u00b0 3' being from Vlacq's Tables, to find the logarithmic sine of 50\u00b0 4'.\n\n| Arcs | Logarithmic Sines |\n|------|------------------|\n| 50\u00b0 0' | 9.8842539665 |\n| 1'   | 9.8843599396 |\n| 2'   | 9.8844658502 |\n| 3'   | 9.8845716981 |\n| 4'   | 9.8846774835 |\n\nHere, passing over the middle term, the difference between the logarithmic sines of 50\u00b0 1' and of 50\u00b0 3' is doubled, and added to that of 50\u00b0, to form the logarithmic sine of 50\u00b0 4'.\n\nBut a nearer approximation may be obtained, by supposing the second differences of any series to form the arithmetical progression. The sum of the extreme terms \\(C-2B+A\\) and \\(F-2E+D\\) would, therefore, be equal to the sum of the mean terms \\(D-2C+B\\) and \\(E-2D+C\\); whence \\(F-A=3B+3E-2C-2D\\), or \\(F=A+3(B+E)-2(C+D)\\). Thus, the natural sines of the successive arcs 30, 31, 32, 34, and 35 degrees may be easily computed to seven places of figures.\n\n| Arcs | Sines |\n|------|-------|\n| 30\u00b0 | .5000000 |\n| 31\u00b0 | .5150381 |\n| 32\u00b0 | .5299193 |\n| 33\u00b0 | .5446390 |\n| 34\u00b0 | .5592929 |\n| 35\u00b0 | .5735764 |\n\nThe sines of 31\u00b0 and of 34\u00b0 are here added together, and the sum tripled, and from this amount is taken the double of the sum of the sines of 31\u00b0 and of 33\u00b0; the sine of 30\u00b0 being subtracted from that remainder, leaves finally the sine of 35\u00b0.\n\nEmploying the same number of terms of the series, a still closer approximation may be discovered, by considering the third differences only as uniformly progressive. Wherefore the extreme differences \\(D-3C+3B-A\\) and \\(F-3E+3D-C\\) will be together equal to double the middle one, \\(E-3D+3C-B\\), and consequently \\(F-A=5E-10D+10C-5B\\), or \\(F=A+5(E-B)-10(D-C)\\).\n\nHence the logarithms even of low numbers may be computed exact to eight decimal places. Thus, the logarithms of 150, 151, 152, 153, and 154, being given, that of 155 is found by this process:\n\n| Numbers | Logarithms |\n|---------|------------|\n| 150     | 2.17609126 |\n| 151     | 2.17897695 |\n| 152     | 2.18189359 |\n| 153     | 2.18469143 |\n| 154     | 2.18752072 |\n| 155     | 2.19033170 |\n\nThe difference between the logarithms of 151 and 154 is here multiplied by 5, and the difference of the logarithms of 152 and 153 is multiplied by 10; and the excess of the former product above the latter being added to the logarithm of 150, gives the logarithm of 155.\n\nIt would obviously be preferable, however, to employ the formula in a modified form for interpolation merely. Hence \\(D=C+\\frac{1}{2}(E-B)+A-F\\).\n\nIf six terms of the series were given, the seventh could be found to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> degree of accuracy. The sum of the extremes of the progressive third differences being now assumed equal to that of the means, we have \\(D-3C+3B-A+G-3F+3E-D=E-3D+3C-B+F-3E+3D-C\\), and by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> \\(G-A=4F-5E-5C-4B\\), whence \\(G=A+4(F-B)-5(E-C)\\). It seems unnecessary to subjoin any farther illustrations; but the very simple methods of interpolation now proposed, might be applied with great facility and advantage in various physical researches.

href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">Navy</a> belonging to each county, at the respective periods of taking the Census; but the Actual Total in England, in 1821, was 11,261,437; in Wales it was 717,438; and in Scotland it was 9,009,456; as then enumerated, and as is shown in these Summaries, by the numbers of Males and Females.\n\n### THE <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">METROPOLIS</a>.\n\nThe rapid increase of the population in the suburbs, since the beginning of the last century, shows how rapidly the metropolis increases in extent, although its population has not increased so fast as that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>. In 1700, the metropolis contained almost an eighth part of the inhabitants of England and Wales; in 1750 and in 1801, about a tenth part; but in 1811 and at present, only about a twelfth part.\n\nObjections might be made to the propriety of the limits of the metropolis as herein assumed, and it may therefore be right to add, that the population of all the parishes, of which the churches are situate within eight miles rectilinear around St Paul's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHEDRAL\">Cathedral</a> (including the before mentioned addition of one twenty-fifth part), would, in 1801, have amounted to 1,031,500\u2014in 1811, to 1,220,200\u2014and in 1821, to no less than 1,481,500; without including the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOLWICH\">Woolwich</a>, which contains 17,008 additional.\n\nN. B. The population ascribed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> is comprised within a district of full such an extent.\n\nThe arrivals of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COASTING\">coasting</a> vessels in the port of London may be estimated to have been about 5500, in the year 1700;\u20146400, in the year 1750;\u201410,400, in 1801;\u201413,500, in 1811; and at about 17,000 per annum, since the year 1817. This produces a constant, though fluctuating accession to the population, to a larger amount than elsewhere, and consequently, a twenty-fifth, instead of a fiftieth part, is to be added to form a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> with the Parish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGISTER\">Register</a> Returns in the General Abstract. With this addition, the metropolis, in the year 1801, contained about 900,000;\u2014in 1811, about 1,050,000;\u2014and in 1821, about 1,274,800 inhabitants. The totals would then be, in\n\n| Year   | Population |\n|--------|------------|\n| 1700   | 674,350    |\n| 1750   | 676,250    |\n| 1801   | 900,000    |\n| 1811   | 1,050,000  |\n| 1821   | 1,274,800  |\n\nThe actual totals, as enumerated, were 864,845, 1,009,546, 1,225,694.\nComparison of the Population of the Shires of Scotland.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> claims of our countryman, Roger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACON\">Bacon</a>, such as they are, are however unquestionable; as this substance is described in his writings about the year 1270; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> eighty years before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of the supposed discovery of Schwartz. But even Bacon has as little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> to this invention as his supposed rival; nor, indeed, when we examine his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of this then wonderful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a>, do we perceive that he makes any claim to have been the discoverer. On the contrary, he quotes it as a well known substance, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> all over the world for making squibs to amuse children. So pertinacious are vulgar errors. The passage in Bacon stands as follows: \"Ex hoc ludicro puerili, quod fit in multis mundi partibus, scilicet, ut instrumento facto <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-AD\">ad</a> quantitatem pollicis humani, ex violentia salis qui salpetra vocatur, tam horribiles sonus nascitur.\" This is the description of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARCHMENT\">parchment</a> cracker. \"In ruptura tam modici pergameni, quod fortis tonitrum excedere rugitum et corruscationem maximam sui luminis jubar excedit.\" Thus the claim is shifted without difficulty from Bacon, and, as Dutens thinks he can show, is removed to Magnus Graecus, whose MS. he quotes, and from which he presumes that Bacon derived the invention; although, by his own showing, Bacon need not have consulted an obscure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> for an invention of general notoriety. The title of the MS. in question is as follows: \"Incipit Liber Ignium a Marco Graeco perscriptus, cujus virtus et efficacia est ad comburendum hostes, tam in mari quam in terra,\" so that even the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> uses of gunpowder were then known. In the same MS. are contained directions for making a rocket, which we dare not quote on account of its length, but it is such as to prove that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of this firework was thoroughly understood. It is even remarkable that he recommends particularly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARCOAL\">charcoal</a> of willow wood, which we moderns have found by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> to be among the best for all the purposes of gunpowder.\n\nThus far, although we have not fixed the date of the invention, we have carried it, not only beyond Bacon, but even beyond this supposed predecessor; as he himself does not pretend to be the inventor, but the compiler, of a Liber Ignium; a treatise on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYROTECHNY\">pyrotechny</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a>, in attempting to ascend still higher, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> becomes more rare and more obscure, there are still insuperable facts to prove that its antiquity is far greater; however impossible it may be to approximate to the date of the invention, far less to assign that which seems buried among the obscurities of Oriental learning. The question of gunpowder, as applied to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTILLERY\">Artillery</a>, is a separate one; but there is abundant reason to believe that this compound was not only used in some form or other as an explosive and combustible substance, but was even applied to military purposes; it may be in the shape of rockets or other fireworks, which, for objects of amusement at least, have been familiar to the Chinese beyond all record.\n\nThe earliest date to which we can refer the knowledge of gunpowder, in defect of a sufficiently re-\nA.C.; although, from the very nature of this evidence, it follows that it was then not only known to the eastern nations, but that it must have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> been so; since, even at that early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, it was applied to warlike purposes. In the code of Hindoo laws, indeed, where it is mentioned, it is referred to a period which Oriental antiquaries have considered as coincident with the time of Moses. But the evidence to which we more particularly allude, is found in a passage of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">Life</a> of Apollonius Tyanaeus by Philostratus, the purport of which is, that Alexander was unwilling to attack the Oxydracae, who lived between the Hyphasis and the Ganges, because they were under the care of the gods, and overthrew their enemies with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a>, which they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a> from their walls. The same tale is told of the repulses experienced in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERCULES\">Hercules</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACCHUS\">Bacchus</a>.\n\nThe next of these early dates, in which also our evidence is imperfect, is 212 A.C., but the establishment of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of the last would render this one more credible. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYRACUSE\">Syracuse</a> by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHIMEDES\">Archimedes</a>, Vitruvius relates that one of his engines threw <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> with a great noise; a description which does not apply to any of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> artillery of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>. On a notice so superficial, we must not, however, lay too much stress; and here ends all the information which we have yet procured respecting the earliest knowledge of gunpowder. It seems, however, to be so decidedly capable of being traced from the East, through the intervention of the Arabs, that there can be little doubt of its being an Oriental invention, and of its having been thence imported into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>; and, indeed, the military use of rockets in the armies of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> ascends to a period beyond record.\n\nOf the earliest period at which it was known in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHINA\">China</a>, we have, in defect of their own evidence, only the testimony of Uffano, an Italian author, who affirms that not only gunpowder, but ordnance, was in use in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> in the year 85 A.D.; and that cannon were, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, remaining from the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> times, in some of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARITIME\">maritime</a> provinces, made both of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a>. Hence some writers presume, that the Chinese communicated the invention to the Indians; while it has also been said, but on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> sufficient authority, that they themselves received it from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TARTARY\">Tartary</a>\u2014a nation respecting which we know little or nothing, and in which we should not be inclined to look for an early acquaintance with the arts. This, however, refers to a date so late as 917; so that, if there is any dependence to be placed on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> and Chinese <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TARTARS\">Tartars</a> must themselves have borrowed the invention from those to whom they are said to have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENT\">lent</a> it.\n\nThere is after this a long blank; and the first author on the subject that we have discovered is in 1249, twenty years before the date of Bacon's narrative. This is an Arabic writer, in the Escorial collection, who is translated by Casiri. His description is such, that it may apply both to rockets and to shells. In the former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, it only proves the knowledge of the detonating compound; the latter, were it proved, would show that they were also acquainted with the use of ordnance; although it is not impossible but that such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROJECTILES\">projectiles</a> might have been thrown by mechanical artillery.\n\nAs the invention of gunpowder has been popularly attributed to Bacon and Schwartz, so the use of ordnance has been referred to the time of the field of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CRESSY\">Cressy</a>, or 1346. To <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> over the Chinese hypothesis on this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the subject, we shall find that cannon was known at least as early as 1312. This we derive from the source quoted by Casiri; from Arabian writers who describe the use of ordnance in 1312 and in 1323; while, if Barbour is to be trusted, Edward III. was also provided with some pieces of artillery in 1327; and Pere Daniel asserts that cannon was known to the French in 1338. We need not carry this discussion lower; though, in favour of the Oriental origin of this invention, we would still remark, that artillery was much in use in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a> when it was still little used elsewhere; as by the Venetians against <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENOA\">Genoa</a>, in 1380, and by Alphonso XI. in his wars against the Moors.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">Composition</a> of Gunpowder.\n\nThe present composition of the Chinese corresponds so nearly with our own, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> is nearly insensible; but whether it had arrived at that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of perfection in their ancient periods, we have no means of knowing. Neither can we judge of its nature and power as known to the Arabs. But, in our own country, it was very late in arriving at its present state of perfection; nor do the various proportions given by one of our earliest writers on the subject, argue much in favour of their chemical knowledge, or turn for experiments. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a> Whitehorne, who wrote in 1573, gives numerous proportions, without seeming well aware of their respective values; and, respecting some of them, it is easy to see that they were scarcely fit for squibs, much less for the purpose of projecting shot. Such is nitre, sulphur, charcoal, equal parts; while, in the very opposite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a>, we have nitre 12 parts, sulphur and charcoal, of each 3 parts; and, still worse, nitre 27 to 3 of the other two ingredients; or nitre, 48 parts, with 7 of sulphur and .3 of charcoal. Here, such as these compositions are, want of experience can scarcely be pleaded, as they are not better than those given by Nye, in 1380. In France also, the composition, at no very remote period, was nitre 50, sulphur 16, charcoal 3\u00bd; from which it varied to, nitre 67, sulphur 13, charcoal 20, and to nitre 84, sulphur 8; charcoal 8; these differences being supposed necessary for the larger cannon, and the smaller progressively; the last being their musket powder.\n\nBut as we cannot afford space to describe the gradual progress of improvement in the composition of gunpowder, we shall now state the proportions at present in use in different nations. They do not materially differ from each other, although it is unquestionable that they are not all of equal power.\nThe proportions in the commercial gunpowder of England vary indefinitely, according to the views of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANUFACTURER\">manufacturer</a> respecting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARKETS\">markets</a>, the price, and other matters. Cheapness being the leading <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> where it is only made for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a>, and the nitre being the only expensive article, the proportion of this is diminished, and those of the other two ingredients increased. The worst is made for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUINEA\">Guinea</a> trade, and, if we are not misinformed, that for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CANADA\">Canada</a> trade is nearly as bad, while the next upwards in the scale is that sold to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TURKEY\">Turkey</a>. We have never met any specimen in which there was less than 62 of nitre; but have reason to believe that some of the inferior kinds do not contain more than 50.\n\nFor the use of miners it also is made with a low proportion of nitre; producing advantages in mining not intended by the makers, whose only object was to manufacture a cheap article. But the proportions of all the commercial powders are very inconstant, even when furnished <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BONA\">bona</a> fide to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, as it is impossible to prevent the workmen from purloining the nitre, and replacing it with the cheapest ingredients.\n\nIt is not for want of experiments if greater uniformity has not been attained in these compositions, and if all adhere to their own. Baptista Porta was one of the first who made accurate investigations on this subject; and, as long ago as 1515, he fixed on the proportions now used in France. Beaum\u00e9, some time ago, fixed on 80 of nitre, 5 of sulphur, and 15 of charcoal; and the opinions of Morveau, Chaptal, and Proust, are displayed in the preceding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>.\n\nIt is easy to account for these differences of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, when we recollect the numerous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCESSORY\">accessory</a> circumstances which modify or vitiate the results obtained from practice. With the very same power it is scarcely possible to procure uniform ones, as is well known to Artillerists; and hence, from practice alone, unless with an enormous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of trials, no certain conclusions can be drawn. It <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a>, indeed, appear,\nGunpowder are concerned, we do not consider this as of much moment; or that any material object would be obtained by using different ones, proportioned to the respective calibres. But we consider that they commit a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> in adopting the same for the mining <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>; and that some of the failures caused in our wars, in attempting to blow up works or demolish bridges, have been produced by the very excellence of the powder,\u2014by its too great strength, in short. To take the case of common blast-mining as a simple one, and to put the extreme case of all; if it be attempted to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> a rock by the powder of chlorate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POTASH\">potash</a>, either the plug will be blown out, or a very narrow space round the mine will be broken. With the best musket or cannon powder the same effects, but in a less degree, follow. Here the miners' powder, which seldom contains as much as 60 per cent. of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALTPETRE\">saltpetre</a>, is effectual; and, what is more, it is rendered still more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> by being damp from careless keeping, or from remaining some time in the mine before it is fired. Mathematicians will immediately see the solution of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> incongruity, by recollecting that the element of time is an ingredient in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a>. With too great a velocity the parts of the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> nearest to the acting force are disintegrated; so that not only is the force expended in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a>, but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAS\">gas</a> thus escapes from the opening. With a power acting more slowly, the whole mass, or a much larger one at least than in the first case, is moved; and thus the rock is widely shaken, although not blown into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>. It will be found practically, that the further the fragments are dispersed, the less is the effect; and thus the mine which is most dangerous to the workmen, is also the least efficacious.\n\nIt is from this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> respecting the power of gunpowder, hitherto unattended to, from confounding impulse and pressure, to which at least it bears a certain relation, that so many different opinions have been entertained respecting the force of powder in particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>. Hence also have arisen various projects for increasing its efficacy; among which quick-lime has been repeatedly recommended. In mining it does actually increase the effect, though not the force. It diminishes the force, on the contrary; and it is from that very cause that it is more effectual in mining or shaking a rock. The same object can be obtained by a mixture of sawdust; but it must also be remembered, that this will not happen unless good powder be used. Ordinary miners' powder will not often bear this kind of dilution. It is easy now to apply this principle to military mining, where the object is to produce as extensive a shock as possible. Mathematicians have calculated the globes of compression for certain charges; but it will be found that these will vary so much, according to the strength of the material, that the conclusions cannot be depended on. This is a very important problem, however; because the destruction of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> depends on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a> of the base of the paraboloid, or whatever else the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> is, which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPLOSION\">explosion</a> produces. We dare not, however, enter further on this subject, as it would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> us beyond our limits.\n\nOn the Choice and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">Examination</a> of the Materials.\n\nNitre, as it is imported from India, whence all that is used in this country is procured, is mixed with much dirt and with some salts, consisting chiefly of the nitrates and muriats of lime, and of muriat of potash. As the deliquescent salts, in particular, are extremely injurious, from their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of attracting moisture, it is most important that the nitre to be used in gunpowder should be thoroughly refined. For this purpose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> ought to be used if possible, and if not, such river or other waters as are found, on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> by the appropriate tests, to contain the least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of saline matters. The nitre is first boiled, and the grosser impurities separated by filtering through hempen bags, after which it is crystallized. After <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-DRAINING\">draining</a>, one washing is sufficient to render the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CRYSTALLIZATION\">crystallization</a> sufficiently pure; but the subsequent ones require repeated solution and crystallization before all the foreign salts can be separated. We need not, however, dwell on this subject, and shall only add, that no nitre ought to be used unless it will stand the tests of nitrat of silver and of carbonat of potash, without exhibiting a precipitate.\n\nIt is held necessary that the nitre should be thoroughly dried; and, accordingly, much unnecessary labour is bestowed on this object, since it must be moistened in the mill when the composition is submitted to the rollers. The only real use in drying it is to enable the workman more easily to allot the true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>, which might equally well be done by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> and an experiment. We should scarcely have noticed this, but that the French manufacturers boast much of the superiority which they derive from reducing the nitre to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> crystals, by agitating the solution. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MILLS\">mills</a> it is further the practice to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUSE\">fuse</a> the nitre into large cakes. By this method it is speedily dried, easily stored away, and protected from depredation. These advantages are held to be sufficient to compensate the expense; but it ought to be remembered that there is a degree of hazard in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a>; as, if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> should be overheated, it might be so far decomposed as to have a portion of potash united with it.\n\nSulphur, as it is received from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SICILY\">Sicily</a>, the great emporium of this commodity, is mixed with a considerable proportion of lime, while a portion of it is also combined with that substance, forming calcareous hepar, or sulphuret of lime. From this and the grosser accidental matters it is purified by melting; the sulphuret and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> subsiding to the bottom of the mould, so as to admit of being mechanically separated. This residue, yielding no more pure sulphur by that process, is afterwards submitted to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTILLATION\">distillation</a>. When the sublimed material is to be used, it requires previous washing, till it is entirely freed from the sulphuric acid adhering to it, and it may be tested for this purpose by means of the muriat of barrytes. The fused sulphur, if doubted of, may be submitted to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMBUSTION\">combustion</a>, and the residue noted; but a little deficiency in the purity of this ingredient is of no moment.\n\nWith respect to the charcoal, there is considerably more nicety required than is generally imagined. The soft woods have been preferred from time immemorial; since even in the receipt of Magnus Graecus, formerly quoted, the willow is mentioned. The poplar and many others have been used abroad, but in this country those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> adopted are the\nGunpowder, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> willow and the alder. Even among these soft woods there is a considerable difference, as our own experiments have shown; and in them it was proved that the greatest explosive power, ceteris paribus, was produced by the wood of the *Rhamnus frangula*, commonly called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> dogwood, as we shall show more particularly hereafter. The hard woods are invariably rejected, and with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>; though the reasons for this practice, which are derived from the presence of salts in these, are not the causes of their inferiority, certainly not the only ones. It is nevertheless true, that no wood which contains carbonat of potash, or other deliquescent salts, is fit for the purpose, and for the most obvious reasons; and this is the case in the oak, elm, fir, and other trees. But there is another reason for the badness of these kinds of charcoal, the cause of which is not so obvious, although it is evidently connected with their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a>. To us it appears to depend on the small proportion of hydrogen combined with the carbon in these charcoals, compared to that which exists in the produce of the softer woods. Even these can be reduced to the same state by overheating. Thus the hydrogen is dissipated, and the charcoal becomes so hard as to scratch <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a>, in which case, however obtained, it is always unfit for powder.\n\nAs this subject is yet obscure, from our imperfect acquaintance with the true nature of charcoal, and with the modifications of which it is susceptible, it becomes necessary to have recourse to experiment, for the purpose of determining, at any rate, the proximate cause of this difference in the explosive powers of the several kinds. Various trials have accordingly been made, as well by ourselves as by the French chemists; and, for brevity's sake, we add the most important results in the subjoined table. We are not informed of the process which was adopted by the French for measuring the gas; but in our own, we had recourse to the pneumatic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a>, using it in the manner which is described in another part of this article for collecting the total produce of the combustion of gunpowder. The mixture, in the French experiments, consisted uniformly of 60 parts of nitre, and 12 of the charcoal submitted to trial. In our own they were varied, and the results taken from those in which the combustion of the charcoal was completed, and the quantity of gas greatest. As no more nitrous acid could be decomposed than there was coal present to burn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OXYGEN\">oxygen</a>, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> that in these the results are correct.\n\nThese results are such as to prove that there are important differences in the produce of gas; but, with regard to practice, they are of very little value, as few of the substances submitted to trial could be used. To admit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> between our own experiments and these, we shall reduce our proportions to the same standard, by taking our scale from the fibert at 72. We neglect the residue, knowing that it proves nothing, as the results are uncertain, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSORPTION\">absorption</a> of water, and partly from the impossibility of collecting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> and the gaseous matters both from one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a>.\n\n| Prop. Parts | Gas. | Solid Residue |\n|-------------|-----|--------------|\n| French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEMP\">Hemp</a> stalks | 62 | 12 |\n| Asphodel | 62 | 20 |\n| Vine | 64 | 20 |\n| Pearstalks | 62 | 21 |\n| Fir | 66 | 30 |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPINDLE\">Spindle</a> tree (*Euonymus Europaeus*) | 66 | 28 |\n| Chesnut | 66 | 36 |\n| Hazel | 66 | 33 |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-LAMP\">Lamp</a> black | 54 | 44 |\n| Coak | 54 | 45 |\n| Filbert | 72 | 30 |\n\nThe various results, and some others which we have thought it unnecessary to record, may, in a certain degree, depend on inaccuracies in the experiment; but in the greater number they arise from real differences in the charcoals from the same substance, produced, as we before insinuated, by overheating. This is apparent in the two cases above cited of oak and willow; but in some trials, the differences were even greater. Coak and animal charcoal are particularly liable to vary.\n\nIt is evident from the preceding table that the best charcoal for gunpowder must stand in the following order: Black dogwood, willow, alder, filbert. From the French tables, in which we do not, however, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> much confidence, we may add, consecutively, hazel, and the spindle tree; but our own trials raise these to 70 at least, in the scale. Such, at present, are the results of these trials as to the best charcoal; but we are by no means satisfied that we have yet found out the best wood for this purpose. The experiments are laborious; yet we think the subject deserving of more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> than has yet been bestowed on it. With respect to coak and animal coal, they stand very low in the scale, as the over-hardened wood-coals do; and, in all cases, there is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> relation between the produce of gas and the facility of combustion under ordinary circumstances.\n\nTo satisfy ourselves by trials of a more direct nature, and more applicable to practice, we chose a method derived from the flight of rockets, as less liable to disturbance from collateral causes than any practice with pieces of ordnance. The rockets were of compound dimensions, and were all made with the same proportions and driven by the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, so as to ensure all possible uniformity, the only variation being in the nature of the charcoal. The vertical\nGunpowder elevations were taken by two quadrants at the same time, and all the flights that deviated from the perpendicular rejected. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> vertical ascent of a great number of those, made with willow, alder, and dogwood, was 480 yards; but between these three coals, the differences were so great as to give various results, which may be represented by the following numbers:\n\nDogwood, 515, 550, 525  \nWillow, 470, 480, 490  \nAlder, 455, 460, 470\n\nGreater accuracy is not attainable in this way, as may easily be conceived by those who know by how many collateral circumstances a rocket is influenced; but these trials are quite sufficient to justify the general inference made from the experiments in the pneumatic apparatus.\n\nIt has been held that the charcoal for gunpowder ought to be made in cylinders or retorts by distillation; and this expensive process is consequently universally adopted. It is doubtful if this is not a mistake of the *causa pro non causa*. Pit charcoal being made in coppice woods, is always the produce of oak, and it is probable that this wood, if charred in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> vessels, would be even worse than it is now. There is more danger of overheating in the retort than in the pit, while the wood is not better burned; and hence, by a careless management of the process, even the charcoal of willow or alder may be rendered as bad as that of oak. Considering these various circumstances, charcoal requires to be submitted to three tests. It ought to act, as little as possible, mechanically, even on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>; it ought to exhibit no salts on being treated with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> distilled water and tested; and it ought to be thoroughly burnt. The best test of this latter circumstance is its giving out no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a> when heated.\n\nA new and economical method of distilling charcoal has recently been invented by Sir William Congreve. Subsequently, but without any knowledge of what had been done, as we understand, the same process was suggested in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a> by Dr Bollman, to whom we are indebted for the present cheap method of purifying pyrolignous acid, and rendering it a substitute for common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VINEGAR\">vinegar</a>. In this beautiful process the retorts or cylinders are ranged in a row, a gas pipe from each being conducted to the bottom of the next in succession. By means of a fire under the first alone, the distillation of the whole may be conducted together; the gas which issues from that one being sufficient to char the next, and so on in succession to the end of the chain. The acid is collected in this case, as in others, by means of a separate pipe arising from a lower point in the retort.\n\nBefore we dismiss this very important and somewhat neglected department of the gunpowder manufactory, we must point out a circumstance with respect to charcoal, that requires an attention which it has never yet experienced. This is the property which it possesses of absorbing and retaining water, and which we have ascertained to be different in the different kinds of wood; although we have had no opportunity of investigating fully that which is here recommended to the attention of powder manufacturers.\n\nIt is from this hygrometric power that gunpowder attracts moisture, even when the nitre has been perfectly purified: a circumstance which materially interferes with its rapidity of inflammation, and, consequently, with its strength. But as the various hygrometric powers of different charcoals have never yet been properly examined, we can communicate no information on this subject which is worth recording.\n\n**On the Manufacture of Gunpowder.**\n\n**<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRINDING\">Grinding</a>.**\n\nThe first part of the process consists in pulverizing all the ingredients separately, after which, they are weighed and mixed in a general and rude manner before being submitted to the mill. In France, and in some other countries, a pestle engine is used, or a stamping-mill; but it is subject to more hazard and inconveniences than the grinding mill which is adopted in this country. This is formed on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> of the common bark mill, and with two rollers at different distances from the axis, so as to cover the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a>. The weight of each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROLLER\">roller</a> is commonly about three tons, and they are generally made of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">limestone</a>, although iron cylinders have been adopted in some works. The bed, which is surrounded by a wooden margin, is of the same materials, and the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> is built of slight framed wood, to diminish the evils that might arise from a casual explosion. A wooden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RAKE\">rake</a> follows the rollers for the purpose of bringing the mixture under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a>; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> is communicated, either by water or by the power of horses.\n\nThe mixture being distributed on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, to the amount of 40 or 50 lbs. is moistened with distilled or rain water, but so as not to be wetted. It is barely sufficient to prevent the dust from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a>. According to the velocity, the grinding is perfected in a space of time varying from three to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> hours, and it depends on the inspector to determine by trial for each velocity when the mixture is perfect. After that, time is a sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>. The removal of the mill cake, as it is called, requires caution, as it is commonly at this time that the explosions take place. These, indeed, will generally be produced if the bed and cylinder should come into contact while they are moved round slowly, to enable the materials to be taken out; the friction, under so great a weight, even of the purest limestones, or of iron, being sufficient to inflame gunpowder. To prevent this risk, a thick piece of hide is carried before the cylinder as the powder is removed, and by this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> the contact is prevented.\n\n**Pressing, Granulating, and Drying.**\n\nThe mill cake thus completed is gunpowder, and may be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANULATED\">granulated</a>. But it is yet not so firm as it can be rendered by further pressure; and that property is very essential to its durability in travelling. For this reason, it is further condensed by pressure, either in the common screw-press used by packers, or by means of Bramah's hydraulic engine. Thus it becomes indurated to a hardness equal to\nGunpowder, that of many stones, and its specific gravity is also increased. In the press, also, it is divided into cakes of an inch or more in thickness, that it may be the more easily broken into pieces for the Granulating Engine.\n\nThis machine consists of a number of sieves made of strong vellum, perforated by punched holes, and supplied with top and bottom covers, like those used by druggists. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATFORM\">platform</a>, to which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> circular motion is communicated by machinery, receives a number of these which are fixed in it. The lumps of the press-cake are introduced into each of these, together with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLOCK\">block</a> of lignum vitae or other hard wood, shaped somewhat like a Dutch cheese. During the rotatory motion, the lumps become thus broken into smaller fragments, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> through the holes, together with the dust, into the receptacle below.\n\nIt remains to separate the grains according to the sizes that are required; and for military purposes, these are three; one for large ordnance, another for musketry, and a third for pistols. The powder generally used by sportsmen is of a still finer grain than the last. The separation is performed by means of wire <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GAUZE\">gauze</a>, or strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a> gauze, of different apertures; the sieves being commonly cylindrical and turned by the machinery. At the same time the dust is separated, and afterwards returned to the press.\n\nThe last operation is known by the name of Glazing, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> literally true in the case of sportsmen's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHOOTING\">shooting</a> powder. But the real object of this operation is to take off all those acute <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> from the grains, which would otherwise be ground off in travelling, and thus produce great inconveniences, by introducing dust into the casks. This process is performed, by causing the separate classes of grains to revolve in cylinders so constructed as only to let the dust through; and the mutual friction of the grains produces the desired effect. When it is required to give the powder a brilliant surface, as is the case with fine sportsman's powder, the cylinder is lined with a woollen cloth; and sometimes, if a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> polished gloss is desired, some black lead is introduced into it. But these are matters of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> ornament.\n\nAlthough the powder thus completed appears dry to the feel as well as to the sight, it contains a considerable quantity of water. This must be separated by drying. In hot climates, exposure to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> is sufficient, but in most cases, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> is required. In France, a complex process was adopted by passing heated and dry air through a closed chamber, with the intention of diminishing the risk of explosion; but, with any moderate degree of care, it may be done in any manner. In some of the older works, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STOVE\">stove</a> in use was a closed room with air holes above, heated by means of an iron cupola or large pot, to which a fire was applied outside of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>; the temperature being regulated by a thermometer fixed in the door and indicating the heat externally. In this room, the powder was exposed in flat trays round the circumference. Lately, the method by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEAM\">steam</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PIPES\">pipes</a> has become generally adopted, and in this way, every possible security, real as well as imaginary, is obtained.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">Analysis</a> of Gunpowder.\n\nIt is often useful, and frequently indispensable, to analyse gunpowder. This process will, indeed, generally supersede the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of proving by the usual methods; as it is always certain that a specimen of gunpowder, well made, will produce the best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a>. It is particularly convenient in the case of gunpowder purchased from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a>, or by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a>; as, from the several causes which may easily be conjectured, such an article may be deficient in the quantity or in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of the saltpetre, or in both. It is useful, moreover, in the case of damaged powder, returned from military and naval service; as we can determine by these means, whether it has been wetted by rain or by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> water, or whether any portion of the nitre has been washed out. Powder thus damaged by fresh water only, and otherwise uninjured, may be committed to the mill and restored at a very trifling expense. If the saltpetre is diminished, it can thus also be restored; but, on the contrary, if the damage has been produced by sea water, it becomes necessary to destroy the powder for the purpose of extracting the nitre.\n\nBy washing the powder previously weighed in a filter, with hot distilled water, the nitre is dissolved, and admits of being crystallized and weighed. The tests formerly mentioned, namely, nitrat of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a> and carbonat of potash, may then be used to determine its purity. Thus it may be ascertained whether, in a new sample, the nitre is in sufficient proportion, and whether it has been well purified, and in a damaged one, whether the injury has arisen from fresh or from salt water. It only remains to examine the proportions of the charcoal and sulphur; a task, however, which is less easy, but which is, at the same time, less necessary, as the manufacturers are under no great temptation to assume a wrong proportion of these, although the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> quantity of the whole may be in excess. This mixture, being dried and weighed, must be exposed to a moderate heat; as long as any sulphur can be sublimed. But, as the last portions are inseparable in this manner, it is necessary at length to have recourse to other means. Among those that have been tried, there is none more convenient than boiling, in a solution of pure alkali, by which a sulphuret is formed, and the weight of the dried charcoal thus completes the analysis.\n\nAnalysis of Gunpowder after Explosion.\n\nTo a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, at least, an analysis of gunpowder, after explosion, is necessary for the purpose of procuring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATA\">data</a> whence its force may, a priori, be calculated. The rest is only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of curiosity, and we have borrowed the determination from the experiments of the late Mr Cruikshank, a name known to chemists as that of the discoverer of carbonic oxide. As far as this analysis may differ from that of others, it must be recollected that the separation of mixed gases is not a very easy problem. The mere collection of the total gaseous products is easy; and had the same method been followed by Robins and others, less difficulty would have been found in their computations. Had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> Rumford,\nGunpowder, and a numerous party of speculators on this subject, adopted so simple an expedient, they would not have had recourse to the expansive force of steam, or of the air contained within the charge, for an explanation of the cause and nature of the force.\n\nBy ramming 100 grains of powder into a narrow metallic tube, furnished with a long handle, it is easily caused to burn under water; as the combustion is slow and safe when it is thus condensed; and this quantity is sufficient for any purpose of experiment. The tube being plunged under the water, with its mouth downwards under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELL\">bell</a>-glass of the pneumatic apparatus, the powder may be lighted without any loss. This is done by introducing, into that part of the tube above the charge, which is purposely left empty, a crooked wire heated to redness. After the hot wire and the tube in this position are immersed under the bell, the former is brought into contact with the charge. To prevent the water from absorbing any portion of the carbonic acid, sulphuric acid may be added to it, as well as many other matters too obvious to mention; or else it may be heated. Thus the gaseous product may be collected and examined at leisure, by the means which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">chemistry</a> furnishes, and which our limits will not permit us to detail.\n\nTo collect the solid product, it is most convenient to use a glass vessel, on account of the certainty of obtaining the produce, which is, in great part, carried up in smoke, and adheres to the receptacle in which the powder is burnt. But we need not describe the numerous modes in which this object can be attained; only adding, that to diminish the hazard, the powder for this purpose may be wetted without affecting the results.\n\nThe following statement, then, contains the gaseous produce of 100 grains, made of the proportions 75 nitre, 10 sulphur, 15 charcoal; the measure and weight being both included. The temperature is reduced to 65, and the barometric pressure to 29.5.\n\nThe total gaseous produce measured 91 cubic inches, and the total weight 50 grains. Thus, about half the weight of the powder becomes converted into gas, and the remainder forms the solid produce:\n\n| Subcarbonat of potash | 40 |\n| Sulphat of potash      | 11 |\n| Charcoal               | 3  |\n| Sulphur                | 0.5|\n| **Total**              | **54.5** |\n\nIt is not difficult to account for these various products, and it is evident that the carbonic acid and the azote are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> causes of the explosion. The decomposition of the acid, and the combustion of the charcoal, form the basis of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> force. It may be imagined that the hydrogen is the produce of contained water; but we consider that it is principally derived from the charcoal and from the sulphur. The two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a> which it forms are such as might be expected, and the nitrous gas requires no remark. Respecting the solid produce, the produce of the subcarbonat and sulphat of potash is a matter of course; and it is only necessary to point out the excess; of charcoal principally, of sulphur slightly. It is evident that more nitre would be required to consume them; but, as we formerly remarked, it is held expedient that there should be an excess in this way rather than in the other. We need not, however, dwell longer on this analysis; since, as far as the effects of gunpowder are concerned, it is the quantity, not the quality, of the produce that is an object of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>.\n\nOn the Sizes and Forms of the Grains in Gunpowder.\n\nThe variety in the effects of gunpowder, arising from differences in the sizes and forms of the grains, has been an object of much inquiry. The conditions of the problem are somewhat complicated. Within certain limits, which gunpowder made of nitre cannot exceed, rapidity of inflammation is essential to the production of a full effect. Not to inquire into other causes, without this property, a part of the charge is rendered useless by being blown out unburnt; an accident not uncommon on ordinary occasions. This may also happen from the form of the piece and that of the charge: it will occur in a long charge or in a short piece; or, most of all, when both are united. Hence variations in the effect of gunpowder, that are independent of its quality, and which will render computations, founded on that circumstance alone, deceptive. As we have not room to dwell on this subject as it deserves, we must refer our readers to Robins, and others who have written on it.\n\nNow, this rapidity of inflammation may be attained, in some measure, in two ways: by intense heat, and by facility of transmission of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a>. But if a charge is considerable, no intensity of heat can compensate for the absence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> condition. To put an extreme case. If the eight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATTERING\">battering</a> charge of a 24 pounder were a single grain, it requires little thought to perceive that the shot would have quitted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUN\">gun</a> before the charge was half burnt. Hence, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANULATION\">granulation</a> is as necessary for ensuring the full effect as it is for con-\nGunpowder.venience: and thus, also, we are led to the cause of the bad consequences of hard ramming: a charge very thoroughly rammed, and lighted at the anterior end, would burn like a fuse or a squib; if lighted by a touch-hole, it will be blown out like a shot. Thus the rapidity of the inflammation is secured by multiplying as much as possible the intervals for the passage of the flame, or by diminishing the size of the grains. Yet there is a limit even to this; and as that can only be determined by experiment, it is from such trials that the grain for the smallest charges has been fixed. As the charge, however, increases in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIMENSION\">dimension</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of flame and the intensity of the heat produced admit of a grain of greater bulk, or one containing, in a given dimension, a smaller number of intervals. Much refinement on this subject being, however, unnecessary, one size is used for all ordnance; while an inferior size is made for muskets, and one still less for pistols: the powder manufactured for fowling pieces is also of the smallest size.\n\nBut there is a further element concerned in this question; and that is, the different specific gravities of the different sizes of powder, or, what is especially to the purpose here, the different spaces occupied by the different sizes. The same measure which contains 172 grains of the smallest, contains 180 of the medium, and 195 of the largest. If powder be measured instead of weighed, it is evident that there will be one-ninth more of the large than of the small grained in a given charge: if weighed, the larger will occupy about one-ninth less space. In either case the greater force will be excited by the large grained, presuming that the inflammation is perfect: when it is weighed, as is the correct practice, it will not be very difficult to calculate the difference; as the force of the expanding fluid is, in a certain inverse ratio, of the space in which it is confined.\n\nTo increase the rapidity of inflammation, the French have manufactured spherical powder. The details of the process are such as would exceed the limits allotted to this article; but the principle may be understood by saying, that it is similar to that used by confectioners in making comfits. Angular grains are rolled in machinery adapted to that purpose, in powder dust slightly moistened; and thus small globules are formed. This grain is less liable to wear in travelling, from the absence of angles; but it is, at the same time, more tender and less able to bear pressure than pressed powder. Nor do the French experiments, either by the eprouvettes or the tables of practice, prove its superiority; on the contrary, the average results of its comparison with ordinary powder are unfavourable; and this also was observed in our own trial. Hence, it has not been adopted in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>.\n\nProving of Gunpowder.\n\nTo ascertain, by practical trials, the strength of gunpowder, is not merely a matter of curiosity, but of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> necessity. As the force, in battering ordnance, and the range, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTAR\">mortar</a> and howitzer practice, is regulated by the quantity of the charge, it is obvious, that no regular practice in the field, or consistent results, will be obtained, unless the standard of strength in the powder is both known and invariable. This is particularly the case with mortar practice against small works or redoubts, or against the enemy's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRENCHES\">trenches</a>; and with howitzer practice against moving columns in the field. An invariable standard is, unfortunately, impossible; but it is always something to approximate to it. In military arrangements, a proof is also requisite, for the most obvious reasons, when powder is purchased from merchant manufacturers; not only that a minimum standard of strength may be fixed, but that, as far as is possible, the various qualities furnished may be reduced by mixture to an uniform standard.\n\nIt is usual, in the first place, among the workmen, as well as the merchants, to form a judgment of the quality of gunpowder by the aspect and firmness of the grain; and the latter, indeed, is a quality which is indispensable, if it is to be exposed to much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> carriage. The nicety of tact required for this is, however, only to be attained by practice; as in all other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of sampling. The moisture is judged of by weighing, and by subsequent drying and comparison. The quantity of this is a question of profit and loss in the purchase. But it is more important to ascertain its hygrometrical powers, by exposure to moisture after drying. That is the best which gains least weight by this operation; nor, in any case, should the absorption of water amount to $\\frac{4}{2}$ per cent. It is also a common practice to try it by what is called flashing: but this only serves to show whether it has been thoroughly ground: if not, the charcoal will produce sparks.\n\nThe trial of force is made by eprouvettes of different constructions, or else by practice. The most common eprouvette is a short chamber, provided with a gun-lock, the orifice of which is closed by a cover, connected with a graduated and ratchet wheel and spring. The quantity of the wheel's revolution is the esteemed measure of the force. But often as this machine has been varied and improved, the results are so irregular, that it may fairly be considered as useless. Various other instruments for this purpose have been invented and tried; but, without figures, we could not render their constructions intelligible. Regnier's does not materially differ from the preceding in its principles; and the results are equally unsatisfactory. His hydrostatic one appears to be still worse. We may say the same of that described by Saint Remy, and of another recommended by the Chevalier D'Arcy; and, of the whole, we would remark that the leading fault is want of simplicity. In a case like the explosion of gunpowder, where so many disturbing forces are always at hand to vitiate the true results, we cannot be too careful in eliciting all unnecessary causes of disturbance. If there is any one class of machinery in which simplicity is indispensable, it is that which belongs to gunpowder, under any of its relations.\n\nWe, however, consider that, as an eprouvette, Dr Hutton's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PENDULUM\">pendulum</a> is as free from exception as any machine can be. The disturbing forces are nothing, or as little as possible; the charging and firing admits of great uniformity; and, on trial, the consistency of the results justifies the expectations\nGunpowder formed from its simplicity. In this pendulum, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARREL\">barrel</a> is fixed upon the bob, and the force of the gunpowder is therefore measured, not, as in Robins's, by the impulse of a shot, but by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOIL\">recoil</a>. The indication of the extremity of the arc of vibration is made by a hand continuous with the pendulum rod, which moves an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">index</a> furnished with a spring sufficiently strong to retain it at that point of a graduated arc, where it was left by the movement of the hand.\n\nThe barrel used for this purpose is an inch in diameter, and is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> with two ounces of powder put in loosely, without wadding or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a>. In this, as in all other cases of eprouvettes, the standard of strength is arbitrary; and, for service, is assumed from the best average of gunpowder manufactured by Government. The goodness of particular specimens is estimated by their agreement, or otherwise, with this standard.\n\nNotwithstanding, however, the apparent accuracy of this method, artillery officers, both in France and England, are not satisfied with it as a method of proving powder for service. It is, perhaps, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>, that practical men should, in a matter of so much importance, rely only on such a method of proof as agrees best with the particular objects for which the material is intended. Yet it should also be recollected, that all Robins's conclusions respecting the force of gunpowder were drawn from experiments made on his Balistic pendulum, and that the much more accurate ones of Dr Hutton, on which we now rely, were the results of the practice with that pendulum which we have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> described.\n\nThe method of proving, then, adopted both in France and England, consists in real practice from a mortar at short ranges. In France a mortar is used of which the diameter is 0.191 (metres), or nearly eight inches English, and that of the touch-hole somewhat less than two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a>. The diameter of the ball is 0.1895 (metres), and the windage consequently is 0.015. The weight of the ball is about 60 lbs. A troublesome verification of the diameter of the bore, of the vent, and of the shot, is made for each day's practice. The mortar is condemned when the diameter is enlarged to 0.192, or if that of the vent becomes 0.005 more than it ought to be. A difference of windage, amounting to 0.002 (metres) more than what is allowed, condemns the shot; or, as it may happen, the whole apparatus.\n\nAll these verifications are so tedious, and the wear of the mortar, the vent, and the shot, so rapid, that it becomes inconvenient or impossible to follow them so nicely in practice when there is much business. It is, therefore, found more convenient to make a standard trial for each day's proof, and to refer all the others to this one; instead of trying to preserve what becomes impossible in practice, an absolute and invariable range.\n\nThe English proof-mortar, therefore, nearly corresponds with the French, it being of the eight-inch calibre, and of brass. The shot is turned and polished so as to be true, and to have at the commencement the least practicable windage. During the progress of use, as the windage increases from the wear both of the bore and of the shot, the range becomes contracted; a circumstance which also follows from the enlargement of the vent; in consequence of which gunpowder a greater proportion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> air escapes at that aperture. But, from the practice adopted with us, these variations are of no moment, till the range becomes contracted so as to render it expedient to replace the shot or the mortar, or both.\n\nThe quantity of powder that is used is four ounces, and the mortar being elevated to 45 degrees, the range is measured in each trial. If the standard range for the day is 225 yards, the powder that gives a range of only 200 is rejected. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> precautions requisite to procure fair results in this comparative method, is to take care that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> of the platform and the elevation of the mortar are subject to no accidents; that the powder be fairly placed in the chamber; that the priming tube always reaches to the same depth within the charge; and that the mortar be brought to the same temperature at each experiment. For this purpose, it is to be cooled with water.\n\nMusket powder is submitted to a different species of proof; founded on the same views of rendering the proof for each kind as nearly corresponding as possible with the purposes for which they are designed. A barrel fitted with a turned steel ball, and with as little windage as possible, is used for this purpose. The ball is discharged at the distance of a few yards only, against a compound butt, made of elm planks an inch thick, soaked in water, and separated at a short distance from each other. The extent of the penetration is the proof of the strength of the powder; and the trials in this case also are referred to a standard experiment made each day. Before concluding this subject, we must add, that trials are also made for the purpose of ascertaining the hygrometric property of the powder to be purchased or issued. This is done by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> a quantity for a given time in a box perforated with holes, and in a damp room, and then submitting it to the same proof.\n\nPowder from Orymuriat of Polish\n\nTo increase the strength of gunpowder has been a favourite project with inventors at all times; all of them forgetting that the same end can be attained, as far as it is attainable, by augmenting the charge; and that neither the one nor the other is practicable without an entire reformation of the whole system of artillery. Could the force of powder be increased one-half, for example, it would be necessary to condemn almost every gun in use; and not only every gun, but every carriage, breeching, ringbolt; nay, we might almost add, every ship in the service. And supposing a new species of ordnance invented to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> the new powder, it would require at least one-half as much more of weight in guns and mortars, the same in gun <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARRIAGES\">carriages</a>; with additional strength in every object concerned about them. In the field, in the same manner, an increased number of horses would be required. This view presumes that the object is, what in fact it always has been with the herd of inventors on this subject, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> additional force, or range. If the purpose is only that of being enabled to reduce the quantity, and thus diminish the bulk and trouble of transportation, it is so trifling an ob-\nGunpowder, ject as scarcely to be worth attaining. With regard to the main intention, or that of gaining greater range and force, it is only necessary to say that the powder is already too strong for the artillery.\n\nAs soon as the oxymuriat of potash was known, it became obvious that it would not only answer the same purpose as vitre, but, from its more energetic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, produce a more rapid combustion. It was first proposed and made by Mons. Berthollet in 1786; but an accident having happened from it at Essone, by which many people lost their lives, it was abandoned. The proportions used were 80 oxymuriat, 5 sulphur, and 15 charcoal. Afterwards they attempted to make a modified compound by using only a proportion of it with the nitre; but after various trials of this kind, the whole project was abandoned.\n\nWe have repeated Berthollet's method at different times, and on a very large scale, without accidents; but we consider that the proportion of oxymuriat is too large,\u2014that it is at least larger than is necessary. A better proportion appears to be 75 oxymuriat, 5 sulphur, 20 charcoal. As this compound is very easily exploded by friction, it is necessary to be very cautious throughout the whole process; particularly in the granulations; nor is it safe to make more than one pound at a time. Of course, it may be mixed in wooden mortars, as it requires no large apparatus.\n\nThe great objection to its use is the facility with which it is inflamed by friction, or by a hard blow. The expense, indeed, would alone be an insuperable one, were there no other; as the price of this salt is more than twenty times that of nitre. It also corrodes the barrels very quickly. In fowling-pieces it is however of use; being the detonating priming of Forsyth's and of Manton's gun-locks. We may add, that very good powder may be made from this salt and charcoal alone, in the proportion of 80 to 20; but the grain is not very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a>, and it is subject to all the same faults as the first.\n\nThe action of this powder on the shot in a charge is very capricious, and far from intelligible. In the French trials, it was found to give ranges sometimes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a>, and sometimes triple those of common powder, using the same weights. In various trials made in this country, the ranges were double in a majority of comparisons, when moderate charges were used. But, by increasing the charges beyond this, the ranges, instead of increasing in the same ratio, began to contract; double the quantity producing but a moderate increase in the range, and a third proportion making an addition still less than the preceding. This, however, agrees with Robins's experiments on common gunpowder; and he has accounted for it by what he calls the triple resistance; proving, as he thinks, that whenever the initial velocity exceeds 1142 feet in the second, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VACUUM\">vacuum</a> is formed behind the shot, which, by increasing the resistance before it, speedily reduces the velocity to what it would have been with a smaller charge. We need say no more respecting a compound, the use of which is not likely to be ever extended beyond its present application to the detonating gun-locks.\n\nKeeping and Restoration of Powder.\n\nPowder for service, whether for sea or land, is kept in barrels, containing each one cwt. the size of Gunpowder, which is nearly that of a ten-gallon cask, and they are hooped with copper. As it is difficult to keep dry casks water-tight, as indeed it was not thought necessary that they should be so, much powder was always rendered useless on service by wet. Lately copper linings have been very properly introduced, and the casks are now water-tight. As great quantities of powder always have been, however, and always must be, returned unserviceable; it is an important object to be able to restore it, or render it useful in the most economical manner.\n\nSometimes the grain is merely adhering, and can be shaken loose again; and this effect is not frequent even in magazines on shore. Such powder, when dried by restoring, appears sufficiently perfect; but it will be found that it is increased in bulk, and has become spongy and tender. On examination by the magnifying glass, it will also be perceived that the nitre is partially separated. Powder which has once undergone this change is deteriorated, yet is still fit for all ordinary purposes. It is not strong enough, however, to bear travelling; and, should it be required for that purpose, it ought to be remilled and granulated over again.\n\nWhen the casks have been opened on service, before being returned, it is necessary to examine carefully whether they do not contain nails, or other foreign matters; an accident not uncommon. In such a case it is unsafe to commit them to the mill, and they must be reserved for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTRACTION\">extraction</a>. When the powder has been so wetted as to be near into lumps, it is first necessary to examine, by the test of nitrate of mercury, whether the damage has been done by fresh or salt water. If by the latter, it must also be sent to the extracting house. If it has been very thoroughly wetted, even by fresh water, it will often be found that some of the saltpetre has been washed away. In this case it must be analyzed, so far at least as to determine the proportion of saltpetre wanting, which must be added to it in the mill. In the process of extracting, nothing more is necessary than to boil the powder in pure water, and to filter the solution through thick woollen bags. The crystals are purified exactly as in the case of rough nitre. This is a wasteful process, however, and in all cases where it is possible, remilling is to be preferred.\n\nOn Accidental Explosions in Powder Manufactory.\n\nThis is a subject which deserves far more attention than it has yet experienced; and we can only regret that our researches do not enable us to add more to the present suspicions as to the causes, than the little which follows. That want of sufficient care is the general source of these disasters is, however, certain; as certain merchants' mills have been celebrated for them, while in others, as well as in those belonging to the Government, they have been extremely rare. Such accidents may take place in any part of the works; but they are most frequent, as well as less injurious, when they happen in the mills; as the quantity of powder in these never exceeds 50 lbs. It ought at least to be an invariable rule to remove each charge to the pressing house as soon as it is completed.\nWe already hinted at the cause of the explosions in the mills, when they happen at the time of removing the powder from beneath the stones. As stamping-mills are not used in this country, it may be thought superfluous to remark, that, in these cases, this accident sometimes happens from attempting to remove, by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALLET\">mallet</a> and chisel, the lumps of powder which adhere to the pestles. It is one of the inconveniences attached to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of grinding. But it is also proper to observe, that the mills are sometimes blown up while working; and, from some examinations which we have made, we have little doubt that this has arisen from fragments of the stones falling off, and being bruised together with the powder.\n\nWe indeed consider metallic rollers as every way safer than stone ones; as they can only produce fire in case of friction in contact during the removal of the charge. If iron be held objectionable, it is easy to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a> them with a sheet of copper; but it is proper to recollect that, even thus, the chances of explosion from friction are not removed. It is a great mistake to suppose that the absolute hardness of any metal is indispensable to the production of explosion in gunpowder. A blow sufficiently powerful, or friction caused by sufficient weight and rapidity, will compensate for the absence of this, in very soft <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a>, as well as in many other substances, which do not readily give fire. Limestone we consider to be a very objectionable substance. Except that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CARRARA\">Carrara</a>, we know of none, either primary or secondary, that does not contain much silica; often, indeed, particles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTZ\">quartz</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>. In the secondary calcareous rocks it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a>; nor is even the finest white marble of Carrara always exempt; as is well known to statuaries. But the softness, even of the purest limestones, is no defence; as the friction between these is still more capable of setting fire to gunpowder than that of iron. The readiest way of putting these different substances to the test, is by experiments in fulminating silver (that of Howard): as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRRITABILITY\">irritability</a> of this substance enables us to ascertain the facts with moderate and convenient force.\n\nWe know of no explosions in the store, except in one noted instance, when it was pretty well ascertained to have been produced by a workman, who had determined on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUICIDE\">suicide</a> in this manner. In the steam stove it can never happen from overheating; but as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a> must necessarily be dry when the workmen enter to remove the powder, instead of being wet, as it always is in the other houses, it requires additional care respecting the feet of the people employed. The only method that is quite safe, in all houses and magazines, is to oblige the workmen to labour barefooted. The heavy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a> slippers in common use are far from safe; as, from not fitting well, they are frequently dragged along; in which way they may easily entangle particles of sand. It ought to be known to all powder makers, that the breaking of a fragment of quartz, or the sufficient friction of two grains between copper, or even wood, is capable of igniting gunpowder. This is more particularly the case when the finer charcoals are used; as it is this which is the susceptible ingredient.\n\nExplosions in the pressing and granulating house have happened much too often, nor have the causes been ascertained. As there is a considerable quantity of powder always present here, these are of a very serious nature. It would be proper that these two buildings should always be separated, and, in the usual way, by a work of earth. The old granulating houses are far from safe, as the cranks and other parts of the moving machinery are contained within the house, which is always filled with the dust of the powder. It is trusting too much to the attention of persons, whom practice renders habitually careless, to expect that they will always keep the parts oiled. It is easy to remedy this evil by entirely separating the working machinery from the granulating engine, which may be suspended and steadied by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROPES\">ropes</a>, so as to avoid all chance of friction.\n\nIn the pressing house there seem to be two sources of danger, both of which may be obviated. It is easy for powder to become entangled among the threads of the screw, and the consequence of this must be obvious. This would be remedied by adopting Bramah's press. We also think that the sudden condensation of air entangled among the fragments in the pressing box may be sufficient to produce fire. Whether this be the case or not, it will always be prudent to make the first pressure as slowly as possible, that the air may be allowed to escape.\n\nWe have observed three other causes for accident, though neither of them belong properly to the manufacturing houses. It is, nevertheless, very important that they should be generally known. Charcoal, in certain cases, is liable to take fire spontaneously, and that even in the lamp. This is a case exactly analogous to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYROPHORUS\">pyrophorus</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOMBERG\">Homberg</a>; and it unquestionably arises from the same cause, namely, the presence of a portion of potassium. It is an accident which, we imagine, can only happen to charcoal made in retorts; as, in the pit method, the potassium could scarcely be expected to escape combustion. The precautions hence requisite, respecting the stowage of charcoal, and the place of the distilling houses, must be evident. When in a state of powder, and under pressure, it also has been known to inflame; and, possibly, from the same cause.\n\nWe are not aware that it is usual to keep many waggons and powder-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CART\">cart</a> tilts about powder magazines, but we do know that this has happened, and with the effect of producing fire. It ought to be generally known, for many other reasons, that fresh painted canvass, stowed close, is subject to spontaneous combustion.\n\nLastly, it has frequently been observed that fire was struck in closing up the powder barrels, as well on board ships as in magazines\u2014an accident which was supposed impossible, since both copper hoops and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HAMMERS\">hammers</a> are exclusively used. We at length discovered that this accident had arisen from using <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> rivets, in the surface of which the sand of the mould had become entangled. Hence the obvious necessity of using none but forged copper rivets, and since the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADOPTION\">adoption</a> of these in the Government stores, this accident has been unknown.\nOn the Force of Gunpowder when Fired.\n\nIt remains to inquire, whether there are any means, *a priori*, of determining the explosive force of gunpowder, and of discovering what that is or ought to be. Many calculations have been made on this subject, and some of them, we need scarcely say, are deserving of great regard, although by no means in accordance with each other. Many, on the contrary, proceed on principles, so often gratuitous or false, as to be entitled to no consideration. When we consider the reputation of some of the authors of these speculations, and the real knowledge of the true cause of explosion which were then in existence, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of these opinions, and thus of the deduced results, are not a little curious.\n\nLemery, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WOLF\">Wolf</a>, Papin, and some others, considered that the cause of the explosion was to be sought in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAREFACTION\">rarefaction</a> of air contained in the interstices of the powder; forgetting, that in a rocket, which can contain none, the production of air was sufficient to communicate and maintain a considerable velocity during the whole time of the combustion. John Bernoulli imagined that this air contributed an eighth part of the force only, and that the remainder arose from water contained in the saltpetre. Muschenbroek, Stahl, Beaum\u00e9, and Macquer, again, considered the whole effect as produced by the conversion of the water of the nitre into steam; an error quite unpardonable in the two last chemists, who ought to have known that nitre contained little or no water of crystallization; and still more so in Count Rumford, who has followed them in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a>. Lombard, attempting to improve on it, adds to the expansion of steam that of the nitric acid. The Abb\u00e9 Nollet allows the water but a share in the explosion. But not to enumerate more of these hypotheses, we shall only mention further, that of those who have attributed the expansive force to the conversion of latent into free, or radiant caloric, as they have thought fit to term it.\n\nIt would have been much more easy and correct to have put this question to the test of experiment, when the real cause would have immediately appeared. It was sufficiently unpardonable, in the greater number of these persons, not to have inquired what had been done before them; since Boyle, Hales, Hawksbee, and others, were aware that the combustion of gunpowder produced a permanently elastic fluid; although their mode of obtaining it in an exhausted receiver was not a very accurate one. Hawksbee found that one grain of powder, when fired in vacuo, produced a cubic inch of a permanently elastic fluid, and that the same result was obtained in air. Hence, though not acquainted with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> chemistry so as to be aware of the nature of the generated gas, he knew well that it could not have arisen from the expansion either of air or water contained in the powder. The inaccuracy of Count Rumford's views, and the extraordinary results of his numerous and laborious experiments, exceed, however, all that has been done on this, or perhaps on any subject in modern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIMENTAL_PHILOSOPHY\">experimental <a class=\"</a>xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>.\n\nThe history of opinions respecting the explosive force of gunpowder, and all alike pretending to be deduced from experiments, is scarcely less amusing than the hypotheses respecting the cause; although rendered much more marvellous by their extraordinary discrepancy. John Bernoulli considered the initial force as equal to 100 times the pressure of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>; while Daniel Bernoulli made it 10,000. Brachus determines it at 450, D'Antone as lying between 1400 and 1900, and Ingenhouz at 2276. According to Dulacy it is 4000, by Amontons it is 5000, and by Lombard it is stated at 9215. After this there is a rapidly increasing estimate among other experimenters; Monsieur Le General de la Martilliere representing it at 43,600, Count Rumford at 54,750, and Monsieur Gay de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-VERNON\">Vernon</a>, who outdoes all his competitors, stating it as making from 30,000 to 80,000.\n\nAmong the French, Gilot's experiments appear the only tolerably accurate ones; as he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> the produce of 100 lb. of powder in gas to be 463 cubic feet. This, however, is considerably under the truth, at least in the present French powder, as well as in our own. Of course, this is not meant to represent the total force; but he has not given any statement of the increase of volume produced by the temperature on firing. The coincidence between Robins's and Gilot's results is, however, considerable; but the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> is beyond the truth.\n\nAccording to Robins, from experiments made in an exhausted receiver, the produce of gas from a given quantity of powder, bulk for bulk, is 236; or one cubic inch of powder produces 236 inches of elastic fluid at the mean temperature and pressure. If the powder be rammed into the smallest possible space, the produce is double, or 472 inches of air; as it may be condensed, by hard ramming, into half the space which it occupies when loose. But we must beware of assuming this as an element in the computation of the initial force, however true a representation it is of the fact, abstractedly considered. In practice, powder would produce no corresponding effect in this state, because the ball would have quitted the piece before it was half burnt. Now, Robins's experiments <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TALLY\">tally</a> very nearly with our own, as formerly stated; the produce from rammed powder being about 520 on an average of trials, which, being reduced in the proper ratio for powder as it is fired, gives 260 instead of 236. It is not impossible but that our powder may have been superior to his.\n\nThus much for the permanent produce. But there is another important element required, before the expansive force of the powder at the time of firing can be determined, and the initial velocity calculated. This is the augmentation of bulk produced by the elevated temperature which results from the combustion. According to Robins, that is such as to render the pressure, or force of the generated fluid at the moment of explosion, equal to 1000 atmospheres. Dr Hutton, more justly, states this at 2000; a force far short of the imaginary ones which we have quoted above.\n\nWe should have proceeded to examine the experiments on which this determination was founded, and to compare the calculations with the results of\nLife Preservers.\n\nAlthough it too frequently happens, that an accident, which materially endangers the life of an individual, deprives him, in the mean time, of that presence of mind which alone would enable him to take proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> for his safety; yet to have meditated, in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> of leisure, upon the best method of proceeding in case of emergency, must tend greatly to diminish the embarrassment and confusion that commonly accompany the accident, even if it should not be thought necessary to provide any particular apparatus for the purpose of escaping the danger. There are also many ways in which those who are not immediately involved in the disaster may contribute to the preservation of life, whether actuated by interest, or by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a> only; and the modes of relief will, therefore, be naturally divided into the internal and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a>, whether relating to fires or to shipwrecks.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">Sect</a>. I.\u2014Internal Fire Escapes.\n\nWhenever a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> establishes itself in a residence not detached from others, it becomes of importance to ascertain what facilities the house affords for ascending to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a>, and for passing to those of the neighbouring houses. It is scarcely possible that a conflagration should extend at once to the contiguous houses on each side, before the inhabitants of the house in question have had time to escape. But in a detached house, if there are not two or more staircases remote from each other; and even in a house contiguous to others, when there is no facility of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> by the roof, it becomes highly expedient to provide some internal means of escaping through the windows in case of fire; and to have on every floor a good strong rope, with a hook or a loop at the end, by which it may be fastened to a bedpost, so as to enable an active person to descend by its help out of the window, finding from time to time a partial footing in the inequalities of the wall. This process will be greatly facilitated by having the rope knotted at intervals of about a foot throughout its length; the knots being nearly as convenient as the blocks, or clips, that are sometimes made for the purpose of retarding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a>, by holding them, and regulating the friction by the pressure of the hand* (Plate CX. fig. 14); unless the clip be attached to a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a>, on which a person may sit, while he regulates the position of the clip by its handles, and allows himself to descend with more or less velocity at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>. The arrangement for this purpose may be made by a roller, or pipe, sliding on the rope, and pushed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> so as to open the handles of the clip and tighten its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>, when the person holds by the roller and draws it down (Plate CX. fig. 13); and, on the contrary, the clip may be opened by pressing on the handles with the other hand, or with the thighs; or any other simple mode of regulating the clip may be adopted, provided that it be not liable to be misunderstood, or misapplied in a moment of confusion. After all, a rope <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LADDER\">ladder</a> would perhaps be preferable, as not being liable to be deranged; it is often kept ready made in the shops; and in the absence of any other rope, a common bed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CORD\">cord</a> will generally be found strong enough to support the weight even of a stout <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>; for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> inch rope may be safely trusted with two hundred weight, and ought, indeed, to support three times as much if new and good.\n\nSect.

In like manner, by consumption is not meant the consumption, or annihilation of matter, for that is equally impossible as its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a>, but merely the consumption or annihilation of those qualities which render commodities useful and desirable. To consume the products of art or industry is, therefore, really to deprive the matter of which they consist of the utility, and consequently of the exchangeable value communicated to it by labour. And hence we are not to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> consumption by the magnitude, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of the products consumed, but exclusively by their value.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">Large</a> consumption is the destruction of large value, however small the bulk in which that value may happen to be compressed.\n\nConsumption, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> in which the word is used by Political Economists, is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYNONYMOUS\">synonymous</a> with the end <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>. We produce commodities only that we may be producible to use or consume them. Consumption is the great end and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> industry. Production is merely a means to attain an end. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a> one would produce were it not that he might afterwards consume. All the products of art and industry are destined to be consumed, or made use of; and when a commodity is brought into a state fit to be used, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> its consumption be deferred, a loss is incurred. All products are intended either to satisfy the immediate wants, or to add to the enjoyments of their producers; or they are intended to be employed as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a>, and made to reproduce a greater value than themselves. In the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, by delaying to use them, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> we either refuse to satisfy a want, or deny ourselves a gratification it is in our power to obtain;\u2014and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, by delaying to use them, it is equally plain we allow the instruments of production to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> idle, and lose the profit that might be derived from their employment.\n\nBut, although all commodities are produced only to be consumed, we must not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> into the error of supposing, that all consumption is equally advantageous to the individual, or the society. If an individual employs a set of labourers to build him a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> the one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, and to pull it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the next, their labour, or rather the capital he gave them in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a> for their labour, and which they have consumed during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> they were engaged in this futile employment, is evidently destroyed for ever, and absolutely lost both to himself and the public; whereas, had he employed them in the raising of corn, or in the production of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of valuable produce, he would have obtained commodities of equal, or more than equal, value to the capital he gave them.\n\nThe value of the return, or the advantage obtained from the consumption, is, therefore, the true and only test of advantageous and disadvantageous, or, as it is more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> termed, of productive and unproductive consumption. Commodities are consumed productively when the advantage or benefit accruing in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> to their possessors, or when the value of the products obtained in their stead exceeds their value; and they are consumed unproductively when the value of the advantage or benefit, or the value of the new commodities, is less than their value. It is on this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> of consumption and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-REPRODUCTION\">reproduction</a>, and not, as was so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> supposed, on the balance of trade, that the prosperity or decay of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> depends. If, in given periods, the commodities produced in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> exceed those consumed in it, the means of increasing its capital <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be provided, and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> will either increase, or the actual numbers will be better accommodated, or both. If the consumption in such periods fully equals the reproduction, no means will be afforded of increasing the stock or capital of the nation, and society will be at a stand. And if the consumption exceeds the reproduction, every succeeding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> will see the society worse supplied; its prosperity and population will evident-\nly decline, and pauperism will gradually and progressively spread itself over the whole country.\n\nIt is impossible, however, to fix on any standard by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> with which we may be able to obtain even a tolerable approximation to the comparative value or advantage of different kinds of consumption. This is a point on which the sentiments of no two individuals can ever exactly coincide. The opinions of each will always depend more or less on the situation in which he is placed. The rich <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> will naturally be inclined to give a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> to the limits of advantageous consumption than the man of middling fortune; and the latter than the man who is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>. And it is undoubtedly true that a man's expenses ought always to bear some proportion to the magnitude of his fortune, and his condition in society; and that what might be proper and advantageous expenditure in one case, might be exceedingly improper and disadvantageous in another. It is, therefore, quite impossible to frame any system of rules on the subject of expenditure, which shall be applicable to the case of every individual; and even if it were practicable, there is no ground to think that the formation of such rules would be of the smallest utility. The state has no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> whatever to control individual expenditure; nor, even if it had such a right, could it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> it without occasioning serious injury. The public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> requires that the national capital should, if possible, be constantly kept on the increase; or, which is the same thing, that the consumption of any given period should be made the means of reproducing a greater value. But we have sufficiently proved that this cannot, in any case, or under any circumstances, be the result of a system of surveillance and restriction. Industry and frugality never have been, and never can be, promoted by such means. To render a man industrious, secure him the peaceable enjoyment of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> of his industry\u2014to wean him from extravagance, and to render him frugal and parsimonious, allow him to reap all the disadvantage of the one line of conduct, and all the advantage of the other. The poverty and loss of station which is the necessary and inevitable result of improvident and prodigal consumption, is a sufficient security against its ever becoming injuriously prevalent; and wherever the public burdens are moderate, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> protected, and the perfect and uncontrolled freedom of industry secured, the constant efforts of the great body of the people to rise in the world and improve their condition, will ensure the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> increase of national wealth. It is idle to expect that all unproductive and unprofitable expenditure can ever be avoided; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> of all tolerably well governed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> proves, that the amount of the produce of industry productively expended, is always infinitely greater than that which is expended unproductively.\n\nIt was long a prevalent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> among moralists, that the labour bestowed on the production of luxuries, and consequently their consumption, was unproductive. But this opinion is now almost universally abandoned. Unless, indeed, all comforts and enjoyments are to be proscribed, it is impossible to say where necessaries end, and luxuries begin. But if we are to understand by necessaries such products only as are absolutely required for the support of human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, every thing but wild fruits, roots, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, must be deemed superfluous; and in this view of the matter, the peasantry of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>, who live only on potatoes and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>, must be considered as contributing much more to the national wealth than the peasantry of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>! The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> statement of such a doctrine is sufficient for its refutation. Everything that stimulates exertion is advantageous. The mere necessaries of life may be obtained with comparatively little labour; and those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> and uncivilized hordes, who have no desire to possess its comforts, are proverbially and notoriously indolent and dissipated. To make men industrious\u2014to make them shake off that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETHARGY\">lethargy</a> which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> to them, they must be inspired with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> for the luxuries and enjoyments of civilized life. When this is done, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> wants will become equally clamorous with those that are strictly necessary, and they will increase exactly as the means of gratifying them increase. Wherever a taste for comforts and conveniences has been generally diffused, the wants and desires of man become altogether unlimited. The gratification of one leads directly to the formation of another. In highly civilized <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a>, new products and new modes of enjoyment are constantly presenting themselves as motives to exertion, and as means of rewarding it. Perseverance is, in consequence, given to all the operations of industry; and idleness, and its attendant train of evils, almost entirely disappear. \"What,\" asks Dr Paley, \"can be less necessary, or less connected with the sustentation of human life, than the whole produce of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LACE\">lace</a>, and plate manufactory? Yet what multitudes labour in the different branches of these arts! What can be imagined more capricious than the fondness for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOBACCO\">tobacco</a> and snuff? Yet how many various occupations, and how many thousands in each, are set at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> in administering to this frivolous gratification!\" It is the stimulus which the desire to possess these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a> gives to industry that renders their introduction advantageous. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> is capable of furnishing food adequate for the support of a much greater portion of human beings than can be employed in its cultivation. But those who are in possession of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> will not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> with their produce for nothing; or rather, they will not raise at all what they can neither use themselves nor exchange for what they want. As soon, however, as a taste for conveniencies and luxuries has been introduced, the occupiers of the ground raise from it the utmost that it can be made to produce, and exchange the surplus for such conveniencies and gratifications as they are desirous of obtaining; and, in consequence, the producers of these articles, though they have neither property in the soil, nor any concern in its cultivation, are regularly and liberally supplied with its produce. In this way, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of necessaries, as well as of useful and agreeable products, is vastly increased by the introduction of a taste for luxuries; and the population are, in consequence, not only better provided for, but their numbers are proportionally and greatly augmented.\n\nIt is plain, therefore, that the consumption of lux-\nConsumption of Wealth.\n\nDr Smith's Criterion of Productive and Unproductive Consumption.\n\nDr Smith has given another criterion of productive and unproductive consumption; but his opinions on this subject, though exceedingly ingenious, and supported with his usual ability, appear to rest on no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> foundation. He divides society into two great classes. The first consists of those who fix, or, as he terms it, \"realize their labour in some particular subject, or vendible commodity, which lasts for some time at least after that labour is past\"; the second, of those whose labour leaves nothing in existence after the moment of exertion, but perishes in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of performance. The former are said by Dr Smith to be productive, the latter unproductive, labourers. Not that, in making this distinction, Dr Smith means to undervalue the services performed by the unproductive class, or to deny that they are often of the highest utility; for he admits that such is frequently the case: but he contends, that these services, however useful, do not augment the wealth of the country; and, consequently, that the commodities consumed by this class are unproductively consumed, and have a tendency to impoverish, not to enrich, the society. But to avoid the chance of misrepresentation, we shall give Dr Smith's opinions in his own words.\n\n\"There is one sort of labour,\" says he, \"which adds to the value of the subject upon which it is bestowed; there is another which has no such effect. The former, as it produces a value, may be called productive; the latter unproductive labour. Thus the labour of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANUFACTURER\">manufacturer</a> adds, generally, to the value of the materials which he works upon, that of his own maintenance, and of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>'s profit. The labour of a menial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a>, on the contrary, adds to the value of nothing. Though the manufacturer has his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WAGES\">wages</a> advanced to him by his master, he, in reality, costs him no expense, the value of those wages being generally restored, together with a profit, in the improved value of the subject upon which his labour is bestowed. But the maintenance of a menial servant never is restored. A man grows rich by employing a multitude of manufacturers; he grows poor by maintaining a multitude of menial servants. The labour of the latter, however, has its value and deserves its reward as well as that of the former. But the labour of the manufacturers fixes and realizes itself in some particular subject, or vendible commodity, which lasts for some time at least after that labour is past. It is, as it were, a certain quantity of labour stocked and stored up to be employed, if necessary, upon some other occasion. That subject, or, what is the same thing, the price of that subject, can afterwards, if necessary, put into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> a quantity of labour equal to that which had originally produced it. The labour of the menial servant, on the contrary, does not fix or realize itself in any particular subject or vendible commodity. His services generally perish in the very instant of their performance, and seldom leave any trace or value behind them for which an equal quantity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> could afterwards be procured.\n\n\"The labour of some of the most respectable orders in the society is like that of menial servants, unproductive of any value, and does not fix or realize itself in any permanent subject or vendible commodity, which endures after that labour is past, and for which an equal quantity of labour could afterwards be procured. The sovereign, for example, with all the officers both of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> who serve under him, the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">navy</a>, are unproductive labourers. They are the servants of the public, and are maintained by a part of the annual produce of the industry of other people. Their service, how <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a>, how necessary, or how useful soever, produces nothing for which an equal quantity of service can afterwards be procured. The protection, security, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of the commonwealth, the effect of their labour this year, will not purchase its protection, security, and defence for the year to come. In the same class must be ranked some both of the greatest and most important, and some of the most frivolous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROFESSIONS\">professions</a>: churchmen, lawyers, physicians, men of letters of all kinds; players, buffoons, musicians, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPERA\">opera</a>-singers, opera-dancers, &c. The labour of the meanest of these has a certain value, regulated by the very same principles which regulate that of every other sort of labour; and that of the noblest and most useful produces nothing which could afterwards purchase or procure an equal quantity of labour. Like the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECLAMATION\">declamation</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTOR\">actor</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARANGUE\">harangue</a> of the orator, or the tune of the musician, the work of all of them perishes in the very instant of its production.\" (Wealth of Nations, II. p. 1.)\n\nSuch are the opinions of Dr Smith, and it will not, we think, be very difficult to show the fallacy of the distinction he has endeavoured to establish between the labour, and consequently also the consumption, of the different classes of society. To begin with the case of the menial servant:\u2014Dr Smith says, that his labour is unproductive, because it is not realized in a vendible commodity, while the labour of the manufacturer is productive, because it is so realized. But of what, may we ask, is the labour of the manufacturer really productive? Does it not consist exclusively of comforts and conveniences required for the use and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a> of society? The manufacturer is not a producer of\nmatter, but of utility only. And is it not obvious that the labour of the menial servant is also productive of utility? If, for example, the labour expended in converting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a> of the sheep into a coat be, as it unquestionably is, productive, then surely the labour expended in cleaning and brushing the coat, and rendering it fit to be worn, must be so too. It is universally allowed, that the labour of the husbandman in raising corn, beef, and other articles of provision, is productive; but if so, why is the labour of the menial servant who performs the necessary and indispensable task of preparing and dressing these articles, and fitting them to be used, to be stigmatized as unproductive? It is clear to demonstration, that there is no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> whatever between the two species of industry\u2014that they are either both productive, or both unproductive. To produce a fire, is it not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> as necessary that coals should be carried from the cellar to the grate, as that they should be carried from the bottom of the mine to the surface of the earth? And if it is said, that the miner is a productive labourer, must we not also say the same of the servant, who is employed to make and mend the fire? The whole of Dr Smith's reasoning proceeds on a false <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>. He has made a distinction where there is none, and where there can be none. The end of all human exertion is the same\u2014that is, to increase the sum of necessaries, comforts, and enjoyments; and it must be left to the judgment of every man to determine what proportion of these comforts he will have in the shape of menial services, and what in the shape of material products. It is an error to suppose that a man is impoverished by maintaining menial servants, any more than by indulging in any other species of expense. It is true he will be ruined if he keeps more servants than he has occasion for, or than he can afford to pay; but his ruin would be equally certain were he to purchase an excess of food or clothes, or to employ more workmen in any branch of manufacture than are required to carry it on, or than his capital could employ. To keep two ploughmen when one only might suffice, is just as improvident and wasteful expenditure as it is to keep two footmen to do the business of one. It is in the extravagant quantity of the commodities we consume or of the labour we employ, and not in the particular species of commodities or labour, that we must seek for the causes of impoverishment.\n\nThe same reasoning applies to all the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> mentioned by Dr Smith. Take, for example, the case of the physician. Dr Smith tells us that he is an unproductive labourer, because he does not directly produce something that has exchangeable value. But if he does the same thing indirectly, what is the difference? If the exertions of the physician are conducive to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, and if, as is undoubtedly the case, he enables others to produce more than they could do without his assistance, then it is plain he is indirectly, at least, if not directly, a productive labourer. Dr Smith makes no scruple about admitting the just <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of the workman employed to repair a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEAM_ENGINE\"><a class=\"xr</a>ef\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEAM\">steam</a>-engine to be enrolled in the productive class; and yet he would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> a physician, who had been instrumental in saving the life of an Arkwright or a Watt, among those that are unproductive! It is impossible that these inconsistencies and contradictions could have occurred to Dr Smith; and the errors into which he has fallen in treating this important branch of the science, shows in the strongest manner the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of advancing with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> caution, and of subjecting every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a>, how plausible and ingenious soever it may appear when first stated, to a severe and patient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>.\n\nThe amusements furnished by players, singers, and so forth, come under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of luxuries, and have precisely the same effect on the public wealth as the introduction of a taste for tobacco, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEA\">tea</a>, or other superfluities. They create new wants, and by so doing, stimulate our industry to procure the means of gratifying them. They are really, therefore, a means of production; and while they furnish us with elegant and amusing recreation, they certainly add to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of useful material products.\n\nThe productiveness of the higher class of functionaries mentioned by Dr Smith is still more obvious. So far, indeed, from being unproductive, they are, when they discharge properly the duties of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> station, the most productive labourers in a state. Dr Smith says, that the results of their service, that is, to use his own words, \"the protection, security, and defence of the commonwealth any one year, will not purchase its protection, security, and defence for the year to come.\" But this is plainly an error. We do not say that the protection and security afforded by good government is directly a cause of wealth; but it is plain that without this security and protection, the productive powers of industry could not have been called into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>. Dr Smith would allow that the material products produced by the society one year, were to form the means of producing its supplies of necessaries, conveniences, and enjoyments during the following year. But without the security and protection afforded by government, these products would either have not existed at all, or their quantity would have been very greatly diminished. How, then, is it possible to deny that those whose labour is necessary to afford this security are productively employed? Take the case of the labourers employed to construct fences; no one ever presumed to doubt that their labour is productive; and yet they do not contribute directly to the production of corn or of any other valuable product. The object of their industry is to give protection and security; to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> the fields that have been fertilized and planted by the husbandman from depredation; and to enable him to prosecute his employments without having his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> distracted by the care of watching. But if the security and protection afforded by the hedger and ditcher justly entitle them to be classed among those who contribute to enrich their country, on what principle can we reckon those public servants whose exertions protect property in the mass, and render every portion of it secure against hostile aggression, and the attacks of thieves and plunderers, be said to be unproductive? If the labourers who protect a single corn field from the neighbouring crows and cattle be productive, then surely the\njudges and magistrates, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> and sailors, who protect every field in the empire, and to whom it is owing that every class of inhabitants feel secure in the enjoyment of their property, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a>, and privileges, have a right to be classed among those whose services are supereminently productive.\n\nThat much wealth has been unproductively consumed by the servants of the public, both in this and other countries, it is impossible to doubt. But we are not to argue from the abuses <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTRINSIC\">extrinsic</a> to a beneficial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> against the institution itself. If the public pay their servants excessive salaries, or employ a greater number than is required for the purposes of good government and security, it is their own fault. Their conduct is quite the same as that of a manufacturer who should pay his labourers comparatively high wages, and employ more of them than he had occasion for. But, although a state or an individual may act in this foolish and extravagant manner, it would obviously be the extreme of folly and absurdity to conclude from thence that all public servants and all manufacturing labourers are unproductive! If the establishments which provide security and protection be formed on an extravagant scale, if we have more judges or magistrates, more soldiers or sailors, than are necessary, or if we pay them larger salaries than would suffice to procure the services of others, let their numbers and their salaries be reduced. The excess, if there be any, is not a fault inherent in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of such establishments, but results entirely from the extravagant scale on which they have been arranged.\n\nBut, in showing that Dr Smith was mistaken in considering the consumption of menial servants, and of lawyers, physicians, and public functionaries unproductive, we must beware of falling into the opposite extreme, and of countenancing the erroneous and infinitely more dangerous doctrine of those who contend that consumption, even when most unproductive, ought to be encouraged as a means of stimulating production, and of increasing the demand for labour! The consumption of the classes mentioned by Dr Smith is advantageous, because they render services in return, which those who employ them, and who are the only proper judges in such a case, consider to be of greater value than the wages they pay them. But the case would be totally different, if the Government and those who employ labourers, were to do so, not in order to profit by their services, but to stimulate production by their consumption! It is a fallacy and an absurdity to suppose that production can ever be encouraged by a wasteful consumption of the products of industry. A man is stimulated to produce when he finds a ready market for the produce of his labour, that is, when he can readily exchange them for other products. And hence the true and only encouragement of industry consists, not in the increase of wasteful and improvident consumption, but in the increase of production. Every new product necessarily forms a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a>, or a new means of purchasing some other product. It must always be remembered, that the mere existence of a demand, how intense soever it may be, cannot of itself be a means of encouraging production. To become a real demander, a man must not only have the will, but he must also have the power, to purchase the commodity he wishes to possess; or, in other words, he must be able to offer an equivalent for it. There never has been, nor is it in the nature of things that there ever can be, any limits to our wish to possess the products of art and industry. It is the power to give effect to our wishes, or to furnish other products in exchange for those we are desirous of obtaining, that is the real and only desideratum. The more, therefore, that this power is increased, that is, the more industrious every individual becomes, his means of offering equivalents for the products of others will be so much the more increased, and the market will be rendered so much the more extensive.\n\nMr Sismondi and Mr Malthus have, indeed, contended, in opposition to this doctrine, that the productivity of industry may really be carried to excess; and that, in a country where there are great facilities of production, a large unproductive consumption is necessary to stimulate industry, and prevent the overloading of the market. But if we attend to the motives which cause men to engage in any branch of industry, we shall be satisfied that the apprehensions of these writers are unfounded, and that the utmost facility of production can never be productive of a permanent glut of the market, or require to be counteracted by means of unproductive expenditure. In exerting his productive powers, every man's object is either directly to consume the produce of his labour himself, or to exchange it for such commodities as he wishes to obtain from others: If he does the first\u2014if he directly consumes the produce of his industry, there is an end of the matter, and it is evident that the multiplication of such produce to infinity could never occasion a glut: If he does the second\u2014if he brings the produce of his industry to market, and offers it in exchange for other commodities, then, and then only, there may be glut; but why? Not certainly because there has been any excess of production, but because the producers have not properly adapted their means to their ends. They wanted, for example, to obtain silks, and they offered cottons in exchange for them; the proprietors of the silks were, however, already sufficiently supplied with cottons, and they wanted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> cloths. The cause of the glut is, therefore, obvious. It consists not in over-production, but in the production of cottons, which were not wanted, instead of broad cloths, which were wanted. Let this error be rectified, and the glut will disappear. Even supposing the proprietors of silks to be not only supplied with cottons, but with cloth and every other commodity that the demanders can produce, it would not invalidate the principle for which we are contending. If those who want silks cannot obtain them from those who have them, by means of an exchange, they have an obvious resource at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>\u2014let them cease to produce the commodities which they do not want, and directly produce the silks which they do want, or substitutes for them. It is plain, therefore, that the utmost facility of production can never be a means of overloading the market. Too much of one commodity may occa-\nsionally be produced; but it is quite impossible that there can be too great a supply of every species of commodities. For every excess there must be a corresponding deficiency. The fault is not in producing too much, but in producing commodities which do not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> the tastes of those with whom we wish to exchange them, or which we cannot ourselves consume. If we attend to these two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> requisites, we may increase the power of production a thousand or a million of times, and we shall be as free of all excess as if we diminished it in the same proportion. Unproductive consumption is not, therefore, necessary to prevent the overloading of the market; and to maintain that it contributes to increase national wealth in any other way, is really just the same thing as to maintain that wealth would be increased by throwing a portion of it into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> or the fire.\n\nMontesquieu has said, and the same sentiment has been expressed in a thousand different shapes,\n\n\"Si les <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a> ne d\u00e9pendent pas beaucoup les pauvres mourront de faim.\" (Liv. VII. chap. 4.) Montesquieu was betrayed into this error, from his being unacquainted with the nature and functions of capital. The profusion of the rich, far from being of any advantage to the poor, is really one of the greatest calamities that can befall them. It is impossible that the demand for labour can be increased without an increase of capital. When the parsimonious principle predominates, capital increases, and as capital increases, the demand for labour is increased, the existing inhabitants are better provided for, and their numbers are increased; on the contrary, wherever profusion and wasteful expenditure predominates, capital is diminished, the inhabitants are daily worse and worse provided for, and idleness, pauperism, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> prevail. Besides, it must be remembered, that what is annually saved, is as regularly consumed as what is annually spent. The only difference is, that it is consumed in a different manner\u2014consumed by those who render a greater value in return, instead of being consumed by such as render no real value whatever.\n\n\"By what a frugal man annually saves,\" says Dr. Smith, \"he not only affords maintenance to an additional number of labourers for that or the ensuing year, but, like the founder of a public workhouse, he establishes, as it were, a perpetual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUND\">fund</a> for the maintenance of an equal number in all time to come. The perpetual allotment and destination of this fund, indeed, is not always guarded by any positive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, by any trust-right, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEED\">deed</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTMAIN\">mortmain</a>. It is always guarded, however, by a very powerful principle, the plain and evident interest of every individual to whom any share of it shall ever belong. No part of it can afterwards be employed to maintain any but productive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, without an evident loss to the person who thus perverts it from its proper destination.\" (Wealth of Nations, II. p. 14.)\n\nWe have already stated the impossibility of laying down any general rules on the subject of individual consumption. What the public is really interested in is, that it should never be carried on for the absurd purpose of occasioning a demand for the products of industry, and that it should be less than the reproduction; or, in other words, that the capital of the country should be kept constantly on the increase. But there is no instance of any people having ever missed an opportunity to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> and accumulate. And in all tolerably well governed countries the principle of accumulation in individuals has always had a marked ascendancy over the principle of expence, and the national capital, and, consequently, the riches of the country, have been constantly augmented.\n\nBut this is seldom the case with the consumption carried on by governments and their servants. Individuals are fully sensible of the value of the articles they expend. In the vast majority of instances, they are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> result of their industry, perseverance, and economy; and they will not consume them, unless to obtain an equivalent advantage. But such is not the situation of governments. They con-\n\n---\n\nM. Say was the first who showed, in a satisfactory manner, that effective demand depends upon production. (See his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> De Debout\u00e9s.) But the principles from which his conclusions are drawn had been stated so early as 1752, in a tract of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAN\">Dean</a> Tucker's, entitled Queries on the late Naturalization <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BILL\">Bill</a>. As this tract is now become of rare occurrence, we shall subjoin the queries referred to.\n\n\"Whether it is possible, in the nature of things, for all trades and professions to be overstocked? And whether, if you were to remove any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> number from each calling, the remainder would not have the same grounds of complaint they had before?\n\n\"Whether, in fact, any tradesman thinks there are too many of other occupations to become his customers; though narrow selfish views <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> him to wish there were fewer of his own trade?\n\n\"If a particular trade be at any time overstocked, will not the disease cure itself? That is, will not some persons take to other trades, and fewer young people be bred up to that which is least profitable? And whether any other remedy but this is not, in fact, curing one transient disorder by bringing on many which are dangerous, and will grow ineradicable?\n\n\"Whether it is not an infallible maxim, that one man's labour creates employment for another?\" (p. 13.)\n\nFor a farther demonstration of the same principle, see Mr Mill's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">Commerce</a> Defended, p. 80.\n\n+ For a farther and very able discussion of the opinion of Montesquieu, see the 7th chapter of the Commentaire sur l'Esprit des Lois of M. Destutt-Tracy, and Tom. IV. p. 383, of the Elements d'Ideologie of the same author.\nsume the produce of the labour of others, not of their own; and this circumstance prevents them from being so much interested in its profitable expenditure, and so much alive to the injurious consequences of extravagant and wasteful expenditure as their subjects. But economy on the part of government, though more difficult to be obtained, is of infinitely greater importance than economy on the part of any individual. Should a private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> think of acting on the principle that profusion is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>, and that industry may be encouraged by increasing unprofitable consumption, he will most certainly be ruined; his ruin, however, will only be directly injurious to the individuals in his own employment, and will have but a very slight indirect effect on others. But similar conduct on the part of government would most probably be productive either of revolution, or of national poverty and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEGRADATION\">degradation</a>. If, then, it is most desirable that individuals should have a correct knowledge of their real interest in the consumption of commodities; how much more so must it be that government should possess that knowledge? Economy and frugality are virtues in a private station; but in a public station their influence upon national <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> is so vast, that they are not only the first of virtues, but the most pressing of duties.\n\n\"Si les d\u00e9penses publiques,\" M. Say observes, \"affectent la <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOMME\">somme</a> des richesses pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re que les d\u00e9penses priv\u00e9es, les m\u00eames principes d'\u00e9conomie doivent presider aux unes et aux autres. Il n'y a pas plus deux sortes d'\u00e9conomie, qu'il n'y a deux sortes de probit\u00e9, deux sortes de morale. Si un gouvernement comme un particulier font des consommations desquelles il doive resulter une production de valeur sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la valeur consomm\u00e9, ils exercent une industrie productive; si la valeur consomm\u00e9 n'a laiss\u00e9 aucun produit, c'est une valeur perdue pour l'une comme pour l'autre, mais qui en se dissipant, a fort bien pu rendre le service qu'on en attendait. Les munitions de guerre et de bouche, le tems et les travaux de fonctionnaires civils et militaires qui ont servi \u00e0 la defense de l'\u00e9tat, n'existent plus, quoique ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 parfaitement bien employ\u00e9s, il en est des ces choses comme de denr\u00e9es et des services qu'une famille a consomm\u00e9s pour son usage. Cet emploi n'a present\u00e9e aucun avantage autre que la satisfaction d'un besoin; si le besoin n'existait pas, la consommation, la depense, n'ont plus \u00e9t\u00e9 qu'un mal sans compensation. Il en est de m\u00eame des consommations de l'\u00e9tat;\u2014consommer pour consommer, d\u00e9penser par systeme, r\u00e9clamer une service pour l'avantage de lui accorder une salaire, anneantir une chose pour avoir occasion de la payer est une extravagance de la part d'un gouvernement comme de la part d'un particulier, dans un petit \u00e9tat comme dans un grand, dans une republique comme dans un monarchie. Un gouvernement dissipateur est m\u00eame bien plus coupable qu'un particulier: celui ci consume les produits qui lui appartiennent, tandis qu'un gouvernement n'est pas propri\u00e9taire: il n'est qu'administrateur de la fortune publique.\" (Tome II. p. 268.)\n\nWe have now shown how labour may be rendered most productive of wealth\u2014how that wealth is distributed among the various classes of the society\u2014and how it may be most advantageously consumed. We have shown the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> and indissoluble connection subsisting between private and public opulence, and that whatever has any tendency to increase the former, must, to the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, increase the latter;\u2014and we have shown that security of property, freedom of industry, and moderation in the public expenditure, are the only, as they are the certain, means by which the various powers and resources of human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a> and ingenuity can be called into action, and society made continually to advance in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAREER\">career</a> of wealth and civilization. Every increase of security or of freedom is a benefit, as every diminution, whether of the one or the other, is an evil. It is by the spontaneous and unconstrained efforts of individuals to improve their condition and to rise in the world, and by these efforts only, that nations become rich and powerful. The labour and the savings of individuals are at once the source and the measure of national opulence and public prosperity. They may be compared to the drops of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEW\">dew</a> which invigorate and mature all vegetable nature. None of them has singly any perceptible influence; but we owe the foliage of summer and the fruits of autumn to their combined action. (s.s.)\nA name given by several early writers on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">geography</a>, but first, we believe, by De Barros, to the numerous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a> scattered over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PACIFIC_OCEAN\">Pacific Ocean</a>, or, as it was usually called, the Great South Sea. It is the name which is now applied by most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> geographers to the sixth great division of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-EARTH_S\">earth's</a> surface; a division which will probably appear, on examination, less arbitrary than some others; for whether we consider it in a political, physical, or moral point of view, the separation from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a> on the one hand, and from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUSTRALASIA\">Australasia</a> and the Asiatic Islands on the other, is marked by strong and distinct features. A considerable portion of the two last, for instance, have, ages ago, been invaded and taken possession of by foreigners, and many of them more recently been colonized by Europeans. No <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a> have yet been planted in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-POLYNESIA\">Polynesia</a>, with the exception of that on one of the Ladrones Islands by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>; numbers of its islands have never yet been visited; and the rest only occasionally by passing navigators, or a few of the most inviting by some missionaries, with the sole object of the conversion of the natives to Christianity. The inhabitants have no political connection with any of the other divisions of the earth, and little or none exists between any two of its groups or separate islands, each being governed by its own chiefs, and confining its friendships or hostilities to some neighbouring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUP\">group</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>.\n\nPhysically considered, the line of separation is almost as distinct as their political seclusion. If a line be drawn in a south-easterly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>, along the eastern extremity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILIPPINE_ISLANDS\">Philippine Islands</a>, Mindanao, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PAPUA\">Papua</a> or New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUINEA\">Guinea</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol16.html#article-NEW_IRELAND\">New Ireland</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLOMON\">Solomon</a>'s Archipelago, and from thence continued southerly along the eastern shores of the New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEBRIDES\">Hebrides</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-NEW_ZEALAND\">New <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZEALAND\">Zealand</a>, this line will mark with sufficient precision the separation of the Asiatic Islands (mostly to the northward of the equator) and Australasia (to the southward of the equator) from Polynesia. Besides, the geological structure of the islands which constitute the last mentioned divisions are, generally speaking, essentially different; consisting chiefly of lofty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>, of primary or secondary formation, partaking of the same structure as those on the continent of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>, with which some of them, indeed, may probably have once been connected, their rugged sides presenting, as it were, a broken <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARRIER\">barrier</a> to the Great Pacific; whereas Polynesia exhibits a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of low, flat islands, scarcely rising above the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> of the sea, which, with the exception of a few of the larger groups of volcanic formation, are the labours of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> sea-animals, and are usually distinguished by the name of Coral Islands or Reefs.\n\nIn a moral point of view, the distinctive character of the Polynesians is as strongly marked as the physical structure of the islands which they inhabit. In the Eastern Archipelago, or the Asiatic Islands, and in Australasia, two distinct races of men have been traced, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a>. In the Archipelago, and more particularly in the Philippine Islands, a few individual families of the Negro <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> were discovered by the early European visitors; in New Guinea and the Papuan Islands, the whole population appears to consist of this race. They differ in some respects from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NEGROES\">negroes</a> of the western <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>; resembling rather those which are found on the eastern coast, particularly in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>, which is strongly twisted into small tufts, and very different from that of the negro of Guinea.\n\nNone of these negroes have been discovered on any of the islands of Polynesia, all the inhabitants being of the brown race, and evidently derived from the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> stock to which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TARTARS\">Tartars</a>, the Chinese, the Japanese, and the Malays, owe their origin. In this opinion Sir William Jones, Dr Buchanan, Dr Hunter, Mr Marsden, and Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAMFORD\">Stamford</a> Raffles, unanimously concur. This race, modified, of course, by the circumstances of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, occupations, and habits, may thus be described: Their persons short, squat, and robust; their lower <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a> large and heavy; their arms fleshy; hands and feet small; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a> somewhat of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOZENGE\">lozenge</a> shape, the forehead and chin rather sharpened, but broad across the cheekbones, which are high, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEEKS\">cheeks</a> hollow; the eyes black, small, narrow, and placed obliquely in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> being the highest; nose broad, but not flat, and nostrils open and circular; mouth rather wide; hair harsh, lank, and quite black.\n\nDispersed as the Polynesians are, and rarely purely accidental as any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> between distant islands must be, it is perfectly certain that the different dialects spoken, from the shores of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> and Africa to those of America, are the derivatives of one common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, which, according to Marsden, still forms the primitive portion of the Malay language, mixed, as it now is, with Sanscrit and Arabic. \"The Malayan,\" says this learned and accurate writer, \"is a branch or dialect of the widely extended language prevailing throughout the islands of the archipelago to which it gives name, and those of the South Sea, comprehending between Madagascar on the one side, and Easter Island on the other, both inclusive, the space of full two hundred degrees of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a>. This consideration alone is sufficient to give it claim to the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of antiquity, and to originality, as far as that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> can be applied.\"\n\nNot less remarkable is the general accordance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, the Polynesians in manners, superstitions, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> observances. The conversion of the Malays of the archipelago to Mahometanism has obliterated nearly their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>, but enough still remains on some of the Asiatic Islands, and still more on the Asiatic Continent, to trace the source from whence the Polynesians have derived their notions and practices on matters of this kind.\nThese <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRELIMINARY\">preliminary</a> observations on the physical form, features, language, and religion of the Polynesians, are made with a view to assert their common origin, and may be taken as a general description of the natives of the various groups of islands which are scattered over the surface of the vast Pacific Ocean. These groups are exceedingly different in their extent, both as to number and size as well as in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>. Sometimes single islands are met with, surrounded by rocky reefs. These islands and reefs are dispersed, as already observed, over the whole of the Pacific Ocean, but chiefly between the thirtieth degree of northern and the thirtieth degree of southern latitude. The following classification will probably be found to embrace the greater part of those islands which are comprehended under the geographical division, Polynesia:\n\nIn the Northern Hemisphere.\n1. The Marian or Ladrones Islands.\n2. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAROLINAS\">Carolinas</a>, including the Pellew Islands.\n3. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDWICH\">Sandwich</a> Islands.\n4. The numerous reefs and coral islands scattered over the Pacific in both hemispheres.\n\nIn the Southern Hemisphere.\n1. The Friendly Islands, including the group of the Tonga Islands.\n2. The Navigators' Islands.\n3. The Society Islands.\n4. The Georgian Islands, including Otaheite, and the great range extending as far as Pitcairn's Island.\n5. The Marquesas.\n6. Easter Island.\n\nIn the Northern Hemisphere.\n1. The Ladrones Islands were first discovered by Magellhaens on the 6th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 1521. This name, by which they are generally known, was given to them by the Spaniards on account of the thievish disposition of the natives. They also called them Islas de los Velos Latinas, in reference to the sails of their canoes. By some they were called los Jardines (the Gardens), and by others Dosprazeres (the Delightful Islands); and, when missionaries were first sent thither in 1668, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRONAGE\">patronage</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANNE\">Anne</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUSTRIA\">Austria</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a>, they took the name of las Marianas, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a>. They consist of four larger and several smaller islands. The former are called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SAYPAN\">Saypan</a>, Tinian, Zarp\u00e1n or Rosa, and Aguig\u00e1n, or rather Guahan. Saypan has a lofty peak, evidently volcanic, but the rest are of moderate height, and are surrounded by rocks of coral formation. They lie between latitude 13\u00b0 and 15\u00b0 N.; longitude about 144\u00b0 E. On approaching these lands, Magellhaens perceived that they were inhabited, and the natives presently came off to the ships with cocoa-nuts, yams, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICE\">rice</a>. They were stout well-made people, of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a>, long black hair, and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a> dyed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> or black; an apron of the bark of a tree was their only covering; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANCE\">lance</a> pointed with a fish bone their only weapon. Their boats had latticen (shoulder of mutton) sails, with outriggers to prevent their oversetting, and they sailed with great swiftness. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">captain</a>-general was so delighted with the appearance of the country, that he intended to refresh his crew among them; but such numbers of the inhabitants flocked on board his ships, and were so addicted to thieving, that, being under the necessity of driving them away by force, hostilities ensued, and several of the natives were killed. Magellhaens had one of his boats stolen, which so exasperated him, that he landed with ninety of his people, set fire to their houses, which were of wood, and carried off all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> he could find.\n\nThe expedition of Loyosa, commanded, after his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, by Sebastian del Cano, and at his decease by Alonzo de Salazar, touched at the Ladrones Islands in 1526, and being received in the most friendly manner, procured water and provisions in plenty for the sickly squadron. To the great surprise of the Spaniards, a countryman of theirs, named Gonzalo de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIGO\">Vigo</a>, came to them from one of the islands, having deserted from one of the ships of Magellhaens; two others, he said, had deserted at the same time, but were put to death by the natives. They found no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRUPEDS\">quadrupeds</a> on the island, but plenty of excellent fruits, fish, and rice. The only birds were turtle-doves, of which the islanders appeared to be so fond, that they kept them in cages, and taught them to speak.\n\nIn 1565, the Ladrones Islands were again visited by Lopez de Legaspe. While the ships were yet two leagues from the shore, the natives came off in their canoes, but kept at a distance from the ships. The general put knives and other articles on a plank, and floated it off, and the natives showed fruits, patting their bellies, and pointing to the shore, to induce the Spaniards to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a>. This they did the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> on the island of Guahan, and exchanged bits of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> for provisions; but notwithstanding the regulations made by Legaspe in order to prevent quarrels, skirmishes took place, and one of the seamen, who had strolled into the woods, being found murdered, the Spaniards landed in force, set fire to their houses and canoes, wounded several of the natives, and hung up on the spot three wounded prisoners.\n\nNo kind of animal was found on the island, nor would the natives taste any other animal food except fish. \"But that which caused most admiration,\" says Friar Gaspar, \"was, that they would drink <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> water, and were such expert swimmers, and passed so much of their time in the water, that, as among other animals, some are amphibious, in like manner it seemed as if these people were in their nature amphibious.\"\n\nIn 1588, our countryman Candish or Cavendish visited by came in sight of the Ladrones, and sailed along the coast of Guahan, from which a number of canoes came off with fruits and vegetables, which were exchanged for pieces of iron; but the natives became so troublesome, that, in order to get rid of them, Cavendish ordered muskets to be fired at them.\n\nIn 1600, Olivier Van Noort made the Ladrones Islands, and stopped near Guahan for two days, from which island above 200 canoes came off to the ships with fish, fruits, and rice, to exchange for iron; and fowls are also mentioned, for the first time, in this voyage. In the same year, the Santa <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARGARITA\">Margarita</a>, a\nSpanish ship, having lost her captain and many of her crew by sickness, anchored off Saipan, and was taken possession of by the natives, who killed some of the crew, and took others of them on shore, where they were kindly treated, and such as survived were afterwards taken off by a Spanish ship which had been sent for the purpose.\n\nIn 1616, Spilberg made the Ladrones Islands, and stopped two days to traffic with the natives for provisions of fruit, fowls, and fish, in exchange for bits of iron. In 1625, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a> under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">Prince</a> Maurice of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NASSAU\">Nassau</a> refreshed at Guahan, and were supplied by 150 canoes, with immense quantities of coconuts, yams, bananas, rice, and fowls, which were of infinite service, as the scurvy had made such havoc among the crews, that in some of the ships they had scarcely strength enough to manage the sails.\n\nIn 1668, the Spaniards established a mission on the island Guahan, consisting of P. Servitores and five other fathers, and several lay-assistants, most of them natives of the Philippine Islands, and well acquainted with the Tagul language, the same as that spoken by the natives of the Ladrones Islands. For some time the chiefs of the islands behaved with great kindness to the Jesuits, and gave them ground for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>. From this seat of the mission the fathers spread themselves among the other islands, where they were received with equal kindness. In short, P. Servitores says, that in the first year they had baptized more than 13,000 islanders, and instructed 20,000 in the eleven islands which they had visited. As usual, however, the imprudent zeal of the missionaries ruined their cause, by shocking the prejudices of the natives. These simple people took it into their heads that, as an infant had died shortly after being baptized, its death had been occasioned in consequence of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a>; and such was the terror of mothers on seeing a missionary approach, that they seized their children and ran off with them into the woods. This opinion gathered ground from the eagerness of the Jesuits to get hold of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANTS\">infants</a> for the purpose of baptizing them, and more than one of these holy fathers fell martyrs to their imprudent zeal. Several murders ensued; and, as the Spaniards had taken care to strengthen the mission with a body of troops well armed, with the obvious intention of taking possession of the Ladrones as an important outpost to the Philippine Islands, after a great number of the natives had been put to death, the rest submitted to the yoke of the Spaniards; though most of the missionaries suffered in the contest, and last of all Servitores, who was killed by the man to whom he had been the greatest benefactor, because the missionary insisted on baptizing his child. Thus, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of forty-five, this pious and good man (for such he certainly was) fell by the hand of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ASSASSIN\">assassin</a>, after having, as we are told, \"established the faith in thirteen islands, founded eight churches, established three seminaries for the instruction of youth, and baptized nearly 50,000 of the islanders.\" From this time constant revolts and massacres, and the most inhuman cruelties, were inflicted on the unhappy islanders; so that, in 1681, the island of Guahan, which, on the first coming of the Spaniards, counted 40,000 inhabitants (some accounts make them more), was so completely depopulated, that it was found necessary to bring inhabitants from the northern islands to cultivate the soil.\n\nIn the year 1685, the ship of John Eaton, the Visited by Buccaneer, touched at Guahan, the crew of which quarrelled with the natives, and killed some of them. Having satisfied the Spanish governor that it was done in their own defence, \"he gave us toleration,\" says Cowley in his narrative, \"to kill them all, if we could.\"\n\n\"We took four of these infidels prisoners,\" continues the narrator, \"and brought them on board, binding their hands behind them; but they had not been long there, when three of them leaped overboard into the sea, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWIMMING\">swimming</a> away from the ship, with their hands tied behind them. However, we sent the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a> after them, and found a strong man, at the first blow, could not penetrate their skins with a cutlass; one of them had received, in my judgment, forty shots in his body before he died; and the last of the three that was killed had swum a good English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> first, not only with his hands behind him, as before, but also with his arms pinioned.\" We are told by the late Captain Burney, that it is stated in Cowley's MS. in the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSEUM\">Museum</a>, that \"the boat coming up with them, our carpenter, being a strong man, thought, with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>, to cut off the head of one of them, but he struck two blows before he could fetch blood.\"\n\nIn 1686, Dampier touched at Guahan, and states By <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAM\">Dam</a>-son anchored before the island of Tinian. It was deserted, but cattle to the number of at least 10,000, hogs, and fowls, were running about wild. Coconuts in innumerable quantities, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>-fruit, oranges, limes, water-melons, and other tropical fruits, were in the greatest abundance. The island swarmed with rats, and the flies, mosquitoes, and ticks or bugs, were very troublesome; but it was a paradise to the crew of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CENTURION\">Centurion</a>, in the horrible state of scurvy in which they arrived. Though now deserted, Tinian, on the arrival of the Spaniards, is said to have contained 30,000 inhabitants. Ruins of buildings, consisting of pyramidal pillars of considerable dimensions, were met with in all parts of the island.\n\nCommodore Byron anchored in the year 1765 before Tinian, and found the island overgrown with large trees and underwood, among which were most of the tropical fruits. He complains bitterly of the bad anchorage, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> water, venomous insects, from which they suffered so severely, that \"we were afraid,\" he says, \"to lie down in our beds;\" and though his crew recovered fast from the scurvy, he lost two by fevers, being the first deaths in his ship.\nsince leaving England. \"I am, indeed, of opinion,\" says the Commodore, \"that this is one of the most unhealthy spots in the world; at least during the season in which we were here;\" yet it was in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> when visited by the Centurion.\n\nThe latest account of these islands is that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">Lieutenant</a> Kotzebue, who visited Guahan in 1817. No canoes nor proas, nor happy islanders, greeted his approach; the whole race of natives had long been extirpated. \"We looked,\" he says, \"in vain for a canoe or a man on the shore; and it almost seemed as if we were off an uninhabited island. The sight of this lovely country deeply affected me. Formerly these fertile valleys were the abode of a nation, who passed their days in tranquil happiness; now only the beautiful palm groves remained to overshadow their graves; a death-like silence everywhere prevailed.\" Soon, however, a person appeared from the Spanish governor, and piloted the ship into the harbour; and after this, Kotzebue proceeded to the town of Agana, situated on a beautiful plain, some hundred paces from the shore, in the midst of fine palm groves; some of the houses are built of coral rock, others of bamboo. It has a church and a convent, and two fortresses, one to protect the town from the seaways, the other to keep the Indians in awe. The town contains about 200 houses, and 1500 inhabitants, who derive their origin from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEXICO\">Mexico</a> and the Philippines. The population of the island is about 6000 souls. \"There is but one man and his wife,\" says Kotzebue, \"on the whole island of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> stock; with the death of these two people, the race of the old Ladrones will be totally extinguished.\"\u2014\"The present race,\" says Chamisso, \"no longer know the sea; are no mariners, no swimmers; they have ceased to build boats. They now scarcely hollow out, without skill, the trunks of trees to fish within the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAKERS\">breakers</a>.\" All the other islands to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> of Guahan are entirely uninhabited, and overrun with wild cattle, hogs, and goats, which afford a supply to the American vessels trading to the Sandwich Islands and the north-west coast of America. Indeed, it is said that some of these people have been allowed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> themselves in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGRIGAN\">Agrigan</a>, on condition of acknowledging their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALLEGIANCE\">allegiance</a> to Spain, and that they are peopling the island by kidnapping the natives of the Sandwich Islands.\n\n2. The Carolinas, or Caroline Islands. In 1686, a Spanish ship, being near the meridian of the Ladrones, fell in with an island, which her Commander, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DON\">Don</a> Francisco Lazeano, named La Carolina, in honour of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">King</a> of Spain, Carlos II. This island has given the name to a very extensive chain spreading over a space of not less than six degrees of latitude, and twenty-five degrees of longitude, the western extremity being the group of the Palaos or Pellew Islands, in latitude 7\u00b0 N., longitude 135\u00b0 E., and the easternmost island (that of Hogolen) in latitude 9\u00b0 N., longitude 155\u00b0 E. The whole group, as far as is known (which, however, is very imperfectly), consists of at least 150 separate islands, and may be nearly twice as many, besides various coral reefs, with islets upon them. Yet, numerous as they are, being somewhat out of the direct and usual route of the Spaniards in their voyages from South America to the Philippines, they had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOOD_FORTUNE\">good fortune</a> to escape any intimate connection with them\u2014a connection which has proved equally baneful to others, whether established by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> or the sword; by their professions of friendship or avowals of hostility. Gobien, the historian of the desolating progress of the Spaniards in the Ladrones, says, that Quiroga, the governor, made search for the island Carolina, \"wishing to extend the faith to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFIDEL\">infidel</a> inhabitants, and, for that purpose, sent some soldiers, and with them the chanionis (or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a>), Don Alonzo Soon; but, after a fruitless search, and much pains, they returned without finding the object of their research.\"\n\nSome of these islands, however, and especially those towards the western extremity of the group, had been seen by various navigators long before that of Carolina was noticed and named by Lazeano. The Portuguese, Da Rocha, fell in with islands in 9\u00b0 or 10\u00b0 N. latitude, in 1526, which he named Sequiera, after his pilot; and, in 1628, Saavedra, a Spaniard, in his passage to the Philippines, discovered islands in latitude 11\u00b0, which he named Los Reyes. In 1579, our countryman Drake <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> some islands, to which he gave the name of the Islands of Thieves, which, from his description, have been supposed to be the Pellew Islands. In 1595, one of the islands in about 6\u00b0 N. was seen by Mendana; but two proas full of people, driven by the violence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> from a group of islands in the east, as far as Samal, roused the attention of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">College</a> of Jesuits at Manila, who made several unsuccessful attempts to establish missions on those islands, which the wrecked natives described to consist of thirty-two in number. In 1710, the two fathers, Duberron and Cortel, embarked in the San Trinidad, with a crew of 86 men, to establish themselves on the Pellew Islands. They landed on Sonsorol, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>-master and ensign of the troops, in all sixteen persons; but the ship being driven off by the current, made for another of the islands, called Panloque, at the supposed distance of fifty leagues from the Sonsorolles. On approaching the island, several boats came off, and some of the Palaos people swam from them to the ship, and coming on board, attempted to steal whatever they could lay their hands on. In consequence of this, they were ordered away; and having reached their boats, began to shoot arrows at the ship, which were answered by a discharge of musquetry. The ship now returned to the Sonsorolles, to inquire after the two missionaries and the boat; but the strong winds and currents would not suffer them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANCHOR\">anchor</a>, nor could they see or hear any thing of their companions, though they stood in towards the shore within cannon-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a>. A storm coming on, left them no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ALTERNATIVE\">alternative</a> but \"to return to Manila, with the sorrowful news of what had happened.\" What became of the missionaries was never ascertained. The following year, however, P. Serano departed from Manila, in a ship fitted out for the purpose, in search of the two fathers and their companions; but she foundered three days after she de-\nparted from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANILLA\">Manilla</a>, and every person on board perished, except one Spaniard and two Indians, who brought back the melancholy intelligence.\n\nIn the Lettres \u00c9difiantes et Curieuses is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> and chart from P. Juan Antonio Cantova, a missionary at Guahan, addressed to the King of Spain's confessor in 1722, in which is given a more particular account of the Carolinas than any which had before, or has since, been published. It states, that, in the preceding year, a bark, with eleven men, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> women, and six children, arrived on the east side of Guahan; and that, two days after, another canoe, with four men, one woman, and child, came to the opposite side of the island. The two parties, on being brought together, recognised each other with great joy. It appeared they had been dispersed by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GALE\">gale</a> of wind, and driven about for twenty days, without knowing where they were. Cantova thus describes them: They wore a garment open at the sides, but covering the shoulders and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>, and extending down to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-KNEES\">knees</a>. The women had a piece of cloth round the waist, falling, like a petticoat, to the middle of the leg. Their hair was curly, the nose large, the eyes large and penetrating, and the beards of the men moderately thick. Some had the pure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> of the Indians; others apparently of a mixed breed, between Spaniards and Indians; and others between a Negro and an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a>. Cantova succeeded in learning their language, and obtained from them the following particulars respecting their islands.\n\nThe Carolinas are divided into five provinces. Beginning at the east, the first is named Cittac; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> island, Hogolen, much larger than Guahan; its inhabitants negroes, mulattoes, and whites. There are eighteen principal islands in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a>, besides a multitude of smaller ones. The second province consists of twenty-six islands, of which Ulec and Lamurree are the principal ones. The third province consists of a group of islands, of which Feis is the principal, and is very populous and fertile; but the chief of the group resides at Mogmog, and all the pros which approach this island lower their sails in token of respect to this chief. Of the fourth province, Yap is the principal island, about 120 miles in circuit, very populous, and fruitful. The fifth province is the most westerly, and is named Panleu (the Palaos, or Pellew Islands), of which there are seven principal islands. It is remarkable that the inhabitants of these islands so far differ from the Carolinians in general, and from the account given of them in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROMANCE\">romance</a> of Mr Keates, drawn up by that ingenious gentleman from the documents furnished by Captain Wilson, that they are represented as a most barbarous race; both men and women going entirely naked, and feeding on human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>. We are told by the naturalist of Kotzebue's expedition, that a Spaniard, who had lived <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> months on the Pellew Islands, and whom they met with at Cavit\u00e9, gave him a horrible account of the natives; that they were wholly without shame; that husbands lend their wives for a mere trifle; that the women are without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a>; and that they certainly eat human flesh; a great part of which was confirmed by a native of the Carolinas, who had been at the Pellew Islands.\n\nCantova farther learned from the islanders, that to the eastward were a great number of other islands, the inhabitants of which pay <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADORATION\">adoration</a> to the shark; that most of them are negroes, and of savage dispositions. It is supposed that Cantova returned with these islanders in the year 1722, though no account of any such voyage is on record; but, in 1731, he embarked for the islands of the third province, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> with another father, of the name of Walter, from which the former never returned. The latter, however, returned to procure certain articles of which they stood in need, was driven to the Philippines, re-embarked in 1792, and was wrecked. Walter again embarked in May 1753, with forty-four persons. On the ninth day, they approached the island, and fired cannon to inform Cantova of their arrival, but no boat appeared. Standing within a musket-shot of the shore, they observed that their former habitation had disappeared, as well as the cross which had been erected near the sea shore. Four small canoes at length approached the vessel, bringing cocoa-nuts. On inquiring after Cantova and his companions, the islanders were evidently embarrassed, and said they were gone to Yap. Being fearful, by their manner, that the good father had fallen by the hands of the barbarians, and willing to be satisfied on this head, they seized one of the islanders, upon which the rest swam ashore. After the strongest assurances that no harm should be done to him, provided he would tell the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, he confessed that shortly after the departure of Walter, the natives put the Father Cantova to death and all his companions, fourteen in number. Cantova, it seemed, from this man's account, went, with his interpreter and two soldiers, to the Island Mogmog, to baptize, while the rest remained at Falalep. He had scarcely set his foot on shore when he was surrounded and pierced through and through with lances, the natives crying out that he was come to take away the old law, and give them a new one. They gave his body a decent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BURIAL\">burial</a>, but the bodies of his companions were put into a canoe, which was then turned adrift upon the ocean. The same people then went over to the island of Falalep, and put to death the remainder of the companions of Cantova.\n\nSince that time, little or no information has been procured respecting the Carolinas, with the exception of that which is contained in the narrative of Mr Keates, from the materials of Captain Wilson, who, when commander of the Antelope packet, in the service of the East India Company, was wrecked on Oroolong, one of the Pellew Islands. Whatever their general character may be, the crew of the Antelope found them a friendly, hospitable, and humane people. They were stout, well-made, rather above the middle size, and their colour approaching to a deep brown; their hair long; some wearing it loose, and others turned up. The men were entirely naked; the women contented themselves with two little aprons or fringes, made of the fibres of the cocoa-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NUT\">nut</a> husk, about ten inches deep and seven wide, one of which was worn before, and the other behind. Both sexes were tattooed; the men had one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EAR\">ear</a> perforated, the women both, and they wore beads, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TORTOISE_SHELL\">tortoise-shell</a>, or leaves, as suited their fancy; the car-\ntilage of the nose was also bored, and a little sprig or blossom of some plant was generally stuck in the hole; their teeth were dyed black by a paste prepared of certain herbs, which, it is pretended, caused severe sickness for five days, the time required to complete the operation.\n\nFish and cocoa-nuts are the chief articles of food, but the islands afford an abundant supply of yams, plantains, oranges, lemons, bread-fruit, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARAMBOLA\">carambola</a>, and the areca nut; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANE\">cane</a> grew wild. No quadruped, except rats, was found on the islands; of birds, the pigeon was the most abundant, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> fowl ran wild in the woods. The natives were wholly unacquainted with the use of salt. Their usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEVERAGE\">beverage</a> was the milk of the cocoa-nut. Their houses were of bamboo and plank, raised upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> from the ground. The husk of the cocoa-nut supplied them with nets and cordage, and the tortoise-shell with hooks to catch fish. Their knives were made of mother-of-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEARL\">pearl</a>, shells, or split bamboo; the cocoa-nut served them for cups, the plantain-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a> for plates, and the fibres of this plant for mats to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a> on. Their weapons were spears of wood, darts, and slings. Their boats were canoes, made of the trunks of large trees, and some of them sufficiently capacious to hold from twenty to thirty persons. In the daytime they seemed to live as much in the water as on shore, and both sexes were admirable swimmers. The women mixed freely with the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEX\">sex</a>, and their conduct was not strictly inquired into by their husbands. They seemed to have little sense of any religious duties, except in the ceremonies attending the burial of the dead, which takes place in spots set aside for that purpose, and with great solemnity; but they have some faint notion that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> survives the body. Their graves very much resembled those in a country church-yard of England, some having earth heaped up in the same manner, and others covered with flat tombstones, and protected by fences of wicker work.\n\nThe larger of the Pellew Islands are of a moderate height, rising into beautiful hills, well clothed with forest trees. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\">natural <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> still remains unknown, but being about the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a>, and of the same formation with the numerous group visited by Kotzebue, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> and animals are in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> much the same. The smaller islands are the productions of the coral-making animals, with which the larger are also surrounded to a great distance from their shores.\n\n3. The Sandwich Islands.\u2014This fine group of islands in the Northern Pacific had the good fortune to escape the visits of the old navigators, and the discovery of them was reserved for Captain Cook, who first touched at them in the year 1778, and lost his valuable life there in 1779. M. Fleurieu, in his introduction to Marchand's Voyage, is disposed to dispute this claim, and to assign the first discovery of these islands to Mendana, for no other reason but that it appears he passed at no great distance from Owyhee (but without seeing it), on his return voyage in 1568; and because he finds an island named Mesa, laid down on the nineteenth parallel of latitude, on the obscure and unauthenticated chart of Galion de Manille. It is almost unnecessary to add, that the name by which they are now known was given to them by Captain Cook, in honour of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARL\">Earl</a> of Sandwich, under whose naval administration geography was enriched with many important discoveries.\n\nCaptain King makes the group to consist of eleven islands, the principal of which are Owyhee, said to contain about 150,000 inhabitants,\u2014its extent about 6000 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> miles; Mowhee, 65,000,\u2014extent 600 square miles; Woahoo, 60,000,\u2014extent 1800 square miles; Atooil, 54,000,\u2014extent 1000 square miles; and Morotol, 36,000,\u2014extent 300 square miles. The rest are smaller, and make up a population for the whole group of about 400,000 souls. They are situated between the latitude 18\u00b0 54' N. (the south point of Owyhee), and 22\u00b0 2' N. (the latitude of Orehoue), and between the longitude 199\u00b0 36' (the small island of Tahoura), and 205\u00b0 6' (the eastern extremity of Owyhee).\n\nThe island of Owyhee is described as rising majestically in grand unbroken <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> from the ocean, and forming three several mountain peaks, on two of which snow lies the greater part of the year. They are as under:\n\n| Island                  | Height |\n|-------------------------|--------|\n| Mouna Roa (the Great Mountain) | 2482 toises. |\n| Mouna Kuah (Little Mountain)   | 2180    |\n| Mouna Wororai,             | 1687    |\n\nThese measurements, as given by Kotzebue, agree within a few toises with those of Marchand. The whole group is of volcanic origin, and on the summit of Mouna Wororai is an immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CRATER\">crater</a>. The last eruption from the side of this mountain took place in 1801. The chain of mountains runs from the N.W. point of Owyhee, over the islands Mowee, Morotol, and Woahoo. On Mowhee is a peak as high nearly as that of Wororai, but the latter is the only volcano in a state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a>.\n\nThese islands, though volcanic, are surrounded by coral reefs, and the plains next the sea, raised only a few feet above it, were once of the same description, and covered with water. These plains are generally naked and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>-burnt, but the valleys among the mountains are beautifully picturesque and fertile, and the sides of the hills are covered with magnificent forests. The most fertile and best cultivated of the group is Woahoo, on which is the safe and capacious harbour of Hana-rura, protected by a coral reef, through a break of which the entrance to it lies. In one of the mountains a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIAMOND\">diamond</a> mine was supposed to exist, but the products turned out to be only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTZ\">quartz</a> crystals. In the Pearl River of this island oysters have been found, containing pearls, but none of much value.\n\nAmong the indigenous plants mentioned by Chamisso, the naturalist of Kotzebue's expedition, are the accacia, metrosideros, pandanus, santalum, aleurites, dracaena, ammonium, curcuma, tacea. The families of rubiaceae, contortae, and urticae, predominate. From the latter, as well as from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> mulberry (Broussonetia papyrifera), are made their cordage and cloths. The accacia tree used for their boats and canvas grows only in the mountains, which is the case also with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDAL\">sandal</a>-wood, the principal article of export from the islands.\nThe plants mostly in use for domestic purposes are the banana-tree, the coco-nut tree, the bread-fruit, sugar-cane, yam, batatos, and the taro-root (Arum esculentum), of indigenous growth; besides which have been introduced the tobacco plant, the melon, and water-melon, rice, and the vine, the last of which will unquestionably thrive well on the sides of the volcanic mountains. The cultivation of the taro-root has the greatest share of attention bestowed on it; and, in fact, it constitutes a considerable portion of the food of the people. The fields or ponds in which this root is planted are inclosed with stones in the form of regular squares, from 100 to 200 feet each side; these squares are connected by sluices to convey the water from one to the other, pretty much in the same manner that the Chinese manage their rice fields. \"I have seen,\" says Kotzebue, \"whole mountains covered with such fields, through which the water gradually flowed; each sluice formed a small cascade, which ran through avenues of sugar-cane, or banana, into the next pond, and afforded an extremely picturesque prospect.\"\n\nA convict from New South <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a> has taught the people of these islands the art of distilling ardent spirits from sugar-cane, and a plant called the Tee-root (the Dracaena terminalis). And, as every chief has now his still, it is probable that the use of the pernicious kava will give way to that of the almost equally pernicious use of spirituous liquors. This kava is the liquor or juice of a root of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEPPER\">pepper</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PIPER\">Piper</a> methysticum), chewed and spit out into a large bowl, and then diluted with water, and this exquisite beverage is prepared for the sole use of the king and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBLES\">nobles</a>, the women being prohibited from tasting it. The baneful effects of this liquor have been noticed by most voyagers; the bodies of those who swallow it are, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of time, covered with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> scurf, their eyes become red and inflamed, their limbs emaciated, and their whole frame trembling and paralytic.\n\nWhen Captain Cook first discovered these islands, the only quadrupeds upon them were hogs, dogs, and rats. They have now horses (not many), asses, horned cattle, many of them running wild in the mountains, and goats. Hogs are exceedingly abundant. \"They are so large,\" says Kotzebue, \"that the whole crew could not eat one in two days;\" and the flavour, from being fed on sugar-cane, is very superior to European pork. Fowls, ducks, and geese, are equally abundant.\n\nThe Sandwich Islands, though last discovered, have been more frequently visited by Europeans and Americans, and particularly by the latter, than any other group of islands in the whole range of Polynesia; and they have profited the most by such intercourse, though not by any means to that extent which might have been wished. Indeed, what little progress they have made towards civilization is mainly to be attributed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> character of the present chief or king, whose name is Tamaa-mah; and that which he has effected is more for his individual advantage than the good of his subjects. When Captain Vancouver visited these islands in 1792, the king being desirous of having a vessel of European <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a>, this able navigator laid down the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KEEL\">keel</a> of one, which was speedily finished. Ten or twelve years after this, when Mr Turnbull visited the islands, he had a naval force of twenty vessels or upwards, from 25 to 50 tons, which traded among the islands. He had built a house for himself, after the European manner, with windows of glass, and he imitated the English in his dress. By means of English and American seamen and artificers, some of whom deserted from ships touching there, and others obtained regular permission to remain on the islands, most of the trades exercised in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> have partially been introduced into the Sandwich Islands.\n\nMost of those people having taken to themselves native wives, a new race of men is springing up, which, in the course of time, may probably be the means of hastening the civilization of these islands. It is much to be regretted, however, that hitherto no steps have been taken to bring up the new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a> in the principles of morality and religion, or for instructing them in the common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>. Tamaa-mah is ready enough to imitate the Europeans in his dress and dwelling, in building forts for the protection of his islands, and in training his troops in the European <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a>, of whom Kotzebue saw 400 drawn out, armed with musquets. In these matters, he is willing enough to be instructed by the Europeans who have settled on the islands, who, generally speaking, are of a description not likely to convince him of the utility of intellectual acquirements. In a visit to the Morai, pointing to the large wooden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATUES\">statues</a>, he said to Kotzebue, \"These are our gods, whom I worship. Whether I do right or wrong, I do not know, but I follow my faith, which cannot be wicked, as it commands me never to do wrong.\" Such sentiments do honour to the savage; and the man who entertains them is capable of being instructed in better things.\n\nHe is very tenacious in observing the customs of the country, and says, that, although those of Europeans are better, he cannot depart from his own. Thus the women continue to be degraded and despised; and, notwithstanding the frequent intercourse with strangers, and the improvements which undoubtedly have been introduced, the sex do not appear to have gained a single step in the estimation of the men, or lost any part of the grossness of behaviour since they were first visited by Captain Cook. That \"offensively conspicuous wantonness,\" which Vancouver deplores, and to which he found no parallel in the whole of Polynesia, appears to have suffered no abatement. When Campbell, the seaman, was on the island of Woahoo, the king's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> died, on which occasion, as part of the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOURNING\">mourning</a>, a public prostitution of the women took place. The captain of a ship, then in the harbour, remonstrated with the king, who coolly observed, it was their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>, and he could not prevent it. The women, too, it seems, are more addicted to drinking than the men. The governor of Woahoo invited Kotzebue and his officers to witness a dance of the natives, at which he was not present, but sent an apology to say, that his lady was so drunk that he could not leave her. The women are also great smokers of tobacco, and continue it sometimes till they fall down senseless.\nThough the women are so far degraded that they cannot eat in the same house with their lords and masters, and must not taste at all of certain articles, yet if the latter be sick, they must howl and make lamentations, tear their hair, lacerate their cheeks; and if he should die (provided he be a Jerrie, Eree, or noble), the favourite wife must die with him. The victims, both men and women, who are to be sacrificed at the death of Tamaa-mah are well known, nor is it concealed even from themselves, and they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> in the distinction. \"I have myself,\" says Kotzebue, \"seen one of the devoted victims in Woahoo, a man who was always cheerful and happy.\" On the death of the king, these people will be led bound into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> Morai (temple and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> place), where, after the prescribed ceremonies, they will suffer death at the hands of the priests. Chamisso, however, says, that this inhuman practice is wearing out, and that now culprits only, whose lives have been forfeited, are sacrificed to the gods on particular occasions. But though the custom of offering up human sacrifices is still retained, there are no grounds whatever for supposing, as the surgeon of Captain Cook's ship did, that they ever taste of human flesh.\n\nTo violate the sanctity of the Morai is one of the greatest crimes of which a man can be guilty. Campbell was present at the execution of a man who had committed this offence, in getting drunk and running out of the Morai during <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABBOO\">tabboo</a> time. He was taken back to the Morai, where his eyes were put out; in this state he remained two days, when he was strangled and his body exposed before the image of Etooah, or Eatoah, the principal deity, who, according to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a>, is the creator of the universe, and who afterwards destroyed it by an inundation that covered the whole earth except Mou-na Roa; on the top of which one single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> had the good fortune to save themselves, from whom the present race of men, that is, the Sandwich Islanders, sprung. Each chief has his own peculiar deity and his own Morai, and dresses up his wooden god after his own fashion. The common people have also their own objects of worship in their houses\u2014birds, beasts, fish, &c. just like the fetishes of the Africans on the coast of Guinea.\n\nThat singular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a> by which the king, the nobles, and the priests, under the name of Tabboo, have contrived to render sacred and inviolable whatever they may wish to appropriate to their own use, and which is in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> operation through the whole of Polynesia, is practised to a great extent in the Sandwich Islands. By means of it, a whole people is contented to be robbed of their property, and to suffer any privations that may be imposed on them without murmuring. When their houses are tabboosed they dare not enter them; when their tar-ro-roots or their hogs are tabboosed, they surrender them without a struggle; but in return, it must be owned, they are not scrupulous in appropriating to themselves whatever is not tabboosed.\n\nAmong the customs which they inverately retain is that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TATTOOING\">tattooing</a> the body, this operation being also universal among the islanders of the Pacific. The hands and arms of the women, in particular, are marked with peculiar elegance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, and many of Polynesia, the women have the tip of the tongue tattooed. Contrary, however, to the common practice of the islanders, they do not paint their bodies, nor wear ornaments of any kind in the ears; but the women decorate their hair, which is cut short, with wreaths of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a>, and wear necklaces, bracelets, and anklets of shells, coral, and other substances. The common dress of the men is the maro, a piece of cloth about a foot wide, which, passing between the legs, is tied round the waist; that of the women is a short petticoat, reaching about half-way down the thigh. The chiefs, on days of ceremony, and on particular occasions, wear cloaks made of the most beautiful feathers, with an elegant shaped <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HELMET\">helmet</a> to correspond. They are ambitious, however, to appear in the dress of Europeans, to enable them to do which, great quantities of old laced coats are carried out to the Sandwich Islands, as articles of commerce.\n\nTo whatever degree of civilization the Sandwich Islanders may have attained, since the first discovery by Captain Cook, it is to be ascribed, as we said before, to the personal character of Tamaa-mah; but whether they will continue to proceed or to retrograde, on the death of this extraordinary man, is a matter of great doubt, considering the character of his son and successor. The old man, however, has caused him to be tabboosed, or made sacred, so that nobody is allowed, on pain of death, to see him by day. This being done, he receives the appellation of Leo-leo, \"that is,\" says Kotzebue, \"dog of all dogs; and such we really found him.\"\u2014\"We entered,\" he continues, \"a neat and small house, in which Leo-leo, a tall, corpulent, and naked figure, was stretched out on his stomach, and just indolently raised his head to look at his guests; near him sat several naked soldiers armed with muskets, who guarded the monster. A handsome young native, with a tuft of red feathers, drove away the flies from him.\u2014The dog of all dogs at last rose very lazily, and gaped upon us with a stupid vacant countenance.\" His age is stated to be about twenty-two, but his corpulency is somewhat enormous for one so young. This description does not certainly portend much in favour of the future happiness of the Sandwich Islands, for the vacant government of which there will probably start up many competitors. An European of talent, if such there should happen to be on the spot, might probably succeed to the government and civilization of this good humoured, and by no means untractable people.\n\n4. Coral Islands and Reefs.\u2014The number and position of the multitude of low islands, sometimes found in groups, and sometimes solitary, are by no means yet ascertained; but from the various tracts of ships, it is known that the whole of that part of the Pacific lying between the equator and the 10\u00b0 of north latitude, and from the Pellew Islands, to 180\u00b0 longitude, being at least forty-five degrees of longitude, is completely studded with low coral islands and reefs in countless numbers, some of them inhabited, and others not; and in different stages, from the circular reef, with islets rising upon it like the beads of a necklace, with a lagoon in the centre, to the complete consolidation into one firm island.\nAbout the tenth parallel, and proceeding easterly from the Carolinas, we have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUTTON\">Button</a>, Tindall, Watt's, and Gilbert's Islands; and about the longitude 175\u00b0 east, a whole group, extending to the southward of the equator, named on some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CHARTS\">charts</a> \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Mulgrave's Range,\" on others \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCARBOROUGH\">Scarborough</a>'s Range;\" some of the individual islands of which are Smith's, Allen's, Gillespie's, Toumin's, Hopper's, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHATHAM\">Chatham</a>'s, Calvert's, Robertson's, Arrowsmith's, Daniel's, Marshall's, Pott's, near to which are Kingmill's Group and Byron's Island, all of coral formation.\n\nVarious accounts have been given by Cook, Forster, Flinders, and others, of the progressive formation of these low specks of land, with which the Pacific is studded; but the best and most satisfactory is that by Kotzebue and the naturalist Chamisso. They not only saw the \"Lord Mulgrave's\" chain of islands, which extend from 1\u00b0 to 129\u00b0 N., of which Gilbert's Islands form the northern, and Marshall's Island the southern, extremity, but they discovered and examined minutely many other groups and detached islands. Between the eighth and tenth degrees of north latitude, and between longitude 188\u00b0 48' and 190\u00b0 46', they fell in with no less than six distinct groups, to which they understood the natives applied the name of Radaack; and they learned that to the westward were nine other groups, and three detached islands, called Ralick, besides four groups to the southward. The Radaack chain is probably those which were seen by Captain Marshall in 1788, and to which he gave the name of Chatham and Calvert Islands, though Krusenstern thinks that these are the same as the Ralick chain. It is not of much importance, in a geographical point of view, whatever it might be for the benefit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a>.\n\nThe small size of Kotzebue's vessel gave him the advantage of sailing through the openings in the circular reefs, and of examining the lagoons within them. From his account, it would seem that the coral-making animals do not commence their labours at the very depth of the ocean, as has been supposed, but on rocky shoals, the summits, in all probability, of submarine mountains, round which they lay the foundation of their extraordinary fibres, forming an united chain, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> in shape, but generally approaching, more or less, to a circle. The greatest depth at which they are able to derive a sufficient degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> for their operations has not yet been ascertained; but we know that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">marine</a> animals have been drawn up in a living state from the depth of a thousand fathoms, and from a temperature very little above that of the freezing point. The outer edge of the reef exposed to the surf of the sea is the first that shows itself above water; in process of time, it becomes indurated, breaks, and crumbles, by the action of the sea, and at length forms a sort of barrier, within the sloping sides of which the living animals are seen carrying on their operations. Those observed by Chamisso were the Tubipora musica, the Millepora carulea, obistichopora, actinias, and various kinds of the polypus. He found the living branches of the lythophytes generally attached to the dead stems; many of the latter, however, crumbled into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>, which, accumulating on the inner declivity, constitutes no inconsiderable part of the surface of the new islands, which rise out of this reef, and are gradually united into one island, having in its centre a salt water lake, that alternately grows up by a silent and slow progress, till what was at first a chain of islets, has become one connected mass of land. The progress towards a state fit for the habitation of man is thus described by Chamisso:\n\n\"As soon as it has reached such a height, that it remains almost dry at low water, at the time of ebb, the corals leave off building higher; sea-shells, fragments of coral, sea-hedgehog shells, and their broken off prickles, are united by the burning sun, through the medium of the cementing calcareous sand, which has arisen from the pulverization of the above-mentioned shells into one whole or solid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, which, strengthened by the continual throwing up of new materials, gradually increases in thickness, till it at last becomes so high, that it is covered only during some seasons of the year by the high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-TIDES\">tides</a>. The heat of the sun so penetrates the mass of stone when it is dry, that it splits in many places, and breaks off in flakes. These flakes, so separated, are raised one upon another by the waves at the time of high water. The always <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> surf throws blocks of coral (frequently of a fathom in length, and three or four feet thick) and shells of marine animals between and upon the foundation stones; after this, the calcareous sand lies undisturbed, and offers to the seeds of trees and plants, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> upon it by the waves, a soil upon which they rapidly grow, to overshadow its dazzling white surface. Entire trunks of trees, which are carried by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> from other countries and islands, find here, at length, a resting place, after their long wanderings: with these come some small animals, such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIZARDS\">lizards</a> and insects, as the first inhabitants. Even before the trees form a wood, the real sea-birds nestle there; strayed land-birds take refuge in the bushes; and, at a much later period, when the work has been long since completed, man also appears, builds his hut on the fruitful soil, formed by the corruption of the leaves of the trees, and calls himself lord and proprietor of this new creation.\"\n\nIn the Southern Hemisphere.\n\n1. The Friendly Islands.\u2014The Friendly Islands, among which may also be included the Feejee Islands, were first discovered by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABEL\">Abel</a> Jansen Tasman in 1649, to three of which he gave the names of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMSTERDAM\">Amsterdam</a>, Middleburgh, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROTTERDAM\">Rotterdam</a>. The first of these islands is that which was afterwards visited by Captain Cook, and described by him under the name of Tongataboo; more properly, as we since learn from Mr Mariner, Tonga, the annexed word Tabboo, so extensively used throughout Polynesia, being expressive only of its sacred character. From the inhabitants of this island Tasman received yams, cocoa-nuts, bananas, hogs, and fowls, in exchange for iron, nails, beads, and pieces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a>. They had also plenty of sugarcanes. Women as well as men swam off to the ship, and it was observed that all the elder dames had the little finger of both hands cut off, but the young women had not. They wore round the middle a covering of mat-work, which reached down to their knees; the rest of the body naked. None of the\nmen would taste wine, and they were ignorant of the use of tobacco; they had no arms of any kind, which led Tasman to conclude that they lived in perpetual peace and friendship.\n\nTasman next touched at Ammomooka, or, as he called it, Amsterdam Island, in the hope of meeting with better water than on the first, where it was bad and scanty. On landing, they perceived some sixty or seventy persons sitting quietly on the shore, who had no arms of any kind, and appeared to be a harmless and peaceable people. There were, besides, many women and children, the former clothed like those on Amsterdam Island, but they were of a larger size, and as strong in their bodies and limbs as the men. The party was shown to a piece of fresh water not a mile from the shore, about a quarter of a mile in circumference, and about a musket-shot from the north side of the island, where there was a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a>. Here they watered their ships, and received abundance of provisions, the same in kind as those of the other island. The inhabitants are described as being great thieves, but very friendly. They have large vessels with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASTS\">masts</a>, sails, and outriggers, as well as canoes, and on going into the interior of the island it was observed that all their plantations were laid out in neat and regular order. \"In our walk,\" says Tasman, \"we saw several pieces of cultivated ground or gardens, where the beds were regularly laid out into squares, and planted with different plants and fruits; bananas and other trees placed in straight lines, which made a pleasant show, and spread round about a very agreeable and fine odour; so that among these people, who have the form of the human species, but no human manners, you may see traces of reason and understanding.\" He says they have no religion, no idols, relics, or priests; but that they have their superstitions, as a man was seen to take up a water-snake, which, after placing it respectfully upon his head, he threw back into the water. Indeed, they seem averse from hurting any thing that has life, for though the flies are numerous and troublesome, they will not kill them, and one of the principal people was offended on perceiving the steersman kill a fly, though accidentally. Captain Cook bears testimony to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> and fertility of the Tonga Islands. \"There was not,\" says this celebrated man, \"an inch of waste ground; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a> occupied no more space than was absolutely necessary; the fences did not take up above four inches each, and even this was not wholly lost, for in many were planted some useful trees or plants. It was everywhere the same; change of place altered not the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a>; nature, assisted by a little art, nowhere appears in more splendour than here.\" The missionaries, too, in 1797, found these islands in as high a state of cultivation and beauty as they appeared to Tasman and to Cook.\n\nA woeful difference in their peaceable habits, according to Mr Mariner, has taken place since the visits of these Europeans. In 1799 a revolution took place, and from that time bloody wars and most savage slaughter have desolated these beautiful islands. They first commenced, as it would appear, by a most atrocious savage, in whom the kingly power was vested, who not only practised the most barbarous cruelties on his subjects, but seized upon the sacred or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> power, which had always, as in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JAPAN\">Japan</a>, been kept separate from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SECULAR\">secular</a> arm. The sacred spell being thus broken, which rested solely on public opinion, a complete revolution followed, and from that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> these once happy islands have been the scene of slaughter, famine, and every species of horror and misery. We must not, however, give implicit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> to all that has been stated by Dr Martin, the writer of Mariner's account of these islands, but rather consider it as a romantic exaggeration of facts and descriptions, similar to that of the Pellew Islands by Mr Keats. There are shades of difference merely between the inhabitants of these and of the neighbouring islands.\n\n2. Navigator's Islands.\u2014To the north-east of the Feejee, Tonga, or Friendly Islands, are situated the Bauman or Navigator's Islands. The first name was given to them after Captain Bauman, of the Teinhoven, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JACOB\">Jacob</a> Roggewein, by whom they were discovered in 1722; the latter name was conferred by Bougainville, who passed them in 1768. La Perouse likewise visited these islands, and is of opinion that they are not the same as Bauman's islands, because their geographical position does not agree with that assigned to them by Roggewein. Burney, however, has no doubt that they are identical, the only difference being in their supposed longitude, which, in the time of Roggewein, was frequently set down erroneously by several degrees.\n\nThese islands form an archipelago, consisting of ten in number, according to La Perouse, of which the Maoua, Oyolava, and Pola, are the largest and most beautiful. The parallel of 14\u00b0 south latitude, and the meridian of 190\u00b0, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> through the centre of the group. They are said by La Perouse to be volcanic, but surrounded by coral reefs. Roggewein describes the hills and valleys as affording a delightful prospect. The natives came off in boats neatly made and carved, bringing fish, cocoanuts, and plantains. They are said to have white skins but tanned by the sun, gentle in their manners towards each other, lively and good humoured; their bodies were neither painted nor marked, and they were clothed from the waist downwards; the cultivated grounds were all enclosed, and, in short, they are described by the writer of Roggewein's voyage as the most civilized and honest people they had met with among the islands of the South Sea. We may conclude, indeed, from his account, that they were equally well cultivated, and the inhabitants equally mild and peaceable with those of the Friendly Islands.\n\nVery different, however, is the account given of them by La Perouse. Ferocious in the highest degree, he describes them as utterly destitute of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> and every good moral feeling; that a look of disdain is stamped on all their countenances, and that they are eternally fighting with each other, so that their bodies are covered with scars occasioned by the blows of clubs. Tall in stature, their limbs are of colossal proportions; and their bodies are tattooed to such a degree as to make them appear clothed, though they have only a girdle of sea-weeds round their loins, which reaches to the knee. The\nsize of the women corresponds with that of the men, and their whole behaviour is represented as highly indecent and disgusting. They had no desire for iron, preferring their own adzes and other tools made of basalt. Their huts were made with great nicety, and all their wood-work was highly polished and carved. Their matting and cloth were exceedingly beautiful; the latter woven with thread made from the nettle, and a species of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAX\">flax</a>. The sails of their boats or canoes were made of this cloth. The islands are so intersected with creeks, that they travel from place to place almost universally in canoes, which have outriggers to prevent them over-setting.\n\nAll the islands were clothed with trees up to the very summit of the hills, many of them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LADEN\">laden</a> with fruit. The villages are ranged along the margin of the streams which fall from the mountains, and are built in the midst of groves of cocoa, banana, guava, and other fruit trees common to the South Sea islands. The woods abound with wild pigeons and turtle doves, which are tamed by the natives, and kept about their houses in flocks of many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HUNDREDS\">hundreds</a>. Sugar-cane grows abundantly and without culture. Their animals are pigs, dogs, and the domestic fowl; these and the fish, which they catch with great expertise, afford them an abundant supply of food.\n\n3. Society Islands.\u2014The first account of these islands is given in the voyage of Jacob Roggewein, who touched at Ulitea in the year 1722; at least it is conjectured by Burney on probable grounds, that the Verquicking or Recreation Island of that navigator is the same. On sending a boat on shore, the inhabitants assembled on the beach, and advanced into the water armed with lances to oppose their landing. The Hollanders fired upon them, and having dispersed them, landed on the beach, and the inhabitants returned in a friendly manner, and brought them cocoa-nuts and other articles of food. The Hollanders then advanced up a valley towards the mountains, but some thousands of the natives coming out of the glens and crevices, made signs to them to return. The Hollanders, however, paid no regard but proceeded, upon which showers of stones were hurled at them, by which some were killed and others wounded. These volleys were answered by a discharge of musketry, which killed many of the islanders, who, nevertheless, continued the action, and finally drove the Dutchmen into their boats. Many of the latter subsequently died of the wounds they had received in consequence of the bad state of their constitutions, being severely affected with the scurvy.\n\nCaptain Cook visited these islands in 1769, and again in 1777. They consist of six in number (besides small coral islets), whose names are Ulitea and Otahe (both encompassed by the same coral reef), Huaheine, Bolabola, Tubai, and Maurua. They extend from about 16\u00b0 to 17\u00b0 south latitude, and from 151\u00b0 to 152\u00b0 west longitude. The climate, the productions, and the inhabitants, resemble so nearly those of Otaheite, that the same description will apply to both. The surfaces of all the islands are uneven and hilly, but not mountainous, and the hills are finely wooded. The inhabitants, like those of the Navigator's Islands, are generally of a larger stature than the Otaheitans. The late Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a> Banks measured one of the natives of Huaheine, and found him to be six feet three inches and a half in height, and the women are described as generally more handsome and somewhat fairer than those of Otaheite. Bolabola differs from the rest of the islands by having a lofty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> peaked mountain near its centre, apparently volcanic. In Ulitea there is a large morai, in which a number of jaw-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a> are kept as trophies of war. The coral reefs which everywhere surround these islands form numerous safe and commodious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HARBOURS\">harbours</a> for shipping, and refreshments of hogs, fowls, plantains, cocoa-nuts, and yams, are generally to be had in great abundance.\n\n4. The Georgian Islands, including Otaheite, &c. The Georgian Islands\u2014Otaheite is the chief island of this vast group, which extends over fifteen degrees of longitude, in the direction of south-east. The extreme point is Pitcairn's Island, lately become interesting on account of the discovery of the descendants of the mutineer Christian and some of his associates. The natives of this vast chain of islands, and particularly of Otaheite, may probably be considered as the most civilized, but, at the same time, the most sensual people in all Polynesia. It was first discovered by Quir\u00f3s, in 1606, and received from him the name of Sagittaria. The natives received the strangers with great kindness, gave them cocoa-nuts and other fruits, and a general interchange of civilities and presents soon took place. This good understanding remained uninterrupted, and the Spaniards, for once, left the island without having quarrelled with the inhabitants. In their zeal, however, they committed an act which, if discovered, might have been attended with unpleasant circumstances. The place at which they first landed was uninhabited, but in passing through a wood they discovered a Morai, in which they concluded \"the enemy of mankind resided;\" and under this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a>, cut down a tree, which they formed into a cross, and planted in the midst of the sacred building.\n\nIn 1765, Commodore Byron discovered two low islands to the northward of Otaheite, which, in honour of his Majesty, he named George's Islands, one of which, afterwards visited by Cook, is called Tiookea; the natives of these islands were very dark coloured, robust, and apparently ferocious; their bodies were marked with the figure of a fish.\n\nIn 1767, Captain Wallis touched at Otaheite, and went through the ceremony of taking possession of the island in the name of his Sovereign; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAG\">flag</a> was removed by the natives in the night. Various squabbles occurred between the seamen and the natives, who, however, behaved on the whole with great kindness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITALITY\">hospitality</a>. Most of the quarrels were owing to the licentious intercourse of the seamen with the native women. In 1768, M. de Bougainville visited Otaheite, and was most hospitably received; in return for which, several murders were committed by the French seamen. Captain (then Lieutenant) Cook anchored in Matavai Bay in April 1769. It is from this and his several subsequent visits, together with a missionary voyage in the ship...\nDuff, commanded by Captain Wilson, 1796\u20141798, that Otaheite is so well known to us.\n\nThe island consists of two peninsulas, connected by a low isthmus, about three miles in width, covered with brushwood. The larger, Otaheite Nove, is about ninety miles in circumference, and nearly circular; the smaller, Tiaraabo, is about thirty miles; the whole nearly surrounded by a low belt of land, from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FURLONG\">furlong</a> to a mile in width, which is prolonged by a gradual rise to the valleys which run up to the foot of the lofty central mountain. These valleys and their intermediate ridges are beautiful, clothed with a great variety of trees to their very summits; in the valleys are mostly met with clear streams of water, which, in the rainy season, become mountain-torrents. The island being surrounded with coral reefs, is dangerous to approach, and the only safe harbour is that of Matavai, on the northern side, in latitude 17\u00b0 30' S. longitude 149\u00b0 13' W. This too is not free from danger, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> to March. The climate is delightful, the thermometer seldom rising above 80\u00b0 in summer, and ranging from 62\u00b0 to 72\u00b0 in winter.\n\nThe island is so fertile as to produce every thing in abundance, and without toil, for the sustenance of man. The bread-fruit is here superior to that which grows on the other islands. The fruit affords them a most nutritive food, either for present use, or made into a paste called mahie, which will keep till the following season; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a> supplies them with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a> for their buildings and canoes; it exudes a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUM\">gum</a>, which serves for pitch, and from the inner bark is manufactured a substantial cloth. They reckon no less than thirty varieties of this most useful tree, which, with the different exposures to the trade winds, and the difference of elevation above the sea, afford to the natives a bread-fruit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARVEST\">harvest</a> at almost all seasons of the year. The cocoa-nut, next to the bread-fruit, supplies them with meat, drink, cloth, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>. Of plantains, they reckon fifteen different sorts. Yams and sweet potatoes, taro-root of different kinds, and various other edible roots and fruits, are most abundantly produced; to which our missionaries have added the pine-apple, the grape, and various culinary vegetables of Europe; but the natural and spontaneous productions of the soil, and the consequent indolence of the people, are unfavourable to their success.\n\nThe animals found on the island are hogs, dogs, and rats. Several attempts have been made to introduce the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> and horned cattle, sheep and goats, but without success. The latter are so disliked for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a> and the mischief they did to their plantations, that they drove them into the mountains, where they run wild. The breed of cats has succeeded, and found to be extremely useful; and rabbits have been introduced, but we know not with what success. Common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POULTRY\">poultry</a> are abundant, and the woods supply vast quantities of wild pigeons and parrots. The tropic-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BIRD\">bird</a> builds its nest in the steep cliffs, and as their long feathers are highly valued, they are taken on the nest by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOWERING\">lowering</a> down a man seated across a stick, by a rope, to the depth of thirty or forty fathoms; in which situation, by means of a long pole, he swings himself from side to side, examining all the holes as he descends, in order to take the bird on her nest. The shores abound with sea fowl, and the sea with excellent fish, which they take with great expertness by hook and line, or by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">net</a>. Dolphins are caught at a distance from the shore, by baiting the hook with a real or artificial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a> fish. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISHING\">fishing</a>-tackle displays the greatest ingenuity, and can only be exceeded by their skill in using it. Their hooks are made of pearl-shells, bone, and hard wood. The coast abounds with lobsters, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CRABS\">crabs</a>, and various kinds of shell-fish.\n\nThe colour of the natives is that of olive, or light <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>. The men are above the middle size; the chiefs almost uniformly tall, muscular, and well-limbed, measuring from five feet nine inches to six feet four inches, and continue healthy and vigorous to a good old age. The women of the upper ranks are also tall, with limbs finely turned. Their skins soft and delicate; eyes black, sparkling, and full of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>; teeth beautifully white and even; their hair jet black, and generally ornamented with flowers; in their gait they are firm, but easy and graceful. From a custom of compressing the face when infants, they can scarcely be called beauties; yet, according to the account of Captain Wilson, they possess <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEMININE\">feminine</a> graces in an eminent degree; \"their faces never being darkened with a scowl, or covered with a cloud of sullenness or suspicion.\" They are affable and engaging; mild, gentle, and unaffected; courteous to each other and to strangers. The whole of the body to the middle of the leg is clothed; but there is a singular custom which compels a woman to uncover her shoulders and breasts in the presence of a chief, or in passing a morai, or sacred place. The lower classes have always been described as extremely licentious, but Captain Cook says they have been much calumniated. \"It is too true,\" say the writers of the Missionary Voyage, \"that, for the sake of gaining our extraordinary curiosities, and to please our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUTES\">brutes</a>, they have appeared immodest in the extreme. Yet they lay the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> wholly at our door, and say the Englishmen are ashamed at nothing, and that we have led them to public acts of indecency never before practised among themselves.\" It must be admitted, however, that the most abandoned conduct is freely indulged by the women of the Arreoy society, who, to the crime of unbounded licentiousness, add that of murdering their children the moment they are born. In recent accounts, however, it is stated, that this horrible practice has been abolished, and that Christianity is making a rapid progress among these interesting islanders.\n\nAs wives, the Otaheitan women are tenderly affectionate to their husbands and children, nursing and attending the latter with the utmost care. They never, on any occasion, strike a child. A melancholy instance of the fidelity and affection of one of these women is given in the Missionary Voyage. \"The history of Peggy Stewart marks a tenderness of heart that never will be heard without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMOTION\">emotion</a>. She was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of a chief, and taken for his wife by Mr Stewart, one of the unhappy mutineers (of the Bounty). They had lived with the old chief in the most tender state of endearment; a beautiful little\ngirl had been the fruit of their union, and was at the breast when the Pandora arrived, seized the criminals, and secured them in irons on board the ship. Frantic with grief, the unhappy Peggy flew with her infant in a canoe to the arms of her husband. The interview was so affecting and afflicting, that the officers on board were overwhelmed with anguish, and Stewart himself, unable to bear the heart-rending scene, begged she might not be admitted again on board. She was separated from him by violence, and conveyed on shore in a state of despair and grief too big for utterance. Withheld from him, and forbidden to come any more on board, she sunk into the deepest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPRESSION\">depression</a>; it preyed on her vitals,\u2014she lost all relish for food and life,\u2014rejoiced no more,\u2014pined under a rapid decay of two months, and fell a victim to her feelings, dying literally of a broken heart.\"\n\nThe Otaheitans are generous even to a fault; they seem to be utterly unable to resist importunities, and always ready to share their last morsel with their neighbours. Poverty is no reproach, but affluence with covetousness brings contempt on the owner. Should any one, indeed, refuse to share his property in cases of distress, the chances are that it will be destroyed, and his house pulled down over his head. The office of king is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>; the chiefs resemble our ancient barons; under them are the vassals, and below them the villeins, or labourers. The king and queen enjoy many privileges, one of which is, to be carried about every where on men's shoulders; and the reason of this is, that whatever soil they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-TREAD\">tread</a> upon becomes sacred, and belongs to them; so also, if they enter a house, it is rendered sacred, and becomes their property. Their domestics and attendants are also raa, or sacred, and for thieving, plunder, and all manner of licentiousness, they are said to be the worst on the island.\n\nIn the Missionary Voyage is given an account of the ceremony of investing the new sovereign with the royal maro, when each chief of the island, amounting to nearly one hundred, brings one, two, or three human victims, to offer up on the occasion. They are brought before the sovereign in a lifeless state, having first been stoned to death, or knocked on the head with clubs. From each of these victims the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a> scoops out an eye, and presents it to the king on a plantain-leaf, and the bodies are then carried away and interred in the Morai. The reason assigned for this oblation is, that the head being accounted sacred, and the eye the most precious part, it is presented to the king as the head and eye of the people. During the presentation the king holds his mouth open, as if devouring it, whereby it is imagined he receives additional <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> and discernment. The royal maro, and the sacred canoes which brought the human sacrifices, are then deposited in the Morai. A series of feasts then begin, which continue for two months. These abominable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RITES\">rites</a>, if not entirely abolished, have, in a great degree, ceased by the influence of the missionaries.\n\nIn their language and their deities may be traced their Hindoo origin; and, though their religion is a tissue of superstitions and brutal ceremonies, they never draw near to their Eatova with carelessness and inattention. Captain Cook testifies to the decorous conduct of an Otaheitan on such occasions: \"He is all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a>,\u2014he approaches the place of worship with reverential awe,\u2014uncovers when he treads on sacred ground, and prays with a fervour that would do honour to a better profession.\"\n\nOn the whole, the Otaheitans are not only the most advanced in civilization, but inhabit the fairest and most fertile island of Polynesia. Taking into account, as Captain Wilson says, its amenity, the salubrity of the climate, the plenty of fine water, spontaneous productions of the earth, the rich and most romantically picturesque appearances of the country, \"he felt the justice of the title given to Otaheite by one of the navigators, as the 'Queen of Islands.'\" The latest accounts received from the missionaries are most gratifying. One of them thus concludes: \"Public immorality, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRUNKENNESS\">drunkenness</a>, and profane swearing, are unknown here. All their former sports and amusements are completely put down. Their morals are almost all demolished, and many of them completely obliterated; and it is a singular fact, that chapels now occupy the very ground on which many of them stood.\"\n\nWith such a people is the north-western extremity of the large group of islands, and the interesting offspring of the mutineers of the Bounty, who still preserve their religious habits and purity of manners, on the small island of Pitcairn, at the opposite extremity, a hope may be indulged that, in the course of half a century, civilization will have made a rapid progress, not only throughout the Friendly Society, and King George Islands, but over a very considerable portion of Polynesia.\n\n5. The Marquesas.\u2014This cluster of islands was discovered by Alvaro Mendana in 1595, and named Marquesas by him Las Marquesas de Mendoza, in honour of the Viceroy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERU\">Peru</a>. Four only are described by Quiros the pilot, under the names of La <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMINICA\">Dominica</a>, Santa <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHRISTINA\">Christina</a>, San Pedro, and La Madalena. The Spaniards anchored in a port on Santa Christina, to which they gave the name of Madre de Dios, well protected from the trade-wind, and which has two excellent streams of fresh water flowing into it. The people are described as being an elegant race, the women in particular as remarkably beautiful, whose complexions and general appearance are said to excel those of the women of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIMA\">Lima</a>. Their dress consisted of a cloth made of the leaves of a palm-tree, with which they were covered from the breast downwards; and so civilly disposed were they, that a beautiful native woman seated herself by the side of Donna Isabel, the wife of Mendana, and began to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAN\">fan</a> her. But the Spaniards, as usual, found means to quarrel with the natives, and to drive them with their fire-arms into the woods.\n\nThe produce of the island was hogs, fowls, fish, cocoa-nuts, sugar-canes, plantains, and the breadfruit, described for the first time by the writer of this voyage.\n\nSubsequent discoveries have made us nearly as well acquainted with the Marquesas as with Otaheite. Captain Cook visited them in 1774, and Captain Wilson in 1797. From these we know that they consist of eight islands in number, besides some smaller islands to the westward, which being seen by\nPolynesia. an American master of the name of Ingraham, he called them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WASHINGTON\">Washington</a>'s Islands. They had previously been seen, however, by Marchand in 1789, and may fairly be grouped as part of the Marquesas. The centre of the group may be reckoned in about the latitude $9^\\circ 30'$ south, and longitude $139^\\circ 30'$ west.\n\nThe manners, the religious ceremonies, the manners, and the general appearance of the natives, are so similar to those of Otaheite, that a description of them would amount to little more than a repetition of what has been said. They have all the good qualities of the natives of that island, and most of their bad ones; but owing probably to a more restricted communication with strangers, a greater degree of simplicity was observable in their manners, on the first arrival of the missionaries among them, than in the people of Otaheite. Scarcely had they anchored in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESOLUTION\">Resolution</a> Bay (Madre de Dios), than two women, though dark, swam off to the ship, in the hope of meeting a favourable reception, calling out in a piteous tone, when they found they could not be admitted on board, \"Wahee\u00e9\u00e9\u00e9, wahee\u00e9\u00e9\u00e9!\" We are women, we are women. The next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> the visit was repeated, and is thus described in the Missionary Voyage.\n\n\"Our first visitors from the shore came early; they were seven beautiful young women, swimming quite naked, except a few green leaves tied round their middle; they kept playing round the ship for three hours, calling Wahee\u00e9\u00e9\u00e9! until several of the native men had got on board; one of them, being the chief of the island, requested that his sister might be taken on board, which was complied with. She was of a fair complexion, inclining to a healthy yellow, with a tint of red in her cheek, was rather stout, but possessing such symmetry of features, as did all her companions, that as models for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATUARY\">statuary</a> and painter their equals can seldom be found.\" Captain Wilson says, that an Otaheitan woman which they had on board was far eclipsed by the Marquesan woman; but she was shocked to see a woman quite naked walking the deck, and threw over her a dress of Otaheitan cloth; but as for the rest of these females, the goats, it seems, soon stripped them of their green leaves, and left them in a state of complete nudity. On shore the women clothe themselves in decent habits.\n\nThe Marquesans are so far superior to the Otaheitans, that they sacrifice hogs only to their deities, and never men. Their houses, canoes, their dress, and the cultivation of their land, are at least equal to those of Otaheite, and they have none of those infamous arr\u00e9y societies. Captain Porter of the American frigate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSEX\">Essex</a>, after brutally massacring a number of these people on the most frivolous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRETEXT\">pretext</a>, charges them with cannibalism, though, from his own account, there does not appear the slightest ground for so injurious an imputation. To all unprejudiced navigators they have appeared as an amiable people, entertaining a great respect for old age, fond of their children instead of murdering them, as on Otaheite and some other islands, and living in peace and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a> with each other, and with their families.\n\n6. Easter Island.\u2014This small island, not 30 miles in length, is only deserving of notice from its solitary position, its great distance from any of the islands of the Pacific, its comparative <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROXIMITY\">proximity</a> to the coast of South America, and its being inhabited by a race of men who differ no more from the rest of the Polynesians than they do from each other; having the same language, the same features, the same religious notions, and Morais constructed as they generally are in other islands; on the platforms of which are erected shapeless and uncouth masses of stone, carved in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of the human bust, with rude faces four or five feet long, set on trunks of ten or twelve feet in height. Kotzebue, the last visitor to this island, looked, however, in vain for any traces of these statues on the spots where they are described by Cook and La Peyrouse.\n\nThis island is supposed to have been discovered by the Buccaneer Davis in 1687; though some have contended for the Dutch <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ADMIRAL\">Admiral</a> Roggewein being the discoverer, who gave it the name of Paaschen, or Easter Island, having first seen it on the day of that feast. Its latitude is $27^\\circ 5'$ south, and longitude $109^\\circ 46'$ west.\n\nIt is not remarkably fertile; few trees are found on it, and no running stream. The natives are very industrious in raising food for their support, which consists chiefly of bananas, taro-root, sugar-canes, sweet potatoes, and yams. By some navigators they are described as a very savage people, by others as a mild and amiable race;\u2014the fact is, that their conduct has corresponded with the treatment they have received from strange visitors. Thus their decided hostility to Kotzebue, when he attempted to land on the island, was explained on his arrival at the Sandwich Islands. An American commanding a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCHOONER\">schooner</a> called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-NANCY\">Nancy</a> from New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, had observed a vast multitude of seals on the shores of the small uninhabited island of Massafuero, to the westward of Juan Fernandez; and thinking it might turn out an excellent speculation, if a small establishment were formed on the island, to carry on the fishing, set about the means of carrying this project into effect. His own crew was but just sufficient to navigate the vessel, and there being no anchorage off the island, could not be spared to catch seals. The brutal wretch, therefore, proceeded to Easter Island, and landing at Cook's Bay, seized and carried off twelve men and ten women to people his new colony. For the first three days they were confined in irons, and were not released till fairly out of sight of land, when the first use they made of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> was to jump overboard, choosing rather to perish in the waves than to be carried away they knew not whither, or for what purpose; the women, who were with difficulty restrained from following them, were carried to Massafuero, but what ultimately became of these poor creatures M. Kotzebue does not relate. No wonder then that such base and inhuman practices should drive the natives to acts of hostility against all foreign intruders.","sp":306,"ep":326},{"h":"JOHN RENNIE","t":"Civil Engineer,\nF. R. S.

The construction of foot paths and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIDLE\">bridle</a> roads is so simple as to require very little separate consideration: except that, in cities and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>, the convenience of the inhabitants requires that some pains should be taken to avoid dust, and has generally been a reason for employing pavements in preference to gravel roads, which might in some other respects be more eligible.\n\nFor facilitating the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of carriages, the most essential requisite is to have the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> as smooth, and as hard, and as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> as possible. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHEELS\">wheels</a> of carriages are principally useful in diminishing the friction of the materials; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAY\">dray</a> sliding without wheels, even on a rail road of greased and polished <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, would have to overcome a friction as much greater than that of the wheel on its axle, as the diameter of the wheel is greater than that of the axle. The wheels assist us also in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> a carriage over an obstacle; for the path which the axis of the wheel describes is always smoother and less abrupt than the surface of a rough road, on which the wheel rolls, and so much the smoother as the wheel is larger, since the portions of larger circles, which constitute the path in question, are less curved than those of smaller ones.\n\nBut in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> of roads not extremely hard, by far the greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the resistance, actually exhibited by a road to the motion of a carriage, is that which depends on the continual displacement of a portion of the materials from their inelasticity, which causes them to exert a continual pressure on the fore part of the wheel, without rising behind it to propel it forwards by its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REACTION\">reaction</a>, as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> substance would do. Hence, in a soft <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>, although the axles of the wheels may move in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> perfectly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a>, the draught becomes extremely heavy. The more the wheel sinks, the greater is the resistance, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> we suppose the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of elasticity of the materials, and their immediate resistance at different depths, to be known, we may calculate the whole effect of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> on the wheel, and the force that is required to displace them, in the progressive motion of the carriage. Thus, if the materials were perfectly inelastic, acting only on the preceding half of the immersed portion of the wheel, and their immediate pressure or resistance were simply <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to the depth, like that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a>, or that of elastic substances compressed, the horizontal resistance would be to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> nearly as two fifths of the length of the part immersed at once, in the newly formed rut, to the diameter of the wheel; or, on a still more probable supposition respecting the greater resistance of the more deeply seated parts of the rut, about half as much as this, or as about one fifth of the length of the part immersed in the rut to the diameter. Thus, if a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COACH\">coach</a> or waggon, weighing sixty hundred weight, supported by wheels four feet in diameter, formed a new rut, an inch deep, in a smooth road, the length of the part immersed being about fourteen inches, the resistance would be about \\(\\frac{1}{7}\\)th of the weight, upon the lowest supposition that is at all admissible, and more probably about one ninth, or from six to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> hundred weight at least; and if the rut were two inches deep, the resistance would be half as much more. But, on any supposition, the increased height, and even the increased breadth of the wheel, is calculated to diminish the resistance, by diminishing the depth of the part immersed: thus, if a wheel were made four times as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>, the length of the part immersed, considering the road as an imperfect fluid, would be doubled, and the resistance would be diminished, theoretically speaking, to about half of its former magnitude; and if the breadth were increased from one to eight, the length of the part immersed would be diminished to about a half, and the resistance would in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> also be reduced to a half.\n\nIn soft and boggy soils, as well as in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a> roads, this consideration is of great importance; and the wheels employed for removing heavy weights, in such cases, ought to be as high and as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> as possible consistently with sufficient lightness and economy. But whether a broad and, at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, a low <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROLLER\">roller</a>, possesses any advantages above a narrow coach wheel, is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> much more questionable; it must be remembered that a narrow wheel may often run between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, where a broader would have to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> over them; and there appears to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> theoretical reason for preferring a low roller, except with respect to a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of wheels, as affording a more convenient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> for the shafts in a moderate inclination, which is both more favourable to the exertion of the horses, and more effective in overcoming the friction; since it has been demonstrated that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> affording the most advantageous line of draught is exactly the same as the inclination of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> along which the carriage would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> begin to descend by its own weight on the same kind of surface. In fact, however, there is no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> for fixing the axletree precisely in the line of draught; and the principal reason for having the fore wheels lower than the others is for the convenience of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> the carriage more abruptly. A very accurate practical roadmaker has observed, that a good road never suffers from narrow wheels with moderate weights not in rapid motion, but that it is equally worn by the rapid driving of heavy stage coaches, and by the slow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRINDING\">grinding</a> of the conical rollers of overloaded, broad-wheeled waggons.\n\nSuch being the operation of the wheels of car-\nriages on sandy or on rough roads, it is easy to perceive how much the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a> and smoothness of the surface must facilitate the draught; it is obvious also that the same qualities must be equally conducive to the durability of the road, since the inequalities will always cause the carriage to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> on it with a certain impetus after being elevated by the irregularities, and the same shock which strains the carriage will also tend to wear away the road still more where it is lowest; and, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, the resistance of the soft materials before the wheel will tend to tear up the road, as it causes the wheel to thrust them before it.\n\nIt happens not very uncommonly that the interests of the traveller and the postmaster are somewhat at variance with respect to the qualities of a road. The French postillion keeps to the rough pavement as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> as the aching <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a> of the ladies in the carriage will allow them to be silent, except when, in going <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> hill, he saves himself the trouble of locking the wheel, by bringing it to the soft edge of the ditch or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KENNEL\">kennel</a>; and the horses of the Parisian cabriolets, in their excursions to the suburbs, have sagacity enough to incline always to the pavement, when their drivers allow them to have a will of their own; while a single horseman, on the contrary, more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> finds his steed on the gravel road, if he happens to leave him to his own direction. In Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> the roads are commonly managed by commissioners, who have no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> with the innkeepers; on the Continent they are universally under the immediate direction of the different governments, who also appoint the postmasters, while the carriages are almost as uniformly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of particular individuals, who have no immediate influence on the management of the roads; and this diversity may perhaps explain, in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, the different systems of roadmaking which prevail on the opposite sides of the Channel. But it may be said of roads as of governments, \"that which is best administered is best;\" whether a very smooth pavement not too slippery, or a very hard gravel road not worn into great inequalities.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">Sect</a>. II.\u2014Of the Mechanical Formation of Roads.\n\nThe only strongly marked <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of the different kinds of roads depends on their being paved or gravelled; but each of these classes admits of considerable diversity in the principles on which the road is constructed. The theory of pavement appears to be extremely simple; the stones, however, may be either small or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>; the former being understood to be employed without previous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> of their shape, as in the inferior kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> which is called \"pitching\" in the west of England; the latter being more or less cut to fit each other, whether in the form of thick rough blocks, not very remote from cubes, or of flat and smooth flagstones: in the cities of Great Britain the former are commonly used for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> pavements, and the latter for foot passengers; but in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLORENCE\">Florence</a> the whole breadth of the streets is paved with flagstones placed diagonally, and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPLES\">Naples</a> the surfaces are nearly as smooth; in both these cases it is necessary to roughen the stones frequently with chisels wherever there is a hill or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a>, in order to prevent the horses slipping, but in both cities the horses from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> are sufficiently sure-footed, even when running with some rapidity. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILAN\">Milan</a> both kinds of pavements are mixed in the same streets; the smooth in two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a>, for the wheels of carriages coming and going, and the rougher in the intermediate parts, for the feet of the horses, as in the British railroads. But in none of these cities is there much heavy traffic to wear these well arranged surfaces into such inequalities as would probably soon be observed in the streets of London, if they were so delicately formed; although, until this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DETERIORATION\">deterioration</a> actually took <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, the locomotion would be luxurious both for the horses and for the passengers, and only ruinous to the coachmakers.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> used large and heavy blocks for their roads, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> them on the spot into such forms as enabled them to be best adjusted to those of the neighbouring stones, though seldom exactly rectangular in their surfaces; and even at Pompeii, where the ruts are worn half through the depth of the blocks, the bottom remains tolerably even, in a longitudinal direction, at least as much so as would be required for carts and other carriages of business.\n\nOur more particular object, however, at present, is the consideration of gravel roads rather than of pavements; the word gravel being here understood to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> in general all stone broken small, whether by nature or by art. The improvement of such roads has long been a subject of great interest with the agricultural and commercial inhabitants of Great Britain. It was soon after the year 1700 that a part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of repairing roads was taken off the respective parishes through which they pass, and levied on the general traveller by means of turnpike-gates; but it was for many years a complaint that the roads were little, if at all, fundamentally improved by the expenditure of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> so raised. This complaint is very energetically advanced in A Dissertation concerning the present State of the High Roads of England, especially of those near London, wherein is proposed a new Method of repairing and maintaining them; read before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> in the Winter of 1736-7, by Robert Phillips, and printed in a small separate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a>. The author's great object is to recommend washing the roads by a constant stream if possible, and at any rate, washing the materials of which they are composed; in this respect, notwithstanding the existence of single roads so situated that the effects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> upon them have been very beneficially introduced, his plans for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> employment of water have been altogether superseded by later <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>; but he remonstrates, with great propriety, against the practice, which has, however, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to prevail so generally even of late years, of laying down large heaps of unprepared gravel, to be gradually consolidated into a harder <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>, at the expense of the intolerable labour of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> animals that are obliged to grind it down. As an illustration of the good effect of water, he mentions that even the sediment deposited by it at the bottom of Fleetditch, which was supposed to be a soft mud, and to require removal when the ditch was...\nfilled up, proved in fact to be a hard gravelly substance, which afterwards afforded an excellent foundation for the roads and buildings supported by it.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of the public has been more lately directed to the subject of roads and carriages by several essays which appeared in the Communications of the Board of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">Agriculture</a>; they principally belong to the names of Beatson, Wright, Jessop, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HALL\">Hall</a>, Wilkes, Erskine, Ellis, Cumming, Whetley, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMOS\">Amos</a>, and Booth; the most remarkable are Mr Wilkes's Remarks on the Advantages of Concave Roads; Mr Ellis's on Washing Roads; Mr Wilkes's on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RAILWAYS\">Railways</a>; and Mr Cumming's on Wheel Carriages; showing particularly the disadvantage of broad conical wheels, and the historical progress of the practice of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENDING\">bending</a> the line of the axes.\n\nBut all these improvements, whether real or imaginary, have of late been in a great measure superseded by the ingenuity and success of Mr Loudon Macadam, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> whose practice is in general principally to be applauded for its obvious simplicity and economy, though he has also had the merit of discovering that the simplest and cheapest methods, in particular cases, especially in that of boggy soils, are also the most scientific and the most effectual. The practical observations, which are to be here inserted, cannot therefore be so well expressed in any other form, as in that of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> of Mr Macadam's own directions.\n\nMr Macadam's leading \"principles are\" (Remarks, p. 37), \"that a road ought to be considered as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> flooring, forming a strong, smooth, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> surface, at once capable of carrying great weights, and over which carriages may pass without meeting any impediment.\"\n\nHe proceeds to give directions for repairing an old road and for making a new one, in the form of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMITTEE\">Committee</a> appointed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">House</a> of Commons, in the year 1819, with some subsequent corrections.\n\nNo additional materials, he observes, are to be brought upon a road, unless in any part of it there be not a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of clean stone equal to ten inches in thickness.\n\nThe stone already in the road, supposing it to have been made in the usual manner, is to be loosened and broken, so that no piece may exceed six ounces in weight; the road is then to be laid as flat as possible, leaving only a fall of three inches from the middle to the sides, when the road is thirty feet wide. The stones, thus loosened, are to be dragged to the side by a strong heavy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RAKE\">rake</a>, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a> two inches and a half in length, and there broken; but the stones are never to be broken on the road itself.\n\nWhen the great stones have been removed, and none are left exceeding six ounces in weight, the surface is to be made smooth by a rake, which will also <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> the remaining materials into a better consistence, bringing up the stone, and letting the dirt fall down into its place.\n\nThe road being so prepared, the stone that has been broken by the side is then to be carefully spread over it; this operation requires very particular attention, and the future <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of the road will greatly depend on the manner in which it is performed; the stone must not be laid on in shovels full, but scattered over the surface, one shovel full following another, and being spread over a considerable space.\n\nOnly a small part of the length of the road should be lifted in this manner at once; that is, about two or three yards; five men in a gang should be employed to lift it all across, two continually <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGGING\">digging</a> up and raking off the large stones, and preparing the road for receiving them again, and the other three breaking them at the side of the road. It may, however, happen, that the surveyor may see cause to distribute the labour in a proportion somewhat different.\n\nThe only proper method of breaking stones, in general, both for effect and for economy, is in a sitting posture. The stones are to be placed in small heaps, and women, boys, and old men past hard labour, may sit down and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> them with small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HAMMERS\">hammers</a> into pieces not exceeding six ounces in weight. When the heavy work of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARRY\">quarry</a> can be performed by men, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a> by their wives and children, the stone can be obtained by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> for two thirds of the former prices, although the stones were then left four times as large. It has also been recommended by Mr Macadam and others (p. 35), that the largest stone employed should not exceed the measure of an inch in its greatest dimensions, or in other words, that it should be capable of being contained in a sphere of about an inch in diameter, which would seldom weigh more than a single ounce.\n\nIn some cases, it would be unprofitable to lift and relay a road, even if the materials should have been originally too large; for example, the road betwixt Bath and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CIRENCESTER\">Cirencester</a> was made of large stones, but so friable, that in lifting they would have fallen into sand; in this case, Mr Macadam merely had the higher parts cut down, and replaced when sifted (p. 107), and the surface kept smooth, until those materials were gradually worn out; and they were afterwards replaced by stone of a better quality, properly prepared. At Egham, it was necessary to remove the whole road, in order to separate the small portion of valuable materials from the mass of soft matter in which they were enveloped, and which was carried away, at a considerable expense, before a good road could be made. But although freestone is by no means calculated to make a durable road, yet, by judicious management, it may be made to form a very good road as long as it lasts. (p. 109.)\n\nWhenever new stone is to be laid on a road already consolidated, the hardened surface is to be loosened with a pick, in order to enable the fresh materials to unite with the old.\n\nA new road, however well it may have been made, will always receive the impressions of the carriage wheels until it is hardened; a careful person must, therefore, attend the road for some time, in order to rake in the tracks made by the wheels; that is, as long as any loose materials are left that can be so employed.\n\nIt is always superfluous, and generally injurious, to add to the broken stone any mixture of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, clay, chalk, or any other matter, that will imbibe water, and be affected by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FROST\">frost</a>; or to lay any thing\nwhatever on the clean stone for the purpose of binding it; for good stone, well broken, will always combine by its own roughness into a solid substance, with a smooth surface, that will not be affected by the vicissitudes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, or disfigured by the action of wheels, which, as they pass over it without a jolt, will consequently be incapable of doing it any considerable injury.\n\nThe experience of the year 1820 strongly confirmed the inutility and inconvenience of employing chalk with the stone. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a>, when a hard frost was succeeded by a sudden thaw, a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of roads broke up, and the wheels of the carriages penetrated into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>; in particular it was observed, that all the roads, of which chalk was a component part, became nearly impassable; and even roads made over chalky soils gave way in most places. But not one of the roads, that had been thoroughly made after these directions, was observed to give way. (p. 44, 46.)\n\nThe tools required for lifting roads are, 1. Strong picks, but short from the handle to the point. 2. Small hammers, weighing about a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a>, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a> the size of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHILLING\">shilling</a>, well steeled, and with a short handle. 3. Rakes, with wooden heads, ten inches in length, and with iron teeth, about two and a-half inches long, and very strong, for raking out the large stones when the road is broken up, and for keeping it smooth after it has been finished, and while it is consolidating. 4. Very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> broad-mouthed shovels, to spread the broken stones, and to form the road.\n\nThe whole expense of lifting and newly forming a rough road, to the depth of four inches, has generally been from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PENNY\">penny</a> to twopence per <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> yard, being more or less, according to the quantity of stone to be broken. With proper tools, and by proper arrangements, stone may be broken for ten-pence or a shilling per ton, including, in some cases, the value of the stone itself. A very material advantage of Mr Macadam's method is the introduction of a much greater proportion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> labour, instead of the work of horses: formerly one fourth of the whole expense was paid, in the district of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRISTOL\">Bristol</a>, for men's labour, and three fourths for that of horses: now, on the contrary, one fourth only is paid for horses' labour, and the other three to men, women, and children.\n\nMr Macadam argues very strongly against the old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, of the necessity of placing a quantity of large stones, as a foundation, to carry the road over a wet subsoil. He says, that whatever be the nature of the soil, if it be previously \"made quite dry,\" and a covering impenetrable to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> placed over it, the thickness of the covering needs only to depend on its own capability of becoming impervious. Large stones, he says, will constantly work up by the agitation of the traffic on the road, and leave vacuities for the reception of water; and the only way of keeping the stones in their places, is to have them of a uniform size. A rocky bottom causes a road to wear out much the faster [acting, probably, as a lower millstone in facilitating the operation of grinding]. \"It is a known fact, that a road lasts much longer over a morass, than when made over rock.\n\nIn the neighbourhood of Bridgewater, for example, the materials consumed on a rocky road, when compared with those which are required for a similar road made over the naked surface of the soil, are in the proportion of seven to five.\"\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> of 1819, upon some new roads made in Scotland, more than three feet of materials, of various dimensions, were laid down; and more than two thirds of them, according to our author, were worse than wasted. In such an arrangement, the water generally penetrates to the bottom of the trench made to receive the road, and remains there to do mischief upon every change of weather.\n\nTo prevent such inconveniences, it is necessary in wet soils, either to make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAINS\">drains</a>, to lower ground, or to raise the road above the general level, instead of making a trench to receive the stones; and from the penetration of rain the solidity of the road itself must protect it. A well made road, not quite four inches in thickness, was found to have kept the earth below it dry in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> of Ashton near Bristol: but six, eight, or ten inches of materials are generally required to make a firm road; being laid on in successive layers of about two inches in thickness, all well broken, well cleaned, and well sized. Sometimes, indeed, a much greater depth of stone than this is required: in a road, for example, which has lately been made from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEWES\">Lewes</a> to East <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOURNE\">Bourne</a>, entirely upon Mr Macadam's principles, as much as three feet of materials was required in many parts before the road could be sufficiently consolidated; it has, however, ultimately been made excellent, though at an expense of not much less than a thousand pounds a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILE\">mile</a>.\n\nMr Macadam maintains that the quantity of stone required for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PAVING\">paving</a> is fully sufficient to make an excellent gravel road in any part of the world; and in almost every case, materials equally good can be obtained for roads at a still cheaper rate; commonly, indeed, at one tenth of the expense of pavements. It is, however, in steep ascents that pavements are most objectionable; at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> end of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACKFRIARS\">Blackfriars</a>' Bridge, more horses are said to fall and receive injury than at any other place in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>. In the suburbs of Bristol the pavements have lately been converted into roads with great success. It is probable that neither the inhabitants of these suburbs nor their housemaids were much consulted on the occasion, although <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> seems to require that the pedestrian order should not be altogether sacrificed to the equestrian without their consent; but, in fact, the inhabitants of these ci-devant streets are said to be well satisfied with the change; and we seem in danger, from the opposition of contending theories, of having all the streets of our cities dug up, and many of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> roads, on the other hand, encumbered with pavements. Mr Macadam has received a new encouragement from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a> to the amount of L. 4000, and not Charing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CROSS\">Cross</a>, indeed, but St James's Square, is going to be Macadamised without delay.\n\nWe find some further confirmations and illustrations of Mr Macadam's principles and precepts in the Report of the former Committee of the House of Commons as reprinted in his Remarks.\nThis gentleman, it seems, arrived from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a> in the year 1783, at the time that many new roads were making in Scotland (p. 97); he was then appointed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSIONER\">commissioner</a> of the roads, and studied the subject in that capacity there; he has since resided chiefly in Bristol, and was induced to take charge of the roads of that district as a surveyor in 1816; because it was only in that situation that he could carry his principles into practice, and make the necessary experiments for establishing them. He observed in his travels, that the mixture of clay and chalk, with the materials of roads, was the almost universal cause of their failure; and he convinced himself that, by a proper application of materials, a good road might be made in every country. His improvements have been very generally adopted in the west and south of England; and principally under his own direction or under that of his family. They had superintended more than 300 miles of road, and twice as many more had been improved by their advice and influence. Sober, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a>, and well informed sub-surveyors he considers as the most important of all materials for a good road; and among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTRINSIC\">extrinsic</a> arrangements which are often required, he thinks the union of different trusts into a single one the most likely to be generally beneficial.\n\nThe operation of washing gravel Mr Macadam has not found eligible, because it is more expensive than screening or sifting, and less effectual; for about London the common gravel is not capable of being cleaned by any ordinary washing; though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THAMES\">Thames</a> gravel, where it can be procured, is generally clean and serviceable. Coarse gravel broken, he says, is preferable to fine, as it consolidates more perfectly into a single mass. The old practice of putting a heap of unprepared gravel along the middle of the road, and letting it work its own way gradually to the sides, he thinks every way reprehensible.\n\nThe objection to a very convex road is, that travellers only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> the middle of it, which is, therefore, worn into three furrows by the string of horses, and by the wheels; if the road is flatter, it becomes worn more equally. Ditches, he observes, only require to be so deep that the surface of the water in them may be a few inches below the level of the road; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">farmer</a> often makes them dangerously deep on account of the value of the mould that is dug out of them. Mr Macadam would prefer a bog to any other foundation for a road, provided that it would allow a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> to walk over it; and he justly observes, that the resistance to the motion of a carriage would not be materially affected by the foundation, if the road were well made. From Bridgewater to Cross, a part of the road shakes when a carriage passes over it; yet the consumption of materials is less there than on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">limestone</a> rock in the neighbourhood. He does not use any faggots in such cases, nor any stones larger than six ounces in weight; and these never sink in the bog, but unite into one mass like a piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a>, which rests on it. He makes such a road generally at three different times: and he always prefers working in weather not very dry. The surveyors are directed to carry a pair of scales and a six ounce weight in their pockets, as a check upon the workmen.\n\nMr Macadam has generally found reason to approve the usual regulations respecting carriage-wheels: but he thinks broad wheels less advantageous to roads than is commonly supposed. He suggests that the tolls might always be fairly made proportional to the exact number of horses employed; except that the waggons should be encouraged to harness them in pairs rather than in a line. The conical form of broad wheels he thinks very injurious.\n\nClean flints from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> side are among the best materials for roads, and might often be procured cheap by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CANALS\">canals</a>: <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANITE\">granite</a> chippings also, brought as ballast, are excellent; and when the middle of the road has been well made with good stones, the sides may often be left for a few feet less abundantly provided with them, as they are naturally much less exposed to wear.\n\nOf the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> produced to the Committee of the House of Commons, there is much that gives us valuable information respecting the economy of horses and carriages in general, and some that deserves to be noticed, as affording partial exceptions to the universal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADOPTION\">adoption</a> of the system introduced by Mr Macadam.\n\nMr Waterhouse observes (p. 85), that stage coach horses generally last about four years in the neighbourhood of London, and about six in remoter parts. He agrees with Mr Macadam, that a very slight convexity is better for a road than a greater: that roads in wet situations often require underdraining; and that the gravel near London is too often used without being sufficiently cleaned. Mr Horne's horses generally wear out in about three years. The \"light\" coaches, with their loads, generally weigh about two tons and a half; the coach one, the passengers one, and the luggage a half; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UXBRIDGE\">Uxbridge</a> road, he says, is generally heavy, because it lies lower than the neighbouring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, and is not sufficiently drained. Mr Eames reports, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUILDFORD\">Guildford</a> road is so much improved by the introduction of flints instead of gravel, that sixteen miles are as easily performed on it by his horses as twelve were before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a>. Mr Fary explains the principle upon which some of the roads about London are watered in winter; it is in order to soften the tenacious mud, that is formed upon the surface; to prevent its adhering to the carriage wheels, and to enable it to be scraped off with ease. He says that about Whitechapel it has been found very advantageous for the heavy traffic, to have the middle of the road paved; and he thinks that two lines of pavement, one on each side, would be preferable to a single one, in order that the waggons might walk at the sides of the road, leaving the middle for lighter carriages. He would have a road 55 feet wide, elevated about 12 inches in the middle Broad wheels, he thinks, are seldom so flat as to bear on their whole surface at once, being commonly rather conoidal than conical; so that they differ less in their effect from narrower wheels than is commonly supposed. Mr Walker adheres to the old opinion, that in soft soils a road ought to be founded on bushes or \"bavins;\" that is, where they can be ex-\npected to remain always wet, so as not to be liable to a very speedy decay. He observes, that if a road does not possess some considerable convexity at first, it will wear concave, and collect mud; the elevation, he thinks, should be about $\\frac{1}{36}$th of the breadth. Mr Telford informs the committee (p. 188) that the declivity of the Welsh roads was formerly in many places one inch in ten; and in some one in eight, and even one in six; but that the modern road scarcely ever rises above an inch in thirty; and that the utmost ascent in the whole line is one in seventeen, for about two hundred yards. With respect to the weight of the stones, he agrees with Mr Macadam, that they ought not to exceed six or eight ounces; and that gravel is best cleaned by riddling it repeatedly, and leaving it to dry in the intervals.\n\nSect. III.\u2014Of the Roads of different Ages and Countries.\n\nThe Romans appear to have been beyond <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> the greatest roadmakers of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> or the modern world. The story told by Montaigne (III. vi. p. 206) of a road in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERU\">Peru</a>, from Quito to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSCO\">Cusco</a>, 300 leagues long, and 25 paces broad, made of stones 10 feet square, with a running stream and a row of trees on each side, seems to have been considerably exaggerated; and it is not very clear whether the stones he mentions were used for the road or for the houses of entertainment built at intervals by its side; nor have the \"rocks cut through\" and \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> levelled\" been very particularly noticed by more recent travellers in that country. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a> only, the Romans are said to have made more than 14,000 miles of road, which was generally executed with great care and labour; and many of their roads still remain as the foundation of the most favourite routes of Italian travellers. The more than Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESPOT\">despot</a> of modern times was as much a Roman in his road-making as in the selfish character of his general policy; and in proportion to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> of his dynasty, he performed more than all the Appii and Flaminii of antiquity. Whatever his merits may have been, the beneficial effects of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> remain, and those who have profited by his improvements have no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to criticize his motives with too great severity.\n\nOf the great roads diverging from the gates of ancient Rome, about twelve have been enumerated by antiquaries, and twelve more branched off from these at a small distance from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a>; eighteen others commenced in different parts of Italy, and in the whole there are at least fifty, which have been distinguished by appropriate names, without including the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> roads through the distant provinces; such, for example, as in England were distinguished by the name of streets, of which many traces yet remain in different parts of the country.\n\nDirectly to the sea the Romans travelled by the Ostian road; along its shores to the north west by the Aurelian, and to the south east by the Appian. Next within the Aurelian was the Flaminian, then the Salarian, the Nomentanian, the Tiburtine, the Praenestine, the Lavican, and the Latin; and then the Appian, which was the most ancient of all, having been made as far as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPUA\">Capua</a>, in the 442d year of the city, accompanied to a considerable distance by an aqueduct. The Aurelian road was made in the year 512; the Flaminian about 533.\n\nI. The Flaminian road still affords the great northern approach to Rome by the Porta del Popolo; it led to Foligno, Aneona, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIMINI\">Rimini</a>, and was continued by the Emilian to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOLOGNA\">Bologna</a>, and thence to Aquilegia, near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a>; the present mountain route from Bologna to Rome is still facilitated by the remains of the ancient structures. Besides the Emilian road, the Flaminian was also connected with the Cassian, leading to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODENA\">Modena</a>; the Claudian to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREZZO\">Arezzo</a>, Florence, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUCCA\">Lucca</a>; there were also six other branches of less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a>, each named after its founder.\n\nII. III. The Salarian and the Nomentanian roads lay to the east of the Flaminian; the former, from the Porta Salara, led through the country of the Sabines by Rieti to Hadria; the latter from the Porta Sant' Agnese went north eastwards to Nomentum.\n\nIV. The Tiburtine road led from the Porta Tiburtina, now San Lorenzo, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIVOLI\">Tivoli</a>, with a branch on the right called the Gabian. The large blocks which were employed to form this road, near the town of Tivoli, in ascending from the river, are still in their ancient places; they are accurately fitted together, and present a surface sufficiently smooth, after having been in use for about two thousand years.\n\nV. VI. VII. The three next in order all met at Anagnia, 24 miles beyond Praeneste or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PALESTRINA\">Palestrina</a>. The Praenestine, from the Esquiline gate, now called Porta Maggiore, on account of the magnitude of the ruins of the aqueduct of Clodius, with which it is incorporated, led by Aquinum to Praeneste; the Lavican led from the same gate, more to the right, by way of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENEVENTUM\">Beneventum</a>; and the Latin road, from the Porta Latina, went first to Comptum; and from Anagnia proceeded to join the Appian near Capua.\n\nVIII. The Appian road is as well known from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of Horace's progress, in his journey to Brundusium, as from the eagerness with which a modern traveller reckons the stages that he has completed, on his way to Naples, without a visit from the banditti that infest it. The original <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of this road, from the Colosseum to Capua, was 142 Roman miles; and it was continued 238 miles further to Brundusium by Julius Caesar. It was constructed with large stones, or rather rocks, joined together with great care; and it is said to have had a foot pavement two feet wide on each side, besides the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGGER\">agger</a>, or principal mass of stones in the middle, and the two marginal parts, which were probably unpaved.\n\nIX. The Ostian road led from the Porta di San Paolo, near the Tiber, in a straight line to the mouth of that river.\n\nX. The Aurelian, from the Porta Aurelia, a gate which was near the Moles Adriani, or Castle of Sant' Angelo, led by Laurentum to Centumcellae, or Civita Vecchia, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENOA\">Genoa</a>, and thence by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUSA\">Susa</a>, across the Montcenis, as far as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARLES\">Arles</a> in Provence. This seems to have been the oldest passage into the Gauls; it was improved by Pompey the Great under the name of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRATA\">Strata</a> Romana. Several other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALPS\">Alps</a> are also particularised in the Itinerary of Antonine on the roads from Milan to\nArles; from Milan to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIENNE\">Vienne</a> in Dauphin\u00e9, either by the Grecian or by the Cottian Alps; the former north, the latter south of Montcenis; from Milan to Strasburg; and from Milan to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MENTZ\">Mentz</a>.\n\nXI. XII. The Triumphal road began from the Capitol, and went over the Tiber into the country beyond the present site of the Vatican. We may consider as the last of the twelve great roads, originating from Rome, the Collatine, leading due north from the Porta Pinciana on the Monte Pincio.\n\nAmong the less remarkable roads about the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a> of the ancient world were also the Campanian, the new and the old Valerian, both leading by Tivoli to the Adriatic; the Tuscan, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALBAN\">Alban</a>, the Ardeatine, on the right of the Appian; the Laurentine, a little more to the right, Pliny's villa being mentioned as accessible from either of these last; the Portuensis, from the Porta Portuense Trasteverina, leading to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OSTIA\">Ostia</a>; and the Aurelia Nova, beginning from the Porta Janiculi, now Porta San Pancrazio, and leading towards Civita Vecchia.\n\nWhether on the foundations of the ancient roads, or in any new lines that have been prepared in modern times by the magnificence of the Pontiffs or of the Princes, the great roads of Italy are at present almost universally well made and well repaired. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOMBARDY\">Lombardy</a>, indeed, and throughout the immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> that extends from the Alps to the Apennines, they are quite as good, in summer at least, as in England. The cross roads of Italy are, however, greatly neglected; for it is in fact almost exclusively in Great Britain that private and individual exertion supersedes the necessity of public munificence.\n\nThe intercourse of Italy with the rest of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> has been greatly facilitated by the improvements made in the two great passages over the Alps by the authority of Bonaparte. The more useful of these improvements are probably those which have been effected on the southern side of Montcenis, since they enable the traveller to pass with little danger or difficulty at all seasons of the year; the more magnificent are the works at the Simplon, which, however, are not completely secure from the danger of avalanches, whenever fresh snow is lying on the ground.\n\nThe Apennine portion of the Aurelian road has also been greatly improved by some still more recent operations, so that carriages may now pass with comparative ease and safety from Lucca to Genoa; though, for one stage, near Sestri, it is not thought advisable for the travellers to retain their seats within them.\n\nThe general declivity of the new road over Montcenis is 1 inch in 15 or 20; and it is never greater, in the steepest part, that is, in the fourth and fifth turns that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> up over Lanslebourg, than 1 in 12.* The road over the Simplon was executed jointly by the French and Italians, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of Bonaparte, from 1801 to 1805. The greatest declivity is 1 inch in 29; so that an English stage coachman might trot his horses up almost the whole way. The longest gallery or tunnel is about 500 feet underground.\n\nThe roads in France are generally rough in their original formation, and still rougher from want of care in repairing them, as the traveller feels to his cost in passing over the primitive mountains in the south of that country, where the roads are certainly very different from those which are made by Macadam across a bog; although some of the more recent French and Flemish pavements, as long as they remain unimpaired, are truly excellent: the new pavement between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOGNE\">Cologne</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRUSSELS\">Brussels</a>, for example, is far more perfect than some of the unpaved parts of the continuation of the same line of road to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CALAIS\">Calais</a>, although the civil postmasters are in the habit of congratulating their English guests on the \"fine gravel road\" they will have to pass over. In Germany they have few pavements, and the roads, except in sandy countries, are generally kept, or keep themselves, in good repair; that is, in the south and the west of Germany. Mr Cripps informs us, that the great roads in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a> are beautiful; they are very slightly convex, and made of granite broken to the size of a walnut. The Irish roads, according to Mr Edgeworth, are generally better than the English; the Scotch, Macadam thinks worse, though the materials are better; but in many parts of Scotland the roads appear to be more than sufficiently good for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> of the country.\n\n[Bergier, Histoire des Grands Chemins de l'Empire Romain, 2 vols. 4to.

Lond. 1822.]","sp":473,"ep":480},{"h":"NECKER","t":"a well known statesman and financier of France. He was born, 30th September 1732, at Geneva, of a respectable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, originally from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> of Germany. At the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of fifteen he quitted Geneva, and proceeded to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> with a view to push his fortune in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a>. He entered first into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BANKING\">banking</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of Vernet, and afterwards into that of Thelluson, of which he became the cashier, and at length a partner. On the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Thelluson, he established a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a> on his own account, by which he accumulated a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> fortune. After twenty years of unremitting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to business, he married a Protestant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a> of respectable family, but in reduced circumstances, the patrimonial estate having been lost in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the revocation of the edict of Nantes. With this lady he appears to have enjoyed the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>. A short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> after his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a>, he was named minister of the republic of Geneva at Paris; and in accepting of this employment, he refused the emoluments which were attached to it,\u2014a degree of forbearance not very usual in public men, but in which he resolutely persisted during the whole course of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. Two works which he published, namely, *A Eulogium on Colbert*, and a treatise *On the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEGISLATION\">Legislation</a> and Trade of Corn*, had greatly spread the reputation of his political talents; and he had fortunately succeeded in adjusting some differences between the East <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">Company</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CROWN\">Crown</a>, in such a manner as to receive the approbation of both parties,\u2014a circumstance which added to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of his character.\n\nAbout this time the disorder in the state of the French finances had become so alarming, that it was found necessary to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> through the routine of official promotion, and to choose able men for\nthe public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> wherever they could be found. These inducements so far outweighed the objections to M. Necker, as a foreigner and a Protestant, that, after some private conversations with M. Maurepas, he was, in 1776, appointed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTOR\">Director</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURY\">Treasury</a>, and in the following year, Director-general of the Finances. The great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of M. Necker was to introduce order and economy in the public management. With this view, he found himself compelled either to suppress useless offices, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> to diminish emoluments; and his retrenchments drew on him the enmity of all those who suffered by his economical reforms. A party was formed against him, chiefly composed of rapacious courtiers; and though the repeal of several oppressive imposts had conciliated the general goodwill of the people, he was daily the object of malicious libels. His severe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> of economy had also excited the dislike of the minister M. Maurepas; though others ascribe his hostility to a different cause; namely, to his disappointment at not finding in Necker that subserviency which he expected from a person of his comparatively obscure origin, and a Protestant. Whatever was the reason, the minister was among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of his enemies, and he is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a>, Madame de Stael, with secretly instigating those libellous attacks of which M. Necker was the object. To enable him, according to Madame de Stael, the better to struggle with his opponents, he requested some signal mark of royal favour, such as a seat in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNCIL\">Council</a>, which was granted. This demand on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of Necker gave rise to new and acrimonious discussions; in the course of which he tendered his resignation, after he had been in office five years. Others give a different account of this transaction. Under the influence, it is said, of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> for popular applause, which was the torment of his life, he published, in 1781, the well-known piece on the state of the Finances entitled Le Compte Rendu au Roi, of which an immense number of copies were sold. Elated by this success, he made his demand for a seat in the Council, but was objected to on the ground of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>. Being persuaded that this scruple would be abandoned, he persisted, and offered his resignation, which was accepted, and he became in this manner, as is alleged, the dupe of his presumption.\n\nThe enemies of Necker reproached him with indulging, during his short administration, his passion for popularity at the expense of the public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>. The great point which he laboured to establish in his Compte Rendu was, that there was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> deficit in the public revenue, and that there was no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> for additional taxes. In lieu of new impositions, he is charged with supplying the public necessities by the expedient of large loans,\u2014postponing, in this manner, the evil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, but accumulating under prosperity a progressive load of debt, which, sooner or later, must be provided for by adequate taxes,\u2014and all this to procure a temporary popularity at the expense of his rivals. Notwithstanding these objections, he had numerous partizans, especially among the men of letters, who regarded his elevation to power as the triumph of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> and liberal principles over aristocratical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a>.\n\nAfter his resignation, he retired to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWITZERLAND\">Switzerland</a>, where he purchased the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARONY\">barony</a> of Copet. In 1784, he published an able <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, further illustrating his financial policy, entitled De l'Administration des Finances. This work, of which 80,000 copies were speedily sold, served to support the reputation of his plans, and also to keep together his adherents, whose numbers formed a counterpoise to the influence of his enemies at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">court</a>.\n\nIn 1787, M. de Calonne convoked the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">Assembly</a> of the Notables, and in his opening speech to that body, he impeached the accuracy of the statements contained in the Compte Rendu. It was not to be supposed that M. Necker would quietly submit to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a>. He sent a memorial on the subject to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a>, with various other papers, for the purpose of proving the correctness of his calculations. His majesty having read these documents, requested that they might not be published; a proposition which by no means suited the views of M. Necker. His statements were accordingly printed, on which he was exiled, by a lettre de cachet, forty leagues from Paris.\n\nM. de Calonne did not, however, remain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> in power; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">Archbishop</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOULOUSE\">Toulouse</a>, by whom he was succeeded, was also obliged to resign, and to make way for M. Necker, the favourite of the people, who was reinstated in his former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POST\">post</a> in August 1788. A new and remarkable era was now about to open in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> both of France and of the world. The writings of the French philosophers and men of letters had gradually given currency to notions of constitutional freedom. The people could no longer endure, like their forefathers, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONDAGE\">bondage</a> of feudal privileges, by which the few acquired the power of oppressing the many. They had become jealous and discontented, and were deeply irritated at the insolence and oppression of the aristocratical body; and with those indignant feelings were mingled, in the minds of the popular leaders, the brilliant visions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REFORM\">reform</a>. But so long as the people wanted a legitimate organ through which their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> could be heard, it was clear that whatever might be their feelings, they could make little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> on the measures of the state. What was wanting in this respect was now about to be supplied; and the popular voice, hitherto so little considered, was, through the representative body, to become the predominant influence in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>. At this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> the French Government was assailed by a complication of difficulties, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> of which was the impracticability of raising the necessary supplies, and the danger of an immediate bankruptcy. A great scarcity also prevailed at Paris, which rendered the populace unusually discontented and tumultuous. In this emergency various expedients were suggested; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVOCATION\">convocation</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">States</a> General, which had been long talked of, was advised by M. Necker as likely to give general satisfaction to the people. In assenting to this proposition, it was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of the court, that the different orders of the clergy, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a>, and commons, should vote in separate chambers, in or-\nder that the deputies of the commons might be controlled by the other two bodies. But the popular leaders were by far too penetrating to allow their influence to be annihilated by this device. They determined, from the beginning, that the three orders should sit and vote together; and, as is well known, after various fruitless efforts to bring about this union, the commons resolved to form themselves into an Assembly for the dispatch of business, without regard to the other two chambers. This decisive step proved effectual, and the three chambers at length all met and voted in one house, by which the whole power was thrown into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of the commons.\n\nDuring these transactions, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> and his advisers pursued a weak and vacillating policy. They <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a>, when it was too late, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> they committed, or supposed themselves to have committed, in putting into the hands of the people the powerful weapon of a representative body. But in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of yielding to the necessity of circumstances, and conciliating this new power, which they could now no longer resist, by conceding with a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a> every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> demand of constitutional <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>, they endeavoured to recover the ground which they had for ever lost; vainly struggling against the power of the commons, and meditating even the most violent measures for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a> of their authority. It was in pursuance of these views that troops were drawn from the most distant parts and encamped around Paris\u2014a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> that could be put upon which was, that it was intended to overawe the deliberations of the Assembly, or, perhaps, to dissolve it at once at the point of the bayonet. These violent courses M. Necker opposed, and he was accordingly dismissed on the 11th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> 1789, and ordered to quit the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> in twenty-four hours. This order he obeyed with equal secrecy and dispatch, and had arrived at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRUSSELS\">Brussels</a> before it was generally known in Paris that he was out of office.\n\nIt is impossible to describe the consternation which prevailed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> when the dismissal and exile of this favourite minister was made known. The person who first communicated the intelligence was considered as a madman, and with difficulty escaped some harsh treatment; and the event was no sooner confirmed, than all the shops and places of amusement were shut up; and his bust, with that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">Duke</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORLEANS\">Orleans</a>, was paraded through the streets, dressed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOURNING\">mourning</a>. These proceedings were interrupted by a German regiment; the busts were broken in pieces; and in the course of the tumult one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> lost his life, while others were wounded. Fresh troops arriving, a serious conflict ensued; and an old man being cut <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> in the Tuileries by an officer of distinction, the populace were enraged to the highest pitch, and being joined by the French Guards, who deserted their officers, they at last succeeded in overpowering the Germans. New outrages and tumults succeeded; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BASTILLE\">Bastille</a> was stormed; and the capital became the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of bloody massacres, while the people's minds were at the same time filled with dismay at the near approach of foreign troops, from whom they apprehended nothing less than the sack of the city. In the midst of these alarms, they besought the Assembly to intercede with the king for the recall of their favourite minister. The necessity of complying with this demand was at length seen by the king, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> was written to M. Necker, requesting him to return.\n\nM. Necker was at Basle when he received this letter, with the request contained in which he resolved immediately to comply. His progress to Paris was one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> triumph. He was cheered as he passed through the different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> by the acclamations of multitudes, who hailed him as their deliverer. This popularity, however, was not of long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>. Alarmed by the excesses which had already taken place, M. Necker became desirous to support the authority of the sovereign; and, without conciliating the confidence of the king's friends, he lost that of the popular party. By the Royalists he was always hated; he now became an object of suspicion to the more violent patriots, and was reproached as an aristocrat. Seeing his popularity on the decline, he resolved to retire, and he accordingly wrote a letter to the Assembly, pleading the necessity of repose for the restoration of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>. No notice was taken of this letter; and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> safety being now in danger from the violence of the people, he quitted Paris, in a private manner, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> 1790.\n\nAfter the loss of power and popularity, M. Necker seems to have sunk into the greatest dejection. \"I could have wished,\" says Mr Gibbon, who passed some days with him about this period, \"to have exhibited him as a warning to any aspiring youth possessed with the demon of ambition. With all the means of private happiness in his power, he is the most miserable of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> beings; the past, the present, and the future, are equally odious to him. When I suggested some domestic amusements, he answered with a deep tone of despair, 'In the state in which I am I can feel nothing but the blast which has overthrown me.'\"\n\nHis mind was soon diverted from the disappointments of ambition by domestic griefs of a more poignant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>; his wife, to whom he was deeply attached, dying after a long illness, in which he attended her with great affection. He had now recourse to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> to divert his melancholy, and several works, which he published, were the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> of his labours. He died at Copet, on the 9th April 1804, after a short but painful illness. His public character is, of course, differently estimated, according to the political views of parties. In his private and domestic relations he was amiable and affectionate, and appears to have been greatly beloved. His writings, besides those already mentioned, are the following:\n\nAn Answer to the Memorial of the Abbe Marelet, on the East India Company, 1769.

The kingdom was then divided into the following provinces, viz. Gorcrah, Kyrat, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MORUNG\">Morung</a>, Muckwany, Mockwanpore, Lamjung, 24 Rajahs, Kemoon, and Almora. The valley of Nepaul proper, from whence the kingdom takes its name, is nearly of an oval <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>; its greatest length from north to south being 12 miles, by 9 in the greatest breadth. On the north and south it is bounded by lofty mountains, but is more open to the east and west. This small tract is very populous, and, besides the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> Cata-madoo, is filled with villages. This valley, although situated between the 27th and 28th degrees of N. lat. is so elevated, that it enjoys an European <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, and the mountains, covered with snow, are in sight the whole year round. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> is productive, and, in some places, yields two crops in the year.

A very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> portion of the northern shores of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>, which circumscribe it, have been visited; and the position of most of their bays, headlands, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>, geographically ascertained. By casting our eye over the North Polar Chart, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be seen that the Polar Sea of that hemisphere is an immense circular basin, which communicates with the two great Oceans of the world, the Atlantic and the Pacific, by two channels, the one separating America from Europe, the other America from Asia. It will be seen, that few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of the coasts of Europe and Asia, which occupy a full half of the circumscribing circle, extend much beyond the 70th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> of latitude; and all these points have been passed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, though at different times and by different persons, with the single exception of the\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> Cevero Vostocknoi, which, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CHARTS\">charts</a>, is made to extend to the latitude $75^\\circ$.

The extent, therefore, of the North Polar Sea may be considered about 2400 geographical miles in diameter, or 7200 in circumference.\n\nThe interior or central parts of this sea are very little known. Several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a> are scattered over its southern extremities, the largest of which is Old Greenland, whose northern limit has not yet been passed; the others are, Spitzbergen, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol16.html#article-NOVA_ZEMBLA\">Nova Zembla</a>, the islands of Liakhov, or, as some have been pleased to call them, New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIBERIA\">Siberia</a>; the North Georgian islands of Parry, and those which form the western <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAFFIN_S_BAY\">Baffin's <a </a>class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">Bay</a>. Besides these, there are a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of small alluvial islands formed at the mouths of the several rivers of the two continents; but whether any, or what number of islands may exist nearer to the Pole, we must of course remain ignorant till the Polar Sea has been further explored.\n\nFor that little which is known of this sea, we are indebted to that spirit of discovery which showed itself immediately after a passage to the Indies had been effected round the Cape of Good Hope; not so much, it is true, for the sake of geographical discovery, as that of shortening the passage by sea to the eastern parts of the world. It was obvious that, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> a ship could proceed from the Atlantic to the Pacific, on a great circle of the sphere, or nearly so, the distance, compared with the circuitous passage round Southern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a> or Southern America, would be prodigiously shortened. The voyage of Columbus had that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>; but it was soon discovered, that, from the Straits of Magellan to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GULF\">Gulf</a> of St Lawrence, there was one uninterrupted continuity of land. Of the northern regions, the information has been scanty and discouraging for such an enterprise. One of the Scandinavian pirates had indeed been driven by stress of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, so early as the middle of the ninth century, upon an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> to the north-west, to which, from its appearance, he gave the name of Snowland, which was afterwards changed to that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ICELAND\">Iceland</a> by the leader of the Norwegian colonists who took refuge on that inhospitable spot; but it was not till more than a century after this that Eric Randa discovered the southern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of Old Greenland; and there are grounds for believing that, in the year 1001, some of these colonists discovered Newfoundland and the coast of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LABRADOR\">Labrador</a>.\n\nThe colony of Iceland <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to flourish in spite of the storms and tempests, the chilling temperature, the earthquakes and volcanoes, which shook to its centre this Ultima <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THULE\">Thule</a> of the inhabitable world; but the Greenland <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a> were less fortunate. For some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> that on the west is said to have so well succeeded as to number one hundred villages, divided into four parishes; but that, having engaged in hostilities with the natives, whom they named Skraelings (the same people as the present Eskimaux), the latter compelled them to abandon their settlements. The eastern colony is supposed to have shared a more deplorable fate; a stream of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ICE\">ice</a> having fixed itself to the coast, about the year 1406, and rendered the whole of it, from that time to this, utterly inaccessible. The existence, however, of any such colony, has of late years been called in question; and it is now supposed that all the Danish and Norwegian settlements were confined to the western side of Cape Farewell.\n\nThe voyages and adventures of the two brothers Nicol\u00f2 and Antonio Zeno in 1380, though they added ages of Nicola and Antonio Zeno, but little to the knowledge of northern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">geography</a>, are extremely curious, and throw considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> on the state of Greenland, Labrador, and the Feroe Islands (Friesland), at that early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>. It may be doubted, however, if any of the voyages hitherto made were undertaken for purposes of discovery and the benefit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a>. The Portuguese have unquestionably the merit of being the first to send out expeditions with these views; and it is to their successful discovery of a passage round the Cape of Good Hope, that we owe the bold enterprise of Christopher Colon, better known as Columbus, to find out a passage to the Indies by steering directly to the west.\n\nIt was not till the year 1496 that England engaged in nautical discoveries. In that year, Henry VII. encouraged John Cabota, a citizen of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a>, to make discoveries, by granting him a patent to search for unknown lands, and to conquer and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> them. His son Sebastian, either alone or in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> with his father, discovered Newfoundland, to which was given the name of Prima Vista, \"the first seen.\" We say discovered; for although the testimonies are in favour of the Scandinavians having settled colonies on this island, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> vestige then remained or has since been found of any such colonies. The object of the voyage was, as stated by himself, that, \"understanding, by reason of the sphere, that if I should sail by way of north-west, I should by a shorter tract come into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>, I thereupon caused the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> to be advertised of my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEVISE\">devise</a>, who immediately commanded two caravels to be furnished with all things appertaining to the voyage.\" He <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> in his report that he reached the 56th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, but finding no opening in the coast, he despaired of a passage, and returned.\n\nA claim, however, has been set up for the discovery of Terra de Bacalhaos (the Land of Cod-fish), afterwards called Newfoundland, by John Vaz Costa Cortereal, a Portuguese <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> belonging to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSEHOLD\">household</a> of the Infanta <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DON\">Don</a> Fernando, who is said to have touched at that island in the year 1463 or 1464, in an attempt to find a route to India and the Spice Islands by sailing westward round the northern extremity of America. This claim rests on the testimony of Cordeira, and on a patent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a>, granting to Cortereal the Captaincy of Terceira, in 1464, as a reward for his important discovery. The\nPortuguese certainly not only fished on the banks, but formed establishments on the island of Newfoundland towards the end of the fifteenth century.\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> of 1500, two ships sailed from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LISBON\">Lisbon</a>, under the command of Gaspar Cortereal, on northern discovery. According to Ramusio, they arrived at a region of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>; and in the latitude of 60\u00b0 north, discovered a river filled with ice, to which they gave the name of Rio Nevado, that is, Snow River. This land was Labrador, which on an old chart is named Cortereals. In returning, he discovered the Gulf of St Lawrence. Gaspar Cortereal was so satisfied of the existence of a north-west passage to India, that he again left Lisbon, in May 1501, with two vessels, but his own was separated on the coast of Terra Verde, and never more heard of. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> went out the following year, but his ship was also supposed to be lost and all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> perished. A third expedition was sent out in search of the unfortunate navigators, but no tidings could be obtained of their fate.\n\nThe French are the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARITIME\">maritime</a> people who have seen, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> indifference, the exertions made by other nations for the discovery of a passage to India, either by the north-east or the north-west. Auberton Cartier's voyages to Newfoundland and the Gulf of St Lawrence, between 1508 and 1534, can hardly be considered as voyages of discovery; and the subsequent voyages of Roberval and of the Marquis de la Roche had no other object than the discovery of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>, or of a desirable spot to establish a colony on the coast of America.\n\nIn the year 1524, the jealousy of the Spaniards would seem to have taken the alarm at the attempts which were making by other nations to discover a shorter way to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHINA\">China</a> and the Indies by the north; for it appears, that a skilful navigator, who had been with Magellan, of the name of Estevan Gomez, sailed in that year from Corunna, with the view of discovering a northern passage from the Atlantic to the Moluccas. Gaspar, the only author who has recorded this voyage, enters into no details, but it is supposed he reached no farther than the coast of Labrador, from whence he brought away some of the natives. On his return, he was asked by a friend what success he had met with? The answer was esclavos (slaves), which the inquirer mistook for clavos (cloves), and spread the report of his having made, as Purchas calls it, a \"spicy discovery.\" It is evident, however, that his voyage was a complete failure, of which, as the voluminous compiler just mentioned observes, \"little is left us but a jest.\"\n\nThe alarm of the Spaniards spread to the Pacific; and Cortez, the conqueror and Viceroy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEXICO\">Mexico</a>, on receiving intelligence of the voyages of the Cortereals, fitted out three ships, under the orders of Francisco Ulloa, to look for the supposed Strait of Anian, through which they were to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a>. In 1542, the Viceroy Mendoza sent one expedition by land and another by sea from Mexico to the northward. No discoveries were made by any of these voyages. Two years after this, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">Court</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a> ordered another expedition along the western coast of America, the conduct of which was entrusted to Juan Rodriques de Cabrillo, a Portuguese in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> of Spain. He reached the latitude of 44\u00b0 N. and gave the name of Cape Mendocino to the land, about the latitude 42\u00b0 N., in compliment of the viceroy.\n\nEngland, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time, was not inactive. At the suggestion of Mr Robert Thorne of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRISTOL\">Bristol</a>, King Henry VIII. caused to be sent forth \"two faire ships, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVERS\">divers</a> cunning men, to seek strange regions,\" which left the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THAMES\">Thames</a> in 1527. All that Hakluyt could discover of these ships and the cunning men was, that the name of one of them was Dominus Vobiscum, and that a canon of St Paul's of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, a great mathematician and wealthy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, went on the expedition. One of these ships was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> away in the great opening between the north parts of Newfoundland and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-META\">Meta</a> Incognita, supposed to be Greenland.\n\nIn the year 1536, two ships, the Trinitie and the Minion, were set forth by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">Master</a> Hore of London, \"a man of goodly stature and of great courage, and given to the studie of cosmographie.\" Six score persons, we are told, embarked on this expedition, whereof thirty were gentlemen. They reached no higher than Newfoundland; but there is a curious account of their proceedings by Hakluyt, which he procured from Mr Oliver Dawbeny, merchant of London, who was one of the adventurers on board the Minion.\n\nOn the return of Sebastian Cabot to England, he was constituted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">Grand</a> Pilot, and \"Governor of the Mysterye and Companie of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">Merchants</a> Adventurers for the Discoverie of Regions, Dominions, Islands, and Places unknown.\" At his suggestion, a voyage was undertaken, in the year 1553, for the discovery of a north-east passage to Cathais, consisting of three vessels, whose crews, including eleven merchants, amounted to 113 persons. Numerous candidates stood forward for the command of this expedition; but Sir Hugh Willoughby was appointed Captain-General of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a>, \"both by reason of his goodly personage (for he was of tall stature), as also for his singular skill in the services of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-WARRE\">warre</a>.\" The fate of this expedition was most disastrous. Sir Hugh Willoughby, with his brave associates, as well as the crew of the second ship, to the number of seventy persons, miserably perished, from cold and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUNGER\">hunger</a>, on the coast of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAPLAND\">Lapland</a>, at the mouth of a river called Arzina, not far from the harbour of Kegor. The third ship, under Master Richard <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">Chancellor</a>, had parted company, and by putting into Wardhuys, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORWAY\">Norway</a>, escaped the fate of his companions; and in the following year, discovered the port of Archangel, and opened the first intercourse with Russia.\n\nIn the years 1555 and 1556, two ships were sent out to Archangel, to carry Commissioners to the Court of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOSCOW\">Moscow</a>, and having landed them to prosecute discoveries, and \"to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> all wayes and meanes possible to learne howe men may passe from Russia, either by land or sea, to Cathais.\" Stephen Burrough, in the Serchthrift, proceeded easterly as far as the island of Waygatz, where he was stopped by the constant north-east and northerly winds, thick weather, and abundance of ice. The neighbouring\nThe rapid progress made from this time by land through Russia to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a> and India, revived the ardour for discovery by sea, and the pens of the most learned and ingenious men in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> were employed to prove the existence, the practicability, and the great advantages which would result from the discovery of a north-west passage. Among others, Martin Frobisher had laboured for fifteen years, but without the means of setting forth an expedition, till at last, in the year 1576, by the assistance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUDLEY\">Dudley</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARL\">Earl</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARWICK\">Warwick</a>, and a few friends, he was enabled to fit out two small barks, the Gabriel of 35, and the Michael of 30 tons, and a small pinnace of 10 tons. On the 11th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a>, this little squadron came in sight of Friesland, \"rising like pinnacles of steeples, and all covered with snow.\" This Friesland, being in 61\u00b0 latitude, was probably the southern part of Old Greenland. He entered a strait, which now bears his name, in latitude 63\u00b0 8' N., and had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> with the Eskimaux, whom he describes as \"like to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TARTARS\">Tartars</a>, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> faces, and flatte noses.\" He brought home one of these \"strange infideles, whose like was never <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a>, read, nor heard of before;\" and Frobisher had the satisfaction to find himself \"highly commended of all men for his greate and notable attempt, but specially famous for the great hope he brought of the passage to Cathaisa.\"\n\nSome of the crew having brought home a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> which \"glistend with a bright marquesset of gold,\" <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a> now gave countenance to a second attempt, and added to the expedition \"one tall ship of his Majesties, named the Ayde.\" In this voyage they proceeded to Mount Warwick, on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESOLUTION\">Resolution</a> Island, in latitude 63\u00b0 8' N., from whence they sailed on their return home on the 22d August, having lost only one man by sickness, and another who fell overboard.\n\nThough Frobisher brought home neither gold nor silver, but something which had the appearance of both, the Queen and her Court pleased in \"finding that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of the gold ore had appearance, and made shew of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a> and profit, and the hope of the passage to Cathaisa by this last voyage greatly increased,\" determined to establish a colony on Meta Incognita; for which purpose fifteen ships were prepared, carrying 100 persons to form the settlement; with whom three of the ships were to remain, and the other twelve to bring back cargoes of gold ore. The fleet sailed on the 31st May 1578; part of it entered Frobisher's Strait, and part were driven towards the coast of Greenland. On the 30th August, the ships having re-assembled off Hatton's Headland, on Resolution Island, and all hands disheartened by the cold and tempestuous weather, they resolved to make sail for England, where they all arrived at different ports about the beginning of October, with the loss, by deaths, of about forty persons.\n\nThe progress made by land to the eastward introduced the Russia Company to fit out two ships, under the command of Pet and Jackman, to make another attempt at a north-east passage. They left Harwich on the 30th May 1580, reached Wardhays on the 23rd <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a>, and the coast of Nova Zembla the 16th July; passed the Strait of Waygatz, but were obliged to return on account of the ice.\n\nSir Humphry Gilbert and his brother obtained from Queen Elizabeth, in 1578, a patent for making western discoveries, by which they established a corporation under the name of \"The Colleagues of the Fellowship for the Discoverie of the North-west Passage.\" In 1583, Sir Humphry set out to take possession of Newfoundland, but the voyage was most disastrous, and on his return, his little bark foundered at sea, when he and all that were in her perished.\n\nIn 1585, John Davis was sent out by the merchants of London, for the discovery of the north-west passage. Two barks, the Sunshine and the Moonshine, one of 50, the other of 35 tons, were fitted out for this purpose. On the 6th of August, Davis had proceeded so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> up the strait which now bears his name as latitude 66\u00b0 40', and anchored in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXETER\">Exeter</a> Bay, under \"a brave mount,\" to which he gave the name of \"Mount Raleigh, the cliffs whereof were as orient as gold.\" On the 8th August, they returned to the southward, and arrived in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DARTMOUTH\">Dartmouth</a> the 30th September.\n\nIn 1586, Davis set sail a second time, and coasted the western shore of Greenland up to the latitude 66\u00b0 38', stood from thence across to the westward, made the land in 66\u00b0 19', and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> to the southward, along the coast and numerous islands, anchored in a bay on the coast of Labrador, in latitude 56', and, sailing from thence, arrived in England in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of October.\n\nA third voyage being determined on, Davis sailed from Dartmouth on the 19th May, made the land on the west coast of Greenland in latitude 64\u00b0 on the 14th June, had advanced as high as latitude 67\u00b0 on the 24th, and, on the 30th, was in latitude 72\u00b0 12'. From hence he crossed to the westward in an open sea, but being driven, as he supposed, by a current, found themselves, on the 19th, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABREAST\">abreast</a> of Mount Raleigh. After this, Davis advanced 60 leagues up the strait he had discovered on the former voyage, now called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUMBERLAND\">Cumberland</a> Strait; passed through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LUNDY\">Lundy</a>'s Inlet, the same, it is supposed, which Frobisher had discovered, and known as Frobisher's Strait; and, standing to the south-east, discovered Cape Chidley, and, returning homewards, arrived in England by the middle of September.\n\nOf the voyage of Maldonado in 1588, and of Jan de Fuca, 1592, it is not necessary to say anything, the latter being at best but problematical, and the former altogether spurious.\n\nThe next attempts we find in chronological order were three voyages for the discovery of a north-east passage, undertaken by the Dutch, in which Willem Barentz was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> pilot. The first of these was\n\n---\n\nAn interesting account of the proceedings of this able and intrepid navigator, by himself, is contained in a very rare and curious little book called *The World's Hydrographical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">Description</a>*, 1595.\nset forth in 1594; proceeded easterly as far as Waygatze, then along the western coast of Nova Zembla as high as latitude 77\u00b0 25'; and returned to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEXEL\">Texel</a> the 16th September. On the second voyage, the following year, they did not reach Nova Zembla till the 17th August, when finding it impossible, on account of the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of ice, and \"the weather being misty, melancholic, and snowie,\" they returned to the westward, and arrived in the Maes on the 18th November.\n\nThe third voyage of Barentz is intensely interesting. The ships left the Texel in May, and on the 9th June, after sailing among much ice, they discovered Bear (since called Cherry) Island. Proceeding northerly, they discovered Spitzbergen, along the western coast of which they had advanced, on the 19th, as high as 80\u00b0 11', opposite the point since known as Hakluyt's Headland. Returning to the southward, Barentz made for the coast of Nova Zembla; doubled the northern extremity; and then found himself compelled, by the pressure of the ice and bad weather, to seek for refuge in a small bay, which they called Ice Haven; and here they passed \"their cold, comfortlesse, darke, and dreadful winter,\" in about the 76th parallel of latitude. The ship was wholly wrecked, and the surviving part of the crew, fifteen in number, left this spot the following year in two open boats; and after an exertion of forty days, in which they suffered the greatest fatigue, famine, and cold, and in which Barentz and two others died, they reached Kilduin in Lapland, a distance of 1000 miles and more from the bay in which they had passed the winter.\n\nThe merchants of England seem to have lost all hope of a northern passage to the East Indies, till they were once more roused by a supposed piece of information of Captain James <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANCASTER\">Lancaster</a>, that the passage was in the north-west of America, in latitude 62\u00b0 30'. Accordingly in 1602 the Muscovy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TURKEY\">Turkey</a> Companies fitted out two fly-boats, the Discovery and Godspeed, the command of which was given to Captain George Weymouth. This voyage, however, was a complete failure. It is difficult to make out precisely the utmost limit at which it arrived; it was not much beyond Resolution Island in Hudson's Strait; but, to use the words of a subsequent sagacious navigator, Luke Fox, \"Davis and Weymouth lighted Hudson into his Straits.\"\n\nIn 1605, the King of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DENMARK\">Denmark</a> sent out an expedition of discovery, in which two Englishmen, James <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HALL\">Hall</a> and John <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNIGHT\">Knight</a>, were employed. The ships proceeded along the west coast of Greenland, but reached no higher than about latitude 66\u00b0 55'; gave the names of Christian's Foord and Queen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANNE\">Anne</a>'s Cape; traded and quarrelled with the natives; left two malefactors among them, and returned to Elsinore.\n\nThis expedition was followed up by two others in the two following years, neither of which was productive of any discoveries; the first having advanced only to 66\u00b0 25' on the coast of Greenland, and the latter not farther than Cape Farewell.\n\nIn 1606, the merchants of London sent out the Hopewell, under the directions of John Knight. In latitude 56\u00b0 48', on the coast of Labrador, Knight, with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATE\">mate</a> and four others, went on shore, and were supposed to be murdered by the natives, as none of them were ever afterwards heard of. The ship returned home.\n\nHenry Hudson made no fewer than four voyages of discovery. The first, in 1607, was along the eastern coast of Greenland, when he observed, in 78\u00b0 56', a higher degree of latitude on that coast than has since been ascended. The second, in 1608, was an attempt to the eastward, where, as in all preceding attempts, he was stopped at Waygat Strait. Of the third little is known. Its northern limits appear to have been the North Cape on one side, and Newfoundland on the other.\n\nThe fourth voyage was fatal to Hudson; but it opened the way to the coast of America in a higher degree of latitude than it had yet been approached. He left the Thames in the Discovery of 55 tons, on the 17th April 1610; and reached the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLE\">Isle</a> of Godsmercie, in the strait which bears his name, on the 6th July; on the 2d August, he discovered land, which he named Cape Wolstenholm; and near it, on a cluster of islands, Cape Digges\u2014and here ends Hudson's narrative; for his crew having mutinied, they put Hudson, his son, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> others, into an open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a>, which was never heard of more. The ship returned to England, and, what is most remarkable, the inhuman and atrocious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> does not appear to have caused any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a>, nor was any inquiry instituted into the proceedings of the mutineers.\n\nTwo of them, in fact, Abacuk Pricket and Robert Bylot, were employed under Captain (afterwards Sir Thomas) <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUTTON\">Button</a>; appointed to prosecute the discovery of a north-west passage, in two ships, the Resolution and Discovery. Button followed the tract of Hudson, and succeeded in reaching the coast of America, where he wintered in Nelson's River, in latitude 57\u00b0 10'. The following year they stood to the northward, and discovered Southampton Island, as high up as latitude 65\u00b0; made some discoveries of Islands, and returned to England in the autumn of 1613.\n\nIn 1612, we find James Hall employed on an expedition up the western coast of Greenland, where he was slain by one of the natives at Ramel's Point, in latitude 67\u00b0. The account of the voyage is written by William Baffin, who was pilot, in which he relates the method of determining the longitude by an observation of the time when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">moon</a> came upon the meridian; the first navigator probably who practised this method.\n\nIn 1614, Captain Gibbon was sent out in the Discovery, at the recommendation of Sir Thomas Button; he encountered much ice at the opening of Hudson's Strait, returned to the southward, and was shut up in a bay on the coast of Labrador, for five months; and returned without making any progress in the north-western discovery. To this bay the ship's company are said to have given, in derision, the name of \"Gibbon's his Hole.\"\n\nIn 1615, the Discovery was fitted out a fourth time, and the command of her given to Robert Bylot.\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-POLAR_SEAS\">Polar Seas</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOT\">lot</a>, who took William Baffin as his mate. They visited Button's Islands, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">Savage</a> Islands, and Mill Islands, and proceeded along the east coast of Southampton Island to Cape Comfort, in latitude 52\u00b0.\n\nFrom hence they returned to the southward, reached England in the month of September. In 1616, Bylot and Baffin again set out in the Discovery, in search of a north-west passage; following their instructions, proceeded up Davis Strait to Hope Saunderson, the extreme point of Davis's progress, being between 72\u00b0 and 73\u00b0 latitude, which they reached as early as the 30th May. Little to the northward was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUP\">group</a> of islands, to which, finding females only, they gave the name of Women's Islands. From hence they stood northerly, between the ice and the land, passing in succession <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORN\">Horn</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUND\">Sound</a>, Wolstenholme's Islands, Whale Sound, Sir Thomas Smith's Sound, in latitude 78\u00b0, and, at the northern extremity of what has since been called Baffin's Bay; and following the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of the land, they passed, on the western shore, Allerman Jones's Sound, and lastly, Lancaster Sound; from whence the ice compelled them to leave the land, and they therefore shaped their course homewards. This last voyage of Baffin is the most important that had yet been made; and it is quite surprising that the discovery of so many immense openings which he calls sounds, for want of a better word, should not have been followed up, and that not one of them should have been examined until the recent expedition under that intelligent and enterprising officer Captain Parry.\n\nIn 1619, the Danes sent out an expedition under Jens Munck, who penetrated as high up on the coast of America as Chesterfield Inlet, which he named Munck's Winter Harbour, for he wintered in it, and all his people, except two, perished of cold, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>, and famine. Munck, and these two survivors, with great difficulty, fitted out the smaller of the two vessels, and reached Denmark, where they were considered as men risen from the dead. Munck is said to have received the indignity of a blow from the King, on which he took to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a>, and died of a broken heart; but there is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROMANCE\">romance</a> in the account of this voyage, which makes its authenticity doubtful.\n\nIn 1631, Captain Luke Fox, who quaintly calls himself the \"North-west Fox,\" prevailed on some merchants of London to procure from King <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> I. his countenance, and the loan of one of his ships, for attempting the discovery of a north-west passage. Fox was undoubtedly the most shrewd and intelligent of all former navigators; and if, when he reached what he calls Fox's Farthest, he had stood across to the westward, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> is, that he would have got upon the northern coast of America, and succeeded in working his way into the Pacific, by the very route which Parry is now pursuing.\n\nIn the same year the merchants of Bristol fitted out the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARIA\">Maria</a> of 70 tons, the command of which was given to Captain James. In proceeding up Hudson's Strait, somewhere about Resolution Island, he got his ship entangled in the ice; and from that spot to Charlton Island, at the bottom of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HUDSON_S_BAY\">Hudson's Bay</a>, in latitude 52\u00b0, he details a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of disasters which never happened to any navigator before or since. Here he passed the winter, and returned the following year, without making the least progress in discovery.\n\nIn 1652, the King of Denmark again set forth an expedition under Captain Daniel, to explore the eastern coast of Greenland. He stood to the northward of Iceland, but he could not approach the land on account of the ice, but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> were visible at least 60 miles. The most northern cape seen was in 65\u00b0 30', to which he gave the name of Cape King Frederick. From this point to Cape Farewell the ice lay between him and the shore, which in no part he could approach within 20 miles; of course, no discovery was made by him.\n\nAfter the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAPSE\">lapse</a> of more than a century, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> admitted into the Transactions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> of London in 1675, tended to revive the attempt at a north-east passage in England. It contained an account of a Dutch ship fitted out by a company of merchants in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, having passed to the northeastward of Nova Zembla several hundred leagues, between the parallels of 70\u00b0 and 80\u00b0; and the sea in that direction was found to be perfectly open and free from ice. About the same time, it was reported that Spitzbergen had been circumnavigated, and that a Dutch ship had proceeded within one degree of the Pole. Upon the strength of these reports, Captain John Wood addressed a memorial to the king, assigning seven reasons and three arguments, for the existence of a north-east passage. Accordingly, two ships were fitted out under Captains Wood and Flaws; they left the Nore in May 1676; on the 22d June, had reached the latitude 75\u00b0 79', and on the 26th got sight of the west coast of Nova Zembla. Three days after this, Wood lost his ship among the ice, and after some perils and the loss of two men in reaching the shore, they were picked up by the other ship, and returned homewards without making the least discovery; when Wood published many peremptory and ill-founded reflections on former navigators, and now found out seven reasons and three arguments against the passage to the north-east.\n\nOf the voyages of Knight, Barlow, Vaughan, and Scroggs, from the Hudson's Bay Company's settlements, along the eastern coast of America, little else need be said, than that they extended not the knowledge of that coast beyond Whale Point; but their observations on the strong tide flowing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the Welcome, induced a gentleman of the name of Dobbs to press the Board of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMIRALTY\">Admiralty</a> to appropriate a ship of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">navy</a> to make discoveries in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>. Two ships were accordingly fitted out, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FURNACE\">Furnace</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOMB\">bomb</a>, and the Discovery pink, commanded by Captain Middleton and Mr William Moor. They left England in 1741, and wintered in Churchill River in latitude 58\u00b0 56'; remained there till the 1st July; proceeded northerly to the latitude 65\u00b0 23', and entered Wager River, which they examined in an imperfect manner. They then stood to the northward as far as Cape Hope, in latitude 66\u00b0 14', longitude 86\u00b0 28' W.; and, most unaccountably, abandoned all farther search, having\nPolar Seas.\n\nHopewell, under the directions of John Knight, in Polar Seas, set forth in 1694; proceeded easterly as far as Waygate, then along the western coast of Nova Zembla latitude 55\u00b0 48', on the coast of Labrador, Knight, with his mate and four natives, as high as latitude 72\u00b0 25', and returned to the Texel the 16th September. On the second voyage, the following year, they did not reach Nova Zembla till the 17th August, when finding it impossible, on account of the great quantity of ice, and the weather being nasty melancholy, and snowy, they returned to the westward, and arrived in Mares on the 18th November.\n\nThe third voyage of Barentz is interesting; the Texel in May, and on the 9th June, after sailing among much ice, they discovered Bear (since called Cherry) Island. Proceeding northerly, they discovered Spitzbergen, along the western coast of which they had advanced, on the 19th, as high as 80\u00b0 11' opposite the point since known as Hakluyt's Headland. Returning to the southwest, Barentz made for the coast of Nova Zembla; doubled the northern extremity; and then found himself compelled, by the pressure of the ice and bad weather, to seek for refuge in a small bay, which they called Ice Haven; and here they passed \"their cold, comfortless, dark, and dreary winter,\" in about the 76th parallel of latitude. The ship was wholly wrecked, and the surviving part of the crew, fifteen in number, left this spot the following year in two open boats; and after an exertion of forty days, in which they suffered the greatest fatigue, famine, and cold, and in which Barentz and two others died, they reached Kildin in Lapland, a distance of 1000 miles and more from the bay in which they had passed the winter.\n\nOf George Weymouth, hope of a northern passage to the East Indies, till they were once more roused by a subsequent piece of information of Captain James Lancaster, that the passage was in the north-west of America, in latitude 66\u00b0 30'. Accordingly in 1602 the Muscovy and Turkey Companies fitted out two fly-boats, the Discovery and Godspeed, the command of the which was given to Captain George Weymouth. This voyage, however, was a complete failure. It is difficult to make out precisely the utmost limit at which it arrived; it was not much beyond Resolution Island in Hudson's Strait; but, to use the words of a subsequent sagacious navigator, Luke Fox, \"Davis and Weymouth lighted Hudson into his Straits.\"\n\nOf Hall and Knight. In 1605, the King of Denmark sent out an expedition of discovery, in which two Englishmen, James Hall and John Knight, were employed. The ships proceeded along the west coast of Greenland, but reached no higher than about latitude 69\u00b0 55'; but received no tidings of Christian's Food, and Queen Anne's Cape; traded and quarrelled with the natives; left two malcontents among them, and returned to Elsinore.\n\nThis expedition was followed up by two others in the two following years, neither of which was productive of any discoveries; the first having advanced only to 66\u00b0 25' on the coast of Greenland, and the latter not farther than Cape Farewell.\n\nIn 1606, the merchants of London sent out the time, and the command of her given to Robert By-\nPolar Seas.\n\nlot, who took William Baffin as his mate. They visited Button's Islands, Savage Islands, and Mill Islands, and proceeded along the east coast of Southampton Island to Cape Comfort, in latitude 65\u00b0. From hence they returned to the southward, and reached England in the month of September.\n\nIn 1616, Bylot and Baffin again set out in the bark Discovery, in search of a north-west passage; and, following their instructions, proceeded up Davis Strait to Hope Saunderson, the extreme point of Davis's progress, being between 72\u00b0 and 73\u00b0 latitude, which they reached as early as the 30th May. A little to the northward was a group of islands, to which, finding females only, they gave the name of Women's Islands. From hence they stood northerly, between the ice and the land, passing in succession Horn Sound, Wolstenholm's Islands, Whale Sound, Sir Thomas Smith's Sound, in latitude 78\u00b0, and, at the northern extremity of what has since been called Baffin's Bay; and following the direction of the land, they passed, on the western shore, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALDERMAN\">Alderman</a> Jones's Sound, and lastly, Lancaster Sound; from whence the ice compelled them to leave the land, and they therefore shaped their course homewards. This last voyage of Baffin is the most important that had yet been made; and it is quite surprising that the discovery of so many immense openings which he calls sounds, for want of a better word, should not have been followed up, and that not one of them should have been examined until the recent expedition under that intelligent and enterprising officer Captain Parry.\n\nIn 1619, the Danes sent out an expedition under Jens Munck, who penetrated as high up on the coast of America as Chesterfield Inlet, which he named Munck's Winter Harbour, for he wintered in it, and all his people, except two, perished of cold, disease, and famine. Munck, and these two survivors, with great difficulty, fitted out the smaller of the two vessels, and reached Denmark, where they were considered as men risen from the dead. Munck is said to have received the indignity of a blow from the King, on which he took to his bed, and died of a broken heart; but there is an air of romance in the account of this voyage, which makes its authenticity doubtful.\n\nIn 1631, Captain Luke Fox, who quaintly calls himself the \"North-west Fox,\" prevailed on some merchants of London to procure from King Charles I. his countenance, and the loan of one of his ships, for attempting the discovery of a north-west passage. Fox was undoubtedly the most shrewd and intelligent of all former navigators; and if, when he reached what he calls Fox's Farthest, he had stood across to the westward, the probability is, that he would have got upon the northern coast of America, and succeeded in working his way into the Pacific, by the very route which Parry is now pursuing.\n\nIn the same year the merchants of Bristol fitted out the Maria of 70 tons, the command of which was given to Captain James. In proceeding up Hudson's Strait, somewhere about Resolution Island, he got his ship entangled in the ice; and from that spot to Charlton Island, at the bottom of Hudson's Bay, in latitude 52\u00b0, he details a series of disasters which never happened to any navigator before or since. Here he passed the winter, and returned the following year, without making the least progress in discovery.\n\nIn 1652, the King of Denmark again set forth an expedition under Captain Daniel, to explore the eastern coast of Greenland. He stood to the northward of Iceland, but he could not approach the land on account of the ice, but the mountains were visible at least 60 miles. The most northern cape seen was in 65\u00b0 30', to which he gave the name of Cape King Frederick. From this point to Cape Farewell the ice lay between him and the shore, which in no part he could approach within 20 miles; of course, no discovery was made by him.\n\nAfter the lapse of more than a century, a paper admitted into the Transactions of the Royal Society of London in 1675, tended to revive the attempt at a north-east passage in England. It contained an account of a Dutch ship fitted out by a company of merchants in Holland, having passed to the northeastward of Nova Zembla several hundred leagues, between the parallels of 70\u00b0 and 80\u00b0; and the sea in that direction was found to be perfectly open and free from ice. About the same time, it was reported that Spitzbergen had been circumnavigated, and that a Dutch ship had proceeded within one degree of the Pole. Upon the strength of these reports, Captain John Wood addressed a memorial to the king, assigning seven reasons and three arguments, for the existence of a north-east passage. Accordingly, two ships were fitted out under Captains Wood and Flaws; they left the Nore in May 1676; on the 22d June, had reached the latitude 75\u00b0 79', and on the 26th got sight of the west coast of Nova Zembla. Three days after this, Wood lost his ship among the ice, and after some perils and the loss of two men in reaching the shore, they were picked up by the other ship, and returned homewards without making the least discovery; when Wood published many peremptory and ill-founded reflections on former navigators, and now found out seven reasons and three arguments against the passage to the northeast.\n\nOf the voyages of Knight, Barlow, Vaughan, and Captain Scroggs, from the Hudson's Bay Company's settlements, along the eastern coast of America, little else need be said, than that they extended not the knowledge of that coast beyond Whale Point; but their observations on the strong tide flowing down the Welcome, induced a gentleman of the name of Dobbs to press the Board of Admiralty to appropriate a ship of the navy to make discoveries in this quarter. Two ships were accordingly fitted out, the Furnace bomb, and the Discovery pink, commanded by Captain Middleton and Mr William Moor. They left England in 1741, and wintered in Churchill River in latitude 58\u00b0 50'; remained there till the 1st July; proceeded northerly to the latitude 65\u00b0 23', and entered Wager River, which they examined in an imperfect manner. They then stood to the northward as far as Cape Hope, in latitude 66\u00b0 14', longitude 86\u00b0 28' W.; and, most unaccountably, abandoned all farther search, having\nseen, or fancied they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a>, \"a frozen strait\" between them and the point round which they had to proceed to the westward. Middleton had been an old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a> of the Hudson's Bay Company, who were supposed to be jealous of any discoveries in their neighbourhood, and averse from encouraging them; and he was accused of having taken a bribe from them to defeat the object of the expedition. The Lords of the Admiralty refused to approve of his proceedings, and to evince the feeling of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, an act was passed the very year after his return, offering a reward of L.20,000 to the person or persons, being subjects of his Majesty, who should discover a north-west passage through Hudson's Strait to the Pacific. Dobbs, turning these circumstances to the advantage of his favourite project, got up a large subscription, and in 1746, two other vessels were fitted out, and the command of them given to Captain William Moor and Captain Francis Smith. Their first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> was that of the Wager River, which was found to terminate in a broad rapid, beyond which were two unnavigable rivers. They then proceeded northerly, till they came to Captain Middleton's \"frozen strait,\" or opening into Repulse Bay, when a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> arose among the officers, whether they were authorized by their instructions to examine this bay! The fact appears to be, that the officers and men had no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> for the business, and were under no kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a>. Instead, therefore, of proceeding, they began to murmur, and although only the 7th August, they urged the lateness of the season, and wished to return home. After this nothing was done or even attempted; and Repulse Bay remains unexamined to this moment; and what we see laid down in the charts under that name is wholly gratuitous.\n\nNo farther attempts at either passage appear to have been made by any of the maritime nations for nearly thirty years. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONOURABLE\">Honourable</a> Daines Barrington having, in the year 1773, presented to the Royal Society a series of papers on the practicability of approaching the North Pole, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">President</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNCIL\">Council</a> of that Society made application to the First <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> of the Admiralty (then Lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDWICH\">Sandwich</a>) to send out a ship or ships, to try how far navigation might be practicable towards that quarter. The Racehorse and Carcass bombs were accordingly prepared, and the command given to Captain the Honourable Constantine Phipps and Captain Skiffington Lutwidge. They left the Nore on the 10th June, passed along the western coast of Spitzbergen, and advanced to latitude 80\u00b0 48', in sight of the Seven Islands; here they were beset in the ice on the 1st August, and on the 10th, after being forced through it by a north-east <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>, they proceeded to the southward, and arrived at the Nore on the 25th September.\n\nThe hopes of a north-west passage were not abandoned by this failure; but it was resolved to make the attempt by a different route to any that had yet been practised; that is to say, from the Pacific to the Atlantic. Captain Cook was selected for this enterprise, and two ships, the Resolution and Discovery, were fitted out for the purpose, the latter being commanded by Captain Clerke. An amended act was passed for granting the reward of L.20,000 for the discovery of \"any northern passage\" by sea, between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and also the reward of L.5000 to any ship which should approach the North Pole within one degree. Captain Cook left England in July 1776; entered Behring's Strait on the 9th August 1779; and on the 17th August, reached latitude 70\u00b0 41' N., and saw the highest point of America surrounded with ice; and, therefore, named by him Icy Cape, in latitude 70\u00b0 29', longitude 198\u00b0 20'. The main body of the ice drifting down towards the ships, and the weather becoming foggy, they stood to the southward; and, as the season was far advanced, Captain Cook determined to pass the winter at the Sandwich Islands, and to renew the attempt at an earlier period the following year. By his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, Captain Clerke became the commanding officer. That he should have failed in reaching as far north as Cook had done, is not at all surprising, after an absence of three years from home, and all hands, as is avowed, \"heartily sick of a navigation full of danger.\" A small vessel had been sent, in the year 1776, up Davis's Strait, under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">Lieutenant</a> Pickersgill, and the same vessel again in 1777, under Lieutenant Young, to render any assistance that might be required, in the event of Captain Cook's reaching Baffin's Bay; but neither of these officers made a progress beyond the 73rd degree of latitude.\n\nIn 1786 and 1787, the King of Denmark, at the suggestion of Bishop Egede, sent out an expedition under Captain (now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ADMIRAL\">Admiral</a>) Lowenorn, for the purpose of rediscovering the eastern coast of Greenland. This officer persevered for two years, but with no better success than his predecessors. They saw the coast at various points, as high as 66\u00b0 15', but could not approach it for the ice. No discovery, therefore, of importance resulted from this expedition.\n\nOn the part of England, all farther attempts appeared to be abandoned after the failure of Captain Cook. One gentleman, however, the late Alexander Dalrymple, Hydrographer to the Admiralty, considering that three points of the northern coast of America had been clearly established,\u2014Icy Cape by Cook; the north of the Copper Mine River, in 1772, by Hearne; and the mouth of Mackenzie River by the traveller whose name it bears, in 1789,\u2014which three points were supposed to be in or about the 70th parallel of latitude, and that they comprehended within them full two-thirds of the whole of that coast; and combining these discoveries with other circumstances, was decidedly of opinion that a north-west passage did exist, and that it was practicable. On the strength of this opinion, he prevailed on the governor of the Hudson's Bay Company to employ Mr Charles Duncan, a master in the navy, on the discovery. He left England for this purpose in 1790, to join a sloop of the name of the Churchill, then in Hudson's Bay; but he soon discovered that the crew were averse from the intended enterprise, and set up so systematic an opposition to proceeding upon it, that he deemed it prudent to leave them, and to return to England. The governors of the company expressed their regret; and to prove how\nmuch they were in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARNEST\">earnest</a>, fitted out a strong ship called the Beaver, and Mr Duncan set out a second time. He wintered in Churchill River, where he remained till the 15th July, and entered Chesterfield Inlet; his crew mutinied, encouraged by his first officer, who was a servant of the Hudson's Bay Company, and thus ended his second voyage.\n\nWe have said nothing of the Russian voyages along the northern coast of Asia. That no one person has performed the whole, either at once or by successive trials, is quite clear; but, with the single exception of one \"sacred promontory,\" called Cape Cevero Vostochnoi, between the Yenisei and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENA\">Lena</a>, the whole has been navigated by various persons at different times. In the years between 1734 and 1738, Lieutenants Moroviof, Malgyn, and Skurakof, succeeded in proceeding from Archangel to the Bay of Ob; and in the latter year, Offizin and Koskeleif proceeded from that bay to the mouth of the Yenisei. In 1795, Lieutenant Prontshisthef set out in the contrary direction from the Lena, but was stopped by the promontory above mentioned; though some affirm that he passed it, and reached as far as Tai-mura. From the Lena eastward to the Kowyma, the voyage has frequently been performed, and Shalau-roff, in 1671, succeeded in reaching the Shelatskoi Noas, but could not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> it; and the only instance of its having been passed is that of Deshner, as far back as the year 1648, who sailed from the Kowyma, through Behring's Strait, to Anadyr.\n\nThe immense distance by sea from Petersburgh to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KAMTSCHATKA\">Kamtschatka</a>, and the Russian settlements on the north-west coast of America, would render the discovery of a north-west passage of infinite importance to Russia. Impressed with the magnitude of this importance, an individual of that nation, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> Romanzoff, fitted out, at his own expense, a small vessel, named the Rurick, the command of which was given to Lieutenant Kotzebue. She left the Baltic in 1815, passed Cape Horn, and in 1817 entered a deep inlet on the eastern side of Behring's Strait, in which he passed the remaining part of the summer. He found no ice, neither in the strait nor the inlet, and saw nothing to prevent his proceeding up the American coast to Icy Cape but the lateness of the season; and therefore returned to the southward, with the intention of renewing the attempt the following year. An accident, however, which occurred on his second entrance of the strait, though <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> only, put an end to the expedition.\n\nThis voyage of Kotzebue would alone have been sufficient to stimulate England to attempt once more to accomplish the almost only interesting discovery in geography that remains to be made; but other circumstances were reported in the year 1817 which determined the Government to fit out two expeditions for northern discovery. A ship from Hamburgh, in the summer of that year, made the eastern coast of Greenland, which was supposed to have been shut up with ice for four centuries, in the 70th parallel of latitude, continued along it to the 80th degree, and stood along that parallel to the coast of Spitzbergen. For three years before this, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POST_OFFICE\"><a class=\"x</a>ref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POST\">post</a>-office packets, and other vessels crossing the Atlantic, had fallen in with very unusual quantities of ice floating to the Polar Seas southward. This breaking up of the ice was deemed favourable for the prosecution of northern discovery. For this purpose, two separate expeditions were put in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a>. One was intended to proceed by the North Pole, as the nearest route, and, if no interruption from land occurred, probably the most practicable, to Behring's Strait; the other, to attempt a passage by some of the openings leading out of Baffin's Bay. To each were assigned two ships. Those destined for the Polar passage were the Dorothea, of 370 tons, commanded by Captain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAVID\">David</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUCHAN\">Buchan</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRENT\">Trent</a>, of 250 tons, by Lieutenant John Franklin. Those for the north-west were the Isabella, of 382 tons, commanded by Captain John Ross, and the Alexander, of 252 tons, by Lieutenant William Edward Parry. The Polar expedition was rendered abortive by the disabling of the Dorothea in the ice; the other circumnavigated Baffin's Bay, and ascertained that the narrative of that able navigator whose name it bears is substantially true; and that the chart appended to the Voyage of the North-West Fox is, in fact, the chart of Baffin, and wonderfully correct for the time in which it was laid down. Not one, however, of the many great openings which appear in that chart, and were ascertained to exist, were examined; and the only one that was entered was abandoned in a most unaccountable manner, and on grounds which were at once suspected, and subsequently proved, to be utterly without foundation.\n\nAnother expedition was, therefore, immediately fitted out, consisting of two ships, the Hecla bomb and Liddon, and Griper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUN\">gun</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIG\">brig</a>, and the command of it given to Lieutenant Parry, Lieutenant Liddon being appointed to that of the Griper. They dropped down the river on the 4th May 1819; saw Cape Farewell on the 15th June; and by the 30th July had succeeded in crossing the ice of Baffin's Bay, and reaching the opening of Sir James Lancaster's Sound; just one month earlier than in the preceding year. To the examination of this sound Mr Parry was particularly directed by his instructions. In proceeding along it to the westward, he met with little obstruction from the ice (though he was evidently navigating through an archipelago of islands where it usually most abounds), until he came to the western extremity of what he calls Melville Island; the last that was visible on the northern side of the strait or passage through which he had proceeded. Beyond this he struggled in vain, till the 20th September, to get to the westward, when the severity of the weather made it prudent to look out for a secure spot to pass the winter; and after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> a canal through the ice upwards of two miles in length, tracked the two ships into Winter Harbour, the crews \"hauling the event with three loud and hearty cheers.\" The following year, when released from their icy prison, every effort was again made to pass the western extremity of Melville Island, but in vain; and, after many fruitless attempts, the ships returned to the eastward, and reached England in safety, bringing back every man who had embarked on the expedition, with the exception of one, who carried out with him an incurable complaint.\nThe farthest point reached by Lieutenant, now Captain, Parry in the Polar Sea, was latitude 74\u00b0 26' 25\" N. and longitude 113\u00b0 46' 43\" W.; a point of western longitude which, by an amended act of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a>, dividing the sum of L. 20,000 into a graduated scale, entitled the discoverers to L. 5000.\n\nOn their return to England, there was not an officer or man in the whole expedition that was not satisfied with the practicability of a western passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific; though in some other line of direction, either to the northward or the southward of the extensive group of islands among which they had been navigating. The Lords of the Admiralty appear to have entertained the same feelings, and accordingly gave directions for two bombs, the Fury and the Hecla, to be prepared for the prosecution of the discovery. To Captain Parry was given, as was justly due, the command of the expedition, and to Captain Lyon that of the Hecla. They left England in May 1821, and were last heard of high up in Hudson's Strait, in open water, and with a fair wind, on the 22d July, standing for the northeastern extremity of the coast of America; the intention being to keep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> along the northern coast of America, where, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, it is concluded a stream of water will be found between the land and the main body of the ice.\n\nThe sketch here given of the various attempts which have been made for the discovery of a North-West, a North-East, and a Polar passage, is purely historical. The results have been uniformly unsuccessful; but though they have failed in the main object, it must not be concluded that they have been useless. On the contrary, they have been the means of accumulating a stock of information of the highest importance in almost every department of science, so as to entitle those who, at the expense of every personal comfort, embarked in them, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> of mankind. From the present state of our knowledge, thus acquired, a very probable conjecture may now be formed of the practicability, or otherwise, of a navigation through some part of the Polar Sea.\n\nIn the first place, it has been distinctly ascertained that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> beings can winter with impunity to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> in the highest possible degree of cold which can exist in any part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-EARTH_S\"><a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>'s surface; for there is every reason, short of actual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a>, to believe, that the temperature of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a> on the Pole itself is not lower (perhaps not so low) than in the parallel of 75\u00b0, where Parry wintered; the spirit in the thermometer having there descended to 55\u00b0 below zero. So little, indeed, is a high parallel of latitude the sole cause of a decreased temperature, that, in 65\u00b0 N., ten degrees less than Parry's winter-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>, Lieutenant Franklin had the spirit in the tube down to 57\u00b0, two degrees lower than Parry. This officer, therefore, left England with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> that he should experience no injury, nor much inconvenience, from passing a second winter in the Polar Sea, if it should be found necessary.\n\nIn the second place, it has now been ascertained in what situations it would be a waste of time to look for a passage, and where the only remaining points are deserving of examination. That a communication, if not a practicable passage, does exist between the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans, through the medium of the Polar Sea, very little doubt can remain. The three known points of Icy Cape, Mackenzie's River, and Hearne River, go far to prove it; and the distance to which Parry proceeded to the westward, considerably beyond Hearne River, strengthens not a little this position.\n\nAnother ground for concluding that a communication exists between the two oceans is, the constant current which the old navigators, Button, Fox, Middleton, and others, observed to set down the Welcome, and which also, in a less degree, prevails in Baffin's Bay and Davis' Strait; together with the current which as constantly sets up Behring's Strait, as appears from the journals of Cook, Clerke, Glottof, and Kotzebue. The fact of this circumvolving current, which we have no doubt contributes to those permanent movements everywhere existing in the great oceans, has been called in question, because Captain Ross found it running as much one way as the other in Baffin's Bay. Captain Ross had no further knowledge of currents than of those which agitate the surface of the sea, and which are known to change with every wind. Superficial currents, however, are not here meant, but the uniform <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of that great body of water, which, in spite both of winds and superficial currents, and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a> of both, carry icebergs many hundred feet immersed below the surface, and bear them along the coast of America, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> opposition to the strongest and most extensive current that we know of, the Gulf Stream. How happens it, then, it may be asked, why none of these icebergs, so very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> met with in the Atlantic, ever come across to the coast of Norway, or Denmark, Scotland, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>, with the spray of the said currents, after reaching the banks of Newfoundland, and which brings with it so many other matters floating on the surface to these coasts? Or why do all the bottles which have been launched in Davis' Strait separate from the icebergs, and turn up on some of the above-mentioned coasts? Clearly, because there is a body of water acting on those parts of the icebergs under the surface (and which are at least thirty times the magnitude of the parts above the surface) in a contrary direction to that which is in motion above. This is so obvious as not to require another word on the subject. It is the icebergs only that are subject to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a>: the field-ice, which is influenced and drifted about according to the winds and the currents on the surface, gives no indication of the direction in which the great body of water is moved.\n\nIn the same manner, we may be satisfied of the constant rush of water from the Pacific through Behring's Strait into the Polar Sea, to supply the constant stream which flows down the Welcome into Hudson's Bay. It is this current which, according to the observations of Kotzebue and the naturalist Chamisso, brings the great quantity of driftwood into Behring's Strait and Kotzebue's Inlet. It is the same current by which, on the same authority, we are told, that the icebergs and fields of ice, which are formed and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> up in the sea of Kamt-\nschatka, \"do not drift, as in the Atlantic, to the south, but into the Strait to the north;\" and the strength of this set of the sea is stated to be from two and a half to three miles an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>, and that even in the teeth of a strong northerly wind. The conclusion drawn by M. Kotzebue is this, \"that the constant north-east direction of the current of Behring's Strait proves that the water meets with no opposition, and, consequently, that a passage must exist, though perhaps not adapted to navigation. Observations have long been made that the current in Baffin's Bay runs to the south; and thus no doubt can remain that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of water which flows into Behring's Strait takes its course round America, and returns through Baffin's Bay into the ocean. But we have still more direct and positive information. Two Russian ships doubled the Icy Cape in 1821, and proceeded some forty or fifty miles beyond the point reached by Captain Cook; and such was the strength of the current to the eastward, that it was with the utmost difficulty they could stem it on their return, which a want of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>, and of every requisite to pass the winter or encounter ice, compelled them to do; but they had no doubt whatever of a practicable passage.\n\nAn idea has heedlessly been started, that the superficial current in Baffin's Bay, and those which descend along the coast of Labrador, may be owing to the melting of the ice in summer; but if so, why does not the summer current at least descend through Behring's Strait instead of perpetually ascending it? But the supposition is altogether without foundation; for the quantity of ice destroyed above the surface will be replaced by very nearly the same quantity rising from below the surface; and, therefore, the water produced by the melting of the ice will merely supply the place of the latter, and not raise the surface of the sea above its usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a>, nor produce any current. Be it observed too, that, in the Arctic Regions, little or no increase of the ice is occasioned by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> or snow.\n\nAnother objection, equally frivolous, was made against a communication of the waters of Hudson's Bay and Behring's Strait, on the ground, that the continent of Asia overlapped and was united to America, making Behring's Strait to terminate in a great bay. That question, however, has been set at rest for ever, even with those who were disposed to doubt of the voyage of Deschreffe. The Russian government has recently employed several men of science to determine points of doubtful position on the northern coast of Siberia. In February 1821, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARON\">Baron</a> Wrangel, a distinguished officer in their service, left his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>-quarters on the Nishey Kolyma to determine, by astronomical observation, the position of Shelatskoi-noss, or the North-east Cape of Asia, which was found to be in latitude 70\u00b0 05' N., considerably lower than it is usually placed on the maps. He then proceeded over the ice directly north for 80 miles, without perceiving any other object than a boundless field of ice. The supposed continuation, therefore, of Asia to the eastward, may be considered an idle speculation.\n\nThese facts being established, it may be assumed that a communication does exist between the two oceans; and, from the low latitude of the three known points of the coast of America, it may be inferred that this communication is a navigable one. The question then is narrowed to the direction in which it is most probable a passage will be found: The north-eastern route may be given up, were it only for the great distance (just one half) of the whole circumference of the Polar Sea) that it would be necessary to navigate, more or less, among ice. The north-western, by keeping close along the coast of America, is now (1822) under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>; it is that which Captain Parry has judged to be the most feasible from the experience he had acquired along the western coast of Old Greenland, the shores of the western islands of Baffin's Bay, and the southern shores of the numerous islands between the entrance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARROW\">Barrow</a>'s Strait and the western extremity of Melville Island; in all of which places a navigable channel of water was found between the land and the ice. The same thing invariably happens along the western shore of Spitzbergen, and probably along the eastern coast of Old Greenland, when once fairly in with the land. It was proved, indeed, at Winter Harbour, with what extraordinary rapidity the radiated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of the land melted the ice on the return of summer; and as the coast of America is five degrees of latitude more southerly than Melville Island, the former has a full month more of summer than the latter. The only circumstance which militates against an uninterrupted open channel along that coast, is that of its being a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEE\">lee</a>-shore to the northerly winds, which appear to be the most prevailing in the Arctic Seas; though Parry found them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> generally either to the eastward or westward in the direction of the strait. It is not quite certain, however, though every appearance is favourable, that the north-eastern extremity of America terminates at the head of the Welcome, in or about what is called on the charts Repulse Bay; but there is no doubt, that the Regent's Inlet on the south side of Barrow's Strait leads down upon that coast.\n\nThe tract pursued on the late voyage through Barrow's Strait, and among the islands, must obviously be given up as hopeless. The north-westerly winds had wedged in such a mass of ice among the islands which never melts, as to render all attempts to penetrate it at the western opening of the funnel impracticable; but beyond this ice, Captain Parry had no doubt there was an open sea; as it was observed whenever the wind came to the eastward, that the whole body of the ice kept moving to the westward for several days together. And this open sea is probably not inaccessible from some other quarter. There is an opening on the northern side of Barrow's Strait in the meridian of 92\u00b0, which Captain Parry has named <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-WELLINGTON\">Wellington</a>'s Channel. This \"grand opening,\" as Parry calls it, was free from every particle of ice, as far as the eye could reach on a fine clear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, and apparently as open and navigable as any part of the Atlantic. This channel, therefore, in all probability, leads to an open sea to the northward of the archipelago of islands, which, there is every reason to believe, is\nconnected with Baffin's Bay by the great inlets known by the names of Smith's Sound and Alderman Jones's Sound.\n\nThe most important part of the question is, whether the great body of the Polar Sea is composed of water or land. The absence of icebergs in the long tract from Baffin's Bay to Melville Island, and in the seas around Spitzbergen, affords at least a strong presumption against the existence of high precipitous land rising out of a deep ocean, without which, no formation of these huge masses of ice, some of which are not far short of a thousand feet in height, can possibly take place. If, then, the Polar Sea should be free from land, it will, in all probability, be also sufficiently free of ice for the purposes of navigation; for, although it is not doubted that the deep and wide sea will freeze over, yet it is well known that, by the navigation of the water in these boisterous latitudes, the ice formed on the surface is soon broken up, heaped together, and drifted, with the wind to some shore or islands, where it becomes fixed, or floated so far down to the southward as to undergo a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a>. If this was not the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, and we were to suppose the whole surface of the Polar Sea to be once frozen over into one dense and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a> mass of ice, that mass must continue to increase from year to year, till that part of the ocean become one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> and immoveable body.\n\nOn the whole, then, we should say, that the probability of an open sea towards the North Pole rather predominates; it is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> which has been entertained since the days of Dr Hooke; and all the Greenland fishermen are impressed with this opinion.\n\nDr Brewster, in an ingenious and interesting paper on \"the Mean Temperature of the Globe,\" has shown, in a satisfactory manner, by comparing the results of the late expedition with those he had drawn from a preconceived theory, \"that the mean temperature of the North Pole of the globe will be about 11\u00b0,\" which, he says, is \"incomparably warmer than the regions in which Captain Parry spent the winter.\" The mean annual temperature of this spot, according to a series of accurate observations for twelve months, was actually 1\u00b0, 33' ; and on shore could not have been more than 1\u00b0 below zero.\n\nBut if the Polar Sea should be tolerably free from ice and islands, and it were possible to pass the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARRIER\">barrier</a> of ice which is usually jammed in between Spitzbergen and Old Greenland, and no doubt it is possible, in many years, as may also be the case on the eastern side of Spitzbergen in most years, the route by this way, and close to the Pole, being on a great circle, would be by far the shortest in point of distance, cutting off not less than the whole width of the Atlantic from the Shetland Islands to Cape Farewell. The accident that happened to Captain Buchan's ship is greatly to be regretted, as otherwise there was every prospect of much new information being obtained in this quarter, which is not likely to be acquired from private ships; for although the present graduated scale of rewards, which commence at the latitude 83\u00b0, would appear to encourage masters of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISHING\">fishing</a> ships to avail themselves of favourable openings, which frequently occur, to run for that latitude, we have little hope of a whale-fishing ship attempting it, and thereby perhaps running the risk of losing the short and precarious opportunity of accomplishing the main object of the voyage.\n\nThe whole surrounding coast of the North Polar Coast of the Sea is inhabited; the European part with Laplanders and Finns; the Asiatic shores with Osticks, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAMOYEDES\">Samoyedes</a>, Yuckagires, Tchutskies, and Koriacks, who derive their subsistence from the rein-deer and dried fish. The Tchutskoi bordering on Behring Strait are a superior kind of Eskimaux, and are no doubt the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> which extend along the northern coast of America, the shores and islands of Baffin's Bay, Davis and Hudson's Straits, and the coast of Labrador; and as high up on the coast of Old Greenland as latitude 78\u00b0, the highest habitable spot, in all probability, on the globe. All these people, distantly as they are removed from each other, speak the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, wear the same dress, subsist in the same manner, and in all their habits and appearance are precisely the same people. Spitzbergen has no permanent inhabitants, but English, Dutch, Danes, and Russians, have frequently wintered there; and even as high as 80\u00b0 N., many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HUNDREDS\">hundreds</a>, some say thousands, of graves, are met with in two or three particular spots where it was usual to extract the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> from the whale and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">marine</a> animals furnishing blubber. On Nova Zembla, the body of which is five or six degrees lower in latitude, no inhabitants are found, nor, with the exception of Barentz and his associates, have any been known to pass the winter even in the more southerly parts. Such, indeed, is the difference of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> on the same parallels, that while on the southern part of Nova Zembla, in latitude 69\u00b0, not a shrub is to be found, at Altengoord, in Norway, in latitude 70\u00b0, trees grow to a considerable size. Old Greenland, and the islands on the western shore of Baffin's Bay, of Davis Strait, and of Hudson's Bay, down to the 55th degree of latitude, are barren of trees and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHRUBS\">shrubs</a>; while, on the western side of America, as high up as the 60th and even 65th degree, the firs and birch grow to a considerable size. Even in the short distance which separates America from Asia across Behring's Strait, Kotzebue, in passing from the former to the latter, experienced a change like that of summer and winter; in the former all was verdure, in the latter, a complete surface of ice and snow. On the south side of Melville Island, in 75\u00b0 of latitude, the moment that the snow had departed, the ground was enamelled with a variety of brilliant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a>.\n\nNor are these dreary regions entirely destitute of Animals of animated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>. Rein-deer are met with on the northernmost part of Spitzbergen. The polar bear, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WOLF\">wolf</a>, the arctic fox, the polar hare, the ermine, the lemming or Hudson's Bay mouse, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MUSK\">musk</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a>, and the rein-deer, were all caught on Melville Island, the first six being perpetual residents, the two last migratory. Grouse, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PTARMIGAN\">ptarmigan</a>, plover, and a great variety of water-fowl, frequent in vast numbers the straits and islands of the arctic seas. The following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a>, drawn by the naturalist who accompanied Kotzebue, is correct and interesting: \"As, on the one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, in proportion as you advance farther on the land towards the north, the woods become less...\"\nProbable Mean Temperature of the Pole.\n\nShortest Route to Behring's Strait.\nPolar Seas. lofty, the vegetation gradually decreases, animals become scarcer, and lastly (as on Nova Zembla), the rein-deer and the glares vanish with the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a>, and only birds of prey prowl about the icy streams for their food: so, on the other hand, the sea becomes more and more peopled. The alg\u00e6, gigantic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of tang, form inundated woods round the rocky coasts, such as are not met with in the torrid zone. But the waters swarm with animal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>\u2014the medus\u00e6 and zoophytes, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOLLUSCA\">mollusca</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CRUSTACEA\">crustacea</a>, innumerable species of fish, in incredibly crowded shoals; the gigantic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWIMMING\">swimming</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAMMALIA\">mammalia</a>, whales, physeters, dolphins, morse, and seals, fill the sea and its shores, and countless flights of water-fowl rock themselves on the bosom of the ocean, and in the twilight resemble floating islands.\"\n\nSouth Polar Sea.\n\nOf the South Polar Sea little or nothing may be said to be known. Captain Cook, in the years 1773 and 1774, crossed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTARCTIC\">Antarctic</a> Circle in five places only\u2014in longitude 391\u00b0 E., where he advanced to latitude 67\u00b0, and met with fields and detached pieces of ice; in longitudes 101\u00b0 and 110\u00b0 W., between which he proceeded to latitude 71\u00b0 10' S., the farthest progress made by him towards the South Pole, where he was stopped, or at least deemed it prudent to return, on account of the fields and mountains of ice which were scattered over the surface of the sea; and in longitude 136\u00b0 and 148\u00b0 W., between which he descended to latitude 68\u00b0, and saw many floating ice islands. There are, therefore, still remaining about 340 degrees of longitude in which the Antarctic circle has not been crossed, and full half the circumference of the globe which has not been visited lower to the southward than the parallel of 60\u00b0 south latitude.\n\nThere can be little doubt of the existence of high land in the South Polar Sea, though Cook discovered none beyond the Southern Thule or Sandwich Land, on the parallel of 60\u00b0. Without high precipitous land, those large icebergs, which he met with floating among the fields of ice could not have been formed; the hummocks of ice, occasioned by the agitation of the sea and the meeting of the fields or flows in opposite directions, seldom rise to the height of twelve or fifteen feet above the surface. The Russians, indeed, on a recent voyage of discovery, are said to have fallen in with many islands about the 70th parallel of latitude; they also circumnavigated the Sandwich Land, which was left undetermined by Cook, and conjectured that it might be a part of the great Southern Continent, which occupied so much of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of geographers and philosophers of the last century. This idea was renewed by the recent discovery of a very considerable extent of land to the southward of Cape Horn, in latitude 65\u00b0, and seen extending from longitude 55\u00b0 to 65\u00b0 W. As the eastern extremity had not been seen, and the winding of the coast was to the N. E., it was conjectured that it might unite with the Southern Thule of Cook, and form the long sought for Southern Continent. It is said, however, that the Russians have also circumnavigated this land, and that it is composed of a great cluster of islands.\n\nThe land in question has been called South Shetland, but it is no new discovery. In the account of the voyage of The Five Ships of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROTTERDAM\">Rotterdam</a>, under the command of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JACOB\">Jacob</a> Mahu and Simon de Cordes, to the South Seas, in the year 1599, it is stated, that, on approaching the Strait of Magelhaens, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YACHT\">yacht</a>, commanded by Dirk Gherritz, was separated from all the other ships, and was carried by tempestuous weather to the south of the strait to 64\u00b0 S. latitude, where they discovered a high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, with mountains which were covered with snow, like the land of Norway. This land of Gherritz was marked on some of the old charts, but discontinued on the more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> ones, from the uncertainty of its position with regard to longitude. There can be no doubt of its identity with the modern South Shetland. It answered to the description of the mountains of Norway, covered with snow, and is wholly barren, having neither tree nor shrub of any kind. It is unnecessary to say, that it is uninhabited, there being no such people in the southern hemisphere as the Eskimaux; and it may be remarked, that no human beings are found in the Southern Ocean below the 55th parallel of latitude, and none beyond the 50th, except on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATAGONIA\">Patagonia</a> and Terra del <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUEGO\">Fuego</a>. On the shores, the seals and sea-horses, which had remained from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a> undisturbed, were so numerous, that on the first notice of the rediscovery, a whole fleet of vessels from England and North America crowded thither on speculation; but the loss of several, from tempestuous weather and dangerous navigation, and the destruction and alarm of the objects of their curiosity, will probably cause it, for some time at least, to remain as much a land of desolation as it had been before.\n\nSince the preceding article was written, the return of Captain Franklin has completely settled the geography of the mouth of the Copper Mine River, and between 500 and 600 miles to the eastward of it. The latitude of this river, which Hearne originally stated to be upwards of 72\u00b0 N., but which was afterwards reduced to 69\u00b0, is now determined to be 67\u00b0 48' N., and longitude 115\u00b0 30' W., which is five degrees more westerly than is usually laid down on the charts. One part of the coast, to the eastward of Hearne's River, was found to come down as low as the Arctic Circle, or 66\u00b0 30' N. Little or no ice was floating on the sea, which was deep and unobstructed, on which ships of any burden might freely navigate; and thus the theory, upon the strength of which Captain Parry is at present proceeding, is confirmed; and Captain Franklin has every reason to believe, that when once he gets upon the coast of North America, he will find no difficulty in making good his passage. Captain Franklin also found that the general current set to the eastward, as all the driftwood was found on the western sides of the jutting promontories. Nearly parallel to the coast, and at the distance of five or six miles from it, a range of numerous islands extended the whole length of the passage made by Captain Franklin.\nThe greater number of the subordinate parts of the science of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">Political</a> Economy have been treated, in various <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of this Supplement, with the fulness which their relative importance seemed to require. In the present article, therefore, we shall principally confine ourselves to an attempt to define the objects and limits of the science\u2014to trace its progress\u2014to exhibit and establish the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> principles on which it is founded\u2014and to point out the relation and dependence subsisting between its different parts. In doing this, we shall have occasion to examine the more prominent of the theories which have been advanced in this field of inquiry; our object being, not merely to lay before our readers what we conceive to be a true theory of the science, but also to present them with as full an exposition as our limits will allow of the particular doctrines advocated by the most celebrated of its professors.\n\nPart I.\u2014<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-DEFINITION\">Definition</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a>.\n\nDefinition of the Science\u2014Causes of its being neglected in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a> and Rome, and in the Middle Ages\u2014Species of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">Evidence</a> on which its Conclusions are founded\u2014Rise of the Science in Modern Europe\u2014Mercantile System\u2014Progress of Commercial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">Philosophy</a> in England in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries\u2014System of M. Quesnay and the French Economists\u2014Publication of the \"Wealth of Nations\"\u2014Distinction between Politics and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATISTICS\">Statistics</a> and Political Economy.\n\nPolitical Economy* is the science of the laws which regulate the production, distribution, and consumption of those material products which have exchangeable value, and which are either necessary, useful, or agreeable to man.\n\nThis definition has been framed so as to exclude all reference to such articles as exist independently of man, and of which unlimited quantities can be obtained without any degree of laborious exertion. Had such been the case with all the articles required to satisfy our wants, and to gratify our desires, this science would either have had no existence at all, or would have been cultivated only as a source of amusement, without any view to utility. Political Economy is exclusively conversant with objects which come within the observation of every man, and which are continually modified by human interference. It is, in fact, the science of values; and nothing which is not possessed of exchangeable value, or which will not be accepted as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> for something else, can come within the scope of its inquiries. It is obvious, however, that an article may be possessed of the highest degree of utility, or, as it is sometimes termed, of intrinsic worth, and yet be wholly destitute of exchangeable value. Without utility of some species or another, no article will ever be an object of demand; but how necessary soever any particular article may be to our comfort, or even existence, and however great the demand for it, still, if it be a spontaneous production of nature\u2014if it exists independently of human agency, and if every individual has an indefinite command over it, it can never become the subject of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a>, or afford a basis for the reasonings of the economist. It cannot justly be said, that the food with which we appease the cravings of hunger, or the clothes by which we defend ourselves from the inclemency of the weather, are more useful than atmospheric air; and yet they are possessed of that exchangeable value of which it is totally destitute. The reason is, that food and clothes are not, like air, gratuitous products: they cannot be had at all times, and without any exertion; they are obtainable only by labour; and as no one will voluntarily sacrifice the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> of his industry, without receiving an equivalent in return, they are truly said to possess exchangeable value.\n\nThe word value has, we are aware, been very generally employed to express, not only the exchangeable worth of a commodity, or its capacity of exchanging for other commodities, but also to express its utility, or its capacity of satisfying our wants, and of contributing to our comforts and enjoyments. But it is obvious, that the utility of commodities\u2014that the capacity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>, for example, to appease hunger, or of water to quench thirst\u2014is a totally different and distinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> from their capacity of exchanging for other commodities. Dr Smith perceived this difference, and showed the importance of carefully distinguishing between the utility, or as he expressed it, the \"value in use,\" of commodities, and their value in exchange. But he did not always keep this distinction in view, and it has been very generally lost sight of by M. Say, Mr Malthus, and other late writers. We have no doubt, indeed, that the confounding together of these opposite qualities has been one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> causes of the confusion and obscurity in which many branches of the science, not in themselves difficult, are still involved. When, for example, we say that water is highly valuable, we unquestionably attach a very different meaning to the phrase from what we attach to it when we say that gold is valuable. Water is indispensable to existence, and has, therefore, a high degree of utility, or of \"value in use;\" but as it can be generally ob-\n\n* Economy, from \u03bf\u1f36\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, and \u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2, a law\u2014the government of a family. Hence Political Economy may be said to be to the state what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> economy is to a single family.\ntained in large quantities, without much labour or exertion, it has, in most places, but a very low value in exchange. Gold, on the other hand, is of comparatively little utility; but as it exists only in limited quantities, and as a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of labour is necessary to procure a small supply of it, it has a high exchangeable value, and may be exchanged or bartered for a large quantity of most other commodities. To confound these different sorts of value would evidently <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> to the most erroneous conclusions. And hence, to avoid all chance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> from mistaking the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of so important a word as value, we shall never use it except to signify exchangeable worth, or value in exchange; and shall always use the word utility to express the power or capacity of an article to satisfy our wants, or gratify our desires.\n\nA few words will suffice to show the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> and importance of always distinguishing between the utility of a commodity and its value. If utility and value in exchange were identical, or if they were regulated by the same laws, it would necessarily follow, that the same circumstances which were calculated to increase the utility of any article would also increase its value, and vice versa. But the fact is distinctly and completely the reverse. The utility of a commodity is never increased by simply raising, but it is, in the great majority of instances, increased by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOWERING\">lowering</a>, its value. A deficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARVEST\">harvest</a> increases the exchangeable value of corn, but most certainly it does not increase its utility. If such an improvement were to take place in the manufacture of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-HATS\">hats</a> as would enable them to be produced for a half of the expense it now takes to bring them to market, their value, and consequently their price, would very soon be reduced a half also. Each individual would thus be able to buy two hats for the same sum it had formerly required to buy one; and while the utility of no single hat would be impaired by this fall of value, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> that the sphere of their utility would be greatly extended, and that they would be brought within the reach of a large proportion of those whose poverty might previously have rendered them unable to obtain them. In fact, the grand object of the science of Political Economy is to discover the means by which the value of commodities may be reduced to the lowest possible limits. For, the more their value is reduced, the more obtainable they become, and the greater, consequently, is the amount of the necessaries, conveniences, and luxuries at the disposal of every individual.\n\nPolitical Economy has been frequently defined to be \"the science which treats of the production, distribution, and consumption of wealth;\" and if by wealth be meant those material products which possess exchangeable value, and which are necessary, useful, or agreeable to man, the definition is quite unexceptionable. But the economists who have adopted this definition have attached a different, and a much too extensive meaning to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> wealth. They have sometimes, for example, considered wealth as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYNONYMOUS\">synonymous</a> with \"all that man desires as useful and agreeable to him.\" But if Political Economy were to embrace a discussion of the production and distribution of all that is useful and agreeable, it would include within itself every other science; and the best Encyclopaedia would really be the best treatise on Political Economy. Good health is useful and delightful, and, therefore, on this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>, the science of wealth ought to comprehend the science of medicine; civil and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> are highly useful, and, therefore, the science of wealth must comprehend the science of politics; good acting is agreeable, and, therefore, to be complete, the science of wealth must embrace a discussion of the principles of the histrionic art, and so on. Such definitions are obviously worse than useless. They can have no effect but to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATE\">generate</a> confused and perplexed notions respecting the objects and limits of the science, and to prevent the student ever acquiring a clear and distinct idea of the nature of the inquiries in which he is engaged.\n\nMr Malthus has defined wealth to consist of \"those material objects which are necessary, useful, and agreeable to man.\" (Principles of Political Economy, p. 28.) But this definition, though infinitely less objectionable than the preceding, is much too comprehensive to be used in Political Economy. Atmospheric air, and the heat of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, are both material products, and are highly useful and agreeable. But their independent existence, and their incapacity of appropriation, excludes them, as we have already shown, from the investigations of this science.\n\nDr Smith has not explicitly stated what was the precise meaning attached by him to the term wealth; but he most commonly describes it to be \"the annual produce of land and labour.\" Mr Malthus, however, has justly objected to this definition, that it refers to the sources of wealth, before we know what wealth is, and that it includes all the useless products of the earth, as well as those which are appropriated and enjoyed by man.\n\nThe definition we have given is not liable to any of these objections. By confining the science to a discussion of the laws regulating \"the production, distribution, and consumption of those material products which have exchangeable value, and which are either necessary, useful, or agreeable,\" we give to it a distinct and definite object. When thus properly restricted, the researches of the economist occupy a field which is exclusively his own. He runs no risk of wasting his time in inquiries which belong to other sciences, or in unprofitable investigations respecting the production and consumption of articles which cannot be appropriated, and which exist independently of human industry.\n\nCapacity of appropriation is indispensably necessary to constitute wealth. And we shall invariably employ this term to distinguish those products only which are obtained by the intervention of human labour, and which, consequently, can be appropriated by one individual, and consumed exclusively by him. A man is not said to be wealthy, because he has an indefinite command over atmospheric air, for this is a privilege which he enjoys in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> with every other man, and which can form no ground of distinction; but he is said to be wealthy, according to the degree in which he can afford to command those nec-\nsaries, conveniences, and luxuries which are not the gifts of nature, but the products of human industry. It must, however, be carefully observed, that, although the possession of value be thus necessary to the existence of wealth, they cannot be confounded together without leading to the most erroneous conclusions. Wealth and value are as widely different as utility and value. It is plain that every man will be able to command a much greater quantity of these necessaries and gratifications, of which wealth consists when their value declines, or when they become more easily obtainable, than when their value increases. Wealth and value vary in an inverse ratio. The one increases as the other diminishes, and diminishes as the other increases.\u2014Wealth is greatest where the facility of production is greatest, and value is greatest where the difficulty of production is greatest.\n\nThe science of Political Economy is exclusively conversant with that class of phenomena, which the exertion of human industry exhibits. Its object is to ascertain the means by which this industry may be rendered most productive of necessaries, comforts, luxuries, and enjoyments, or of wealth in the proper sense of the word; by which this wealth may be most advantageously distributed among the different classes of the society; and by which it may be most profitably consumed. To enter into a lengthened argument to prove the importance of a science having such objects in view, would be worse than useless. The consumption of wealth is indispensable to existence; but the eternal law of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">Providence</a> has decreed that wealth can only be procured by the intervention of industry\u2014that man must earn his bread by the sweat of his brow. This twofold necessity renders the production of wealth a constant and principal object of the exertions of the vast majority of the human race. It has subdued the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> aversion of man to labour, given <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> to indolence, and armed the patient hand of industry with zeal to undertake, and perseverance to overcome, the most difficult and disagreeable tasks. But when wealth is thus necessary, when the desire to acquire it is sufficient to induce us to submit to the greatest privations, it is plainly impossible to doubt the utility and paramount importance of the science which teaches the modes by which its acquisition may be facilitated, and by which we may be enabled to obtain the greatest amount of wealth with the least possible difficulty. There is no class of people to whom a knowledge of this science can be considered as either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTRINSIC\">extrinsic</a> or superfluous. There are some, doubtless, to whom it may be of more advantage than to others; but it is of the utmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> to all. The prosperity of individuals, and consequently of nations, does not depend nearly so much on salubrity of climate, or on the fertility and convenient situation of the soils they inhabit, as on the power possessed by them, of applying their labour with perseverance, skill, and judgment. Industry can <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> almost every other deficiency. It can render regions naturally inhospitable barren and unproductive, the comfortable abodes of an intelligent and refined, a crowded and wealthy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a>; but where it is wanting, the most precious gifts of nature are of no value, and countries possessed of the greatest capabilities of improvement, with difficulty furnish a miserable subsistence to the scanty population of hordes distinguished only by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a>, barbarism, and wretchedness.\n\nBut when the possession of wealth is thus necessary to individual existence and comfort, and to the advancement of nations in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAREER\">career</a> of civilization, it may justly excite our astonishment that so few efforts should have been made to discover its sources, and facilitate its acquisition, and that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of Political Economy, should not have been early considered as forming a principal part in a comprehensive system of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>. Two circumstances, to which we shall now briefly advert, seem to us to have been the principal causes of the neglect of this science. The first is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> of domestic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SLAVERY\">slavery</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> world; and the second the darkness of the period when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of education in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">universities</a> of modern Europe was first organized.\n\nThe citizens of Greece and Rome considered it degrading to employ themselves in those occupations which form the principal business of the inhabitants of modern Europe. In some of the Grecian states the citizens were prohibited from engaging in any species of manufacturing or commercial industry; and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a> and Rome, where such a prohibition did not exist, these employments were universally regarded as mean, mercenary, and unworthy of freemen, and were in consequence carried on exclusively by slaves, or the very dregs of the people.*\n\n* The force of the prejudices on this head may be learned from the following quotations: \"Illiberales autem et sordidi,\" Cicero says, \"questus mercenariorum, omniumque quorum <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPERA\">opera</a>, non quorum artes emuntur. Est enim illis ipsa merces auctoramentum servitutis. Sordidi etiam putandi, qui mercantur a mercatoribus quod statim vendant, nihil enim proficiscunt, nisi admodum mentiantur!\" Opificesque omnes in sordida arte versantur, nec enim quidquam ingenium possit habere officina \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Mercatura autem, si tenuis est, sordida putanda est; sin autem magna et copiosa, multa undique apportans, multisque sine vanitate impertiens, non est admodum vituperanda\" (De Officiis, Lib. I. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">sect</a>. 42.)\n\n\"Vulgaris opificum, qua manu constant, et <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-AD\">ad</a> instruendam vitam occupate sunt; in quibus nulla decoris, nulla honesti simulatio est.\" (Seneca Epistola, Ep. 89.)\n\nA hundred similar quotations might be produced; but the one we have given from Cicero is sufficient to establish the accuracy of what we have advanced. The strength of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> against <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> and the arts is proved by its exerting so powerful an influence over so cultivated a mind. For a further discussion\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">Agriculture</a> was treated with more respect. Some of the most distinguished <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> in the earlier ages of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROMAN_HISTORY\">Roman history</a> had been actively engaged in rural affairs; but, notwithstanding their example, in the flourishing period of the Republic, and under the Imperial Regime, the cultivation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> was almost entirely carried on by slaves, belonging to the landlord, and employed on his account. The mass of Roman citizens were either engaged in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> service, or derived a precarious and dependant subsistence from the supplies of corn furnished by the conquered provinces. In such a state of society the relations subsisting in modern Europe between landlords and tenants, and masters and servants, were unknown; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> were in consequence entire strangers to all those interesting and important questions arising out of the rise and fall of rents and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WAGES\">wages</a>, which form so important a branch of economical science. The spirit of the philosophy of the ancient world was also extremely unfavourable to the cultivation of Political Economy. The luxurious or more refined <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of living of the rich, was regarded by the ancient moralists as an evil of the first magnitude. They considered it as subversive of those warlike virtues, which were the principal objects of their admiration, and, in consequence, they denounced the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> for accumulating wealth as fraught with the most injurious and destructive consequences. It was impossible that Political Economy could become an object of attention, to men imbued with such prejudices; or that it could be studied by those who held the objects about which it is conversant in contempt, and who spurned that labour by which wealth is produced.\n\nAt the establishment of our universities, the clergy were almost the exclusive possessors of the little knowledge then in existence. It was natural, therefore, that their peculiar feelings and pursuits should have a marked influence on the plans of education they were employed to frame. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAMMAR\">Grammar</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHETORIC\">rhetoric</a>, logic, school <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CIVIL_LAW\">civil law</a>, comprised the whole course of study. To have appointed professors to explain the principles of commerce, and the means by which labour might be rendered most effective, would have been considered as equally superfluous and degrading to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> of science. The prejudices against commerce, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> in antiquity, had a powerful influence in the middle ages. None were possessed of any clear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> concerning the true sources of wealth, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>, and prosperity. The intercourse between the different countries was extremely limited, and was rather confined to marauding excursions, and a piratical scramble for the precious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a>, than to a commerce founded on the gratification of real or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECIPROCAL\">reciprocal</a> wants.\n\nThese circumstances sufficiently account for the slow progress of, and the little attention paid to this science up to a very recent period. And since it became an object of more general attention and liberal inquiry, the opposition between the theories and opinions that have been espoused by the most eminent of its professors,\u2014a necessary and inevitable result, as we shall immediately show, of its recent cultivation, has proved exceedingly unfavourable to its progress, and has generated a disposition to distrust its best established conclusions. This prejudice is, however, extremely ill-founded; and notwithstanding the diversity of the theories that have been formed to explain its various phenomena, Political Economy admits of as much certainty in its conclusions as any science not exclusively dependent on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> relation. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIEF\">brief</a> exposition of the nature of the principles on which it is founded, and of the mode in which its investigations ought to be conducted, will evince the correctness of this statement.\n\nPolitical Economy is not a science of speculation, but of fact and experiment. The principles on which the production and accumulation of wealth and the progress of civilization depend, are not the offspring of legislative enactments. Man must exert himself to produce wealth, because he cannot exist without it; and the desire implanted in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a> of every individual of rising in the world and improving his condition, impels him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> and accumulate. The principles which form the basis of this science make, therefore, a part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of man and of the physical world, and their operations, like those of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> principles, are to be traced by the aid of observation and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a>. There is, however, a material distinction between the physical and the moral and political sciences. The conclusions of the former apply in every case, while those of the latter only apply in the majority of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>. The principles on which the production and accumulation of wealth depend are inherent in our nature, but they do not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> precisely the same influence over the conduct of every individual; and the theorist must satisfy himself with framing his general rules so as to explain their operation in the majority of instances, leaving it to the sagacity of the observer to modify them so as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> individual cases. Thus it is an admitted principle in the science of Morals, as well as of Political Economy, that by far the largest proportion of the human race have a much clearer view of what is conducive to their own interests, than it is possible for any other man, or select number of men to have, and consequently that it is sound policy to allow every individual to follow the bent of his inclination, and to engage in any branch of industry he thinks proper. This is the general theorem; and it is one which is established on the most comprehensive experience. It is not, however, like the laws which regulate the motions of\n\nof the opinions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> on this subject, we refer our readers to the Dissertazione del Commercio de Romani of Mengotti, which received a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIZE\">prize</a> from the Academy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> in 1787, and to the Memoria Apologetica del Commercio de Romani of Torres, published at Venice in 1788.\n\n\"Rei militaris virtus praestat ceteris omnibus; h\u00e6c populo Romano, h\u00e6c huic urbi \u00e6ternam gloriam peperit.\"\u2014(Cicero pro Murena.)\nEvidence on the planetary system\u2014it will hold good in nineteen out of twenty instances, but the twentieth may be an exception. But it is not required of the economist that his theories should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUADRATURE\">quadrature</a> with the peculiar bias of the mind of a particular person. His conclusions are drawn from contemplating the principles which are found to determine the condition of mankind, as presented on the large scale of nations and empires. His business is with man in the aggregate\u2014with states, and not with families\u2014with the passions and propensities which actuate the great bulk of the human race, and not with those which are occasionally found to influence the conduct of a solitary individual.\n\nThis distinction should be kept constantly in view. Nothing is more common than to hear it objected to some of the best established truths in political and economical science, that they are at variance with certain facts, and that, therefore, they must be rejected. But these objections very often originate in an entire misapprehension of the nature of the science. It would be easy to produce a thousand instances of individuals who have been enriched by monopolies and restrictions, and even by robbery and plunder; though it would certainly be a little too much to conclude from thence that society could be enriched by such means! This, however, is the single consideration to which the political economist has to attend\u2014and, until it can be shown that monopolies and restrictions are not destructive of national wealth, and that what is gained by the monopolist is not lost by the public, he is justified in considering them injurious. To arrive at a well-founded conclusion in economical science, it is not enough to observe results in particular cases, or as they affect particular individuals; we must further inquire whether these results are constant and universally applicable\u2014whether the same circumstances which have given rise to them in one instance, would in every instance, and in every state of society, be productive of the same or similar results\u2014A theory which is inconsistent with an uniform and constant fact, must be erroneous; but the observance of a particular result at variance with our customary experience, and when we may not have had the means of discriminating the circumstances attending it, ought not to induce us hastily to modify or reject a principle which accounts satisfactorily for the greater number of appearances.\n\nThe example of the few arbitrary princes who have been equitable, humane, and generous, is not enough to overthrow the principle which teaches that it is the nature of irresponsible power to debauch and vitiate its possessors\u2014to render them haughty, cruel, and suspicious; nor is the example of those who, attentive only to present enjoyment, and careless of the future, lavish their fortunes in boisterous dissipation or vain expense, sufficient to invalidate the general conclusion, that the passion for accumulation is stronger and more powerful than the passion for expense. Had this not been the case, mankind could never have emerged from the condition of savages. The multiplied and stupendous improvements which have been made in different ages and nations\u2014the forests that have been cut down\u2014the marshes and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a> that have been drained and cultivated\u2014the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HARBOURS\">harbours</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a>, and bridges that have been constructed\u2014the cities and edifices that have been raised\u2014are all the fruit of a saving of income, and establish, in despite of a thousand individual instances of prodigality, the ascendancy and superior force of the accumulating principle.\n\nIt is from the want of attention to these considerations that much of the error and misapprehension with which the science of Political Economy has been, and still is infected, has arisen. Almost all the absurd theories and opinions which have successively appeared have been supported by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> to facts. But a knowledge of facts, without a knowledge of their mutual relation\u2014without being able to show why the one is a cause and the other an effect\u2014is, to use the illustration of M. Say, really no better than the indigested erudition of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALMANACK\">almanack</a> maker, and can afford no means of judging of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> or falsehood of a general principle.\n\nBut, although we are not to reject a received principle because of the apparent opposition of a few results, with the particular circumstances of which we are unacquainted, we can have no confidence in its solidity if it be not deduced from a very comprehensive and careful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDUCTION\">induction</a>. To arrive at a true knowledge of the laws regulating the production, distribution, and consumption of wealth, the economist must draw his materials from a very wide surface; he should study man in every different situation\u2014he should have recourse to the history of society, of arts, of commerce, and of civilization\u2014to the works of philosophers and travellers\u2014to every thing, in short, that can throw light on the causes which accelerate or retard the progress of civilization. He should observe the changes which have taken place in the fortunes and condition of the human race in different regions and ages of the world. He should trace the rise, progress, and decline of industry, and he should carefully discriminate the effect of different political <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a>, and the various circumstances wherein an advancing and declining society differ from each other. Such investigations, by disclosing the real causes of national opulence and refinement, and of poverty and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEGRADATION\">degradation</a>, furnish the economist with the means of giving a satisfactory solution of almost all the important problems in the science of wealth, and of devising a scheme of public administration calculated to ensure the continued advancement of the society in the career of improvement.\n\nIt must always be kept in mind that it is no part of the business of the economist to inquire into the means by which individual fortunes may have been increased or diminished, except to ascertain their general operation and effect. The public interests ought always to form the exclusive objects of his attention. He is not to frame systems, and devise schemes, for increasing the wealth and enjoyments of particular classes; but to apply himself to discover the sources of national wealth, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> prosperity, and the means by which they may be rendered most productive.\nWhen we reflect on the variety and extent of the previous knowledge requisite for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of a sound theory of Political Economy, we cease to feel any surprise at the errors into which economists have been betrayed, or at the discrepancy of the opinions which are still entertained on some important points. Political Economy is of very recent origin. Though various treatises of considerable merit had previously appeared on some of its separate parts, it was not treated as a whole, or in a scientific manner, until about the middle of last century. This circumstance is of itself enough to account for the number of erroneous systems that have since appeared. Instead of deducing their general conclusions from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of particular facts, and a careful examination of the phenomena attending the operation of different principles, and of the same principles in different circumstances, the first cultivators of almost every branch of science have begun by framing their theories on a very narrow and insecure basis. Nor is it really in their power to go to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> differently. Observations are scarcely ever made or particulars noted for their own sakes. It is not until they begin to be in request as furnishing the only test by which to ascertain the truth or falsehood of some popular theory, that they are made in sufficient numbers, and with sufficient accuracy. It is, in the peculiar phraseology of this science, the effectual demand of the theorist that regulates the production of the facts or raw materials, which he is afterwards to work into a system. The history of Political Economy strikingly exemplifies the truth of this remark. Being, as we have already observed, entirely unknown to the ancients, and but little attended to by our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a> up to a comparatively late period, those circumstances which would have enabled us to judge with the greatest precision of the wealth and civilization of the inhabitants of the most celebrated states of antiquity, and of Europe during the middle ages, have either been thought unworthy of the notice of the historian, or have been only very imperfectly and carelessly detailed. Those, therefore, who first began to trace the general principles of the science had but a comparatively limited and scanty experience on which to build their conclusions. Nor did they even avail themselves of the few historical facts with which they might have easily become acquainted, but almost exclusively confined their attention to those which happened to fall within the sphere of their own observation.\n\nAgreeably to what we have now stated, we find that the theories advanced by the early economical writers were formed on the most contracted basis, and were only fitted to explain a few of the most obvious and striking phenomena. The Mercantile Theory, for example, was entirely bottomed on the popular and prevalent opinions respecting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>. The precious metals having been long used, both as a standard whereby to ascertain the comparative value of different commodities, and as the equivalents for which they were most frequently exchanged, acquired a fictitious importance, not merely in the estimation of the vulgar, but in that of persons of the greatest discernment. The simple consideration that all buying and selling is really nothing more than the bartering of one commodity for another\u2014of a certain quantity of corn or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a>, for example, for a certain quantity of gold or silver, and vice versa, was entirely overlooked. The attention was gradually transferred from the money's worth to the money itself; and the wealth of individuals and of states came to be measured, not by the abundance of their disposable products\u2014by the quantity or value of the commodities with which they could afford to purchase the precious metals\u2014but by the quantity of these metals actually in their possession. It is on this flimsy and fallacious hypothesis that the theories of almost every writer on economical subjects antecedent to the appearance of the works of Child, North, and Locke, in England, and of Gournay and Quesnay, in France, are founded; and, what is of infinitely greater moment, it is on this same hypothesis that the different civilized countries have proceeded to regulate their intercourse with each other. Their grand object has not been to facilitate the production of the necessaries, comforts, and luxuries of life, but to monopolise the largest possible supply of gold and silver. And, as in countries destitute of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINES\">mines</a>, these could not be obtained except in exchange for exported commodities, various schemes were resorted to for encouraging <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPORTATION\">exportation</a>, and for preventing the importation of almost all products other than the precious metals. In consequence of this opinion, the excess of the value of the exports over the value of the imports was long considered as the most infallible test of the progress of a country in the career of wealth. This excess, it was believed, could not be balanced otherwise than by an equivalent importation of gold or silver; or of the only real wealth which it was then supposed a country could possess.\n\nThese principles and conclusions, though absolutely false and erroneous, afford a tolerable explanation of a few very obvious phenomena; and, what did more to recommend them, they are in perfect unison with the popular prejudices on the subject. It was natural, therefore, that they should be espoused by the merchants or practical men, who were the earliest writers on this science. They did not consider it necessary to subject the principles they assumed to any refined analysis or examination. But, reckoning them as sufficiently established by the common consent and agreement of mankind, they directed themselves exclusively to the discussion of the practical measures calculated to give them the greatest efficacy.\n\n\"Although a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>,\" says one of the earliest and ablest writers in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of the mercantile system, \"may be enriched by gifts received, or by purchase taken, from some other nations, yet these are things uncertain, and of small consideration, when they happen. The ordinary means, therefore, to increase our wealth and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURE\">treasure</a>, is by foreign trade, wherein we must ever observe this rule\u2014to sell more to strangers yearly than we consume of theirs in value.\" For, suppose, that when this kingdom is plentifully served with cloth,\nlead, tin, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, fish, and other native commodities; we do yearly export the surplus to foreign countries to the value of L.2,200,000, by which means we are enabled, beyond the seas, to buy and bring in foreign wares for our use and consumption to the value of L.2,000,000: By this order duly kept in our trading, we may rest assured that the kingdom shall be enriched yearly L.200,000, which must be brought to us as so much treasure; because that part of our stock which is not returned to us in wares, must necessarily be brought home in treasure.\"\n\n\u2014(Mun's Treasure by Foreign Trade, orig. ed. p. 11.)\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> on our foreign commerce is here supposed to consist exclusively of the gold and silver which, it is taken for granted, must necessarily be brought home in payment of the excess of exported commodities. Mr Mun lays no stress whatever on the circumstance of foreign commerce enabling us to obtain an infinite variety of useful and agreeable products, which it would either have been impossible for us to produce at all, or to produce so cheaply, at home. We are desired to consider all this accession of wealth\u2014all the vast addition made by commerce to the motives which stimulate, and to the comforts and enjoyments which reward the labour of the industrious, as nothing, and to fix our attention exclusively on the balance of L.200,000 of gold and silver! This is much the same as if we were desired to estimate the comfort and advantage derived from a suit of clothes, by the number and glare of the metal buttons by which they are fastened! And yet the rule for estimating the advantageousness of foreign commerce, which Mr Mun has here given, was long regarded by the generality of merchants and practical statesmen as infallible; and such is the inveteracy of ancient prejudices, that even now we are annually congratulated on the excess of our exports over our imports!\n\nBut there were other circumstances, besides the erroneous notions respecting the precious metals, which led to the formation of the mercantile system, and to the enacting of regulations restrictive of the freedom of industry. The feudal government established in the countries that had formed the western <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of the Roman Empire, degenerated into a system of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANARCHY\">anarchy</a> and lawless oppression. The princes, who were of themselves totally unable to restrain the usurpations of the greater barons, or to control their violence, endeavoured to strengthen their influence and consolidate their power, by attaching the inhabitants of cities and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> to their interests. For this purpose, they granted them charters, enfranchising the inhabitants, abolishing every existing mark of servitude, and forming them into corporations, or bodies politic, to be governed by a council and magistrates of their own selection. The order and good government that was thus established in the cities, and the security of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> enjoyed by their inhabitants, when the rest of the country was a prey to rapine and disorder, stimulated their industry, and gave them a vast ascendancy over the cultivators of the soil. It was from the cities that the princes derived the greater part of their supplies of money; and it was by their assistance and co-operation that they were enabled to control and subdue the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a> and independence of the barons. But the citizens did not render this assistance to their sovereigns merely by way of compensation for the original gift of their charters. They were continually soliciting and obtaining new privileges. And it was not to be expected that princes, so very deeply indebted to them, and by whom they must have been regarded as forming by far the most industrious and deserving portion of their subjects, should be at all disinclined to gratify their wishes. To enable them to obtain their provisions cheap, and to carry on their industry to the best advantage, the exportation of corn, and of the raw materials of their manufactures, was strictly prohibited; at the same time that heavy duties and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> prohibitions were interposed to prevent the importation of manufactured articles from abroad, and to secure the complete monopoly of the home market to the home manufacturers. These, together with the privilege granted to the citizens of corporate towns of preventing any individual from exercising any branch of business until he had obtained leave from them; and the variety of subordinate regulations intended to force the importation of the raw materials required in manufactures, and the exportation of the manufactured goods, form the principal features of the system of public economy adopted, with the view of encouraging manufacturing industry, in every country in Europe, in the fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth centuries. The freedom of industry recognised by their ancient laws was almost totally destroyed. It would be easy to mention a thousand instances of the excess to which this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> system was carried in England and other countries; but as many of these instances must be familiar to our readers, we shall only observe, as illustrative of its spirit, that by an act passed in 1678, for the encouragement of the English woollen manufacture, it was ordered that all dead bodies should be wrapped in a woollen shroud!\n\nBut the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCLUSION\">exclusion</a> of foreign competition, and the monopoly of the home-market, did not satisfy the manufacturers and merchants. Having obtained all the advantage they could from the public, they attempted to prey on each other. Such of them as possessed most influence, procured the privilege of carrying on particular branches of industry to the exclusion of every other individual. This abuse was carried to a most oppressive height in the reign of Elizabeth, who granted an infinite number of new patents. At length, the grievance became so intolerable, as to induce all classes to join in petitioning for its abolition, which, after much opposition on the part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CROWN\">Crown</a>, by whom the power of erecting monopolies was considered a very valuable branch of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREROGATIVE\">prerogative</a>, was effected by an act passed in the 21st of James I. But this act did not touch any of the fundamental principles of the mercantile or manufacturing system; and the exclusive privileges of all bodies-corporate were exempted from its operation.\n\nIn France the interests of the manufacturers were\nwarmly espoused by the justly celebrated M Colbert, minister of finances during the most splendid period of the reign of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> XIV.; and the year 1664, when the famous tariff, compiled under Colbert's direction, was first promulgated, has been sometimes considered, though improperly, as the real era of the manufacturing system.\n\nThese restrictions were zealously supported by the writers in defence of the mercantile system, and the balance of trade. The facilities given to the exportation of home manufactured goods, and the obstacles thrown in the way of their importation from abroad, seemed to them to be particularly well fitted for making the exports exceed the imports, and procuring a favourable balance. Instead, therefore, of regarding these regulations as the offspring of a selfish monopolizing spirit, they looked on them as having been dictated by the soundest policy. The manufacturing and mercantile systems were thus naturally blended together. The acquisition of a favourable balance of payments was the grand object to be accomplished; and heavy duties and restrictions on importations from abroad and bounties and premiums on exportation from home, were the means by which this object was to be attained! It cannot excite our surprise that a system having so many popular prejudices in its favour, and which afforded a plausible and convenient apology for the exclusive privileges enjoyed by the manufacturing and commercial classes, should have early attained, or that it should still preserve, notwithstanding the overthrow of its principles, a powerful practical influence. Melon and Forbonnais in France,\u2014Genovesi in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>,\u2014Mun, Sir Josiah Child, Dr Davenant, the authors of the British Merchant, and Sir James Stuart, in England\u2014are the ablest writers who have espoused, some with more and some with fewer exceptions, the leading principles of the mercantile system.\n\n\"It is no exaggeration to affirm, that there are very few political errors which have produced more mischief than the mercantile system. Armed with power, it has commanded and forbid where it should only have protected. The regulating mania which it has inspired has tormented industry in a thousand ways, to force it from its natural channels. It has made each particular nation regard the welfare of its neighbours as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a> with its own; hence the reciprocal desire of injuring and impoverishing each other; and hence that spirit of commercial rivalry which has been the immediate or remote cause of the greater number of modern wars. It is this system which has stimulated nations to employ force or cunning to extort commercial treaties, productive of no real advantage to themselves, from the weakness or ignorance of others. It has formed colonies that the mother country might enjoy the monopoly of their trade, and force them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a> exclusively to her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARKETS\">markets</a>. In short, where this system has been productive of the least injury, it has retarded the progress of national prosperity; everywhere else it has deluged the earth with blood, and has depopulated and ruined some of those countries whose power and opulence it was supposed it would carry to the highest pitch.\" (Storch, Trait\u00e9 d'Economie Politique, Tome I. p. 122.)\n\nThe greater attention which began to be paid, in Progress of the seventeenth, and in the earlier part of the last century, to subjects connected with finance, commerce, and agriculture, gradually prepared the way for the downfall of the mercantile system. The English writers preceded those of every other country, in pointing out its defects, and in discovering the real nature and functions of money, and the true principles of commerce. The establishment of a direct intercourse with India did much to accelerate the progress of sound opinions. The precious metals have always been one of the most advantageous articles of export to the East.* And when the East India Company was established in 1600, power was given them annually to export foreign gold coins or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BULLION\">bullion</a>, of the value of L. 30,000. The Company were, however, bound to import, within six months after the return of every voyage, except the first, as much gold and silver as should together be equal to the value of the silver exported by them. But the enemies of the Company contended, that these regulations were not complied with, and that it was contrary to all principle, and highly injurious to the public interests, to permit the exportation of any quantity of bullion. The merchants and others interested in the India trade, among whom we have to reckon Sir Dudley Digges, whose defence of the Company was published in 1615, Mr Mun, who published a very able pamphlet in defence of the Company in 1621,+ Mr Misselden, and more recently, Sir Josiah Child, could not controvert the reasoning of their opponents, without openly impugning some of the commonly received opinions regarding money. In such circumstances, it is easy to see, that prejudice would be forced to give way to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>. At first, however, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a> of the Company did not contend, nor is there, indeed, any good reason for thinking that they were of opinion that the exportation of gold or silver to the East Indies was beneficial on the single ground that the commodities brought back were of greater value. They contended, that the Company did not export a greater\n\n* Pliny, when enumerating the spices, silks, and other eastern products imported into Italy, says, \"Minimae computatione millies centena millia sestertium annis omnibus, India et <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERES\">Seres</a>, peninsulae illa (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARABIA\">Arabia</a>) imperia nostro demunt.\" (Hist. Nat. Lib. XII. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>. 18.)\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">Emperor</a> Charles V. used to say that the Portuguese, who then engrossed almost the whole commerce of the East, were the common enemies of Christendom, inasmuch as they drained it of its treasure to export it to infidels!\u2014(Misselden On Free Trade, p. 24.)\n\n\u2020 This pamphlet, which is now become extremely rare, is printed in Purchas's Pilgrims, Vol. I. p. 732.\nProgress of quantity of bullion than their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARTER\">charter</a> authorized them to do; and they further contended, that this exportation was advantageous, because the commodities imported from India were chiefly re-exported to other countries, from whence a greater quantity of bullion was obtained in exchange for them.* But even this was an immense advance in the progress to a sounder theory. C'est toujours le premier pas qui compte. The advocates of the Company began gradually to assume a higher tone; and at length boldly contended that bullion was nothing but a commodity, and that its exportation ought to be rendered as free as the exportation of any other commodity. Nor were these opinions confined to the partners of the East India Company. They were gradually communicated to others; and many eminent merchants were taught to look with suspicion on several of the received maxims, and were in consequence led to acquire more correct and comprehensive views regarding commercial intercourse. The new ideas ultimately made their way into the House of Commons; and in 1663, the statutes prohibiting the exportation of foreign <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COIN\">coin</a> and bullion were repealed, and full liberty given to the East India Company, and to private traders, to export the same in unlimited quantities.\n\nIn addition to the controversies respecting the East India trade, the discussions to which the foundation of the colonies in America and the West Indies, the establishment of a compulsory provision for the support of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>, and the acts prohibiting the exportation of wool, and the non-importation of Irish cattle, &c. gave rise, attracted an extraordinary portion of the public attention to questions connected with the domestic policy of the country. In the course of the seventeenth century, a more than usual number of tracts were published on commercial and economical subjects. And although the doctrines of the greater number of the writers are strongly tinctured with the prevailing spirit of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, it cannot be denied, that several of them have risen above the prejudices of their contemporaries, and have an unquestionable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to be regarded as the founders of the modern theory of commerce; as the earliest teachers of those sound and liberal doctrines, by which it has been shown, that the prosperity of states can never be promoted by restrictive regulations, or by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPRESSION\">depression</a> of their neighbours\u2014that the genuine spirit of commerce is inconsistent with the dark and shallow policy of monopoly\u2014and that the self-interest of mankind, not less than their duty, requires them to live in peace, and to cultivate friendship with each other.\n\nWe have already referred to Mr Mun's treatise, entitled England's Treasure by Foreign Trade. This treatise was first published in 1664; but there is good reason to suppose that it had been written many years previously. Mr Mun's son, in the dedication to Lord Southampton, prefixed by him to the work, says, that his father \"was, in his time, famous among merchants,\" a mode of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> which he would hardly have used, had not a considerable period elapsed since his father's death: and Mr Edward Misselden, in his Circle of Commerce, published in 1623, (p. 36), refers to Mr Mun's tract on the East India trade, and speaks of its author as being an accomplished and experienced merchant. Perhaps, therefore, we shall not be far wrong if we assume, that this treatise was written so early as 1633 or 1640. At all events, it is certain, that the doctrines which it contains do not differ much from those which he had previously maintained in his pamphlet in defence of the East India Company, and some of the expressions are literally the same with those in the petition presented by that body to Parliament in 1628, which is known to have been written by Mr Mun.\u2020 The extract we have previously given, shows that Mr Mun's opinions, in so far as regards the question respecting the balance of trade, were exactly the same with those of his contemporaries. But, we believe, he was the first who endeavoured to show, and who has, in point of fact, successfully shown, that a favourable balance could never be produced by restrictive regulations\u2014that the exportation and importation of bullion, coin, and every other commodity, should be freely permitted\u2014and that violent measures will never bring gold or silver into a kingdom, or retain them in it. (pp. 27, 92, &c. original ed.) Mr Mun also distinctly lays it down, \"that those who have wares cannot want money,\" and that \"it is not the keeping of our money in the kingdom, but the necessity and use of our wares in foreign countries, and our want of other commodities, that causeth the vent and consumption on all sides which causeth a quick and ample trade.\" (p. 43.)\u2021 Nor are these detached and incidental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> thrown out at random. They breathe the same spirit which pervades the rest of Mr Mun's book, and constitute and form a part of his system. His observations in answer to Malyne's, on some rather difficult questions connected with exchange, are both accurate and ingenious.\n\nThe first edition of Sir Josiah Child's celebrated work on trade (A New Discourse of Trade, &c.) was published in 1668; but it was very greatly enlarged in the next edition, published in 1690. There are many sound and liberal doctrines advanced in this book. The argument to show that colonies do not and cannot depopulate the mother country is as conclusive as if it had proceeded from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEN\">pen</a> of Mr\n\n---\n\n* Those who have not the original pamphlets may consult Macpherson's History of Commerce, Vol. II. pp. 297, 315, 511,\u2014Macpherson's Account of the European Commerce with India, pp. 94, 104,\u2014and Mr Robert <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANT\">Grant</a>'s Sketch of the History of the Company, p. 44, where they will find an ample <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> of what we have stated.\n\n\u2020 This petition, and the reasons on which it is founded, were so well esteemed, as to occasion its being reprinted in 1641.\n\n\u2021 These expressions are in the petition of the Company, presented to Parliament in 1628.\nProgress of Malthus; and the just and forcible reasoning in defense of the naturalization of the Jews is highly credible to the liberality and good sense of the writer, and discovers a mind greatly superior to the prejudices of the age. Sir Josiah has also many good and judicious observations on the bad effects of the laws against forestalling and regrating; on those limiting the number of apprentices; and on corporation privileges.\n\nWhen treating of the laws relating to the exportation of wool, Sir Josiah lays it down as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-AXIOM\">axiom</a>, \"That they that can give the best price for a commodity shall never fail to have it by one means or other, notwithstanding the opposition of any laws, or interposition of any power by sea or land; of such force, subtlety, and violence, is the general course of trade.\"\n\nThe radical defect of Sir Josiah Child's Treatise consists in the circumstance of its being chiefly written to illustrate the advantages, which he labours to show, would result from forcibly reducing the rate of interest to four per cent.; an error into which he had been led by mistaking the low interest of Holland for the principal cause of her wealth, when this low interest was in truth the effect of her comparatively heavy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-TAXATION\">taxation</a>.\n\nIt is, however, worthy of remark, that this error was very soon detected. In the same year (1668) that Sir Josiah's Treatise first appeared, a tract was published, entitled, Interest of Money mistaken, or a Treatise, proving that the Abatement of Interest is the Effect and not the Cause of the Riches of a Nation. The author of this tract maintains the same opinions that were afterwards held by Locke and Montesquieu, that the interest of money does not depend on statutory regulations, but that it varies according to the comparative opulence of a country; or rather according to the comparative scarcity and abundance of money\u2014increasing when the supply of money diminishes, and diminishing when it increases.*\n\nHaving endeavoured to establish this principle, the author of the tract successfully contends that Sir Josiah Child had totally mistaken the cause of the wealth of the Dutch, of which he shows the lowness of their interest was merely a consequence.\n\nIn 1672, Sir William Petty published his celebrated tract, entitled, the Political Anatomy of Ireland. In this work, the absurdity of the act passed in 1664, prohibiting the importation of cattle, beef, &c. from Ireland into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, is ably exposed, and the advantage of an unconstrained internal commerce clearly set forth. \"If it be good for England,\" says Sir William, \"to keep Ireland a distinct kingdom, why do not the predominant party in Parliament, suppose the western members, make England beyond Trent another kingdom, and take tolls and customs upon the borders? Or why was there ever any union between England and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a>? And why may not the entire kingdom of England be further cantonised for the advantage of all parties?\" (P. 34, ed. 1719.)\n\nThe great defect in the writings of Mun, Miseelden, Child, and others, did not really consist so much in their notions about the superior importance of the precious metals, or even the balance of trade, as in their notions respecting the superior advantages derived from the importation of durable, rather than of rapidly perishable commodities, and luxuries. This, however, was an extremely natural opinion; and we cannot be surprised that the earlier writers on commerce should not have avoided falling into an error, from which neither the profound sagacity of Locke, nor the strong sense of Mr Harris, have been able to preserve them. But even so early as 1677, the fallacy of this opinion had been perceived. In that year, there appeared a small tract, entitled, England's Great Happiness; or, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIALOGUE\">Dialogue</a> between Content and Complaint; in which the author contends, that the importation of wine, and other consumable commodities, for which there is a demand, in exchange for money, is advantageous; and, on this ground, defends the French trade, which was as loudly declaimed against by the practical men of that day as it is by those of the present. We shall make a short extract from this remarkable tract:\n\n\"Complaint.\u2014You speak plain; but what think you of the French trade? which draws away our money by wholesale. Mr Fortrey,\u2020 whom I have heard you speak well of, gives an account that they get L.1,600,000 a-year from us.\n\n\"Content.\u2014'Tis a great sum; but, perhaps, were it put to a vote in a wise Council, whether for that reason the trade should be left off, 'twould go in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a>. For paper, wine, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a>, Castile <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOAP\">soap</a>, brandy, olives, capers, prunes, kidskins, taffaties, and such like, we cannot be without; and for the rest, which you are pleased to style Apes and Peacocks (although wise <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLOMON\">Solomon</a> ranked them with gold and ivory), they set us all agog, and have increased among us many considerable trades. * * * I must confess, I had rather they'd use our goods than money; but if not, I WOULD NOT LOSE THE GETTING OF TEN FOUND BECAUSE I CAN'T GET AN HUNDRED; and I don't question but when the French get more foreign trade, they'll give more liberty to the bringing in foreign goods. I'll suppose John-a-Nokes to be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUTCHER\">butcher</a>,\n\n---\n\n* It has been generally supposed that Mr Hume was the first who showed (in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> on Interest) the fallacy of this opinion, and who proved that the rate of interest did not depend on the abundance or scarcity of money, but on the abundance or scarcity of disposable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> compared with the demands of the borrowers, and the rate of profit. This, however, is a mistake, the doctrine in question having been fully demonstrated in a pamphlet written by Mr Massie, entitled, Essay on the Governing Causes of the Natural Rate of Interest, published two years before Mr Hume's Essay appeared.\n\n\u2020 Mr Fortrey's pamphlet has been much referred to. It was published in 1663, and reprinted in 1673. It contains a very good argument in favour of inclosures. The reference in the text sufficiently explains the opinions of the writer in regard to commerce.\nProgress of Dick-a-Styles to be an Exchange man, yourself a Commercial lawyer, will you buy no meat or ribbands, or your wife Science in England, a fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOWN\">gown</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAN\">fan</a>, because they will not truck with you for indentures which they have need of? I suppose no; but if you get money enough of others, you care not though you give it away in specie for these things; I think 'tis the same case.\n\nThe general spirit of this tract may perhaps be better inferred from the titles of some of the dialogues. Among others, we have \"To export money our great advantage;\"\u2014\"The French trade a profitable trade;\"\u2014\"Variety of wares for all markets, a great advantage;\"\u2014\"High living, a great improvement to the arts;\"\u2014\"Invitation of foreign arts, a great advantage;\"\u2014\"Multitudes of traders, a great advantage,\" &c. &c. But its influence was far too feeble to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARREST\">arrest</a> the current of popular prejudice. In the year after its publication (1678) the importation of French commodities was prohibited for three years. This prohibition was made perpetual in the reign of William III. when the French trade was declared a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NUISANCE\">nuisance</a>!\u2014a principle, if we may so call it, which has been acted upon to this very hour.\n\nIn 1681, a pamphlet was published in defence of the East India Company, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIGNATURE\">signature</a> of \"Philopatris,\" but evidently the production of Sir Josiah Child. In the introduction to this pamphlet, the following general principles are laid down:\n\n\"That all close monopolies (Sir Josiah contends that the East India Company does not come under this description), of what nature or kind soever, are destructive to trade, and consequently obstructive to the increase of the value of our lands.\"\n\n\"That silver or gold, coined or uncoined, though they are used for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of all other things, are no less a commodity than wine, oil, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOBACCO\">tobacco</a>, cloth, or stuffs; and may, in many cases, be exported as much to the national advantage as any other commodity.\"\n\n\"That no nation ever was, or will be, considerable in trade, that prohibits the exportation of bullion.\" (p. 3.)\n\nIn Sir William Petty's Quantulumcunque, published in 1682, the subject of money is treated with great ability, and the idea of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-DRAINING\">draining</a> England of her cash, by an unfavourable balance, successfully combated. \"If some English merchants,\" it is said, \"should be so improvident as to carry out money only, then the foreign merchants would buy up such English commodities as they wanted with money brought into England from their respective countries, or with such commodities as England likes better than money; for the vending of English commodities doth not depend on anything else but the use and need which foreigners have of them.\" Sir W. denies that \"a country is the poorer for having less money;\" and concludes by strongly condemning the laws regulating the rate of interest; observing, that there may as well be laws to regulate the rate of exchange and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSURANCE\">insurance</a>. (See pp. 3, 6, 8, original edition.)\n\nBut a tract, entitled, Discourses on Trade, principally directed to the Cases of Interest, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COINAGE\">Coinage</a>, Clipping, and Increase of Money, written by Sir Dudley North, and published in 1691, unquestionably contains a far more able statement of the true principles of commerce than any that had then appeared.\n\nWe regret that our limits will not permit our giving so full an account as we could have wished of this extraordinary tract. The author is a most intelligent and consistent advocate of the great principles of commercial freedom. He is not, like the most eminent of his predecessors, well informed on one subject, and erroneous on another. He is throughout sound and liberal. His system is consistent in its parts, and complete. He shows, that in commercial matters, nations have the same interests as individuals; and exposes the absurdity of supposing, that any trade which is advantageous to the merchant can be injurious to the public. His opinions respecting the imposition of a seigniorage on the coinage of money, and the expediency of sumptuary laws, then in great favour, are equally enlightened.\n\nWe subjoin from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-PREFACE\">preface</a> to this tract an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> of the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a> maintained in it:\n\n\"THAT THE WHOLE WORLD AS TO TRADE IS BUT AS ONE NATION OR PEOPLE, AND THEREIN NATIONS ARE AS PERSONS.\"\n\n\"That the loss of a trade with one nation is not that only, separately considered, but so much of the trade of the world rescinded and lost, for all is combined together.\n\n\"THAT THERE CAN BE NO TRADE UNPROFITABLE TO THE PUBLIC; FOR IF ANY PROVE SO, MEN LEAVE IT OFF; AND WHEREVER THE TRADERS THRIVE, THE PUBLIC, OF WHICH THEY ARE A PART, THRIVE ALSO.\n\n\"That to force men to deal in any prescribed manner may profit such as happen to serve them; but the public gains not, because it is taking from one subject to give to another.\n\n\"That no laws can set prices in trade, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATES\">rates</a> of which must and will make themselves. But when such laws do happen to lay any hold, it is so much impediment to trade, and therefore prejudicial.\n\n\"That money is a merchandise, whereof there may be a glut, as well as a scarcity, and that even to an inconvenience.\n\n\"THAT A PEOPLE CANNOT WANT MONEY TO SERVE THE ORDINARY DEALING, AND MORE THAN ENOUGH THEY WILL NOT HAVE.\n\n\"That no man will be the richer for the making much money, nor have any part of it, but as he buys it for an equivalent price.\n\n\"That the free coynage is a perpetual motion found out, whereby to melt and coyn without ceasing, and so to feed goldsmiths and coyners at the public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a>.\n\n\"That debasing the coyn is defrauding one another, and to the public there is no sort of advantage from it; for that admits no character, or value, but intrinsick.\n\n\"That the sinking by alloy or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> is all one.\n\n\"That exchange and ready money are the same, nothing but carriage and re-carriage being saved.\n\n\"That money exported in trade is an increase to the wealth of the nation; but spent in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, and payments abroad, is so much impoverishment.\n\n\"In short, that ALL FAVOUR TO ONE TRADE, OR INTEREST, IS AN ABUSE, AND CUTS SO MUCH OF PROFIT FROM THE PUBLIC.\"\n\nUnluckily this admirable tract never obtained any considerable circulation. There is good reason, in-\nProgress of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEED\">deed</a>, to suppose that it was designedly suppressed.*\n\nAt all events, it speedily became excessively scarce; and we are not aware that it has ever been referred to by any subsequent writer on commerce.\n\nThe disordered state of the coin, and the proceedings relative to the great recoinage in the reign of William III., led to a great deal of discussion both in and out of Parliament, and contributed, in no ordinary degree, to diffuse juster notions respecting money and commerce. It was then that Mr Locke published his well known tracts on Money.\u2020 These tracts immediately obtained a very extensive circulation; and though infected with some very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a> errors, they had a powerful influence in preventing Mr Lowndes's proposal for degrading the standard of the coin from being carried into effect, and in contributing to establish the true theory of money. The restoration of the currency was not, however, effected without great opposition. A large minority in Parliament supported Mr Lowndes's views; and they were also supported by a number of writers. Of these, Mr Nicholas Barbon seems to have been one of the ablest. In his tract, entitled, *A Discourse concerning Coining the New Money <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">Lighter</a>*, published in 1696, he detected several of the errors into which Mr Locke had fallen; and he has the further merit of having ably demonstrated the fallacy of the popular opinions respecting the balance of trade; and of having shown, that no bullion could ever be sent abroad in payment of an unfavourable balance, unless it was at the time the cheapest and most profitable article of export.\n\nThe inferences deduced by Mr Barbon from his investigations into the balance of trade and foreign exchange are:\n\n\"That a trading nation is made rich by traffic and the industry of the inhabitants\u2014and that the native stock of a nation can never be wasted.\"\n\n\"That no sort of commodities ought to be totally prohibited\u2014and that the freer trade is, the better the nation will thrive.\"\n\n\"That the poverty and riches of a nation does not depend on a lesser or greater consumption of foreign trade, nor on the difference of the value of those goods that are consumed.\"\n\n\"That the balance of trade is a notion that serves rather to puzzle all debates of trade, than to discover any particular advantages a nation may get by regulating of trade.\"\n\n\"That the balance of trade (if there be one) is not the cause of sending away the money out of a nation: But that proceeds from the difference of the value of bullion in several countries, and from the profit that the merchant makes by sending it away more than by bills of exchange.\"\n\n\"That there is no occasion to send away money or bullion to pay bills of exchange, or balance accounts.\"\n\n\"That all sorts of goods, of the value of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BILL\">bill</a> of exchange, or the balance of the account, will answer the bill, and balance the account as well as money.\"\u2014(p. 59.)\n\nIt is singular, that a writer possessed of such sound and enlarged opinions respecting the principles of commercial intercourse, and who had shown that bullion differed in no respect from other commodities, should have maintained, that the value of coined money chiefly depended on the stamp affixed to it by government. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> and unaccountable error destroyed the effect of Mr Barbon's tract; and was, most probably, the cause of the oblivion into which it very soon fell, and of its never having attracted that attention to which it was on other accounts justly entitled.\n\nThe commercial writings of Dr Davenant, Inspector-General of Imports and Exports in the reign of Queen Anne, were published in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> between 1695 and 1711. Though a partisan of the mercantile system, Dr Davenant had emancipated himself from many of the prejudices of its more indiscriminate and zealous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUPPORTERS\">supporters</a>. He considers a watchful attention to the balance of trade, and its \"right government,\" as of the highest importance; but he does not consider wealth as consisting exclusively of gold or silver; or that prohibitions and restrictions should be rashly imposed, even on the intercourse with those countries with which the balance is supposed to be unfavourable. But we are far from thinking, that the commercial writings of Dr Davenant deserve the eulogies that have been bestowed on them; or that they had any material effect in accelerating the progress of sound commercial science. They do not, in fact, contain a single principle that is not to be found in the work of Sir Josiah Child. Some of Dr Davenant's paragraphs are exceedingly good; but the treatises of which they form a part are remarkably inconclusive, and are for the most part founded on narrow and contracted principles. There is no evidence to show that Dr Davenant was at all aware of the effect of commerce in facilitating the production of wealth, by enabling the inhabitants of each particular country to devote themselves, in preference, to those employments for the successful prosecution of which they have some natural advantage.\u2021\n\nIn 1734, Jacob Vanderlint, who describes him\u2014\n\n* See the Honourable Roger North's Life of his brother, the Honourable Sir Dudley North, p. 179.\n\n\u2020 Considerations on the Lowering of Interest and Raising the Value of Money, 1691. Further Considerations concerning Raising the Value of Money, 1695.\n\n\u2021 The progress of enlarged and liberal opinions with regard to commerce seem to have been in no small degree counteracted by the publication of the British Merchant. This work was written by some of the first merchants of their time, and was chiefly intended to expose the alleged defects in the commercial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a> with France negotiated by Queen Anne's Tory administration in 1713. It consists of a series of papers published weekly, and afterwards collected in three volumes. Public opinion being very much against the treaty, the British Merchant enjoyed a large share of popularity. Its authors appear to have\nProgress of self as a tradesman, published his tract, entitled, Money answers all Things. Mr Stewart has referred to this tract in the Appendix to his valuable Life of Dr Smith, and has quoted some passages, illustrative of the advantages of commercial freedom, which, he truly says, \"will bear a comparison, both in point of good sense and of liberality,\" with what was so ably urged by Mr Hume twenty years afterwards, in his Essay on the Jealousy of Trade.\" Vanderlint closes his pamphlet with an argument in favour of the substitution of a territorial tax in place of every other\u2014an idea borrowed from Locke, and subsequently adopted by the French economists.\n\nIn 1744,* Sir Matthew Decker, an extensive merchant, published his Essay on the Causes of the Decline of Foreign Trade. This essay has been frequently referred to by Dr Smith, and it deserves his notice. Sir Matthew is a most intelligent and decided enemy of all restrictions, monopolies, and prohibitions whatever. To give full freedom to industry\u2014he proposes that all corporation privileges should be abolished; and that all the existing taxes should be repealed, and replaced by a single tax laid on the consumers of luxuries, proportionally to their incomes. The following short extracts will give an idea of the spirit and ability which pervades Sir Matthew's work:\n\n\"In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> of De Witt, is said, 'that restraint is always hurtful to trade;' the reason whereof is plain; for nature has given various products to various countries, and thereby knit mankind in an intercourse to supply each other's wants. To attempt to sell our products, but to buy little or none from foreigners, is attempting an impossibility, acting contrary to the intent of nature, cynically, and absurdly; and, as ours is a populous manufacturing country, might be prejudicial to our interests; for, could we raise all necessaries and vanities within ourselves, this intercourse designed by nature would be destroyed; and then, how is our navy, our only bulwark, to be maintained?\" (p. 147.)\n\n\"Trade cannot, will not, be forced; let other nations prohibit, by what severity they please, interest will prevail; they may embarrass their own trade, but cannot hurt a nation, whose trade is free, so much as themselves. Spain has prohibited our woollens; but had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> of our taxes brought them to their natural value only, they would be the cheapest in Europe of their goodness, consequently must be more demanded by the Spaniards, be smuggled into their country in spite of their government, and sold at better prices; their people would be dearer clothed, with duties and prohibitions, than without, consequently must sell their oil, wine, and other commodities, dearer; whereby other nations, raising the like growths, would gain ground upon them, and their balance of trade grow less and less. But should we, for that reason, prohibit their commodities? By no means; for the dearer they grow, no more than what are just necessary will be used; their prohibition does Progress of their own business; some may be necessary for us; what are so, we should not make dearer to our own people; some may be proper to assert cargoes for other countries, and why should we prohibit our people that advantage? Why hurt ourselves to hurt the Spaniards? If we would retaliate effectually upon them for their ill-intent, handsome premiums given to our plantations to raise the same growths as Spain might enable them to supply us cheaper than the Spaniards could do, and establish a trade they could never recover. Premiums may gain trade, but prohibitions will destroy it.\" (p. 163.)\n\nSir Matthew applies the same argument to expose the absurdity and injurious effect of our restraints on the trade with France. \"I allow,\" he says, \"that Britain should be always vigilant over the designs of France, but need not be afraid of her power; her wise regulations in trade should be the objects we should keep our eyes upon, and out-do her if possible; or else, as she rises, we must sink. But it is our comfort, that our remedy is always in our own hands; nor can there be any solid reason for the nation's paying dearer to other countries for goods we could buy cheaper in France. Would any wise dealer in London buy goods of a Dutch shopkeeper for 15d. or 18d. when he could have the same from a French shopkeeper for 1s.? Would he not consider, that, by so doing, he would empty his own pockets the sooner, and that, in the end, he would greatly injure his own family by such whims? And shall this nation commit an absurdity that stares every private man in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a>? \u2014\u2014 The certain way to be secure is to be more powerful, that is, to extend our trade as far as it is capable of; and as restraints have proved its ruin, to reject them, and depend on freedom for our security; bidding defiance to the French, or any nation in Europe, that took umbrage at our exerting our natural advantages.\" (p. 184.)\n\nWe do not know that the impolicy of restrictions on the importation of foreign corn has ever been more ably and triumphantly exposed than in the following passage: \"Every home commodity, in a free trade, will find its natural value; for, though that fluctuates, as of necessity it must, according to the plentifulness or scarcity of seasons, yet, for the home consumption, every home commodity must have great advantage over the foreign, as being upon the spot, and free from freight, insurance, commission, and charges, which on the produce of lands, being all bulky commodities, must in general be about 15 per cent., and a greater advantage cannot be given without prejudice; for 15 per cent. makes a great difference in the price of necessaries between the nation selling and the nation buying, and is a great difficulty on the latter, but, arising from the natural course of things, cannot be helped; though it is a sufficient security to the landholder, that foreigners can never import more necessaries than are absolutely required;\n\nbeen thoroughly imbued with all the prejudices of the mercantile sect; and the work is now only deserving of notice as containing the fullest exposition of their peculiar doctrines.\n\n* We quote from the edition of the Essay published at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> in 1756. It appears from the work itself (p. 4), that it had been written in 1740; the first edition was in 4to.\nOf a work so well known as Mr Hume's *Political Essays* (published in 1752) it is almost superfluous to speak. The ability with which he has combated the prejudice against the French trade, and exposed the absurdity of the dread of being deprived of a sufficient supply of bullion; the liberality and expansion of his views respecting commerce in general; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> of his illustrations, cannot be too highly praised. It did not, however, enter into Mr Hume's plan to give a systematic view of the effects of commerce, nor has he instituted any analysis of the sources of wealth. Mr Harris has endeavoured to supply the latter deficiency; and his *Essay upon Money and Coins*, published in 1757, is, perhaps, on the whole, the best economical treatise that had appeared previously to the publication of the *Wealth of Nations*. We have already noticed Mr Harris's mistake of supposing that it was more profitable to import durable rather than rapidly consumable commodities; and, as a writer on commerce, he is undoubtedly very inferior to Sir Dudley North and Sir Matthew Decker. But the comprehensive and able manner in which he has treated the subject of money; the skill with which he has illustrated the effects of the division of labour in facilitating production and increasing wealth; and the near approach he has made to some of the fundamental doctrines of Dr Smith, if they do not give him a pre-eminence, certainly place him in the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> among his precursors.\n\nWe have been induced to treat of the progress of commercial science in England at considerable length, partly on account of the interest and importance of the subject, and partly because we Writers on Commerce are not acquainted with any work in which it has been investigated. M. Say and some other continental writers contend, that the Italians and French were the first who discovered and established the just principles of commercial intercourse. But the details we have now given prove the indisputable priority of the English. The economical works of Davanzati, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERRA\">Serra</a>, Turbolo, and Scaruffi, are almost wholly occupied with a discussion of the effects of a forced reduction of the standard of money. They deserve <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> for having opposed all tampering with the currency; but the arguments they employ to show its injustice and impolicy, are stated with much greater brevity and force in Sir Robert Cotton's speech in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-PRIVY_COUNCIL\">Privy Council</a> in 1626. The *Discursio Economico* of Bandini, the earliest writer on commerce whose works have been thought worthy of a place in the voluminous collection of Italian works on Political Economy, was published so late as 1737. Belloni and Algarotti's *Essays on Commerce*, both very inferior to the works of Sir Josiah Child or Sir Dudley North, were published, the former in 1750, and the latter in 1763.\n\nThe French have still less claim than the Italians to be considered the discoverers of the true principles of commerce. There is much accurate observation, and many just, patriotic, and striking observations on the injury France sustained from the want of a free internal traffic, and from the oppressiveness of taxation, in the *Dixme Royale* of the famous Marshal Vauban, written in 1698. But Vincent de Gournay, whom the French state to be one of the earliest of their authors, who entertained comprehensive and liberal notions regarding commerce in general, was born so late as 1712. M. Gournay published translations of the treatise of Sir Josiah Child, and of a tract of Sir Thomas Culpepper's, at Paris in 1752. So slow was the progress of economical science in France, that even Montesquieu has a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> entitled, \"A quelles nations il est d\u00e9savantageux de faire le commerce.\"\n\nBut neither the efforts of the English nor French System of the French Economists.\n\n---\n\n*Scrittori Classici Italiani di Economia Politica.* The publication of this collection of the works of her economical writers does <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> to Italy. It was begun in 1809 and finished in 1805, in 50 volumes, 8vo.\n\n\u2020 See Dupont's edition *Des Oeuvres de M. Turgot*, Tom. III. p. 311.\n\n\u2021 Maupertuis, in his *Eloge de Montesquieu*, candidly admits that France is indebted for the science of commerce, finance, and population, or of Political Economy, to England. The passage is curious: \"Comme le plan de Montesquieu,\" he observes, \"renfermoit tout ce qui peut \u00eatre utile au genre humain, il n'a pas oubli\u00e9 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CETTE\">cette</a> partie essentielle qui regarde le commerce, les finances, la population: Science si nouvelle parmi nous, qu'elle n'y a encore point de nom.\u2014C'est chez nos voisins qu'elle est n\u00e9e; et elle y demeura jusque \u00e0 ce que M. Melon lui fit passer le mer.\"\n\nMelon's work, *Essai Politique sur le Commerce*, was published in 1734.\u2014It is entirely founded on the principles of the mercantile system. Mr Bindon translated it into English, and published it, along with some rather valuable annotations and remarks, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUBLIN\">Dublin</a> in 1739.\n\nMelon had advocated the ruinous policy of raising the denomination of the coin. This gave occasion to the publication of a very acute work by Dutot, entitled, *Reflexions Politiques sur les Finances et le Commerce*, 2 Tomes, 12mo. 1738. Dutot's work was in its turn very ably criticised by Duverney, in his *Examen des R\u00e9flexions Politiques sur les Finances*, &c. 2 Tomes, 12mo. 1740. These works contain a great deal of very curious and interesting information respecting the French finances. Duverney's account of the famous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MISSISSIPPI\">Mississippi</a> Scheme is particularly good.\nwriters in favour of the freedom of commerce and industry had any considerable influence on the mercantile system. Their opinions respecting the nature of wealth, and of the causes of national opulence, being confused and contradictory, their arguments in favour of a liberal system of commerce had somewhat of an empirical appearance, and failed of making that impression which is always made by arguments founded on well-established principles, and shown to be consistent with experience. Mr Locke, as we shall hereafter show, unquestionably entertained very correct opinions respecting the paramount influence of labour in the production of wealth; but he did not prosecute his investigations with the view of elucidating the principles of this science, and made no reference to them in his subsequent writings. Mr Harris adopted Mr Locke's views, and deduced from them some practical inferences of great importance; but his general reasonings are merely introductory to his Treatise on Money, and are not illustrated with that fulness of detail, or in that comprehensive and systematic manner that is necessary in scientific works. The celebrated M. Quesnay, a physician, attached to the court of Louis XV., has the unquestionable merit of being the first who attempted to investigate and analyze the sources of wealth, with the intention of ascertaining the fundamental principles of Political Economy, and who gave it a systematic form, and raised it to the rank of a science. Quesnay's father was a small proprietor, and having been educated in the country, he was naturally inclined to regard agriculture with more than ordinary partiality. At an early period of his life he had been struck with its depressed state in France, and had set himself to discover the causes which had prevented its making that progress which the industry of the inhabitants, the fertility of the soil, and the excellence of the climate, seemed to insure. In the course of this inquiry, he speedily discovered that the prohibition of exporting corn to foreign countries, and the preference given by the regulations of Colbert to the manufacturing and commercial classes over the agriculturists, had been one of the most powerful obstacles to the progress and improvement of agriculture. But Quesnay did not satisfy himself with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> the injustice of this preference, and its pernicious consequences. His zeal for the interests of agriculture led him, not merely to place it on the same level with manufactures and commerce, but to raise it above them, by endeavouring to show that it was the only species of industry which contributed to increase the riches of a nation. Founding on the indisputable fact, that every thing which either ministers to our wants, or gratifies our desires, must be originally derived from the earth, Quesnay assumed as a self-evident truth, that the earth was the only source of wealth; and held that industry was altogether incapable of producing any new value, except when employed in agriculture, including therein <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FISHERIES\">fisheries</a> and mines.* His observation of the striking effects of the vegetative powers of nature, and his inability to explain the real origin and causes of rent, confirmed him in this opinion. The circumstance, that of all who are engaged in laborious undertakings, none but the cultivators of the soil paid rent for the use of natural agents, appeared to him an incontrovertible proof, that agriculture was the only species of industry which yielded a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">net</a> surplus (produit net) over and above the expenses of production. Quesnay allowed that manufacturers and merchants were highly useful; but, as they realised no net surplus in the shape of rent, he contended they did not add any greater value to the raw material of the commodities they manufactured or carried from place to place, than what was just equivalent to the value of the capital or stock consumed by them. These principles once established, it followed that landlords, farmers, and labourers employed in agriculture, were the only productive classes in a state; and that the labour of manufacturers and traders being unproductive, their means of subsistence, and their wealth, could only be derived from the agriculturists. It further followed, that the expenses of government, and the various public burdens, however imposed, must be defrayed out of the produit net, or rent of the landlords; and, consistently with this principle, Quesnay proposed that all the existing taxes should be repealed, and that a single tax (l'Imp\u00f4t unique), levied directly from the produce of the land, should be imposed in their stead.\n\nThe economical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> of M. Quesnay\u2014\u201cCette formule etonnante,\u201d says Dupont, \u201cqui peint la naissance, la distribution, et la <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-REPRODUCTION\">reproduction</a> des richesses, et qui sert \u00e0 calculer avec tant de suret\u00e9, de promptitude, et de pr\u00e9cision, l'effet de toutes les op\u00e9rations relatives aux richesses\u201d\u2014was first published at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSAILLES\">Versailles</a> in 1758.\n\nBut, however much impressed with the importance of agriculture over every other species of industry, Quesnay did not solicit for it any exclusive favour or protection. He successfully contended that the interests of the agriculturists, and of all the other classes, would be best promoted by establishing a system of perfect freedom. He showed that it could never be the interest of the proprietors and cultivators of the soil to fetter or discourage the industry of merchants, artificers, and manufacturers: for the greater liberty which they enjoyed, the greater would be their competition, and their products would, in consequence, be sold so much the cheaper. Neither, on the other hand, could it ever be the interest of the unproductive classes to harass and oppress the industry of the agriculturists, either by preventing the free exportation of their products, or by\n\n* \u201cCherchant d'o\u00f9 vient les richesses des nations, Quesnay trouva qu'elles ne naissent que des travaux dans lesquels la Nature et la Puissance Divine, concourent avec les efforts pour produire ou faire recueillir des productions nouvelles: de sorte qu'on ne peut attendre l'augmentation des ces richesses que de la culture, de la p\u00eache, et de l'exploitation des mines et des carri\u00e8res.\u201d (See the Notice sur les Economistes, by one of the most zealous of the sect, Dupont de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEMOURS\">Nemours</a>, in the \u0152uvres de Turgot, Tome III. p. 312.)\nany restrictive regulations whatsoever.

According to this \"liberal and generous system\" (Wealth of Nations, Vol. III. p. 17), the establishment of perfect liberty, perfect security, and perfect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, is the only, as it is the infallible, means of securing the highest degree of prosperity to all classes of the society.\n\n\"Ou a vu,\" says the Commentator of this system, M. Mercier de la Riviere, \"qu'il est de l'essence de l'ordre que l'int\u00e9r\u00eat particulier d'un seul ne puisse jamais \u00eatre s\u00e9par\u00e9 de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat commun de tous; nous en trouvons une preuve bien convaincante dans les effets que produit naturellement et n\u00e9cessairement la pl\u00e9nitude de la libert\u00e9 qui doit r\u00e9gner dans le commerce, pour ne point blesser la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. L'int\u00e9r\u00eat personnel encourag\u00e9 par cette grande libert\u00e9, presse vivement et perp\u00e9tuellement chaque homme en particulier, de perfectionner, de multiplier les choses dont il est vendeur; de grossir ainsi la masse des jouissances qu'il peut procurer aux autres hommes, afin de grossir, par ce moyen, la masse des jouissances que les autres hommes peuvent lui procurer en \u00e9change. Le monde alors va de lui m\u00eame; le d\u00e9sir de jouir, et la libert\u00e9 de jouir ne cessant de provoquer la multiplication des productions et l'accroissement de l'industrie, ils impriment \u00e0 toute la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, un mouvement qui devient une tendance perp\u00e9tuelle vers son meilleur \u00e9tat possible.\"\u2014(Tome II. p. 444.)\n\nWe shall have other opportunities of fully examining the principles of this theory. At present, it is sufficient to remark, that, in assuming agriculture to be the only source of wealth, because the matter of which all commodities are composed must be originally derived from the earth, M. Quesnay and his followers mistake altogether the nature of production, and really suppose wealth to consist of matter. But, in its natural state, matter is very rarely possessed of utility, and is always destitute of value. It is only by means of the labour bestowed in the appropriation of matter, and in fitting and preparing it for our use, that it acquires exchangeable value, and becomes wealth. Human industry does not produce wealth by making any additions to the matter of our globe; for this is a quantity susceptible neither of augmentation nor diminution. Its real effect is simply to produce wealth by giving utility to matter already in existence; and we shall hereafter show that the labour employed in manufactures and commerce is just as productive of utility, and consequently of wealth, as the labour employed in agriculture. Neither is the cultivation of the soil, as M. Quesnay supposed, the only species of industry which yields a surplus produce over the expenses of production. When none but the best soils are cultivated, and when, consequently, agriculture is most productive, no rent, or product net, is obtained from the land; and it is only after recourse has been had to poorer soils, and when the productive powers of the labour and capital employed in cultivation begin to diminish, that rent begins to appear. So that, instead of being a consequence\n\n* That M. Quesnay is entitled to the merit of originality cannot, we think, be disputed. It is certain, however, that he had been anticipated in several of his peculiar doctrines by some English writers of the previous century. The fundamental principles of the economical system are distinctly and clearly stated in a tract entitled Reasons for a limited Exportation of Wool, published in 1677. \"That it is of the greatest concern and interest of the nation,\" says the author of the tract, \"to preserve the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a>, gentry, and those to whom the land of the country belongs, at least, much greater than a few artificers employed in working the superfluity of our wool, or the merchants who gain by the exportation of our manufactures, is manifest\u20141. Because they are the masters and proprietaries of the foundation of all the wealth in this nation, all profit arising out of the ground which is theirs. 2. Because they bear all taxes and public burdens; which, in truth, are only born by those who buy, and sell not; all sellers, raising the price of their commodities, or abating of their goodness, according to their taxes.\"\u2014(Not being able to procure the pamphlet itself, we quote from the extract given in Mr Smith's Memoirs of Wool, Vol. I. p. 254.)\n\nIn 1696, Mr Asgill published a treatise entitled Several Assertions Proved, in order to Create Another Species of Money than Gold, in support of Dr Chamberlayne's proposition for a Land <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">Bank</a>. We extract from this treatise the following passage, breathing, as Mr Stewart has justly observed, the very spirit of Quesnay's philosophy:\n\n\"What we call commodities is nothing but land severed from the soil.\u2014Man deals in nothing but earth. The merchants are the factors of the world; to exchange one part of the earth for another. The king himself is fed by the labour of the ox; and the clothing of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> and victualling of the navy must all be paid for to the owner of the soil as the ultimate receiver. All things in the world are originally the produce of the ground, and there must all things be raised.\"\u2014(This passage has been quoted in Lord Lauderdale's Inquiry into the Nature and Origin of Public Wealth, 2d ed. p. 109.)\n\nThese passages are interesting, as exhibiting the first germs of the theory of the Economists. But there is no reason whatever to suppose that Quesnay was aware of the existence of either of the tracts referred to. The subjects treated in them were of too local a description to excite the attention of foreigners; and Quesnay was too candid to conceal his obligations to them, had he really owed them any. It is probable he may have seen Mr Locke's treatise on Raising the Value of Money, where the idea is thrown out that all taxes fall ultimately on the land. But there is an immeasurable difference between the suggestion of Locke and the well digested system of Quesnay.\nSystem of the superior productiveness of agricultural industry, rent is really a consequence of its being less productive! The opinion of M. Quesnay, that the labour of man derives no assistance from the productive powers of nature, except when employed in agriculture, is totally destitute of foundation; and, in a subsequent part of this article, we shall show that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANUFACTURER\">manufacturer</a> and merchant derive fully as much assistance from these powers as either the agriculturist, the fisher, or the miner.\n\nThough the theory of the French economists, considered in reference to the fundamental principles of the science, was equally erroneous with that to which it was opposed, its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a> and ingenuity, its systematic and consentaneous form, the liberal system of commercial intercourse which it recommended, and the benevolent and excellent character of its founder, speedily obtained for it a very high degree of reputation. The opinions of M. Quesnay were early communicated to, and zealously espoused by, his friends the Marquis de Mirabeau, M. Mercier de la Riviere, M. Dupont de Nemours, and others; and were afterwards advocated by Turgot, one of the most distinguished statesmen of whom France has to boast;* and by Letrosne, Condorcet, Raynal, and most of the succeeding French writers on commerce and finance. Their practical influence on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEGISLATION\">legislation</a> of the country has also been considerable. In 1763 the free transportation of corn from one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> to another was permitted; and in 1764 liberty was given to export it to foreign countries whenever the home price did not exceed 30 livres the septier (48s. the quarter). This last edict, after being suspended in 1770, was again revived in 1778 under the administration of Turgot. But the facility given to the imposition of the contribution fonciere, ought certainly to be considered as the greatest practical achievement of the labours of the economists; and there is but too much reason to fear it will long continue to afford a palpable demonstration of the fallacy of their doctrines.\u2020\n\nBut, notwithstanding the defects of their theory, there can be no question that the labours of the French economists contributed powerfully to accelerate the progress of economical science. In reasoning on subjects connected with national wealth, it was now found to be necessary to subject its sources, and the laws which regulate its production and distribution, to a more accurate and searching analysis. In the course of this examination, it was speedily ascertained that both the mercantile and economical theories were erroneous and defective; and that to establish the science of Political Economy on a firm foundation, it was necessary to take a much more extensive survey, and to seek for its principles, not in a few partial and distorted facts, or in metaphysical abstractions, but in the connection and relation subsisting among the various phenomena manifested in the progress of civilization. The Count di Verri, whose Meditations on Political Economy were published in 1771, demonstrated the fallacy of the opinions entertained by the French economists respecting the superior productiveness of the labour employed in agriculture; and showed that all the operations of industry really consist of modifications of matter already in existence.\u2021 But Verri\n\n---\n\n* Turgot's Reflexions sur la Formation, et la Distribution des Richesses published in 1771, is certainly the best of all the works founded on the principles of the economists; and is, in some respects, the best work on Political Economy published previously to the Wealth of Nations.\n\n\u2020 Exclusive of the Reflexions of Turgot, the following are the principal works published by the French Economists:\n\nTableau Economique, et Maximes Generales du Gouvernement Economique, par Francois Quesnay, 4to, Versailles, 1758.\n\nTheorie de l'Impot, par M. de Mirabeau, 4to, 1760.\n\nL'Ami des Hommes, par M. de Mirabeau, 7 Tomes, 1760, &c.\n\nElements de la Philosophie Rurale, par M. de Mirabeau, 3 Tomes, 12mo, 1763.\n\nL'Ordre Naturel et Essentiel des Societes Politiques, par Mercier de la Riviere, 4to, and 2 Tomes 12mo, 1767.\n\nSur l'Origine et Progres d'une Nouvelle Science, par Dupont de Nemours, 1767.\n\nLa Physiocratie, ou Constitution Naturelle du Gouvernement le plus avantageux aux genre humain, par Quesnay, 2 Tomes, 1767.\n\nLettres d'un Citoyen \u00e0 un Magistrat, sur les vingtiemes et les autres impots, par l'Abbe Baudouin, 1768.\n\n\u2021 Alcuni benemeriti scrittori, rattrattati dai gravi disordini, che soffrono i popoli per le gabelle, sono passati all'estremo de considerare ingiusto e mal collocato il tributo se non ripartito sui fondi di terra, e colla creazione di un linguaggio ascetico, hanno eretta la setta degli economisti, presso la quale ogni uomo che non adoperi l'aratro, e un essere sterile, e i manifattori si chiamano una classe sterile. Rispettando il molto di vero e di utile che da essi \u00e8 stato scritto, io non saprei associarmi <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALLA\">alla</a> loro opinione ne sul tributo, ne su di questa pretesa classe sterile. La riproduzione \u00e8 attribuibile alla manifattura ugualmente, quanto al lavoro di campi. Tutti i fenomeni dell'universo, sieno essi prodotti dalla mano dell'uomo o vero dalle universali leggi della fisica, non ci danno idea di attuale creazione, ma unicamente di una modificazione della materia. Accostare e separare sono gli unici elementi che l'ingegno umano ritrova analizzando l'idea della riproduzione; e tanto e riproduzione di valore e di ricchezza se la terra, l'aria, e l'acqua ne campi si trasmutino in grano, come se colla mano dello uomo il glutine di un insetto si trasmuti in velluto, o vero alcuni pezzetti di metallo si organizzino a formare una ripetizione. Degli intieri citta, e degli stati intieri campano non d'altr\u00f2 che sul prodotto di questa secondissima classe sterile, la di cui riproduzione comprende il valore della materia prima, la consumazione proporzionata delle mani impiegatevi, e di pi\u00f9 quella porzione\ndid not trace the consequences of this important principle; and, possessing no clear and definite notions of what constituted wealth, did not attempt to discover the means by which labour might be facilitated. He made several valuable additions to particular branches of the science, and had sufficient acuteness to detect the errors in the systems of others; but the task of constructing a better system in their stead required talents of a far higher order.\n\nAt length, in 1776, our illustrious countryman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADAM\">Adam</a> Smith published the *Wealth of Nations*\u2014a work which has done for Political Economy what the *Principia* of Newton did for Physics, and the *Esprit des Lois* of Montesquieu for Politics. In this work the science was, for the first time, treated in its fullest extent, and many of its fundamental principles placed beyond the reach of civil and dispute. In opposition to the French economists, Dr Smith showed, that labour is the only source of wealth, and that the desire inherent in the breast of every individual to improve his fortune and rise in the world is the cause of its accumulation. He next traced the means by which the powers of labour may be rendered most effective, and showed that it is productive of wealth when employed in manufactures and commerce, as well as when employed in the cultivation of the land. Having established these principles, Dr Smith showed, in opposition to the commonly received opinions of the merchants, politicians, and statesmen of his time, that wealth did not consist in the abundance of gold and silver, but in the abundance of the various necessaries, conveniences, and enjoyments of human life; he showed that individuals are always the best judges of what is for their own interest, and that, in prosecuting branches of industry advantageous to themselves, they necessarily prosecute such as are advantageous to the public.* From thence Dr Smith drew his grand inference, that every regulation intended to force industry into particular channels, or to determine the species of commercial intercourse to be carried on between different parts of the same country, or between distant and independent countries, is impolitic and pernicious\u2014injurious to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> of individuals\u2014and adverse to the progress of real opulence and lasting prosperity.\n\nThe fact that traces of most of these principles, and even that the distinct statement of many of those that are most important, may be found in the works of previous writers, does not in the least detract from the real merits of Dr Smith. In adopting the discoveries of others, he has made them his own; he has demonstrated the truth of principles on which his predecessors had, in most cases, stumbled by chance; has disentangled and separated them from the errors by which they were incumbered; has traced their remote consequences, and pointed out their limitations; has shown their practical importance and real value\u2014their mutual dependence and relation; and has reduced them into a consistent, harmonious, and magnificent system. We do not mean to say that Dr Smith has produced a perfect work. Undoubtedly there are errors, and those, too, of no slight importance, in the *Wealth of Nations*. The principles to which we have just referred, and which form the basis of the work, are unimpeachable; but Dr Smith has not always reasoned correctly from them, and he has occasionally introduced others, which a more careful observation and analysis has shown to be ill-founded. But, after every allowance has been made for these defects, enough still remains to justify us in considering Dr Smith as the real founder of the science. If he has not left us a perfect work, he has, at all events, left us one which contains a greater mass of useful and universally interesting truths than has ever been given to the world by any other individual; and he has pointed out and smoothed the route, by following which, subsequent philosophers have been enabled to perfect much that he had left incomplete, to rectify the mistakes into which he had fallen, and to make many new and important discoveries. Whether, indeed, we refer to the soundness of its leading doctrines, to the liberality and universal applicability of its practical conclusions, or to the powerful and beneficial influence it has had on the progress and perfection of economical science, and still more on the policy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESTINY\">destiny</a> of nations, Dr Smith's work must be placed in the foremost rank of those that have done most to liberalise, enlighten, and enrich mankind.\n\nThe practical part of the science of Political Economy was long confounded with that of Politics; and between it is undoubtedly true that they are very intimately connected, and that it is frequently impossible to treat those questions which strictly belong to the one without referring more or less to the principles and conclusions of the other. But, in their leading features, they are sufficiently distinct. The laws which regulate the production and distribution of wealth are the same in every country and stage of society. Those circumstances which are favourable or unfavourable to the increase of riches and population in a republic may equally exist, and will have\n\n---\n\n* It is of importance to observe, that Dr Smith does not say, that, in prosecuting such branches of industry as are most advantageous to themselves, individuals necessarily prosecute such as are at the same time most advantageous to the public. His leaning to the system of the Economists\u2014a leaning perceptible in every part of his work\u2014made him so far swerve from the principles of his own system, as to admit, that individual advantage was not always a true test of the public advantageousness of different employments. He considered agriculture, though not the only productive employment, the most productive of any. He also considered the home trade as more productive than a direct foreign trade, and the latter than the carrying trade. We shall hereafter show, that there is no foundation for these distinctions.\nexactly the same effects, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONARCHY\">monarchy</a>. That security of property, without which there can be no steady and continued exertion\u2014that freedom of engaging in every different branch of industry, so necessary to call the various powers and resources of human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a> and ingenuity into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>\u2014and that economy in the public expenditure, so conducive to the accumulation of national wealth\u2014are not the exclusive attributes of any particular species of government. If free states generally make the most rapid advances in wealth and population, it is an indirect rather than a direct consequence of their political constitution. It results more from the greater certainty which a popular government presents that the right of property will be held sacred\u2014that the freedom of industry will be less fettered and restricted,\u2014and that the public income will be more judiciously levied and expended, than from the circumstance of a greater proportion of the people being permitted to exercise political rights and privileges. Give the same securities to the subjects of an absolute monarch, and they will make the same advances. Industry does not require to be stimulated by extrinsic advantages. The additional comforts and enjoyments which it procures have always been found sufficient to ensure the more persevering and successful exertions. And whatever may have been the form of government, those countries have always advanced in the career of improvement, in which the public burdens have been moderate, the freedom of industry permitted, and every individual enabled peaceably to enjoy the fruits of his labour. It is not, therefore, so much on its political organization, as on the talents and spirit of its rulers, that the wealth of a country is principally dependent. Economy, moderation, and intelligence on the part of those in power, have frequently elevated absolute monarchies to a very high degree of opulence and prosperity; while, on the other hand, all the advantages derived from a more liberal system of government have not been able to preserve free states from being impoverished and exhausted by the extravagance, intolerance, and short-sighted policy of their rulers.\n\nThe sciences of Politics and of Political Economy are, therefore, sufficiently distinct. The politician examines the principles on which all government is founded, he endeavours to determine in whose hands the supreme authority may be most advantageously placed,\u2014and unfolds the reciprocal duties and obligations of the governing and governed portions of society. The political economist does not take so high a flight. It is not of the constitution of the government, but of its acts only, that he presumes to judge. Whatever measures affect the production or distribution of wealth, necessarily come within the scope of his observation, and are canvassed by him. He examines whether they are in unison with the just principles of economical science. If they are, he pronounces them to be advantageous, and shows the nature and extent of the benefits of which they will be productive; if they are not, he shows in what respect they are defective, and to what extent their operation will be injurious. But he does this without inquiring into the constitution of the government by which these measures have been adopted. The circumstance of their having emanated from the privy council of an arbitrary monarch, or the representative <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a> of a free state, though in other respects of supreme importance, cannot affect the immutable principles by which the economist is to form his opinion upon them.\n\nBesides being confounded with politics, the practical part of Political Economy has frequently been confounded with Statistics; but they are still more easily separated and distinguished. The object of the statistician is to describe the condition of a particular country at a particular period; while the object of the political economist is to discover the causes which have brought it into that condition, and the means by which its wealth and riches may be indefinitely increased. He is to the statistician what the physical astronomer is to the mere observer. He takes the facts furnished by the researches of the statistician, and after comparing them with those furnished by historians and travellers, he applies himself to discover their relation. By a patient induction\u2014by carefully observing the circumstances attending the operation of particular principles, he discovers the effects of which they are really productive, and how far they are liable to be modified by the operation of other principles. It is thus that the relation between rent and profit\u2014between profit and wages, and the various general laws which regulate and connect the apparently clashing, but really harmonious interests of every different order in society, have been discovered and established with all the certainty of demonstrative evidence.\n\nPART II.\u2014Production of Wealth.\n\nSect. I.\u2014Definition of Production\u2014Labour the only Source of Wealth.\n\nAll the operations of nature and of art are reducible to, and really consist of transmutations,\u2014of changes of form and of place. By production, in the science of Political Economy, we are not to understand the production of matter, for that is exclusively the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> of Omnipotence, but the production of utility, and consequently of exchangeable value, by appropriating and modifying matter already in existence, so as to fit it to satisfy our wants, and to contribute to our enjoyments. The labour which is thus employed is the only source of wealth.*\n\n* This point has been strongly and ably stated by M. Destutt Tracy\u2014\"Non-seulement,\" says he, \"nous ne cr\u00e9ons jamais rien, mais il nous est m\u00eame impossible de concevoir ce que c'est que cr\u00e9er ou ann\u00e9antir, si nous entendons rigoureusement par ces mots, faire quelque chose de rien, ou r\u00e9duire quelque chose \u00e0 rien; car nous n'avons jamais vu un \u00eatre quelconque sortir du n\u00e9ant ni y rentrer. De l\u00e0 cet axiome admis par toute l'antiquit\u00e9 : rien ne vient de rien, et ne peut redevenir rien. Que faisons-nous donc par notre travail, par notre action sur tous les \u00eatres qui nous entourent ? Jamais rien, qu'op\u00e9rer dans ces \u00eatres des changements\nLabour spontaneously furnishes the matter of which commodities are made; but, independently of labour, matter is rarely of any use whatever, and is never of any value. Place us on the banks of a river, or in an orchard, and we shall infallibly perish, either of thirst or hunger, if we do not, by an effort of industry, raise the water to our lips, or pluck the fruit from its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a> tree. It is seldom, however, that the mere appropriation of matter is sufficient. In the infinite majority of cases, labour is required not only to appropriate it, but also to convey it from place to place, and to give it that peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> and shape, without which it may be totally useless, and incapable of either ministering to our necessities or our comforts. The coal used in our fires is buried deep in the bowels of the earth, and is absolutely worthless until the labour of the miner has extracted it from the mine, and brought it into a situation where it can be made use of. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTAR\">mortar</a> of which our houses are built, and the rugged and shapeless materials from which the various articles of convenience and ornament with which they are furnished have been prepared, were, in their original state, alike destitute of value and utility. And of the innumerable variety of animal, vegetable, and mineral products which form the materials of our food and clothes, none were originally serviceable, and many were extremely noxious to man. It is his labour that has given them utility, that has subdued their bad qualities, and made them satisfy his wants, and minister to his comforts and enjoyments. \"Labour was the first price, the original purchase money that was paid for all things. It was not by gold or by silver, but by labour, that all the wealth of the world was originally purchased.\"\u2014(Wealth of Nations, Vol. I. p. 44. Svo edit.)\n\nIf we observe the progress, and trace the history of the human race in different countries and states of society, we shall find their comfort and happiness to have been always nearly proportioned to the power which they possessed of rendering their labour effective in appropriating the raw products of nature, and in fitting and adapting matter to their use. The savage, whose labour is confined to the gathering of wild fruits, or to the picking up of the shell fish on the sea coast, is placed at the very bottom of the scale of civilization, and is, in point of comfort, decidedly inferior to many of the lower animals. The first step in the progress of society is made when man learns to hunt wild animals, to feed himself with their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>, and to clothe himself with their skins. But labour, when confined to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHASE\">chase</a>, is extremely barren and unproductive. Tribes of hunters, like beasts of prey, whom they are justly said to resemble closely in their habits and modes of subsistence, are but thinly scattered over the surface of the country which they occupy; and notwithstanding the fewness of their numbers, any unusual deficiency in the supply of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAME\">game</a> never fails to reduce them to the extremity of want. The second step in the progress of society is made when the tribes of hunters and fishers apply their labour, like the ancient Scythians and modern Tartars, to the domestication of wild animals and the rearing of flocks. Their subsistence is much less precarious than that of hunters, but they are almost entirely destitute of all those comforts and elegancies which give to civilized life its chief value. The third and most decisive step in the progress of civilization\u2014in the great art of producing the necessaries and conveniences of life\u2014is made when the wandering tribes of hunters and shepherds renounce their migratory habits, and become agriculturists and manufacturers. It is then, properly speaking, that man, shaking off that indolence which is natural to him, begins fully to avail himself of the productive powers of industry. He then becomes laborious, and, by a necessary consequence, his wants are then, for the first time, fully supplied, and he acquires an extensive command over the articles necessary to his comfort as well as his subsistence.\n\nHowever paradoxical the assertion may at first sight appear, it is, notwithstanding, unquestionably true that the earth does not gratuitously supply us with a single atom of wealth. It is a powerful machine given by Providence to man; but without labour this machine would be altogether useless, and would forever stand idle and unemployed. It is to labour that the products of the earth owe their value, and it is by its intervention that they become useful. The surface of the earth is, in its natural state, covered with fruits and game; its bowels contain an infinite variety of mineral products; its seas and rivers are stored with fish, and it is endowed with inexhaustible vegetative and productive powers; but all these powers and products are plainly of no use whatever, and have no value, until the labour of man has called the former into action, and appropriated the latter, and given them that peculiar form which is required to fit them to support his existence, or to increase his enjoyments.\n\nThe importance of labour in the production of wealth was very clearly perceived both by Hobbes and Locke. At the commencement of the 24th chapter (entitled, \"Of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NUTRITION\">Nutrition</a> and Procreation of a Commonwealth\") of the Leviathan, published in 1651, Hobbes says, \"The nutrition of a commonwealth consisteth in the plenty and distribution of materials conducing to life.\n\n\"As for the plenty of matter, it is a thing limited by nature to those commodities which, from (the two breasts of our common mother) land and sea, God usually either freely giveth, or for labour selleth to mankind.\n\n\"For the matter of this nutriment, consisting in animals, vegetables, minerals, God hath freely laid\n\nde forme ou de lieu qui les approprient \u00e0 notre usage, qui les rendent utiles \u00e0 la satisfaction de nos besoins. Voil\u00e0 ce que nous devons entendre par produire; c'est donner aux choses une utilit\u00e9 qu'elles n'avaient pas. Quel que soit notre travail, s'il n'en r\u00e9sulte point d'utilit\u00e9, il est infructueux; s'il en r\u00e9sulte, il est productif.\"\u2014(Elements d'Ideologie, Tome III. p. 162.)\nLabour the them before us, in or near to the face of the earth; so as there needeth no more but the labour and industry of receiving them. Insomuch that plenty dependeth (next to God's favour) on the labour and industry of man.\"\n\nBut Mr Locke had a much clearer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> of this doctrine. In his Essay on Civil Government, published in 1689, he has entered into a lengthened, discriminating, and able analysis to show that it is from labour that the products of the earth derive almost all their value. \"Let any one consider,\" says he, \"what the difference is between an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACRE\">acre</a> of land planted with tobacco or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>, sown with wheat or barley, and an acre of the same land lying in common, without any husbandry upon it, and he will find that the improvement of labour makes the far greater part of the value. I think it will be but a very modest computation to say, that of the products of the earth useful to the life of man, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a>-tenths are the effects of labour; nay, if we will rightly consider things as they come to our use, and cast up the several expences about them, what in them is purely owing to nature, and what to labour, we shall find, that in most of them ninety-nine hundredths are wholly to be put on the account of labour.\n\n\"There cannot be a clearer demonstration of any thing, than several nations of the Americans are of this, who are rich in land, and poor in all the comforts of life; whom nature having furnished as liberally as any other people with the materials of plenty; i.e. a fruitful soil apt to produce in abundance what might serve for food, raiment, and delight; yet for want of improving it by labour, have not one hundredth part of the conveniencies we enjoy; and the king of a large and fruitful territory there feeds, lodges, and is worse clad than a day-labourer in England.\n\n\"To make this a little clear, let us but trace some of the ordinary provisions of life through their several progresses, before they come to our use, and see how much of their value they receive from human industry. Bread, wine, and cloth, are things of daily use, and great plenty; yet notwithstanding, acorns, water, and leaves, or skins, must be our bread, drink, and clothing, did not labour furnish us with these more useful commodities; for whatever bread is more worth than acorns, wine than water, and cloth or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a> than leaves, skins, or moss, that is solely owing to labour and industry; the one of these being the food and raiment which unassisted nature furnishes us with; the other provisions which our industry and pains prepare for us; which how much they exceed the other in value, when any one hath computed, he will then see how much labour makes the far greatest part of the value of things we enjoy in this world; and the ground which produces the only materials is scarce to be reckoned on as any, or, at most, but a very small part of it.\n\n\"An acre of land that bears here twenty bushels of wheat, and another in America, which, with the same husbandry, would do the like, are, without doubt, of the same natural intrinsic value. But yet, the benefit mankind receives from the one in a year is worth L. 5, and from the other possibly not worth one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PENNY\">penny</a>; if all the profit an Indian received from it were to be valued and sold here, at least, I may truly say, not 1000.\" 'Tis labour, then, which puts the greatest part of value upon land, without which it would scarcely be worth any thing: 'Tis to that we owe the greatest part of its useful products; for all that the straw, bran, bread of that acre of wheat, is more worth than the product of an acre of good land, which lies waste, is all the effect of labour. For 'tis not merely the ploughman's pains, the reaper's and thrasher's toil, and the baker's sweat, is to be counted into the bread we eat, the labour of those who broke the oxen, who digged and wrought the iron and stones, who fitted and framed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a> employed about the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLOUGH\">plough</a>, mill, oven, or any other utensils, which are a vast number, requisite to this corn, from its being seed to be sown, to its being made bread, must all be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> on the account of labour, and received as an effect of that. Nature and the earth furnishing only the almost worthless materials as in themselves.\u2014'Twould be a strange catalogue of things that industry provided and made use of about every loaf of bread, before it came to our use, if we could trace them. Iron, wood, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a>, barks, timber, stone, brick, coals, lime, cloth, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DYEING\">dyeing</a>-drugs, pitch, tar, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASTS\">masts</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROPES\">ropes</a>, and all the materials made use of in the ship that brought away the commodities made use of by any of the workmen, to any part of the work; all which, it would be almost impossible, at least too long to reckon up.\" (Of Civil Government, Book II. \u00a7 40, 41, 42, and 43.)\n\nHad Mr Locke carried his analysis a little further, he could not have failed to perceive that neither water, leaves, skins, nor any of the spontaneous productions of nature, have any value, except what they owe to the labour required to appropriate them. The value of water to a man placed on the bank of a river depends on the labour necessary to raise it from the river to his lips; and its value, when carried ten or twenty miles off, is equally dependent on the labour necessary to convey it there. All the rude products, and all the productive powers and\n\n* This is a very remarkable passage. It contains a far more distinct and comprehensive statement of the fundamental doctrine, that labour is the constituent principle of value, than is to be found in any other writer previous to Dr Smith, or than is to be found even in the Wealth of Nations. But Mr Locke does seem to have been sufficiently aware of the real value of the principle he had elucidated, and has not deduced from it any important practical conclusion. On the contrary, in his tract on the Raising of the Value of Money, published in 1691, he lays it down broadly that all taxes, howsoever imposed, must ultimately fall on the land; whereas, it is plain he ought, consistently with the above principle, to have shown that they would fall, not exclusively on the produce of land, but generally on the produce of industry, or on all species of commodities.\ncapacities of nature, are gratuitously offered to man. Nature is not niggardly or parsimonious. She neither demands nor receives an equivalent for her favours. An object which it does not require any portion of labour to appropriate or to adapt to our use, may be of the very highest utility; but, as it is the free gift of nature, it is utterly impossible it can be possessed of the smallest value.*\n\n\"Si je retranche,\" to use a striking illustration of this doctrine given by M. Canard, \"de ma montre, par la pens\u00e9e, tous les travaux qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 successivement appliqu\u00e9s, il ne resterait que quelques grains de min\u00e9ral plac\u00e9es dans l'int\u00e9rieur de la terre d'o\u00f9 on les a tir\u00e9s, et ou ils n'ont aucune valeur. De m\u00eame si je d\u00e9compose le pain que je mange, et que j'en retranche successivement tous les travaux successifs qu'il a re\u00e7us, il ne restera que quelques tiges d'herbes, gramin\u00e9es, \u00e9parpill\u00e9es dans des d\u00e9serts incul-tes, et sans aucune valeur.\" (Principes d'Economie Politique, p. 6.)\n\nIt is to labour, therefore, and to labour only, that man owes every thing possessed of exchangeable value. Labour is the talisman that has raised him from the condition of the savage\u2014that has changed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a> and the forest into cultivated fields\u2014that has covered the earth with cities and the ocean with ships\u2014that has given us plenty, comfort, and elegance, instead of want, misery, and barbarism.\n\nHaving established this fundamental principle\u2014having shown that it is labour only that gives exchangeable value to commodities\u2014it is plain the great practical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a> of the science of Political Economy must resolve itself into a discussion of the means whereby labour may be rendered most efficient, or whereby the greatest amount of necessary, useful, and agreeable products may be obtained with the least quantity of labour. Wealth, as we have already shown, is always increased with every diminution of the labour required to produce the articles of which it consists. Every measure and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> that has any tendency to save labour, or to reduce the cost of producing commodities, must add proportionally to our power of obtaining wealth and riches, while every measure or regulation that has any tendency to waste labour, or to raise the cost of producing commodities, must equally lessen this power. This is the simple and decisive test by which we are to judge of the expediency of every measure affecting the wealth of the country, Labour the and of the value of every invention. If they render only Source of Wealth labour more productive\u2014if they have a tendency to reduce the exchangeable value of commodities, to render them more easily obtainable, and to bring them within the command of a greater portion of society, they must be advantageous; but if their tendency be different, they must as certainly be disadvantageous. Considered in this point of view, that great branch of the science of Political Economy which treats of the production of wealth, will be found to be abundantly simple, and easily understood.\n\nLabour, according as it is applied to the raising of raw produce\u2014to the fashioning of that raw produce, when raised, into articles of utility, convenience, or ornament\u2014and to the conveyance of raw and wrought produce from one country and place to another\u2014is said to be agricultural, manufacturing, or commercial. An acquaintance with the particular processes, and most advantageous methods, of applying labour in each of these grand departments of industry, forms the peculiar and appropriate study of the agriculturist, manufacturer, and merchant. It is not consistent with the object of the political economist to enter into the details of particular businesses and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROFESSIONS\">professions</a>. He confines himself to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> of the means by which labour in general may be rendered most productive, and how its powers may be increased in all the departments of industry.\n\nSect.

Xenophanes of Colophon is said to have described the remains of fossil fishes found in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> quarries of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYRACUSE\">Syracuse</a>, and in the deep marble rocks of Paros. Not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> after, in the fifth century before Christ, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERODOTUS\">Herodotus</a> mentions fossil shells as occurring in the rocks of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> this as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>'s having been formerly an arm of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, like the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-RED_SEA\"><a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">Red</a> Sea. We find some allusions to fossil organic remains even in the poets of antiquity. The following passage from Ovid is an example of this kind:\n\nVide ego, quod fuerat quondam solidissima tellus\nEsse fretum, vidi factas ex aquore terras,\nEt procul a pelago concha jacere marinae.\nEt vetus inventa est in montibus anchora summis.\n\nMetamorph. Lib. XV. l. 62.\n\nBut our author confounds true organic remains with the accidental occurrence of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANCHOR\">anchor</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>. Not long after the commencement of the Christian era, attempts were made to connect these phenomena with the Deluge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOAH\">Noah</a>; and in the writings of Tertullian, there are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> that refer to this supposed connection. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> afterwards became general, particularly towards the beginning of the eighteenth century, when it was attempted to prove, or at least to illustrate, the truths of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVELATION\">revelation</a> by appeals to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>. Thus B\u00fcttner, in his Zeichen und Zeugen der Sandflut, published at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ULM\">Ulm</a>, in 1710, and Scheuchzer, in several of his works, as in his Homo Diluvii Testis, Piscium Querela et Vindicatio, Herbarium Diluvianum, &c. enumerate many facts, and state numerous reasons in illustration of the accumulation and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEPOSITION\">deposition</a> of fossil shells, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a>, and animals, during a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOD\">flood</a>, which they maintain to have been that described in the Old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a>. But the non-occurrence of the remains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> along with those of other animals came to be considered as inimical to this opinion, and by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of Knorr it was nearly abandoned. Another speculation was soon started in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, by which it was attempted to show that these remains were not truly organic, but merely efforts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> to produce organic beings; and, therefore, that these bodies, although exhibiting the organic form, had never been animated. This fancy was combated by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUPPORTERS\">supporters</a> of the diluvian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>, and the result was, the addition of many new facts, and the total abandonment of both hypotheses. The discovery of remains of elephants, rhinoceroses, &c. in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> and Northern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a> in a fossil state, gave rise to a new opinion, that these, and many other fossil animals found along with them, had been floated hither from the tropical regions. Forster, Pallas, and others, who advocated this opinion, brought together a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOST\">host</a> of facts in support of it; and, in this way, contributed, in an eminent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, to our knowledge of fossil organic remains, and to a more accurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> of their various <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> and relations. But their speculation, with all its plausibilities, was soon supplanted by that which is at present considered as the most consistent with facts\u2014namely, that the various fossil organic remains, contained in rocks of different kinds, belong to animals and vegetables that formerly lived in the countries where these remains are at present met with. The facts which have been brought to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> by the collision of opposite opinions, and by the careful and successful investigations of many naturalists who were contented to view these fossil remains, not as connected with any general geological hypothesis, but as interesting additions to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZOOLOGY\">zoology</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTANY\">botany</a>, and important contributions to our knowledge of the physical and geographical distributions of animals and vegetables, are so interesting, even to the general reader, that we shall attempt to give a short account of them, in the following order:\n\n1. Different kinds of fossil organic remains.\n   1. Animal remains.\n   2. Vegetable remains.\n   2. State or condition of these remains.\n   3. Geognostical situations.\n   4. Formation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRATA\">strata</a> in which these remains are contained.\n\nI.\u2014DIFFERENT KINDS OF FOSSIL ORGANIC REMAINS.\n\nI.\u2014Fossil Remains of Animals.\n\n1. Fossil Remains of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">Human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">Species</a>.\u2014When the diluvian controversy was keenly agitated, many descriptions were published of fossil remains of man, said to have been found in secondary rocks of different kinds; but all these, without exception, proved to be remains of the lower animals. Thus the famous\n\" homo diluvii testis\" of Scheuchzer was found to be a gigantic fossil salamander. The fossil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CERIGO\">Cerigo</a>, so confidently described by Spallanzani as human, were determined to belong to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRUPEDS\">quadrupeds</a>. The remains of the human species, therefore, do not occur in the secondary strata; but the following facts prove their occurrence in fissures of rocks and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POST\">post</a>-diluvial strata. Human bones, and even whole skeletons, have been found in clay in fissures of rocks, being the remains of bodies that had fallen into them; in other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, human bones and skeletons have been met with, and occasionally more or less mineralized, in old deserted galleries in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINES\">mines</a>. Some years ago, human skeletons were discovered in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a> calcareous rock in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">Island</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUADALOUPE\">Guadaloupe</a>. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of this rock, inclosing a pretty well preserved human skeleton, but without the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, and wanting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> arm (represented at fig. 1, F, Plate CII.), was sent by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ADMIRAL\">Admiral</a> Cochrane to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Melville, and afterwards by him deposited in the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSEUM\">Museum</a>. The rock, on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>, proved to be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> alluvial mass, formed of pieces of coral, that appear to have been thrown up on the shore by the sea, and afterwards united together by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> impregnated with calcareous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>. M. Moreau de Jornes thinks these skeletons are remains of persons who had perished by shipwreck. Human bones have lately been found in alluvial soil at K\u00f6estritz in Germany, and in such a situation as to render it probable that they are of great antiquity. The absence of human fossil remains from diluvial formations has excited surprise; but this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> cease when it is recollected that, probably, at the period of the deluge, the human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> had not extended into the countries where fossil organic remains have been examined, and, therefore, are only to be looked for in those regions where man is known to have lived when that event took place.\n\n**CLASS I.\u2014<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAMMALIA\">MAMMALIA</a>.**\n\n**Order I.\u2014Quadrumana.**\n\nHitherto <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> fossil remains of apes, baboons, monkeys, or other tribes of the order Quadrumana, have been met with; although it is probable that they will be found among the alluvial strata of those regions where these animals now live.\n\n**Order II.\u2014Chiroptera.\u2014Bat.**\n\nIt is probable that fossil species of the larger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATS\">bats</a> will be found in the alluvial strata of the warmer regions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, and that remains of the smaller European species will be discovered in some of the European formations. The only fossil remains of the animals of this order with which we are acquainted are those represented, fig. 5, Plate CII. These are contained in a slab of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">limestone</a> from Eichst\u00e4tt, and belong to a species which must have measured six or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> feet from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other. The remarkable fossil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> named Ornithocephalus, to be described afterwards, in general aspect bears a striking resemblance to bats.\n\n**Order III.\u2014Marsupialia.**\n\nTwo species of this order, both belonging to the genus Didelphis, or Opossum, have been met with in a fossil state; the one was found in the gypsum of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, the other in the calcareous oolite slate of Stonesfield in England.\n\n**Order IV.\u2014Glires, or Gnawers.**\n\nFossil remains of an animal resembling the Cavia porcellus, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUINEA\">Guinea</a>-pig, have been detected in the limestone of Oningen; remains of an animal resembling the Lagomys alpinus, a species at present confined to the higher parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIBERIA\">Siberia</a>, were found in the fissures of the rock of Gibraltar; two species of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEPUS\">Lepus</a>, one nearly resembling the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> rabbit, and the other one-third less, were found in the limestone rocks of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CETTE\">Cette</a>; three species of Mus have been met with in a fossil state, one nearly resembling the Mus terrestris, occurs in limestone in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOHEMIA\">Bohemia</a>, and also in the limestone-conglomerate of Corsica, and two others, one referred to the Mus arvalis, and the other to the common water-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-RAT\">rat</a>, in the rock of Gibraltar: fossil remains of the common beaver have been met with in alluvial strata in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-PERTHSHIRE\">Perthshire</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol4.html#article-BERWICKSHIRE\">Berwickshire</a> in Scotland, and in similar situations on the Continent; and another species, named <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASTOR\">Castor</a> trogontherium, was found on the shores of the sea of Azof.\n\n**Order V.\u2014Bradypoda.\u2014Sloth.**\n\nThe fossil species of this order, although not numerous, are remarkable for their magnitude and singular organization. Hitherto only two species have been discovered, and apparently both belong to the same genus: the one is the Megatherium, and the other the Megalonyx, of authors. We might assume Megatherium as the generic denomination, and name the South American species Megatherium Australe, and the Megalonyx, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">North</a> American species, Megatherium Boreale; but our present view will be answered by describing them under their common names.\n\nMegatherium.\u2014A complete skeleton of this colossal species was found in diluvial soil near Buenos Ayres, and sent to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MADRID\">Madrid</a>; afterwards another was discovered near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIMA\">Lima</a>, and a third in Paraguay.* The splendid specimen in Madrid is fourteen feet long, and seven Spanish feet in height. The skeleton of this megatherium is so rude and unshapely; that the clumsy skeleton of the elephant and rhinoceros, and even the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASSIVE\">massive</a> and rugged bones of the hippopotamus, appear, when placed beside it, slender and light. It is one of the largest and most massive of all the fossil quadrupeds hitherto discovered. Judging from its structure, its motions seem to have been slow and dragging; and, with exception of its long claws, appears to have been more defenceless than any of the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> quadrupeds. The form of the\n\n---\n\n* Remains of the Megatherium have been lately found in limestone caves in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRAZIL\">Brazil</a>.\nOrder VI.\u2014Fer\u00e6.\u2014Rapacious Animals.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-URSUS\">Ursus</a>.\n\nSeveral fossil species of this tribe have been met with in different parts of Europe. The following are enumerated by naturalists:\n\n1. Ursus Spelaeus.\u2014It is the largest species, and is distinguished from the Polar bear, to which it bears a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> resemblance, by its more inclined brow, and the want of the anterior small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRINDING\">grinding</a> tooth.\n\n2. U. Arctoides.\u2014The skull smaller than the preceding, and the small anterior grinding tooth also wanting.\n\n3. U. priscus.\u2014Not larger than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> bear; the cranium the same shape, and provided with the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>.\n\nThese fossil species occur in limestone caves in Germany and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUNGARY\">Hungary</a>.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CANIS\">Canis</a>.\n\nFossil remains of a species of canis resembling the dog, and of another nearly allied to the common fox, and bones of the common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WOLF\">wolf</a>, have been found in post-diluvial and diluvial soils, and in caves in England, Germany, and France.\n\nHy\u00e6na.\n\nFossil remains of a species nearly allied to the common hy\u00e6na have been found in caves in limestone in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORKSHIRE\">Yorkshire</a>. In these also dung was found, proving that these caverns had been the residence of the hy\u00e6na. Remains of the same species occur in caves in Germany. Another species, resembling the H. crocuta, was found in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HANOVER\">Hanover</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARL\">marl</a>, along with bones of the lion and elephant.\n\nFelis.\n\nOne species of this tribe, and nearly resembling the jaguar of South <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>, has been found in a fossil state in limestone caves in Germany; another species, nearly allied to the tiger, is found in diluvial soil, along with fossil remains of the elephant, rhinoceros, hy\u00e6na, and mastodon.\n\nMustella.\u2014Weasel.\n\nTwo species of this genus occur in the German limestone caves. The one is allied to the common pole-cat (Mustella putorius), and the other to the zaville, a pole-cat, native of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> of Good Hope. Another species, allied to the ichneumon of Egypt, but nearly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> its size, occurs in the gypsum quarries around Paris.\n\nOrder VII.\u2014<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-SOLIDUNGULA\">Solidungula</a>.\n\nEquus Adamiticus\u2014Equus Caballus.\u2014Fossil teeth of a species of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> are found in diluvial soil, associated with those of the elephant, rhinoceros, hy\u00e6na, mastodon, and tiger. These teeth are larger than those of the present horse, and, to all appearance, belong to a different species, which inhabited the countries where they are now found, as Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, along with elephants, rhinoceroses, hy\u00e6nas, bears, wolves, &c.\n\nOrder VIII.\u2014Bisulca.\n\nMany fossil animals of this order occur in a fossil state. We shall enumerate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> of these.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOS\">Bos</a>.\u2014Ox.\n\nFour species of this genus occur in a fossil state.\n\n1. Bos aurochs or urus.\u2014This species is considered as distinct from the common ox, being much larger. Horns and bones are found in this country, and also on the Continent of Europe. It occurs likewise in alluvial soil in the district of Ohio in North America.\n\n2. Common Ox.\u2014The fossil skulls of this species differ from those of the present existing races in being larger, and the horns having a different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>. They are considered as belonging to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> race of the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> ox. The remains are of frequent occurrence in our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEAT\">peat</a>-bogs, also in a similar situation in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>.\n\n3. Large Buffalo of Siberia.\u2014Skulls and bones of a large species of ox are found in Siberia, which Cuvier maintains to be different from any of the present species; and as it occurs in the same situation as the elephant and rhinoceros of Siberia, he considers it to have lived at the same early period.\n\n4. Fossil Ox, resembling the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MUSK\">Musk</a> Ox of North America.\u2014The bones of this species resemble in many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> those of the musk ox, but the marks of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> are so considerable as to show that it is a distinct species. This species has hitherto been found only in Siberia.\n\nCervus.\u2014Deer.\n\nThe following are the fossil species.\n\n1. C. elephas, or Red-Deer.\u2014Horns and skulls of a deer, agreeing in almost every particular with the common red deer, are occasionally met with in strata of different descriptions. Some of these have been found in the newer secondary formations, in supposed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> volcanic tufas, and in diluvial strata, with remains of the elephant, rhinoceros, &c., and lastly in our common peat-mosses. The horns and crania found in our peat-bogs are of the same species with our present red deer, but it is not equally certain that those found in the older formations are of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>.\n\n2. Roe-Deer.\u2014Bones of this species are met with in our peat-mosses, and in beds of shell marl, but never in any of the diluvial strata.\n\n3. Fossil Roe of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORLEANS\">Orleans</a>.\u2014This species, nearly allied to the roe, but different as a species, is remarkable on account of its geognostical position; its remains occurring in a new secondary limestone, along with bones of the paleotherium. It occurs near Orleans in France.\n\n4. Fossil Fallow-Deer.\u2014This species is found in peat-bogs and in marl pits in Scotland, England,\nOrganic Remains.\n\nThe antlers are in general larger than those of the present varieties.\n\n5. Fossil Deer of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ETAMPES\">Etampes</a>.\u2014This species appears nearly allied to the rein deer, but much smaller, not exceeding the roe in size. The bones were found near Etampes in France, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>, the geognostical relations of which have not been determined.\n\n6. Cervus giganteus, Irish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ELK\">Elk</a>, or Elk of the Island of Man.\u2014This gigantic and magnificent species, now apparently extinct, occurs in a fossil state in Ireland, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLE\">Isle</a> of Man, England, Germany, and France. The most perfect specimen of the skeleton of this species hitherto met with is that which was found in the Isle of Man, and now preserved in the Museum of the University of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>. In Plate CIV. we have given an accurate representation of this remarkable specimen. It is six feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> feet long, and in height to the tip of the right <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORN\">horn</a>, nine feet seven and a half inches. It was dug up in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> of Kirk Balaff, and fortunately secured for the Museum by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRACE\">Grace</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">Duke</a> of Atholl. It was imbedded in a loose shell marl, in which were numerous imbedded branches and roots. Over the marl was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a> of sand, above the sand a bed of peat, principally composed of small branches and rotten leaves, and over the peat the common soil of the country.\n\nOrder IX.\u2014Multungula.\n\nSeveral of the largest and most remarkable of the fossil species of quadrupeds belong to this order, and of those the following are the most interesting:\n\nRhinoceros.\n\nOf this genus four fossil species have been determined.\n\n1. Rh. tichorinus.\u2014In this species the nostrils are separated by a thick osseous plate. It is the largest of the fossil rhinoceri, and is that which is found in England, France, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, Germany, Siberia, &c. One specimen was found in the year 1770 with its skin on, imbedded in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ICE\">ice</a>, on the banks of the Wilhoui. It appeared to have had very long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> on its feet, an arrangement, according to Cuvier, probably connected with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> which it inhabited.\n\n2. Rh. ptorhinus (from \u03bb\u03b5\u03c0\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2, thin).\u2014In this species the nostrils are not provided with an osseous septum, the bones of the nose are thinner, and the skeleton less massive than in the preceding species. It is found in Italy.\n\n3. Rh. minutus, of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIMINUTIVE\">diminutive</a> size.\u2014Found in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-DILUVIUM\">diluvium</a> in the village of St Laurent, near to the town of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOISSAC\">Moissac</a>, in the department of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TARN\">Tarn</a>, and the Garrone.\n\n4. Rh. incisorus, provided with incisor teeth. It is the size of the common rhinoceros, and is found in Germany.\n\nHippopotamus.\n\nOnly one living species of this tribe is known to naturalists, but four fossil species have been determined by Cuvier.\n\n1. H. magnus. It is very nearly allied to the present living species, and is of the same size. It is found in England, France, Germany, &c.\n\n2. Middle-sized Hippopotamus, is smaller than the former, being the size of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HOG\">hog</a>, and is found in France.\n\n3. Small Hippopotamus.\u2014Found in France; is less than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> species.\n\n4. Least Hippopotamus.\u2014Found in France, and appears to have been the size of the hog of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIAM\">Siam</a>.\n\nElephant.\n\nOf this interesting tribe of animals two living species, the Asiatic and African, and one fossil species, named Mammoth by the Russians, are known to naturalists. The fossil elephant or mammoth differs from the living species in the following particulars: The alveoli of the tusks are much larger, and the zygomatic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> of a different form. The vacuity between the branches of the jaws at the fore <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> is wider than in the Asiatic and African species; and the lower jaw, in place of terminating in a kind of pointed apopysis, as in the living species, is rounded off. The grinders of the fossil species differ from those of the living, and the tusks, although of the same magnitude, appear to be more curved than in either the Asiatic or African species. Single bones and teeth, or even perfect skeletons, are found, and one instance is on record of the whole animal being found preserved in ice. This specimen was discovered in the year 1799 in Asiatic Russia. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>, skin, and hair, were completely preserved,\u2014even the eyes were entire. It was provided with a long mane, and the body was covered with hair. This hair was of different qualities. There were stiff <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> bristles, from twelve to fifteen inches long, and these belonged to the mane, tail, and ears. Other bristles were from nine to ten inches long, and of a brown <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>; and, besides these, there was a coarse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a>, from four to five inches long, of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> colour. This latter is the wool which lies next the skin in all the inhabitants of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> countries; and hence, Cuvier thinks it probable that the northern fossil elephants, or those of Siberia, Russia, &c. were inhabitants of cold countries.* Its remains have been found in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ICELAND\">Iceland</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORWAY\">Norway</a>, Scotland (in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AYRSHIRE\">Ayrshire</a> and West <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOTHIAN\">Lothian</a>), England, and in many places throughout the Continent onwards to the Arctic Ocean. But they are more abundant in Siberia than in other countries; for Pallas informs us, that there is scarcely a spot from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DON\">Don</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KAMTSCHATKA\">Kamtschatka</a> where they have not been met with. They also occur in North America, even as far north as Churchill, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HUDSON_S_BAY\">Hudson's <a </a>class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">Bay</a>; this latter being the locality of a specimen sent to us from that country; and teeth and bones of a fossil elephant have been found in South America.\u2020\n\nMastodon.\n\nThis remarkable genus of fossil multungular ani-\n\n* The wide distribution of this fossil species, and its occurring amongst with remains of numerous large feline animals, &c. would seem to show, in opposition to the above inference, that the climate of the countries it inhabited had a tropical character.\n\n\u2020 There are in the Ashmolean Museum at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a>, some vertebrae and leg bones of an elephant of vast size, probably sixteen feet high, found in gravel near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ABINGDON\">Abingdon</a>. Mixed with these were bones of the rhinoceros, hippopotamus, horse, dog, ox, and a species of deer.\nOrganic remains, first systematically arranged by Cuvier, was named by him Mastodon (from *Mastos*, mamilla, and *dens*, dens), in reference to the maxillary or tubercular processes on the grinding teeth. The following are the species at present known to naturalists:\n\n1. **Great or Gigantic Mastodon of the Ohio.**\u2014This species appears to have been as tall as the elephant, but with longer and thicker <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a>; probably provided with a proboscis or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a>, and had tusks like those of the elephant. It appears to have lived on roots and fleshy parts of plants, and hence this kind of food attracted it to soft and marshy places, where its fossil remains are principally found. It is more common in North America than in any other part of the world, although its remains have also been found in Siberia.\n\n2. **Mastodon with Narrow Grinders.**\u2014It is smaller than the great mastodon, and the grinders are narrower in proportion to their length than in the great mastodon. It is found in Europe, and also in North America. The teeth and bones of this species when of blue colour, from mineral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-IMPREGNATION\">impregnation</a>, are named Animal Turquois. Besides the great mastodon and the species with narrow grinders, remains of four others have been met with, but their characters are not well known. Two of them are from America; the one is named *Mastodon of the Cordilleras*, and the other *Mastodon of Humboldt*; the other two are European, and of these one is named *Small Mastodon*, the other the *Tapir-like Mastodon*.\n\n**Tapir.**\n\nThe tapir was long held as peculiar to America, but the late discovery of a species in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALACCA\">Malacca</a> shows that it also extends to the Old World. The living species are different from those in a fossil state. These latter are found in the same diluvial strata as afford the fossil elephant and mastodon. Two species have been determined. The one, named *Gigantic Tapir*, about eighteen feet long and twelve feet high, thus equalling in magnitude the great mastodon of America and the great elephant, has been found in France, Italy, and Germany. The other is smaller, but still a formidable animal, and occurs in the same countries.\n\n**Lophiodon.**\n\nThis is a newly discovered fossil genus, nearly allied to the tapir, and named from the eminences on its teeth. Twelve species have been ascertained by Cuvier, and one of them, the largest, is of gigantic dimensions. All of them are found in what is called a fresh water formation, of the same nature with that which contains the remains of the palaeotherium and anoplotherium, and hitherto they have been met with only in France and Germany.\n\n**Elasmotherium.**\n\nOf this newly discovered fossil genus but one species has been found, and that in Siberia. It appears from the few fragments in the Museum at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOSCOW\">Moscow</a>, and described by Fisher, to be nearly allied to the rhinoceros and horse, and that probably it forms an intermediate tribe between these two. It is the size of the rhinoceros.\n\n**Palaeotherium.**\n\nThis genus, like the two preceding, is entirely fossil. Its generic character, as given by Cuvier, is as follows: *Organic Remains*.\n\nDentes quadraginta quatuor; scilicet, Primores utrinque <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEX\">sex</a>; lanarii quatuor, acuminati paulo longiores, tecti; molares viginti octo; utrinque septem; quorum superiores quadrati, inferiores bilunati. Nasus productor flexilis. Palmae et plantae tridactyla. In general osteological arrangement it resembles the tapir. Like that tribe, it appears to have had a lengthened snout, or short proboscis, and there can be little doubt that the form of the body was nearly the same as that of the tapir. Ten species are described by Cuvier, and these vary in magnitude from that of the rhinoceros to the hog and sheep, and all of them appear to have been herbivorous. None of the species have been hitherto found in this country, and those described by Cuvier occur in new secondary and diluvial strata in different parts of France, particularly in the vicinity of Paris.\n\n**Anoplotherium.**\n\nThis also is a fossil genus of extinct herbivorous animals. It bears some resemblance to the camel, and the tail is of equal length to the body, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> not longer, being at the same time very thick and strong. There are but five species known, and all of these, as far as we know, are found only in the new secondary rocks around Paris. The following is the character of this genus, as given by Cuvier. Dentes quadraginta quatuor, serie continua. Primores utrinque sex; lanarii primibus similes, ceteris non longiores; molares viginti octo, utrinque septem; anteriores compressi; posteriores superiores quadrate; inferiores bilunati. Palmae et plantae tridactyla, ossibus metacarpi et metatarsi discretis; digitis accessoris in quibusdam.\n\n**<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUS\">Sus</a>.\u2014Hog.**\n\nBones and teeth of the common hog occur in peat-mosses, and similar remains of a dubious species of hog in loam, along with remains of the elephant and rhinoceros.\n\nOrder X.\u2014*Palmata, Palmated Quadrupeds.*\n\nUnder this head we include those tribes provided with four paws somewhat resembling fins, and sometimes provided with clawed toes.\n\n1. **Phoca, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEAL\">Seal</a>.**\u2014Two fossil species of this genus have been found in France, in the coarse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">marine</a> limestone of the formation above chalk. One of them appears to have been three times as large as the common seal, and the other of rather smaller dimensions.\n\n2. **Trichecus, or Sea Horse, or Walrus.**\u2014No well marked fossil remains of this genus have hitherto been met with.\n\nOrder XI.\u2014*Sirenia.*\n\n**Lamantin, or Manatus.**\u2014Several bones of an unknown species of this genus have been discovered in the coarse marine limestone formation in the department of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAINE\">Maine</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOIRE\">Loire</a>.\n\nOrder XII.\u2014*Cetacea.\u2014Whale.*\n\nMr Parkinson says that two teeth of the narwal, or Monodon monoceros, were found on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of Es-\nOrganic Remains.\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> clay, and that one specimen was found in the limestone of Bath. Fossil remains of dolphins and whales are mentioned as occurring in the new secondary formations of Italy; and we know that a skeleton of the common whale was found near Airthy in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STIRLINGSHIRE\">Stirlingshire</a>, imbedded in alluvial soil formed by depositions from a river in a marine estuary.\n\nCLASS II.\u2014ORNITHOLITES, OR FOSSIL BIRDS.\n\nFossil remains of birds are of rare occurrence, and the few specimens hitherto found afford results much less satisfactory than those obtained by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of the fossil bones of quadrupeds. The best information on this subject is furnished by Cuvier, who has also communicated some obvious characters for assisting in the determination of this class of organic remains. Among others, the following are enumerated:\u2014The foot in birds has a single bone in place of the tarsal and metatarsal bones of quadrupeds; birds, too, form the only class in which the toes all differ as to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a>, and in which this number, and the order of the toes which have them, is nevertheless fixed. The great toe has two; the first two, reckoning on the outside, three; the middle five, and the outermost five. The crocodile has the same number of phalanges; but, as these have a tarsal and metatarsal bone, they cannot be confounded. By <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to these and other characters, fossil remains of species of the following genera have been determined, viz. owl, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUZZARD\">buzzard</a>, starling, ibis, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-QUAIL\">quail</a>, curlew, tern, and pelican. These occur in the limestone and gypsum of the Paris formations, and, it is said, also in an older formation, viz. that into which the Stonesfield slate enters as a member.*\n\nOrnithocephalus.\n\nThis genus, which is entirely fossil, is so remarkable in its structure, that naturalists are not agreed as to its place in the system. Some, as Cuvier, refer it to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMPHIBIA\">Amphibia</a>; others, as Blumenbach, to the birds; Collini described it as a fish; while Sommering arranges it with the Mammalia, and near to the bats. In this state of uncertainty, it is of little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> where we place it. The skull is very large in proportion to the size of the skeleton, the jaws themselves being longer than the body, and furnished with sharp slightly incurvated teeth. In general form, the head of the O. longirostris resembles that of the curlew tribe, while the brevirostris more nearly resembles the bat, particularly the Vespertilio murinus. The orbits of the eyes are disproportionably large, and hence it is probable that, like the bat, it was a nocturnal animal, while, from the size of its jaws, it is likely that it fed on small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a> insects. There are four legs, the hinder ones being of considerable length. There are no tarsal bones, only metatarsal bones and claws. There is a distinct tail. Two species are described by Sommering, the largest, which is about a foot long, is named O. longirostris; while the other, which is less, is named O. brevirostris. They are re-\n\n* Cuvier has lately found in Montmartre an ornitholite, in which the head, neck, wings, tail, thighs, and even the trachea arteria, are well preserved.\n\npresented in Plate CII. Both species occur imbedded in the limestone of Eichst\u00e4dt.\n\nCLASS III.\u2014AMPHIBIA.\n\nTestudo.\n\nSeveral species of this tribe have been detected in formations of different descriptions. In England they have been met with in the lias limestone near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRISTOL\">Bristol</a>, in the oolite of Stonesfield, but most perfect in the London clay, as it is termed, in the vale of Sheppey. Cuvier and other naturalists enumerate different species of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, marine, and fresh water fossil testudines found in France, Germany, and Italy, but all of them apparently extinct species.\n\nCrocodile.\n\nTwo species were found in a blue clay (resembling that below chalk) in the neighbourhood of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONFLEUR\">Honfleur</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAVRE\">Havre</a>. They cannot be referred to any of the present species. In England, one specimen was obtained from the Purbeck stone, and another was found in the cornbrash rock at Gibraltar, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OXFORDSHIRE\">Oxfordshire</a>. These are distinct from the first French species, but perhaps may agree with the second. Vertebrae, apparently of that species, are found in clay near Weymouth, and in chalk in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUSSEX\">Sussex</a>.\n\nMosasaurus of Conybeare.\u2014<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LACERTA\">Lacerta</a> Gigantea of Sommering.\n\nThis tribe contains those fossil amphibia which differ from crocodiles in some important characters, and is considered as an intermediate genus between those animals of the lizard tribe with a short tongue, and whose palate is furnished with teeth, and those where the tongue is long and forked. The gigantic species found in the soft limestone of Maestricht has long excited the attention of naturalists. The length of the skeleton appears to have been nearly 24 feet. The head is a sixth of the whole length of the animal, a proportion approaching very near to that of the crocodile. The tail must have been very strong, and its width at its extremity must have rendered it a most powerful oar, and have enabled the animal to have opposed the most agitated waters.\n\nFossil remains of an animal of the same kind, found in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAVARIA\">Bavaria</a>, are described by Sommering, under the name Lacerta gigantea; all the known parts of which are represented in Plate CV. \"When it is considered,\" says he, \"that this gigantic lizard was 24 feet long, we are forcibly reminded of the dragons so much spoken of in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FABLE\">fable</a>. At least, the fact that, at one period of the world, there existed animals of the lacerta, or dragon tribe, more than 20 feet in length, is more astonishing than all that is recorded in ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a> respecting monsters, which even the wildest fancy did not amplify to such enormous dimensions.\"\n\nIchthyosaurus.\n\nThis is a marine oviparous animal, closely agreeing in the whole osteology of the head, and sternum,\nOrganic Remains.\n\nWith the saurian tribe, except that the bones are usually, as in fish, united by squamous sutures, and approximating to fish in some parts of the structure of its vertebral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a>; and, in others, being sui generis. From these double analogies the name (fish-like lacerta) is derived. The extremities terminate in four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWIMMING\">swimming</a> paws, or paddles, composed of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of flat polygonal bones, greatly exceeding in number, not only the phalanges of quadrupeds, but also the phalangic cartilages of the fins of fish. Three distinct species, distinguished from each other by their teeth, are found in the lias limestone in England.\n\nPlesiosaurus.\n\nFrom \u03c0\u03bb\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, approximate to, and \u03c3\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, a lizard.\u2014This newly discovered fossil animal appears to be intermediate between the crocodile and ichthyosaurus, but whilst the ichthyosaurus recedes from the forms of the lizard <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, and approaches those of fishes, the new animal approximates, in these respects, more nearly to the crocodile; the plesiosaurus is, therefore, a marine animal, intermediate in structure between the ichthyosaurus and crocodile. It also occurs imbedded in lias limestone in England.\n\nMegalosaurus.\n\nFrom \u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, great, and \u03c3\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, a lizard.\u2014This is a species nearly allied to the monitor in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of its dentition. It is found in the calcareous slate of Stonesfield, in England. The animal must, in some instances, have attained the length of forty feet, and stood eight feet high. The gigantic lizard of Sommering appears diminutive when contrasted with this stupendous being.\n\nMonitor.\n\nFossil remains of animals that appear to belong to some of the numerous species comprised by Linnaeus under the name Lacerta monitor, and of Tupinambis by Daudin; animals which frequent marshes and the shallow beds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>, occur in bituminous marl slate in Thuringia.\n\nSalamandra.\u2014Salamander.\n\nScheuchzer's famous Homme fossile, which is considered to be an extinct species of salamander, was found in the limestone of Oeningen.\n\nBufo.\u2014Toad.\n\nFossil remains of this animal occur in the slate limestone of Oeningen. It is not the common toad, but one nearly allied to the Rana calamita.\n\nColuber.\n\nSeveral accounts have been published of the occurrence of fossil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERPENTS\">serpents</a> in rocks of different formation, but all of them, with exception of the notice of Cuvier, are so loose and unsatisfactory, as to be undeserving of notice. In the notice alluded to, we are informed the bones of a snake, resembling the Coluber natrix, were found in the calcareous conglomerate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONTPELLIER\">Montpellier</a>.\n\nCLASS IV.\u2014Fossil Fishes.\n\nFossil remains of fishes occur in considerable abundance in formations of particular descriptions, but hitherto, owing to the difficulties attending the investigation, the determination of the genera and species has been far from satisfactory. Even the attempts that have been made to divide these fossil fishes into fresh and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> water species have generally failed, and the whole geognostical history is in such a state, as to require a complete revival. The fish, in some specimens, are found nearly entire, with the soft parts, and even the scales, preserved by mineralization. In others, all the parts are removed, except the skeleton, and this is more or less perfect, and frequently only the hardest parts remain, such as the palates and teeth. Fossil fishes are found in a variety of geognostic situations in Great Britain, and the following genera are mentioned by authors as occurring in this island: Balistes, Xiphias, Diodon, Anarchichas, Salmo, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ESOX\">Esox</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ZEUS\">Zeus</a>, Mur\u00e6na, Squalus, but of this latter only the teeth, and of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-RAIA\">Raia</a> only the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BONY\">bony</a> tongue and palates.\n\nFossil Vertebrae.\u2014Many figures, and some descriptions, have been published of the fossil vertebrae of fishes. Most of the specimens appear to have belonged to large species of fishes, and some authors have confounded, under this name, the caudal vertebrae of cetacea, which, however, are always easy to determine, as they do not present any traces of the deep and regularly disposed foramina, which present themselves at the surface of the vertebrae of fishes.\n\nFossil Teeth, or Ichthyodonta.\u2014These are the parts of fishes that occur most frequently in the bowels of the earth, on account of their being less subject to decay. They are divided into two groups, the glossopetra, or more or less flattened teeth, which have belonged to fishes of the shark tribe, &c., and the bufonites, batrachites, &c., or more or less rounded teeth, which have been generally considered as belonging to certain species of sparus or of anarchichas. 1. Glossopetrae, or Petrified Tongues.\u2014This denomination has its origin from the idea that was formerly entertained of the form of the tongue of serpents, and especially from the notion that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APOSTLE\">Apostle</a> Paul, on going to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALTA\">Malta</a>, had destroyed all the serpents of that island, and that the fossil teeth of sharks, which occur in great abundance, originated from them, and were nothing else than their tongues converted into stone. 2. Bufofites, or Batrachites.\u2014We find figures, or rather descriptions, by authors under this name, derived from bufo, because it was imagined, we cannot say how, that there were engendered in the head of toads a great number of fossil bodies, of a more or less rounded shape and shining surface, which are evidently nothing else than portions of the teeth of fishes. Many of them are true teeth implanted in the maxillary bones, while others are maxillary plates.\n\nCLASS V.\u2014<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CRUSTACEA\">Crustacea</a>.\n\n1. Fossil Crustacea, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CRABS\">Crabs</a>.\n\nThe description of fossil crustacea presents more difficulties than might at first be imagined. The greater number of them are in such a state of mutilation, or so inclosed in the rock, that very often there is nothing to be seen but a part of the upper\nStill farther back, fig. 1, in a pretty deep hollow, we find the heart, d, which is depressed above, and which occupies its whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>; this organ is easily distinguished by its pulsations. Each lateral edge of the cavity, fff, in which it is placed, is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> and much elevated, and formed by a vertical septum which proceeds from the sternum to the shell, and which contributes to its solidity, by being fixed between these two surfaces, much in the way of the supporter between the two tables of a violin. This septum also gives support to other transverse partitions, which are equal in number to the separations of the sternal pieces, and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> of which are situated the muscles which move the feet. The shell, fig. 2, 3, shows the place of the heart well defined, in the same situation in which this organ is found in the crab when laid bare; and on each of its sides we observe two small sunk <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a>, which belong to the point of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> of the two bony partitions between which the heart is situated.\n\nOn the right and left of the preparatory organs of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a> and of the heart, there are two large spaces, fig. 1, c, where the branchiae are arranged and extended on two oblique osseous tables, which shut up above all the compartments in which the muscles of the feet are fixed. These branchiae are five in number on each side, and each of them presents a double row of small transverse branchial laminae; this point of attachment is externally, and all their extremities are directed toward the line which separates the preparatory organs of generation from the heart. The shell, fig. 2, 5, 5, presents, above these parts, on each side of the body, a bulging space, which, in its extent, agrees perfectly with the place occupied by them beneath it.\n\nLastly, on both sides of the stomach, and before the branchiae, we find the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIVER\">liver</a>, fig. 1, b b, which is very large; it is of a soft consistence and yellowish colour, and its surface presents a multitude of small veriform parts. This liver passes beneath the viscera which we have described, and is prolonged posteriorly, as far as the base of the tail to c, so that it is seen still behind the heart. At this point it has the same aspect and structure as in the anterior part of the body, and is divided into two lobes, which, besides, are in close contact. In the shell, the parts which cover the places where the liver is visible, when it has been removed, fig. 2, 6, 6, and 4, are less bulging than the others, and are distinct on account of this want of protuberance, especially the anterior ones.\n\nThe same relations have been found in the Cancer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol0.html#article-PAGURUS\">pagurus</a>, and many other species. In some, however, many of the indications were wanting, as in certain Leucosia for example; but in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, the shell is altogether smooth, and no other furrow indicated divisions which did not correspond with those which we have mentioned.\n\nIn some others, the surface of the shell is, on the contrary, marked with an infinity of furrows, and with numerous asperities (Cancer variolosus, and C. incisus); but the principal divisions have always the same arrangement.\n\nWe have found it convenient to give the name of Regions to the different parts of the shell which cover the internal organs, and to distinguish these\nregions by particular designations, which bear reference to the relations existing between them and the organs, thus:\n\nThe **gastric region** (r\u00e9gion stomacale), or that which covers the stomach, is median, or anterior, fig. 2, 1.1.\n\nThe **genital region** is median, and situated immediately behind the gastric, 2.2.\n\nThe **cardiac region** (r\u00e9gion cardiale) is median, and placed behind the genital, 3.\n\nThe **hepatic regions** are three in number; two anterior, situated one on each side of the gastric, and before the branchial, 6.6; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POSTERIOR\">posterior</a> median, placed between the cardiac and the posterior edge of the shell, 4.\n\nThe **branchial regions**, two in number, one on each side, are placed between the cardiac and genital regions on one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, and the lateral edges of the shell on the other, 5.5.\n\nDesmarest describes, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> detailed, twenty genera, and a considerable number of species from different parts of Europe, Asia, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>. Many species occur in Great Britain, but principally in England, where they appear in the chalk formation, and also in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLASTIC\">plastic</a> clay of Sheppey.\n\nIn Plate CVI. we have given, from Brongniart, representations of a Limulus and of a Cancer, both of them genera of the Crustacea.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Trilobites.\n\nUpwards of an hundred years ago, there was found in England, near to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUDLEY\">Dudley</a>, in beds of limestone, organic bodies of a very singular form, and different from all the petrifications which had been previously seen, as well as from every organized body known to exist at the surface of the earth. There was no hesitation, however, in referring them to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANIMAL_KINGDOM\">animal <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>; but for a long time it could not be determined to what class they belonged; and Linnaeus himself, on placing them with the insects, found their form to be so very different from that of the animals of this class, that he gave to the particular species which he has described the name of *Entomolites paradoxus*.\n\nNotwithstanding the considerable differences which exist between many of the bodies to which the name of *Entomolites* was at first given, and afterwards that of *Trilobites*, we nevertheless discover between them points of resemblance sufficient to characterize a very natural family.\n\nTheir body, as in the greater number of insects and in some crustacea, may be divided transversely into three principal parts. But the principal general characteristic, and what essentially distinguishes them from all known animals, is their longitudinal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> into three parts, or lobes, by two deep furrows <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to the axis of the body; this remarkable structure has excited the attention of all observers. At first the tails were only observed, and from their being considered as shells, the name of *Concha triloba* was given them. Afterwards this designation was transferred to the entire animals, by naming them *Trilobites*, a denomination first given by Knorr, and afterwards employed in a systematic manner by Br\u00fcnich and Blumenbach.\n\nThe *Trilobites* appear to form a distinct family in the great division of animals named articulated, which may be included in the class Crustacea. It exhibits the following characters:\n\nTheir body, as Brongniart remarks, is divided into three parts, which are more or less distinct; the anterior part, which is named the *scutum* (bouclier), (the head, Walch, &c.), appears to present the union of what, in insects, is generally called the head and thorax; the middle part of the body, which is divided by very distinct transverse articulations, may be considered as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ABDOMEN\">abdomen</a>, or trunk of Walch, Br\u00fcnich, Wahlenberg, or the union of the belly and back; the posterior part, often distinctly separated from the middle division, though sometimes nearly blended with it, and which is divided by less distinct articulations, or transverse folds, may be called the post-abdomen. The name of tail has been universally applied to it by naturalists, from its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> with the part in crustaceans, to which the same name is given with equal impropriety; it is traversed by the intestinal canal, but as there is, besides this part, a true tail, it would be improper to allow the name to remain. At the extremity of this prolongation of the abdomen, we find, in many species, an elongated appendage of a coriaceous, or crustaceous nature, either without articulations, as in the limulus; or composed of several plates arranged in the form of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAN\">fan</a>, as in the lobsters; this appendicular part, which does not contain any viscus, should bear the name of tail.\n\nThese two abdomens are divided longitudinally in the all trilobites by two deep grooves, into three longitudinal parts, or lobes, of unequal breadth; the middle one is generally the narrowest and the most distinctly articulated; the lateral ones, which are broader, even sometimes extend under the form of nearly membranous expansions, which appear to be supported by hard and costiform sides, or appendages, proceeding from the abdomen and the post-abdomen. We shall follow M. Audouin in giving the name of sides (or ilia, or latera) (*flanges*) to these lobes, or lateral parts: we have said that this forms the essential character of the trilobites; it is never wanting in any species, and does not occur so distinctly marked in any known living animal.\n\nThe *scutum* (bouclier) is always divided into three more or less distinct parts; a middle one, which, by Walch, is named the *fronts* (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONT\">front</a>), and two lateral ones which may retain the name of *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEEKS\">cheeks</a>* (joues), employed by the same author.\n\nWe observe upon this fronts, or middle part of the scutum, two or more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TUBERCLES\">tubercles</a>; and, often upon the two lateral parts, two other projecting tubercles very different from the first, which have been compared to eyes.\n\nThe similarity of these parts, in regard to position, general form, and reticular structure, to the reticulated eyes of insects, and especially of the crustacea, scarcely leaves any doubt regarding the analogy which may be established between these tubercles and eyes. The articulations of the abdomen and post-abdomen are sometimes prolonged laterally into projecting appendages.\n\nSometimes the tail does not exist at all, sometimes\nLastly, no naturalists have ever seen anything which could be compared to antennae or feet.\n\nThe trilobites are all marine animals; their constant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">association</a> in the same rocks with shells and other marine productions can leave no doubt on this point. It would appear that they have been capable of multiplying prodigiously, judging from the manner in which certain formations are crowded with them, insomuch that these rocks appear to be entirely composed of them.\n\nThe following are the generic names and characters given to these fossil animals by Desmarest:\n\n**Genus I.\u2014Calymene.** (That is, obscure or hid.)\n\n*Body,* contractile, nearly semicylindrical.\n\n*Scutum,* having several tubercles or folds, two reticulated oculiform tubercles.\n\n*Abdomen* and *post-abdomen,* entire at the margin, the abdomen divided into twelve or fourteen joints.\n\nPoint of the tail prolonged.\n\nC. Blumenbachii. Dudley Fossil. Auct.\n\n*Clypeo rotundato, tuberculis sex distinctis in fronte; oculus in genis eminentissimus; corpora tuberculata.*\n\nAbundant at Dudley in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORCESTERSHIRE\">Worcestershire</a>. Plate CVI. Three other species are described by Brongniart, and two of these are figured in Plate CVI.\n\n**Genus II.\u2014Asaphus.** (That is, difficult to determine.)\n\n*Body,* <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> and pretty flat; middle lobe projecting, and very distinct.\n\n*Sides,* or lateral lobes, each twice the breadth of the middle lobe.\n\nSubmembranous expansions extending the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a> of the lateral lobes.\n\n*Scutum* semicircular, with two reticulated oculiform tubercles.\n\n*Abdomen* divided into eight or twelve joints.\n\nA. Debuchii.\n\nCorpo ovato, antice obtuso: pars caud\u00e6 membranacea <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-AD\">ad</a> marginem longitudinaliter striata. Plate CVI.\n\nIs one of the species found in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a>. Four other species described by Brongniart, and one of these the A. Cornigerus, is figured in Plate CVI.\n\n**Genus III.\u2014Ogygia.** (That is, of the greatest antiquity.)\n\n*Body* much depressed, in the form of an elongated ellipse, not contractile.\n\n*Scutum* marginate; a shallow longitudinal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROOVE\">groove</a> proceeding from its anterior extremity.\n\nNo other tubercles than the oculiform ones.\n\nOculiform protuberances little protruded, not reticulated; posterior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> of the scutum prolonged into a point.\n\nLongitudinal lobes little protruded.\n\n*Abdomen* with eight articulations.\n\nTwo species of this genus, but none of them British, described by Brongniart.\n\n**Genus IV.\u2014Paradoxides.**\n\n*Body* depressed, not contractile.\n\n*Sides* much broader than the middle lobe.\n\n*Scutum* nearly semicircular; three oblique wrinkles on the middle lobe.\n\nNo oculiform tubercles.\n\n*Abdomen* with twelve articulations.\n\nArches of the abdominal and post-abdominal sides more or less prolonged beyond the membrane which sustains them.\n\nFive species, no British, described; and one of these, the P. spinulosus, is figured in Plate CVI. The fossils described by Linn\u00e6us under the name Entomolitus paradoxus belong to this genus.\n\n**Genus V.\u2014Agnostus.** (That is to say, unknown.)\n\n*Body* ellipsoidal, semicylindrical.\n\n*Scutum* and *sides* with the edges a little elevated.\n\nMiddle lobe presenting only two transverse divisions, each of a single piece.\n\nTwo glandular tubercles at the anterior part of the body.\n\nOf this genus but one species, and that found in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a>.\n\n**CLASS VI.\u2014Insecta.**\n\nFrom their perishable nature, the animals of this class rarely occur in a fossil state; and when they do appear, they are generally very imperfect. Supposed larvae of the genera Libellula and Ephemer\u00e6 occur in the marl slate of C\u00f6ningen and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPPENHEIM\">Pappenheim</a>; and the elytra of coleopterous insects in the Stonesfield slate. Insects well preserved, and of extinct species, occur in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMBER\">amber</a>. Schweigger describes a piece of amber containing a perfect scorpion, but different from the common species of that genus. The ants inclosed in amber appear to be the same with the present species; so that we have the same arrangement in this substance as in rock formations, viz. known and unknown species together.\n\n**CLASS VII.\u2014<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOLLUSCA\">Mollusca</a>.**\n\n**Fossil Shells.**\n\nFossil shells are amongst the most abundant of the organic remains met with in the strata of which our globe is composed. They exhibit not only great variety in form, but also in magnitude, having a range from the colossal ammonite, several feet in diameter, to the microscopic nautilus, and other shells of the same description. They are divided into univalve, or those composed of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VALVE\">valve</a> or piece, bivalve, with two valves, and multivalve, with more than two valves.\n\n1. **Univalve Fossil Shells.**\n\nThese univalve shells are again divided into those with one chamber, termed unilocular, as the common patella or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMPET\">limpet</a>; and those with several chambers, named multilocular, as the nautilus. Upwards\nOrganic remains of seventy genera of unilocular shells occur in a fossil state, and many of these include numerous species. The multilocular genera are not so numerous, their number amounting to about twenty-two, but their internal structure is so interesting as to deserve from us some notice. The nautilus, which is one of the best known of these, like all the other genera of this division, has its shell formed into a number of chambers, divided by a perforated septum. The animal which inhabits it, and which is of the sepia or cuttle-fish tribe, resides in the largest and last formed chamber; an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> tube (siphunculus) proceeds from the animal, and passes through the perforation in the septa and the different chambers, and terminates in the first or smallest. It is conjectured that part of the shell is enveloped by the animal, independent of the connection it has with it by means of the siphunculus. The tube is membranous, and it is probable that it is dilatable and compressible, so as to be capable of rendering the animal buoyant or otherwise at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>-bladder does in fishes. The cells or chambers seem to answer no other purpose than that of containing air, as the animal leaves the last formed one in succession as it forms a new one, keeping up with them no other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> than what is preserved by the siphunculus. Thus, as the animal increases in size and occupies a new chamber, the last in order, and, in the same way, all the preceding ones, are left empty, so that the gravity of the shell is not much more than that of the water of the sea, and hence the addition of a small portion of air, by means of the siphunculus, may render it buoyant, and the expansion of the air, and probably the addition of water, may cause it to sink. Of these nautili some are known to live in the present waters of the globe, but are of rare occurrence, while the fossil species are numerous and abundant. Hence has arisen a question as to the cause of the great disproportion between the number of fossil and of recent shells of this tribe. Some are of opinion that the fossil genera have become extinct, while others maintain that they still live at the bottom of the sea, out of the reach of our observation. But the structure of the shell, as already explained, proves that so far from their inhabitants having been destined to live always at the bottom of the sea, they possess the power of rising up and remaining at the surface of the sea. Supposing them still to live, they would occasionally, as the present nautilus, be seen at the surface; but not a single instance being known of a shell of these genera having been thus seen, their existence may be reasonably doubted.\u2014(Parkinson's Introduction.)\n\n**<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMMONITES\">Ammonites</a>.**\u2014This is another tribe of multilocular fossil shells, remarkable not only for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> and variety, but also on account of its vast abundance and wide distribution in the mineral kingdom. They are the petrified serpents of the vulgar; by some considered as the original <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYPE\">type</a> of the volutes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a>, and have also an interesting mythological meaning. Three hundred different species have been described.\n\n**Nummulites.**\u2014Another of the concamerated fossil genera, of a discoidal form, and which has been confounded with seeds. It is so very abundant, that sometimes whole tracts of country are principally composed of it. The pyramids of Egypt are partly built of a limestone almost entirely made up of nummulites. Our limits will not allow of any details in regard to the Orthoceratite, Belemnite, Baculite, and other genera of this remarkable division, which, in general character and economy, agree with the nautilus, already particularly noticed.\n\n2. **Bivalve and Multivalve Fossil Shells.**\n\nThe bivalve fossil shells are so numerous and varied in their forms, that we must refer for descriptions of them to the numerous treatises and works on fossil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol6.html#article-CONCHOLOGY\">conchology</a>. The multivalves are of comparatively rare occurrence.\n\n**CLASS VIII.\u2014Radiaria.**\n\n**Echinus, or Sea Urchin Family.**\n\nThis extensive division of the echinodermata exhibits great variety in form, and although not met with in the older secondary rocks, is abundant in several of the newer. Some of the species resemble those at present met with in our seas, but none of them, as far as we know, are identical with the recent ones.\n\n2. **Asterias, or Sea <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAR\">Star</a> Family.**\n\nThe animals of this series, from the delicacy and frailness of their structure, speedily decay, and hence are rarely met with in a fossil state.\n\n3. **Crinoidea, or Encrinite Family.**\n\nThe animals of this order appear, from their internal structure and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> form, to belong to a series allied to the Radiaria, and therefore cannot be arranged with the simple class of polypi. They abound in many strata, and in vast abundance, but very rarely in a living state,\u2014a fact which shows the great difference between the animal world of the former and present period. Blumenbach first conjectured their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> to the Radiaria; Schweigger describes them as pediculated and fixed asteries; and Miller, in his late excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> on the Crinoidea, has removed every doubt as to their true place in the system. All the Entrochites and Encrinites of authors belong to this family.\n\n**CLASS IX.\u2014Polypi.**\n\nUnder this head we include all the different kinds of simple animals named polypi, with their coverings, termed *polyparia*.

His literary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> commenced very early, for he went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARROW\">Harrow</a> at six, having been previously, for a twelvemonth, under the private tuition of a clergyman in the neighbourhood. For <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> eight years he applied to his classical studies as a schoolboy with great diligence; and when he was thirteen, he was placed in the office of the Accountant of the African <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">Company</a>, in order to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> some practical knowledge of the principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>.\n\nIn 1742 he went out to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CALCUTTA\">Calcutta</a>, and was there engaged in a mercantile <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of respectability: he made a voyage to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SURAT\">Surat</a> in their concerns, and on his return, in 1743, he received from England the appointment of a writer. Five years afterwards he was promoted to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FACTOR\">factor</a> in the Company's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>. In 1752, having been desired to give his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> on the regulation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-POLICE\">Police</a> of Calcutta, he drew up a memorial on the subject, which did great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> to the accuracy and profoundness of his views of the manners, the habits, and the interests of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>.\n\nHe returned to England in 1753, upon a visit to his aunt, and he was much consulted, during his stay in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Holderness, then Secretary of State, with regard to the policy to be observed towards the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">Government</a> respecting the affairs of India. He went out again in 1754, and took his seat as a member of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> at Fort St George. He had here an opportunity of effectually serving the Company by the vigour of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> conduct, and of greatly contributing to the establishment of the decided preponderance of the English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> in India. After the well known affair of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">Black</a> Hole of Calcutta, he was particularly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> in promoting the appointment of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLONEL\">Colonel</a> Clive to the command of the expedition destined to punish the cruelty of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRANT\">tyrant</a> who was the author of that outrage: although his friendship with Colonel Clive did not continue uninterrupted through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. Mr Orme's exertions on this and other occasions were so highly appreciated by the Directors, that he was nominated as eventual successor to the government of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MADRAS\">Madras</a>: but he did not stay <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> enough to profit by the appointment. In the capacity of Accountant-General, he became intimate with Mr Alexander, afterwards Lord Caledon, who was his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEPUTY\">deputy</a>, and with Mr Dalrymple, the hydrographer, to whom he showed many civilities from a conviction of his merits. Mr Benjamin Robins, the historiographer of Anson's Voyage, had also been one of his early friends, that is, during his first residence in India; for this singularly active person died in 1751.\n\nMr Orme's situation in India was extremely favourable for the acquisition of historical information, which it was the delight of his life to collect; but his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> requiring a change of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, he sailed for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> on board of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANTHAM\">Grantham</a> in 1758. The ship was, however, captured in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1759, off the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> of Good Hope, and carried to the Mauritius: after having been detained here for some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, Mr Orme was allowed to proceed to the Cape, and thence to France. He landed at Nantes in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> of 1760: he paid a visit to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, where he amused himself for some months with the literature and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEATRES\">theatres</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>: and his biographer has preserved some interesting remarks that\nthey suggested to him. In October he arrived in London, and engaged a house which had lately been built in Harley Street.\n\nHe employed himself for the two succeeding years upon his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">Military</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a>; sparing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> pains nor expense to complete the collection of materials, which he had begun to form in India, and to prepare the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, with all possible care, for the press. The first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> appeared in 1763, and was received with great approbation. The Company not only granted him free access to their Records, but gave him also the appointment of their historiographer, with a salary of L.400 a year. After this time, he resumed some of his classical studies which he had discontinued so long, as to have forgotten almost all that he had learned; but he soon recovered his knowledge of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> languages, and added to them afterwards such of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> ones as he found likely to be subservient to his pursuits. His hours of leisure were chiefly passed in the enjoyment of literary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>: he became a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 1770; he was intimate about the same time with Lord Sandys, and with Sir James Harris. Sir William Jones, Dr Robertson the historian, Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PEMBERTON\">Pemberton</a>, Dr Wilson, Athenian Stuart, and Nourse the bookseller, were also among his particular friends; as well as Mr Rouse Boughton, afterwards Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> Rouse Boughton, Bart., to whose urbanity and thorough acquaintance with the Persian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> he was indebted for several of his historical documents. He obtained additional information for the completion of his History from the French General de Bussy, who had been much concerned in some of the transactions narrated in his first volume, and who was so much satisfied with his candour and impartiality, that he invited him to his house in the country, and entertained him there, in 1773, with great kindness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITALITY\">hospitality</a>.\n\nAfter the publication of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> volume of his History, he had ample leisure to amuse himself with literary pursuits of a more general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>: but in 1784, he suffered a severe affliction from the loss of his nephew, Mr Hosea, who was shipwrecked, with his wife and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, upon their return from India, on board of the Grosvenor. In 1792, he retired to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EALING\">Ealing</a>, where he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to reside till the time of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, which happened on the 13th January 1801.\n\nGood <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> judgment were the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> features of his character: his works are more distinguished by simplicity, clearness, and precision, than by any very powerful eloquence, or a very nice discrimination of character. He was not, however, deficient either in command of language or in poetical feeling. Sir William Jones and Dr Robertson paid him some very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> compliments, in their private correspondence, for the elegance and purity of his style: the former of these writers has also characterized him, in his third Discourse, as possessing \"an exquisite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> for every fine art.\" We find also, among a few miscellaneous poems collected by his biographer, a remarkable little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADDRESS\">Address</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">Moon</a>, written at Madras in 1757, which is manifestly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> of a well known Greek epigram and a Latin ode of Sir William Jones: and certainly the compliment of having been \"set to music, and much admired,\" must be considered as far inferior to that of having been repeatedly imitated and translated by a poet of a judgment so correct and a taste so refined, and having been called the production of \"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of great talents, and a particular friend of the translator.\"\n\n1. Of his works, the earliest, in its origin, was his General Idea of the Government and People of Indostan. It was principally written in 1752, and finished during his return to England in the next year. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of it was prefixed to his Military History, and it is printed in its entire state among his posthumous works.\n\n2. History of the Military Transactions of the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">Nation</a> in Indostan, from the year 1745. Vol. I, extending to 1756. 4to. Lond. 1763. Ed. 3, with an excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">index</a>, 1781. A Dissertation on the Mahommedan Conquests and Establishments in Indostan is prefixed to this volume. \"No historian,\" says the author of the Annual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGISTER\">Register</a> for 1764, \"seems to have been more perfectly informed of the subject on which he has undertaken to write: and very few have possessed more fully the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a> of impressing it, in the clearest and most vivid manner, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> and understanding of his reader.\"\n\nThe Second Volume, published in 1778, carries the history <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to the peace of 1763.\n\n3. Historical Fragments of the Mogul Empire, from the year 1659. 8vo. Lond. 1782. First published anonymously, but acknowledged and reprinted in 4to in 1805; together with the Origin of the English Establishment at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROACH\">Broach</a> and Surat, the General Idea of the Government and People of Indostan, and a Life of the Author. The Historical Fragments is a work of considerable research, making a sort of episode to the Military History, to which it affords some additions and corrections: it relates principally to the sanguinary Arungzebe and his immediate successors, and to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">contemporary</a>, Sevagi the \"Morattoe,\" the professed descendant of Porus. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> on the Trade of Surat is a fragment which was left unfinished by the author.\n\n4. Several hundred volumes of Mr Orme's manuscript collections, together with some scarce printed tracts, relating to Oriental history, are carefully preserved in the library of the East India Company.\n\n[Life prefixed to the Historical Fragments.

His father afterwards removed to Giggleswick, being appointed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of the school at that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>. Here his son was trained under his immediate inspection, and discovered a solidity of understanding, and a studiousness of disposition, which gave a fair <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARNEST\">earnest</a> of his future eminence.\n\nIn November 1758, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of fifteen, he was admitted a sizar of Christ's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">College</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>; and in October 1759, he became a resident member. When he left home, his father could not refrain from expressing to his friends the anticipations he entertained of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> which his son was destined to make. \"He'll turn out a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>\u2014very great. He has by far the clearest head I ever met with.\"\n\nShortly after his removal to Cambridge, he obtained three scholarships. He was not at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> laborious student; he spent much time in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a>, and improved himself rather by observation and reflection than by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a>. When he appeared in the public school to make his first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a>, the spruceness of his dress presenting a striking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTRAST\">contrast</a> to the habitual carelessness of his appearance, attracted very particular notice, and, aided by a singularity in his gestures and manner, occasioned much mirth among the spectators; but the uncommon success with which he acquitted himself had the effect of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> crowds on all future occasions when he was expected to dispute. His eminent abilities created on one occasion some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a>, when he proposed to argue against the eternity of future punishments. One of the heads of the college insisted on his relinquishing that question. Dr Watson, then Moderator, and afterwards the celebrated Bishop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LLANDAFF\">Llandaff</a>, protected, on this occasion, Paley's independence. The latter, however, was averse to give offence; and at the suggestion of Dr Watson he retained the subject, but took the opposite side. He\ncame off with much eclat, his talents having received the best scope for display from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> ability of his opponent, Mr Frere.\n\nAfter obtaining, with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a>, his bachelor's degree in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1763, he accepted of the situation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> assistant and Latin teacher in an Academy at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREENWICH\">Greenwich</a>, chiefly resorted to by young men intended for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">navy</a>.\n\nIn 1765, Mr Paley gained the first senior bachelor's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIZE\">prize</a> by a Latin dissertation on \"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> between the Stoic and Epicurean <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">Philosophy</a> in their influence on morals;\" taking the side of the Epicureans, as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">sect</a> friendly to rational pleasures, and not (as their enemies supposed) indulgent to vicious excesses; while he condemned the affected austerity of the followers of Zeno, and showed, from facts, that it was compatible with the most flagitious crimes. It is a remarkable circumstance, as illustrative of the formality which often presides in university matters, that this dissertation narrowly escaped rejection, because the Latin text was accompanied by English Notes, for the purpose of aiding philosophical accuracy where the Latin appeared liable to ambiguity.\n\nBeing ordained deacon at the proper age, he officiated as curate to Dr Hinchcliffe, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VICAR\">Vicar</a> of Greenwich, where he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to reside, though he gave up his situation in the Academy.\n\nMr Paley was elected a fellow on the foundation of Christ's College in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 1766; returned to reside in the University; took the degree of Master of Arts; and engaged in the business of private tuition. He took <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a>'s orders in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> 1767, and in 1768 he was appointed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TUTOR\">tutor</a> of Christ's College, along with his friend Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">Law</a>, already a distinguished scholar. The talents and assiduity of these two quickly raised the celebrity of their college to an unprecedented height. Paley's intimacy with Law was productive of much mutual improvement, and introduced the former to the acquaintance of his friend's father, the eminent Dr Edmund Law, who was soon after Bishop of Carlisle, but continued to reside in the university as master of Peterhouse. Mr Paley was at this time held in the highest esteem, and among his particular friends were numbered Dr Plumptre, Professor of Casuistry, Dr Waring, Lucanian Professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">Mathematics</a>, who was in his department eminent beyond his contemporaries, and the accomplished Mr Jebb. He figured as a lecturer on mathematics, morals, and the Greek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a>, and afterwards on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a>. His method of lecturing was singularly happy; the result of a diligent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of the art of teaching. He soon discovered that, in moral disquisitions, more pains are required to make young minds perceive the difficulty than to make them understand the solution; and that some curiosity must be raised before an attempt is made to satisfy it. The discourses which he delivered at this time contained the germ of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> works which he afterwards published on morals and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEOLOGY\">theology</a>.\n\nThe controversy on the propriety of requiring a subscription to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>, as practised by the Church of England, was at this time much agitated at the two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">universities</a>. At <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a> the High Church party was triumphant, and scarcely any individual ventured a whisper of opposition; but at Cambridge talents and ingenuity were exercised on both sides of the question. Paley favoured the claims of the reforming party; but, from motives of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a>, declined signing a petition for relief at that time drawn up; not entertaining such expectations of ultimate success as to be induced to take a public step so obnoxious to those on whom his future prospects depended. He told one of his friends in jest, that \"he could not afford to keep a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a>;\" a confession which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> doubt, lay him open to the animadversions of those who reserve their censures for the subdued struggles of a mind of limited moral strength, while they excuse or applaud the oppressive system by which its efforts are overawed. Paley, however, soon after wielded his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEN\">pen</a> in a decided tone in the cause of freedom. Dr Law, the Bishop of Carlisle, published an able and moderate pamphlet against the imposition of the Church Test. An answer appeared at Oxford from the pen of Dr Randolph. To this Paley published, anonymously, a reply, entitled, A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">Defence</a> of the Considerations on the Propriety of the Church Test.\n\nHis well merited reputation induced that great constitutional lawyer, the late <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARL\">Earl</a> of Camden, to offer him the situation of tutor to his son, but his other engagements led him to decline the offer.\n\nIn 1775, he was inducted to the rectory of Musgrove in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WESTMORELAND\">Westmoreland</a>, worth about L. 80 a-year, presented to him by the Bishop of Carlisle. He now married Miss Hewit of Carlisle, and took a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARM\">farm</a> to improve his income; a speculation which he soon after gave up as unproductive. Next year, he was inducted to the vicarage of Dalston in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUMBERLAND\">Cumberland</a>.\n\nIn 1777, he was inducted to the vicarage of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLEBY\">Appleby</a>, worth about L. 200 a-year; and while in this situation he published a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a>, entitled, The Clergyman's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPANION\">Companion</a> in Visiting the Sick; in which he both evinced his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to the spiritual wants of his own flock, and conferred an obligation on his brethren, which has been acknowledged by the numerous and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> editions which it has undergone. In June 1780, he was installed a prebendary of the fourth stall, in the Cathedral of Carlisle, worth about L. 400 a-year; and in August 1782, on the promotion of his friend Mr Law to the see of Clontert, he was raised to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> of archdeacon of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIOCESE\">diocese</a>.\n\nA report was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> in circulation, that Mr Paley, being appointed to preach before the University of Cambridge when Mr Pitt made his first appearance at St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>'s after his elevation to the premiership, chose the following passage for his text: \"There is a lad here who hath five barley loaves and two fishes, but what are they among so many?\" That was not the fact; but the joke originated with Paley, who said to a friend that, had he been asked to preach on the occasion, he would have chosen this text.\n\nNow in possession of a competent income, and sufficient leisure, he prepared for the press his great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> On the Principles of Moral and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">Political</a> Philosophy, which first appeared in 1785. In conse-\nquence of the well known merit of his lectures on the subject of that work, high expectations were formed of it; and his admirers were not disappointed. Its most obvious feature was that of being all directed to the practice of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> which hourly claim the attention of well meaning minds. Most other scientific works on morals were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a> treatises, which pleased the reader by unfolding the principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> and wrong, in cases in which he has been previously satisfied about the practical rule and its application; while they embarrassed conscientious inquirers with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>-breadth distinctions, instead of conveying satisfactory principles. Dr Paley's work happily unites a due regard for practical duty with rational information on those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> on which the mind is most anxious to obtain satisfaction. It soon established the reputation of its author. Some of his doctrines met with opposition; but he never was provoked to write any reply; and it is further remarked by his biographer, Mr Meadley, that, in the subsequent editions, he made no alterations materially affecting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>. Had there been a few such alterations, however, he would have more fully merited the character of a liberal inquirer.\u2014Among his elucidations of the foundations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>, he certainly fails in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> of \"the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of obligation.\" He acknowledges that the subject had embarrassed his own mind; yet he ultimately reposes in a solution founded on a confusion of terms, which laid him fully open to the animadversions of the Reverend Mr Pearson, who published An <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">Examination</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">Theory</a>. Dr Paley's doctrine is, that \"a man is under moral obligation when he is urged by a violent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a> resulting from the command of another.\" He thus resolves obligation into an effectual inducement. According to this statement, a man is under no moral obligation unless he feels, acknowledges, and acts upon it. Had such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> occurred in the writings of an author who made the purity of practice to depend on the reception of peculiar theories, it might have created great laxity of principle in the minds of some persons and distress in those of others. But his masterly elucidation of the rule of morals, and the paternal benignity with which his efforts are uniformly accompanied, set his reader at rest from all hurtful anxiety on practical topics.\n\nHis exposition of the rule of morals, as founded in utility, is ably managed. He demonstrates the superiority of this rule to every other, and the subordinate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of all those mental suggestions and impressions, which some moralists have represented as essential parts of the foundation of morality. Many such feelings are valuable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> of the Author of our nature; but they do not deserve the authority of guides. Their whole claim to our obedience is derived either from their coincidence with some express command of the Deity, or their conduciveness to utility. The difficulties attending inquiries into this conduciveness in particular instances do not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATE\">generate</a> uncertainties so great as those attached to the other supposed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> tests of moral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>. A man may be mistaken respecting the useful or hurtful tendency of a particular line of conduct; but he is equally liable to be led astray by feelings venerated as moral suggestions; and under that influence, he is deprived of an equal possibility of correcting himself by subsequent reflection. When authors declaim on the danger attached to the doctrine of utility, they borrow their arguments from that doctrine itself. They merely set up utility in its extensive application against such utilities as are partial and delusive. Dr Paley, therefore, dwells strongly on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> and importance of general rules; and by taking them for his guides, obviates all the serious objections brought against his leading theorem, \"that the method of coming at the will of God concerning any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> of nature, is to inquire into the tendency of that action to promote or diminish the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>.\"\n\nOn our duties to ourselves his observations are short, at which we cannot be surprised when we find that in his definition of virtue these duties are excluded. In the excellent casuistical Observations on Self Defence, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRUNKENNESS\">Drunkenness</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUICIDE\">Suicide</a>, of which this portion of his work entirely consists, he regards the tendency of personal conduct and habits only as they affect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> around us. Had he paid more respect to the maxims of the stoical authors, and studied them in their most favourable meaning, he would have been more disposed to point out the importance of maintaining mental composure as an ultimate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of individual efforts. On our duties towards God he also treats briefly. The simplicity attached to our knowledge of their great Object divests them of variety as a separate subject, without detracting from their sublimity.\n\nIn the political <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of this work, we find the exertions of a manly understanding employed with some success in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> the dark bigotry and the gratuitous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a>-worship by which political knowledge had in past ages been disgraced. His efforts, however, are exempt from those headstrong tendencies which minds liberated from unfair control sometimes betray, to run into schemes incapable of being applied without compromising the happiness of society. That happiness he keeps steadily in view, as the only legitimate object of all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, as well as the only legitimate object of opposition to existing practices and institutions. Some of his admirers consider him as going too great lengths in vindicating the execution of a subscription to the Thirty-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> Articles. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> on subscription has been assailed with equal asperity by the strenuous adherents of the established church, and by the scrupulous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a> for Protestant freedom. His biographer, Mr Meadley, calls it \"the last effort of an ingenious mind to soften, by interpretation, the rigour of a practice of which he could not seriously approve, and so to enlarge the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> of conformity to liberal and conscientious men.\"\n\nThe answer which he gives to the arguments for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSIVE\">passive</a> obedience as founded in Scripture is particularly worthy of attention. Through the whole he displays a candour of the most conciliating kind. None of his strictures on existing systems had the slightest tendency to give offence to any, except to persons actuated by downright <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a>, or the most corrupt motives.\nOn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Dr Law, Bishop of Carlisle, which happened in 1787, Mr Paley published a short Memoir of the life of that venerable prelate. Soon after he wrote two tracts in favour of \"the abolition of the slave trade;\" a subject on which he had expressed his sentiments with decision in his Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy, before it began to excite general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>.\n\nIn 1790 he published his Hor\u00e6 Paulinae, or the Truth of the Scripture <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> of St Paul evinced, by a comparison of the Epistles which bear his name, with the Acts of the Apostles, and with one another. The object was to show, by a copious selection of references and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECIPROCAL\">reciprocal</a> allusions, the strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> of their genuineness derived from their undesigned coincidence. This able treatise possesses more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a> of interest, and greater originality of idea, than any of his other works.\n\nDuring the political ferment which led to the French Revolution, Dr Paley published a short tract, entitled, Reasons for Contentment, addressed to the Labouring Classes; and he republished, in a separate form, his chapter On the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">Constitution</a>, from his Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy. He was censured by the violent partisans on both sides, as he went the full lengths of neither; but his style of reasoning had the best tendency to guide and satisfy those minds which were not obstinately and unreasonably prepossessed.\n\nIn May 1791, Mrs Paley died, leaving a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> of four sons and four daughters.\n\nEarly in 1794 he published his View of the Evidences of Christianity. This work, with regard to manner and effect, follows a happy medium between that learned prolixity which deters the reader, or tires out his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a>, and that abrupt brevity which is apt, with some minds, to beget an unfortunate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> of some imperfection in the argument. He contends for the substantial truth of the history connected with the Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVELATION\">revelation</a>; and, not undervaluing, as some have injudiciously done, the internal evidences, he exhibits, in primitive simplicity, and without the least oratorical exaggeration, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUPERLATIVE\">superlative</a> value of those doctrines in which all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> are agreed, and gives an animated view of the morality of the gospel. The work, considered as addressed to doubting minds, was well fitted to interest the attention of all who are duly impressed with the importance of the question at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a>.\n\nHitherto his preferment in the church had been slender, considering his singular merit and the opulence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> establishment. The boldness of his reasonings on political subjects had given deep dissatisfaction. To the favourers of power, it was not welcome doctrine, that \"governments may be too secure;\" that \"the obligations of subjects and sovereigns are reciprocal;\" and \"that the divine right of Kings rests on the same foundation with the divine right of Constables.\" But when he stood forth as the successful defender of the Christian revelation, at a time when the interests of the church were supposed to be in danger, his services met with more marked attention. Dr Porteus, Bishop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, conferred on him the desirable situation of prebend of St Pancras in the cathedral of St Paul's, to which he was instituted in August 1794. He was in a few months after promoted to the sub-deanery of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LINCOLN\">Lincoln</a> by Dr Prettyman, Bishop of that diocese, and took his degree of D.D. at Cambridge.\n\nBefore leaving this place, he had the agreeable surprise of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> from Dr Barrington, Bishop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURHAM\">Durham</a>, offering him the valuable rectory of Bishop-Wearmouth, worth about L. 1200 a-year, into which he was soon inducted. A few months after he married Miss Dobinson of Carlisle, and, from this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> to his death, divided his time between Bishop-Wearmouth and Lincoln; being obliged to reside three months in the year at the latter place. Now that he enjoyed a handsome independence, we find his company courted by many distinguished <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a>, and his life spent in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of the most useful labours, while all his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SECULAR\">secular</a> transactions were so well conducted, as to shed a lustre on his character, and to exhibit a most instructive example to all around him. Both his parents lived to witness his high reputation and success in life. His mother died in 1796, and his father in 1799.\n\nIn 1800, Dr Paley was attacked by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> in the kidneys, accompanied with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of melena, which obliged him to suspend the discharge of his professional duties. He had a second attack in the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>, and a third about the end of 1802.\n\nDuring the progress of this fatal disease, he was engaged in preparing for the press his last important work On Natural Theology. His literary labours were frequently interrupted by severe paroxysms of pain, but on the first respite, he always resumed them with cheerfulness. Under these circumstances, he wrote his excellent remarks on the alleviations of pain, in his chapter On the Goodness of the Deity.\u2014This work had been undertaken at the suggestion of the Bishop of Durham, that he might, by theological exertions in his closet, make up for the unavoidable suspension of his public ecclesiastical labours. In none of his writings does his candour appear to such incontestible advantage as in this. We never find him brow-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEATING\">beating</a> the adversary, or attempting to push his conclusions a single step farther than his premises evidently warrant. We do not find him with many others advancing the metaphysical position, \"that every thing which exists must have a cause,\" so glaringly open to the query, \"why should the world have a cause more than its Creator?\" Mere existence cannot authorize the inference of owing that existence to a higher source. He rests his argument on far better ground,\u2014the character of the fabric of nature, or rather of various objects in it which offer themselves to our observation. Nor does he, with some, assume the doctrine, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> is essentially inert, and that, therefore, its motions must be induced by an extraneous and spiritual cause. He more wisely turns his attention to the proofs of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> which so many objects in the world exhibit. These are so selected and arranged, as to appear in the most interesting and satisfactory point of view. Where the phenomena are apparently inconsistent, we find no straining to reconcile them; no reluctance to take a full view of unfavourable appearances; no inclination to draw the same inferences from opposite facts. His argument is not\nsuspended on a chain of metaphysical reasoning, which would have subjected it to the risk of destruction as soon as one of the links gives way. He directs the attention of his reader to numerous columnar supports of the existence of a God, each of which is adequate to the whole office. Each instance adduced is decisive of the point at issue; and though his instances are numerous as well as beautiful, they are evidently only partial exemplifications of a species of evidence which is boundless in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>.\n\nIn the present state of the learned world, this is the most important of Dr Paley's works; as possessing the best tendency to reclaim persons wandering in the mazes of scepticism to that state of thought which is most favourable to the true improvement of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> character; and to the establishment of that state of mental peace after which a sense of our weakness naturally leads us to aspire.\n\nAfter its publication, Dr Paley continued to take a lively interest in the literary and scientific discussions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>; especially such as bore directly on the great interests of society; but in May 1805, he was subjected to a violent attack of his complaint, in which all remedies proved ineffectual; and, with great tranquillity, he breathed his last at Bishop-Wearmouth, leaving a family of four sons and four daughters in possession of a competent fortune, saved by a systematic, though by no means a niggardly economy.\n\nHe wrote several sermons and other minor productions, less known than those above enumerated. They are all collected in a uniform edition of his works, and will be found, on examination, worthy of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>, and successfully directed to the same valuable ends with his more celebrated productions.\n\n(P. R.)","sp":128,"ep":132},{"h":"PALLAS","t":"a distinguished naturalist and geographer, born 22d September 1741, was the son of Simon Pallas, a surgeon in the Prussian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, and Professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SURGERY\">Surgery</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BERLIN\">Berlin</a>.\n\nHe received the early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> in his father's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, and his instructors bore ample testimony to the rapidity of his progress. At the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of fifteen he began to attend medical lectures, and he applied so closely to practical anatomy, that in 1758 he was found qualified to deliver a course of public lectures on that science. In the same year he went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HALLE\">Halle</a>, and became the pupil of Segner, continuing also his studies of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZOOLOGY\">zoology</a>, and in particular of entomology, with great assiduity. In 1759 he removed to G\u00f6ttingen, where he made a variety of experiments on poisons, and on other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> medical substances, and commenced his observations on parasitical animals. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> 1760 he went on to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEYDEN\">Leyden</a>, in order to attend the lectures of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALBINUS\">Albinus</a>, Gaubius, and Musschenbroek, and at the end of the same year he took his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">Doctor</a> of Physic. The following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> he proceeded to England, principally with the view of completing his medical education, although he devoted the greater part of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> to the active pursuit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, being assisted and encouraged by the friendship of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a> Collinson, and of some other British naturalists, which procured for him a few years afterwards the distinction of having his name inserted in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of the Foreign Members of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a>, at the early age of twenty three. He visited several parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of England, in order to examine its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">marine</a> productions, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of natural history enabled him to profit in a similar manner by an accident which detained him some time at Harwich, on his return to the Continent, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> of 1762.\n\nHaving paid a visit to his native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, he went again to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAGUE\">Hague</a>, and established himself as a resident there under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRONAGE\">patronage</a> of Gaubius. On occasion of the publication of a miscellaneous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> on zoology, which he dedicated to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">Prince</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">Orange</a>, he proposed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> for an expedition to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> of Good Hope, and to the Dutch East Indies, which he offered to conduct in person; but although the project was encouraged by Gaubius, and approved by the Prince, his father's interference prevented its execution, and obliged him to return to Berlin. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FILIAL\">filial</a> affection, however, was not strong enough to induce him to refuse the invitation of the Empress Catharine to Petersburg, where he accepted, in the year 1767, the appointment of Professor of Natural History in the Imperial Academy of Sciences.\n\nThe first few months of his residence at St Petersburg were employed in preparing his Zoological Glomings for publication, and in making catalogues of some collections of natural history. It was now that the more active <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAREER\">career</a> of his public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> was about to commence, and in 1768 he undertook, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> with Falk, Lepechin, and Guldenstadt, the conduct of an expedition sent out by the Empress for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> purposes of observing the transit of Venus, and of investigating the natural history and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">geography</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIBERIA\">Siberia</a>, and the neighbouring countries. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of their researches for the first summer was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KASAN\">Kasan</a>, and the winter was passed at Simbirsk; the next year they examined the shores of the Caspian, and the borders of Calmuc <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TARTARY\">Tartary</a>; they returned through Orenburg, and passed the winter at Ufa. In 1770 Pallas crossed the Uralian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> to Catharinenburg, and, after examining the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> in that neighbourhood, proceeded to Tobolsk. The next year he went to the Altaic mountains, traced the course of the Irtish to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KOLYVAN\">Kolyvan</a>, went on to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TOMSK\">Tomsk</a>, and observed the natural freezing of quicksilver at Krasnoyarsk, on the Yenisiei, in latitude 56\u00b0 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>. He proceeded in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 1772 by Irkutsk across the Lake <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAIKAL\">Baikal</a>, as far as Kiatka, and returned to Krasnoyarsk. In 1773 he visited Tara, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRACAN\">Astracan</a>, and Tzaritzin, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLGA\">Volga</a>, and returned to St Petersburg in 1774, after an absence of six years. About ten years later he was made a member of the Board of Mines, with an additional salary of L. 200 a year, and he was complimented with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNIGHT\">Knight</a> of St Vladimir. The Empress purchased his collection of natural history for a price one third greater than his demand, and allowed him, at the same time, to keep it in his possession for the remainder of his life.\n\nIn 1794 he took a journey into the Crimea, and was captivated with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> and its productions; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> also appearing to be such as his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> was supposed to require, he obtained from his munificent patroness not only permission to establish himself there, but a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> and fertile estate, and a sum of 10,000 rubles.\nto assist him in his outfit. He was thus enabled to build a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a>, rather than a country house, in which a traveller from the North of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> was sure to receive the most obliging <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITALITY\">hospitality</a>, as Dr Clarke has made well known to the English reader. It appears, however, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> was not altogether exempt from the miasmas, which are the causes of paludal fevers; and some other circumstances, besides the distance from all civilized society, seem to have made the old age of Pallas more cheerless than he had anticipated to find it, in the independence and tranquillity of his patriarchal establishment at Akmetshet. About ten years after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of Dr Clarke's travels, he undertook a journey to Berlin to pay a visit to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>, and died there in September 1811.\n\nLinnaeus the younger has given him a genus, *Pallasia*, in his *Supplementum Plantarum*; a compliment to which his unremitting labours, in every department of natural history, had amply entitled him. His collection of dried <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> was purchased by Dr Clarke's fellow traveller, Mr Cripps, and is now in the possession of Mr Aylmer Bourke Lambert.\n\nThe general character of Professor Pallas's acquirements appears to have been that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> and variety, together with fidelity. He was not the author of any new theories, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> improved systems; and it has sometimes been observed, as by Murray in his *System of Vegetables*, that his descriptions were somewhat defective from the omission of correct specific distinctions; but this omission is of such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> as to affect a compiler, or a book-maker, more than an actual student of natural history, who is studying for his own improvement only, and who is capable of entering into a detailed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of the objects concerned. To such a detail the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> part of Professor Pallas's works have related; and it is impossible to enumerate the whole of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMOIRS\">memoirs</a> without making a pretty extensive catalogue of the productions of the various kingdoms of nature.\n\n1. *His Dissertatio Inauguralis de Infestis Viventibus intra Viventia*, 4. Leyd. 1760; containing a systematic account of intestinal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORMS\">worms</a>, is said to have been previously published in another form at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOTTINGEN\">Gottingen</a>, a short time before he went to Leyden. 2. We find in the *Philosophical Transactions* for 1763, p. 62, a short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> On the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">Cold</a> observed at Berlin the preceding winter. 3. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> for 1766, p. 186, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of the jaculator fish, or *Sciama jaculatoria* of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> Ocean, which catches insects by darting drops of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> at them; this description is repeated in the *Spicilegia Zoologica*, Fasc. 8. 4. *Elemen-chus Zoophytorum*, 8.

A translation of this discourse is inserted in *Tocke's Russian Empire*, and some remarks on it are found in the *Journal de Physique*, Vol. XIII.\n\n12. The most considerable of the separate publications of Pallas was the account of his travels, entitled *Reise durch verschiedene provizen des Russischen Reichs*, 3 vols. 4. Petersburg, 1771-3-6; French, 8vo, 8. Par. 1803; English, 2v. 4. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, 1812; a work of the highest authority in geography and natural history. 13. It was in the course of these travels that Pallas observed in Siberia an insulated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, which he described in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, addressed to the Royal Society of London, and printed in the *Philosophical Transactions* for 1776, p. 523; a substance which has become the\nsubject of many discussions, from its resemblance to some of the specimens of well ascertained aerolites; the author mentions also the remains of an unmineralised rhinoceros, which had been found in the same country.\n\n14. In the Besch\u00e4ftigungen Naturforschenden Freunden, published at Berlin about 1777, we find a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> on the Acipenser ruthenus, or Sturgeon, Vol. II. p. 532, and An Account of a Monstrous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">Horse</a>, Vol. III. p. 296. 15.

Another channel, in which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of Pallas's most valuable essays appeared, is the work entitled Neue Nordische Beitr\u00e4ge, which he published at St Petersburg and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LEIPZIG\">Leipzig</a>, in 1781 and the following years.

Dryander, Bibliotheca Banksianna.]\n\n(PANORAMA.\u2014A Panorama is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> drawn on the interior surface of a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a>, representing the objects that can be seen from one station, when the observer directs his eye successively to every point of the horizon. A picture drawn on a vertical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> in the usual way includes only that portion of the sphere of vision that can be seen from one point opposite to the picture, without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> the eye; this portion may comprehend about 60 degrees of the horizon. There Panoramas are compositions, comprehending the visible hemi-sphere, and sometimes nearly the whole sphere of vision; in these compositions, one connected <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> is represented on the interior surfaces of a polyhedron, or of a curved <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a>, the point of sight being in the centre of the polyhedron, and the eye being turned round on its centre, to each of the surfaces, in order to view the whole scene. Of this kind are the gnomonic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROJECTION\">projection</a> of the sphere on the interior surfaces of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUBE\">cube</a>, and several pictures, in which one connected subject is represented on the ceiling and the sides of a room; such as the picture of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a> fulminating the Giants, by Julio Romano, on the walls and hemispherical ceiling of a round room in the Palazzo del T, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANTUA\">Mantua</a>; or the architectural representations and ornaments in Raphael's loggia in the Vatican. Objects are also sometimes projected on the interior surface of a sphere, the eye being placed in the centre; as in a large hollow sphere with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSTELLATIONS\">constellations</a>, which was constructed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEMBROKE\">Pembroke</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">College</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>. These projections, where the eye, remaining in the point of sight, is turned round on its centre to view the different parts of the picture, are formed on the same principle as the panorama.\n\nThe cylindrical surface is the most convenient for Cylindrical panoramas of landscapes; and the specific employment of a large cylindrical surface for representing the landscape of the whole circle of the horizon, is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of Mr Barker, who brought the panorama into use, and still continues to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> his art. The cylinder on which the panorama is painted is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> about 60 feet in diameter. The projection or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSPECTIVE\">perspective</a> of a panorama is formed by imaginary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> drawn from different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of the surrounding objects, to the point of sight in the axis of the cylinder. The intersections of these lines with the cylindrical surface form the corresponding points in the panoramic picture. Where the picture is projected on a plane, as in common perspective, and in the gnomonic projection of the sphere, the cones formed by imaginary lines or rays passing from the point of sight to the different objects, are cut by the plane of the picture; consequently, the sections being formed by a plane, are curves, of which the curvature is always simple. In the perspective of the panorama, where the picture consists of the intersection of the cones of rays by a cylinder, these intersections are, in many of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, doubly curved curves. When the picture of a straight line, which is neither <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to the horizon nor to the axis of the cylinder, is drawn on the cylinder of the panorama, the picture of the line is part of an ellipse, because the oblique <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> cylinder, by a plane passing through the axis, is an ellipse; when the cylinder is developed and unrolled on a plane surface, this ellipse becomes the curve called the sinical curve. The projection of lines on the interior surface of a cylinder is also employed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> Mercator's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CHARTS\">charts</a>. But in the projection of the panorama, the field extends only a few degrees above and below the horizon, whereas, in the projections\nPanorama of the sphere, the field extends many degrees on each side of the plane, which is at right <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> to the axis of the cylinder. In drawing a panorama, as well as in drawing a picture on a plane, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> angles between different objects may be observed by a plane <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> or theodolite; and the elevation of the objects above the horizon, or their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPRESSION\">depression</a>, may also be observed by the theodolite: the horizontal angles are to be laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> by setting off on the graduated horizon of the cylindrical picture the number of degrees observed; the vertical angles on the cylinder are the tangents of the angles observed, the radius being the semidiameter of the cylinder.","sp":132,"ep":135},{"h":"PANTOGRAPH","t":"an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> contrived for the purpose of copying drawings, so that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> may either be of the same size, of a greater, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> of a less size than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a>. It consists of four moveable rulers fixed together by four pivots, and forming a parallelogram. At the extremity of one of these rulers prolonged is a point, which is drawn over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> of the original <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a>, whilst a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a>, fixed at the end of another branch of the instrument, traces on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> the lines of the copy. The pencil is placed in a hollow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a>, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> is added on the top of the pencil; by this means, the point of the pencil is made to press on the paper with the force requisite for drawing the lines. The improvements in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of different parts of the pantograph described in the Memoires de l'Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences, 1743, have been generally adopted. The pantograph, however, is not found convenient in practice; and, for the purpose of copying maps, plans, and other designs, artists most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> employ the method of dividing the original <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of squares, and the paper on which the copy is to be made into the same number of squares. When this is done, they copy the lines contained within each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> of the original, so as to form a similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> within the corresponding square of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RETICULA\">reticula</a> which covers the copy. When the drawing consists of straight lines, a reduced copy is accurately made by means of an isosceles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a>, in which the base is to the side as any line of the copy is to the corresponding line in the original. By setting off with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPASSES\">compasses</a> any line of the original drawing on the sides of the triangle, the base which completes the triangle is the length of the corresponding line to be laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> on the copy. The same operation is performed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTOR\">sector</a>.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> a drawing is to be copied, of the same size as the original, without diminution or enlargement, engravers usually trace the copy on oiled paper laid over the original, or on the transparent papier de guimauve (marsh-mallow paper), made in France.\n\nA pantograph has been made, consisting of a rod, placed vertically, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> round a fixed point in its length, situated between its upper and lower extremity: the upper end of the rod being a point which is conducted by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> over the lines of the original drawing; the lower end of the rod being the pencil which traces the copy on paper. An instrument upon this principle is sometimes used for drawing the profile of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a>, in order to form small portraits or silhouettes.\n\nThe instrument called Micrograph and Prosopograph in Puissant's Geodesie, does not differ in principle from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> pantograph.\n\nA very ingenious instrument for copying drawings, either upon a reduced or enlarged scale, has been lately invented by Mr Wallace, Professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">Mathematics</a> in the University of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>. Of this instrument, which may be fitly introduced under the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, though differing in name, we have been favoured with the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>.\n\nIt is a fact well known, that artists of various descriptions, who have frequent occasion to imitate original designs, have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> felt the want of a convenient mathematical instrument, by which a copy may be made with neatness and expedition, that shall have any given proportion to the original. The Pantograph is the only instrument that has been hitherto employed; but although correct and plausible in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a>, in practice it is found to be so very imperfect, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a> hardly ever thinks of making <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of it.\n\nA consideration of the essential <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> that would be rendered to the graphic art, by a copying instrument, which should be at once simple in its theory and easy in its application, induced Mr Wallace to turn his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to the subject; and, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> of 1821, he produced the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> of a copying instrument, which he has denominated an Eido-\n\ngraph (from \u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 and \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd). The instrument, and its application to the copying of a great variety of subjects, has been shown to engineers, engravers, and other competent judges in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> and in Edinburgh, and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of its utility has been such as to leave <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> doubt of its completely fulfilling the views of the inventor.\n\nThe instrument is represented in this figure:\nThe beam, A B, which is made of mahogany, slides backward and forward in a socket, C; the socket turns on a vertical axis, supported by the fulcrum D, which stands on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>. There is a slit in the beam, through which the axis of the socket passes, so that, when the beam slides in the socket, a portion of it passes on each side of the axis. There are two equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHEELS\">wheels</a>, E, E, below the beam, which turn on axes that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PIPES\">pipes</a> fixed at A, B, near its extremities; and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a> chain passes over the wheels as a band, by which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROTATION\">rotation</a> may be communicated from the one to the other. There are two arms, F, F, which slide in sockets along the lower face of the wheels, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> under their centres: at the extremity, G, of one arm, there is a metal tracer, with a handle attached to it, by which its point may be carried over the lines in any design; and at H, the extremity of the other arm, there is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK_LEAD\"><a class=\"</a>xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> pencil fixed in a metal tube, which is ground to fit so exactly into a pipe, as just to slide up or down. In using the instrument, the pencil, in its tube, is raised by a thread which passes over a pulley, and it descends again by a weight with which it is loaded.\n\nFrom the perfect equality of the wheels, it is easy to see that, if the arms attached to them be placed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> in any one position, they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> retain their parallelism, although one of the wheels, and consequently both, be turned on their centres. Supposing, now, that BC and AC, the parts into which the axis is divided at the centre, have any proportion whatever to each other, if the distances of the tracing point G, and pencil point H, from the centres of their wheels have the very same proportion, then it follows, from the elements of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">geometry</a>, that the tracing point G, the centre C, and the pencil point H, will be in a straight line; and further, that CG and CH, the distance of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> from the centre, will have to each other the constant proportion of CB to CA, or of EG to AH. Such being the geometrical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of the Eidograph, if any subject to be copied be fixed to the table on which the instrument stands, and the tracing point be carried over every line of the design, the pencil point will trace a copy in all respects similar to the original.\n\nTo facilitate the adjustment of the instrument, so that the copy may have any given ratio to the original, there are scales of equal parts on the beam and the two arms: By these and verniers, both halves of the beam, and equal lengths on the arms, are each divided into 1000 equal parts, and at certain intervals corresponding numbers are marked on them. By means of the scales, when any ratio is assigned, the adjustment is made without the least difficulty.\n\nTo avoid any derangement by the chain slipping on the wheels, there are clamps at K and K, which hold it fast to the wheels at points where it never quits them.

Philosophical Dissertations on the Egyptians and Chinese, translated by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> J. Thomson, 2 v. 8. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, 1795. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> was undertaken, he observes, to show that \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> two nations ever resembled each other less than the Egyptians and the Chinese;\" and it must be admitted that he has sufficiently established his proposition. There is, indeed, one argument that he has employed, which appears to be founded on a mistake of the Greek historians of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>, who have asserted that the Egyptians had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> been in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of alphabetical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a>; and the want of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-ALPHABET\">alphabet</a> among the Chinese, is stated by M. de Pauw as affording a marked distinction from the Egyptians. There is, however, scarcely a shadow of resemblance in the particular hieroglyphical characters employed by the two nations, though the general system of beginning with a representation of a visible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>, and departing, more and more, by degrees, from the fidelity of the delineation, must necessarily have been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> to both. But it so happens, that out of about 70 Egyptian characters, which are compared by the Jesuits and Dr Morton with the Chinese in the Philosophical Transactions for 1769, there are about 20 of which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> has been ascertained with tolerable accuracy in the Article Egypt of this Supplement; and of these there is only one that happens to have been rightly determined by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> with the Chinese, excepting two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> three which are obviously <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> pictures, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">Moon</a> and a Bow. There is also a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of a chain, among the old Chinese characters, which agrees remarkably in its form with the Egyptian hieroglyphic employed as a copulative conjunction; and there is a still more striking coincidence, which M. Jomard has noticed, between the Egyptian and Chinese characters for a thousand, both of which he derives from the seed vessel of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOTUS\">lotus</a>, as containing a multitude of seeds; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the older Chinese characters be found to preserve this resemblance as perfectly as they ought to do, it must be confessed that the suspicion of a common origin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be much strengthened by the argument. Both the Egyptians and the Chinese were condemned, M. de Pauw observes, \"to an eternal mediocrity;\" and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of this observation is certainly not diminished by anything that has lately been inferred from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HIEROGLYPHICS\">hieroglyphics</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROSETTA\">Rosetta</a>.\n\n4. There are several papers of M. de Pauw on antiquarian subjects in the Memoirs of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> of Cassel, and one in particular On the Temple of Juno Lacinia, Vol. I. 1780.\n\n5. Recherches sur les Grecs, 2 v. 8. Berl. 1787. Philosophical Dissertations on the Greeks, translated by Thomson, 2 v. 8. Lond. 1793.

The Lacedemonians, the Aetolians, the Thessalians, and the Arcadians, are separately discussed, but considered as comparatively contemptible; the Lacedemonians in particular, and their successors, the Mantineotes, are treated with great severity, as a worthless <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of dishonourable vagabonds. The athletic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> of the Athenians is, however, highly applauded, from a visionary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of the importance of the physical perfection of the body to the operations of the mind.

It is situated between 56\u00b0 7' and 56\u00b0 35' north latitude, and between 3\u00b0 6' and 4\u00b0 47' west <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a>, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREENWICH\">Greenwich</a>. Its greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, from east to west, is about 77 miles, and from north to south 68. It was anciently, and is still, popularly divided into eight districts: Atholl on the north, Stormont on the north-east, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERTH\">Perth</a> Proper and Gowrie on the east, Strathearn on the south, Monteith on the southwest, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREADALBANE\">Breadalbane</a> on the west, and Rannoch on the north-west. It is under the jurisdiction of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SHERIFF\">sheriff</a>, who has substitutes in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> of Perth and Dunblane, and is divided into seventy-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> parishes.\n\nIn a general view, this extensive county may be divided into Highlands and Lowlands; the former occupying a space so much greater than the latter, that not quite so much as a third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the whole is fit for cultivation. This last portion is chiefly, though not without considerable exceptions, situated on the eastern and southern extremities, which contain some of the richest tracts in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>; and in the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STRATHMORE\">Strathmore</a> which has the Grampians on the north-west, and the Ochils and Sidlaw Hills on the east; varying in breadth from ten to fifteen miles, and extending through this and the contiguous counties, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> to sea, a distance of 100 miles. To the west, where the Grampians, at first rising gently, rear their rocky or heath-covered summits to the height of 4000 feet, and for almost the whole breadth of the county, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> grounds are penetrated by straths and glens, some of them of considerable extent, each traversed by its own mountain streams, and diversified by numerous lakes, many of which, having their wild and lofty banks covered with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> wood, present scenes singularly romantic and beautiful. At least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> are upwards of 3000 feet high: the three highest being Benlawers, on the west side of Loch Tay; Benmore, south-west; and Scheallion, north-east; the latter noted as the station chosen by Dr Maskelyne, Astronomer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a>, to make observations on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> of mountains. The most considerable lakes are\u2014Loch Tay, almost in the centre of the Highland district, about fifteen miles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, and one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, with a depth varying from fifteen to one hundred fathoms; Loch Erich, on the north-west, extending into Inverness-shire, still longer, but not so broad; Loch Rannoch, south-east of the former, twelve miles long; Loch Earn, south from Loch Tay; and Lochs Vennachar, Achray, and Katrine, on the south-west: the last of which, with the wild mountain scenery around it, called the Trosachs, has acquired deserved celebrity, from Sir Walter Scott's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">Lady</a> of the Lake. Most of the streams either have their source in these lochs, or receive, as they flow through them, a great accession to their waters. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> are the Tay, the Forth, the Earn, the Teath, and the Isla; of which the two first are by far the most considerable, though the Forth does not attain its full size till it has left this county. The Tay, the largest river in Scotland, and the Earn, belong exclusively to Perthshire. The Tay, under the name of the Dochart, has its source on the western confines, and soon after entering Loch Dochart, flows from thence north-east till it falls into Loch Tay. After leaving Loch Tay, from which it now takes its name, it pursues first a northerly and then a southerly course towards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUNKELD\">Dunkeld</a>, from which it proceeds eastward, and then south, through a very rich <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, till it falls into the Frith of that name, a little below the town of Perth; having been joined by the Almond and many other streams in its course, which, with all its windings, is not less than ninety miles. The salmon fishery on this river yields a rent of about L. 7000 a-year. South of Loch Tay is Loch Earn, where the river of that name has its source, and which, flowing east and south, through Strathearn and by the town of Crieff, after a course of twenty-four miles, falls into the Frith of Tay at Rhind. On the banks of this river, near its confluence with the Tay, is the village of Pitcaithly, long celebrated for its mineral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a>, which have lately found a rival at Dunblane, on the southern side of the county.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> of this extensive district, so different in elevation and exposure, varies considerably. In the central parts, the winters are stormy and very severe, the snow lying long, attended with keen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FROST\">frost</a>; and on the banks of the rivers in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>, hearfrosts are frequent in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, and very injurious to the crops. On the east, the climate is mild and salubrious. At Longforgan, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARSE\">Carse</a> of Gowrie, on the banks of the Frith of Tay, the thermometer, on an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> of twelve years, stood at 50\u00b0, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> annual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> was 24.496 inches; and at Belmont, in Strathmore, for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of ten years, the average height of the thermometer was 46.35, and the yearly quantity of rain during thirty years' observation 30.40 inches.\n\nPerthshire, as far as yet known, does not abound in useful minerals. There is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> coal but at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CULROSS\">Culross</a>, on a small detached tract lying on the Forth, south-east from the rest of the county; and, for want of coal, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">limestone</a>, which is found in many parts, is of little value, though it is sometimes imperfectly calcined by means of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEAT\">peat</a>. Some years ago, a machine was erected for pounding limestone, with the view of employing it in that state as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANURE\">manure</a>; but the experiment was not persisted in. In the higher grounds, the prevailing rock is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANITE\">granite</a>, and in the lower sandstone. Slates are found in many parts of the Highlands, but none in the low country. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COPPER\">Copper</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>, and ironstone, occur in some parts; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> of the two former were once worked, but are now abandoned. Shell <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARL\">marl</a>, which has been long used as a manure, abounds in Stormont and Strathearn, on the east side of the county.\n\nOn so great a variety of surface, every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> occurs that is found in Scotland. That which distinguishes this district, though it is not peculiar to\nit, is the alluvial soil on the banks of the rivers, which is of considerable extent, and in many parts of the richest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>. The Carse of Gowrie, in particular, a tract of about 18,000 acres, lying along the north and north-west banks of the Frith of Tay, has been long celebrated for its fertility. Here there are upwards of twenty orchards, of all sizes, from one to twenty-four acres each. Perthshire has all the kinds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAME\">game</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> in other parts of the Highlands of Scotland, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> and fallow deer, and roes, rabbits, pigeons, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POULTRY\">poultry</a>.\n\nThe territory of Perthshire was divided, in 1811, into 755 estates, of which 621 were under L. 500 Scots of valuation, and 95 above L. 2000; the valuation of the whole being L. 339,892, 6s. 9d. Scots, the highest of any of the Scottish counties excepting Fifehire. The real rent, as returned under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">Property</a>-Tax <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">Act</a> in 1811, was, for the lands, L. 460,738, 13s. 11d. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">Sterling</a>, and for the houses, L. 36,697, 19s. 7d. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a>-rent, which is more than that of any of the other counties by almost one-third, is equal to about a tenth part of the rent of all Scotland; yet it is only at the rate of about 5s. 6d. the English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACRE\">acre</a>. In the same year, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of freeholders entitled to vote in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a> of a member for the county was 178. There are more oak-woods, and these of a greater value, here than in all the rest of Scotland, and very extensive plantations of all sorts of trees, particularly larch, have been made within the last 50 years; of which, those of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">Duke</a> of Atholl are of great extent, and now of immense value. The county is much ornamented by the numerous seats of the proprietors, of whom 12 or 13 are noblemen. Among these are Blair Castle and Dunkeld <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">House</a>\u2014Duke of Atholl; Taymouth\u2014<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARL\">Earl</a> of Breadalbane; Scone\u2014Earl of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANSFIELD\">Mansfield</a>; Dupplin Castle\u2014Earl of Kinnoul; and Dunira\u2014<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Melville.\n\nThe general size of the farms in the Lowlands is from 100 to 300 acres. In the Highlands, the same system prevails that we have adverted to in describing the other Highland counties of Scotland; though here, as elsewhere, it is slowly giving way to one better adapted to the present times. In the crops, live stock, and general management of farms, we find nothing peculiar, except, perhaps, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAX\">flax</a> is cultivated to a greater extent than in the southern counties of Scotland. On the Carse of Gowrie, the highest rented land of the same extent in Britain, Perthshire, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> we except the immediate neighbourhood of a few great towns, the order of cropping, after a plain fallow is\u2014wheat, beans, and pease, barley with seeds, hay, and oats; and under this course, some of the best land yielded, so far back as 1795, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>-rent of 31s. with three bushels of wheat, and about four and a half bushels of barley\u2014altogether, at the prices during the late <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, equal to four guineas the Scots acre.\n\nThis county has only two royal burghs, Perth the Towns-county town, and Culross. Perth is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of great antiquity, formerly the usual residence of the Scottish sovereigns, who were crowned at Scone in its vicinity, and the seat of parliaments and courts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>. Some of the most important events in Scottish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, both of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> description, occurred here. (See the article Perth in the Encyclopaedia.) It is now a well built thriving town, containing (in 1811) about 17,000 inhabitants. About 70 other towns and villages are scattered over the county, the most considerable of which have been already described in the Encyclopaedia.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a> of Perthshire are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a>, cotton, Manufacture-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, and a variety of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINOR\">minor</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a>.

By comparing places under the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a>, we find that this change is not sudden, but progressive. Petersburg, on the same parallel with Upsal, is 5\u00b0 colder, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOSCOW\">Moscow</a> is 5\u00b0 colder than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COPENHAGEN\">Copenhagen</a>. The annual temperature of West <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GREENLAND\">Greenland</a> in lat. 70\u00b0, which is 17\u00b0 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> 18\u00b0, according to Sir C. Gieseck\u00e9, is very nearly the mean between that of the North <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> and Melville <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">Island</a>, as its intermediate situation would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> us to expect.\u2014(Edin. Phil. Jour. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a>. IX. 201.) These differences are rendered more sensible when we connect the places having the same annual temperature by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a>, which Humboldt has named isothermal lines. Thus the isothermal line of 59\u00b0 (Fahrenheit) passes along the latitude of 43\u00b0 in Europe, but descends to lat. 36\u00b0 in America. The isothermal line of 41\u00b0 passes from the latitude of 60\u00b0 in Europe, to that of 48\u00b0 in America, showing that the same annual temperature which is found at the 60th parallel on the eastern side of the Atlantic, is only found at 12\u00b0 farther south on its western shores. The western coast of North America again is warmer than the east; and hence <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> we were to trace the isothermal lines round the northern hemisphere, they would all have concave summits at the east sides of Asia and America, and convex summits at the west sides of America and Europe.\n\nThe difference of mean temperature between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> and winter (reckoning each to consist of three months) is nothing at the equator, and constantly increases as we approach the pole, as shown in the following table:\n\n| Mean Temperature. |\n|-------------------|\n| Latitude. | Of Winter. | Of Summer. | Difference. |\n| Algiers, | 37\u00b0 | 61\u00b0.5 | 80\u00b0.2 | 18\u00b0.7 |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUDA\">Buda</a>, | 47\u00bd | 34\u00b0.0 | 70\u00b0.5 | 26\u00b0.5 |\n| Upsal, | 60 | 25\u00b0.0 | 60\u00b0.2 | 35\u00b0.2 |\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> difference of the seasons is smaller under the warm meridians of Western Europe than anywhere else, and seems to be greatest where the mean annual temperature is lowest,\u2014near the east coasts of Asia and America.\n\n| Places on the Same Parallel. |\n|-----------------------------|\n| Latitude. | Winter. | Summer. | Difference. |\n| Copenhagen, | 55\u00bd\u00b0 | 30\u00b0.7 | 62\u00b0.6 | 31\u00b0.9 |\n| Moscow, | 55\u00bd\u00b0 | 10\u00b0.8 | 67\u00b0.1 | 56\u00b0.3 |\n| Rome, | 42 | 45\u00b0.8 | 75\u00b0.2 | 29\u00b0.4 |\n| Pekin, | 40 | 26\u00b0.4 | 82\u00b0.6 | 56\u00b0.2 |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NEW_YORK\">New <a c</a>lass=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a>, | 41 | 29\u00b0.8 | 79\u00b0.2 | 49\u00b0.4 |\n\n| Places having the Same Mean Annual Temperature. |\n|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Mean An.

The lines of equal winter temperature decline in an opposite direction, and deviate much farther from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> of the parallels. Thus a straight line drawn from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILAN\">Milan</a>, almost exactly at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> to the line of equal summer temperatures, would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> over places, all of which, if equally elevated, would have nearly the same winter temperature of 37\u00b0 or 38\u00b0. The other lines of equal summer and winter temperatures have a direction corresponding to these, but not exactly parallel.\n\n* Deduced by interpolation from the temperature of Natchez, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CINCINNATI\">Cincinnati</a>, Churchill Fort, and Melville Island, reckoning that of Melville Island\u20142 Fahrenheit.\nOn comparing the climate of the two hemispheres, we find that the southern is rather colder than the northern, but is more remarkably distinguished by the greater equality of its seasons. This last effect may obviously be referred to the influence of a greater surface of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> upon a smaller <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a>. In the southern hemisphere also, the temperature seems more uniform under different meridians. At Port Jackson, Buenos Ayres, and the Cape, all nearly under one parallel, the annual mean temperature is almost exactly the same.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> general cause that affects the temperature of places is their elevation above the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> of the sea. The following table, by Humboldt, shows that the ratio of decreasing temperature, as we ascend in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>, is not the same at different latitudes, nor is it uniform at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> for equal successive altitudes.\n\n| Height in English feet | Equatorial Zone from 0\u00b0 to 10\u00b0 | Temperate Zone from 45\u00b0 to 47\u00b0 |\n|-----------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|                       | Mean Temp. | Difference | Mean Temp. | Difference |\n| 0                     | 81.5       | 0          | 53.6       | 0          |\n| 3195                  | 71.2       | 10.3       | 41.0       | 12.6       |\n| 6392                  | 65.1       | 6.1        | 31.6       | 9.4        |\n| 9587                  | 57.7       | 7.4        | 23.4       | 8.2        |\n| 12792                 | 44.6       | 13.1       |            |            |\n| 15965                 | 34.7       | 9.9        |            |            |\n\nThis table shows, that, at the equator, the thermometer sinks 10\u00b0 in the first thousand yards of ascent, or 1\u00b0 for 310 feet. In the next thousand yards it sinks no more than 6\u00b0, or 1\u00b0 for 524 feet. In the third and fourth stages, there is a remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ACCELERATION\">acceleration</a>. In the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> to the limit of perpetual snow, at 15,965 feet of elevation, the decrease is 1\u00b0 for 341 feet. Humboldt ascribes the smaller rate of decrease in the second and third stages to the large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">clouds</a> chiefly suspended in this region, which intercept the radiant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>. In the temperate zone the atmospheric cold increases more rapidly. The decrease of heat for the first thousand yards is at the rate of 1\u00b0 for 253 feet, but to the limit of perpetual snow (at a temperature not of 32\u00b0, but of 23\u00b0.3) it is 1\u00b0 for 317 feet, or, in round <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, 1\u00b0 for 100 yards. Observations made, however, in the free regions of the air, may give different results from those which were made on the sides or summits of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>. But generally in the temperate zone, of two adjacent places, if the one is 1000 yards higher than the other, it will have a climate 12\u00b0 colder. For smaller heights the decrease is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a>. In the upper regions of the atmosphere, the difference between the heat of night and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, summer and winter, is smaller than at the surface of the earth. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of decrease explains to us the extreme cold felt in the elevated plains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIBERIA\">Siberia</a>, and the mild temperature enjoyed in the torrid zone, on the table land of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEXICO\">Mexico</a>, the plateau of Pastos, and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> lands. Humboldt calculates, that in the temperate zone, every hundred metres of ascent (110 yards) diminishes the heat as much as a change of 1\u00b0 of latitude.\n\nThe temperature of countries is affected by the local <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROXIMITY\">proximity</a> of the sea, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the adjacent land. The extremes of temperature are always comparatively little felt in small islands, remote from continents. In the United <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">States</a> intense cold is experienced as often as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> blows from the frozen plains round <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HUDSON_S_BAY\">Hudson's <a </a>class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">Bay</a>. (Warden's America, I. 154.) From high mountains, gusts of cold wind, called snow winds by mariners, rush <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> and cool the circumjacent plains. (Volney's Trav. in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYRIA\">Syria</a>, I. 340.) At Calabozzo, in Venezuela, the temperature, which was from 87\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a>, rose to 104\u00b0 or 105\u00b0, whenever the wind blew from the parched and dusty surface of the Llanos, or great plains. (Humboldt, Pers. Nar. IV. 325.) The heat accumulates to an astonishing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, when the wind passes over extensive deserts of fine and almost impalpable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>, which rises in the air, and hangs over the surface like a fog, or mounts in whirling columns to a great height, mixing its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> particles with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of the atmosphere, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> to it an intolerable heat. (Kinnear's Geog. Mem. of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a>, 216, 222.) In Europe, where the proximity of the sea cools every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the surface by the agency of the winds, the accumulation of heat never proceeds so far as in Asia and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>. Even in low plains, sheltered on the north, the temperature scarcely ever exceeds 100\u00b0; but at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAGDAD\">Bagdad</a> and at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol6.html#article-BUSHIRE\">Bushire</a>, where the south wind arrives, heated by the burning sands of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARABIA\">Arabia</a>, the thermometer sometimes stands at 120\u00b0 or 125\u00b0; and on the west coast of Africa, where similar causes operate, it is said to rise to 130\u00b0.* Though the mean annual temperature is highest at the equator, the extreme summer heat, so far as it proceeds directly from the solar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, is greatest at the tropic, and is even rather greater at the latitude of 45\u00b0 than at the equator. (Art. Climate, in this Supplement, p. 182, Table.) We may therefore conjecture that the hottest summer climate in the world is to be found in the western parts of the Sahara of Africa, under the northern tropic, where the winds blow over a zone of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a> plains 4000 miles in breadth, unbroken by any considerable mountains, or by any surface of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>\n\n* Morier's Journey, II. 97. Edin. Phil. Jour. No. V. 197. Tuckey, II. 442. Humboldt repeatedly observed the temperature of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> in Equinoctial America at the hottest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of the day. It varied with the nature of the mineral substance. The highest he has recorded, we think, was that of a coarse granitic sand at Magpures, whose temperature at two P. M. was 140\u00b0.5. That of a fine granitic sand at the same place was 126\u00b0.5; of a granitic rock, 117\u00b0.6. We may hence conclude, that the air, though perfectly stagnant, could in no possible circumstances be heated above 140\u00b0, and this only within two or three feet of the ground. Humboldt's Pers. Nar. V. 165.\nexcept the narrow inlet of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-RED_SEA\"><a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">Red</a> Sea. At the same time, it is possible that a much narrower surface than this may suffice to communicate the maximum effect of the solar heat to the atmosphere, and the actual heat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> may depend more upon the nature of the surface and its low elevation, than upon its extent.\n\nIt appears that within the tropics seas have very little effect in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEMPERING\">tempering</a> the accumulating heat of the land, when situated to the westward of a continent, but a great effect when situated to the eastward. In the steppes of Caracass, which are open to the sea on the east, the heat rarely exceeds 99\u00b0, but even in the wooded regions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SENEGAMBIA\">Senegambia</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUINEA\">Guinea</a>, much nearer the coast, it rises to 130\u00b0.*\n\nIn the temperate zones, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, it is clear that the sea exerts its influence in a direction precisely contrary. When the land lies to the eastward, the sea mitigates the extremes of heat and cold very much; when to the westward very little. This is abundantly proved by the difference of temperature already noticed between the east and west coasts of the two continents. Now, the sea can exert very little influence over the temperature of the land, except through the agency of the atmospheric currents; and the phenomena in both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> seem to be accounted for by the prevailing direction of the winds. Within the tropics, these are almost constantly from the east; but from the tropics to the latitude of 60\u00b0 north (and probably much farther), the prevailing winds are from the west.\u2020 Within the torrid zone, therefore, we should expect to find the extreme summer heat constantly accumulating from the east side of continents and islands to the west; but in the temperate zones, the extremes both of heat and cold will as regularly increase from the west to the east. This is found to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, and whatever other causes may be conjoined with those now assigned, there can be no doubt that the latter have really a great influence.\n\nThe temperature of each zone has such a correspondence with the amount of the solar impressions, as to lead to the inference, that the heat of the globe is entirely derived from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>; and Professor Leslie has calculated, that, upon this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>, the mean heat of the interior ought to be 66\u00b0.8. Humboldt has ascertained, however, that, in latitudes above 45\u00b0, the mean heat of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a> and caves generally exceeds that of the atmosphere. The difference, which amounts to 6\u00b0 or 7\u00b0 at the parallel of 70\u00b0, he ascribes to the covering of snow in the higher latitudes, which prevents the loss of heat during the winter months by radiation, or the contact of cold winds. But there are facts which indicate that this heat may be derived from another source. To say nothing of volcanoes, we have hot springs in all parts of the world, at all temperatures below <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> water; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> still less equivocal is afforded by the high temperature of deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINES\">mines</a>. The following are examples:\n\nAt Giromagny, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOSGES\">Vosges</a>, annual temperature at surface, 49\u00b0; at 110 yards depth, 53\u00b0.6; at 336 yards, 65\u00b0.8; at 472 yards, 74\u00b0.6.\n\nIn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAXONY\">Saxony</a>, in four of the deepest mines, annual temperature at surface, 46\u00b0.4; at 170 to 200 yards depth, 54\u00b0.5; at 280 yards, 58\u00b0; at 360 yards, 62\u00b0.6. (Daubuisson, Geog. I. 444.)\n\nIn the coal mine of Killingworth, the deepest in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, annual temperature at surface, 48\u00b0; at 300 yards, 70\u00b0; at 400 yards, 77\u00b0. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> others of the deepest coal mines in Britain, a corresponding gradation was observed. (Mr Bald, Edinb. Phil. Jour. No. I. 134.)\n\nIn these British mines, the increment of temperature is about 1\u00b0 for 15 yards of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a>. In the crease Vosges, it is about 1\u00b0 for 20 yards, and in Saxony, 1\u00b0 for 22 yards. Taking 20 yards as a mean, if the increase follows the same arithmetical ratio to a considerable depth, we should find the temperature of the Bath waters (116\u00b0) at 1320 yards below the surface, and that of boiling water at 3300 yards, or nearly two miles. The frequency of hot springs from 80\u00b0 to 120\u00b0, the rarity of those that approach the boiling point, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTANCY\">constancy</a> of temperature in them all, are circumstances remarkably consistent with this hypothesis. The facts, if they do not establish, at least strongly support three conclusions:\n\n1st, That the heat of the interior of the earth is always greater than at the surface;\n2d, That this heat augments progressively as we descend, in a ratio <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> some relation to the depth;\n3d, That, even at moderate depths, this heat is greater than the mean heat of the globe ought to be, if entirely derived from the sun. Such an interior heat, if it exists, must be constantly diffusing itself towards the surface; and at the surface it may be kept down, so as to affect the temperature derived from the solar action very feebly, by the greater or less rapidity of its dissipation. But as it is very improbable that it should be diffused with perfect equality round the whole exterior shell of the globe, it may be the true source of some of those anomalies of climate (such as the discrepancy in the annual heat under the same parallel) which cannot be easily referred to other known causes.\n\nThe atmosphere is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> fluid which surrounds the globe on all sides, and serves the most important purposes in the economy of nature. It sustains the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> of an immense variety of organic beings, spreads the moisture of the ocean over the land in fertilizing showers, receives, dissipates, or decomposes, the innumerable mephitic vapours which are continually exhaled from the surface; and is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a>\n\n---\n\n* Humboldt, Pers. Nar. IV. 315. Tuckey, II. 442, 444.\n\u2020 Cotte, Recherches sur les Vents Dominants, Journal de Physique, Tom. XXXIX. p. 267.\n\u2021 As nearly the whole of the preceding view of climate has been taken from Humboldt's excellent Essay on Isothermal Lines, and the Distribution of Heat over the Globe, particular references were not thought necessary. The English translation, given in the Edinburgh Philosophical Journal, No. 5\u20149, has been consulted.\nwhich, by its incessant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, tempers the extremes of heat and cold, and enables <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> to support himself in every climate from the equator to the vicinity of the pole.\n\nThe fluid which forms the atmosphere consists of two gaseous substances, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OXYGEN\">oxygen</a> and nitrogen, united by a weak <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a>, in the proportion of 21 parts of the former to 79 of the latter. The vital functions of animals and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> depend chiefly on the presence of oxygen, though nitrogen also enters into their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>. With these two are intermixed a very small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of carbonic acid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAS\">gas</a>; a variable portion of aqueous vapour, and in the highest regions of the atmosphere, where meteors are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a>, hydrogen has been supposed to exist. Air from the tropics and the polar regions, from the most healthy and the most insalubrious countries, exhibits no sensible difference in its constituent parts. A hundred cubic inches of air at the surface of the sea, when the thermometer is at 60\u00b0, weigh 30\u00bd grains. The whole atmosphere is equal in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> to a sheet of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a>, 30 inches, or to a sheet of water, 34 feet deep, and were its density everywhere the same as at the surface, would reach no higher than 27,000 feet, or five miles. But its extreme elasticity causes the upper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRATA\">strata</a> to expand indefinitely, and the phenomenon of meteors show that it exists in a state of extreme <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENUATION\">attenuation</a>, at a height a hundred times greater than this. Considering the incessant currents which agitate its whole mass, there is a surprising uniformity in its pressure. The annual range of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAROMETER\">barometer</a>, which indicates the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> of the pressure, does not exceed from \u00bd to \u2153 inch in the torrid zone; is about two inches at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIVERPOOL\">Liverpool</a>, the same at Petersburg, and was found by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> Parry to be 1\u00be inches at Melville Island in one year.* The extreme variation, which nowhere exceeds 3\u00bd inches, is not greater than one-ninth part of the total pressure. It is greater in the temperate zone than at the equator or the pole, and in winter than in summer. The density of the air decreases in a geometrical ratio as we ascend, and in temperate climates is diminished to one-half at an elevation of 3\u00bd miles. We are hence enabled to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> heights by the variations of the barometrical column. Changes in the atmospheric pressure, when they are great, have been observed to take place simultaneously at Edinburgh, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, and Geneva, and must, therefore, affect a great range of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> at the same time.\n\nThe unequal distribution of heat over the surface of the land and water necessarily disturbs the equilibrium of the atmosphere, and produces currents of air, or winds. These currents, however various, have been supposed to result from two general movements, pervading the whole mass of the atmosphere. The heavy and cold air of the polar and temperate regions having a tendency to displace the warm and rarified air of the torrid zone, generates a current in each hemisphere towards the equator. To replace the air abstracted from the higher latitudes, an upper and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTER\">counter</a> current flows back from the equator to the pole; and thus the atmosphere, while it performs a constant revolution, tempers the extremes of climate, by transporting the cold of the frigid zone to the equator, and carrying back the heat of the equator to the frigid zone. These great south and north currents, which are to be considered as the primary winds, receive various modifications. The under current, which proceeds from the polar regions, having impressed upon it the slow rotary motion of these regions, does not acquire in its journey the velocity of the parts it passes over. Instead, therefore, of proceeding directly along the meridian, it is deflected to the westward. It pursues this lateral course more and more as it approaches the torrid zone, and the impulse south and north being destroyed when the currents from the opposite hemisphere meet at the equator, the motion westward alone remains. This constitutes the well-known trade wind, which blows from the east at the equator, from the north-east at the northern tropic, and the south-east at the southern. The upper and counter current again, carrying with it the rapid velocity of the equatorial regions, does not travel right along the meridian, but deviates more and more to the east as it advances; and when its progress towards the pole is stopped by the accumulation of air from the opposite meridians, the motion eastward alone remains, and it settles into a west wind. Thus a constant east wind should prevail at the equator, and a constant west wind near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-POLES\">poles</a>; but the latter, being primarily an upper current, may not be invariably felt as a west wind at the surface. It does not follow, however, that the upper and under currents preserve their relative situation over all the temperate zone. From the greater accumulation of air in the higher latitudes, and from variations of temperature produced by local causes, the upper current will often be bent down to the surface, and the lower current ascend. This interchange will take place occasionally at all parts of the temperate zone. Hence, in high latitudes, storms of wind, which mingle the warm upper current with the cold air below, always produce an increase of heat, as Captain Parry found.\u2014(Voyage, p. 118.) In the northern hemisphere, then, when the cold current from the pole sweeps the surface rapidly, we have a north wind; it becomes a northeast wind when its motion southward is retarded; an east wind when it is checked, and a south-east when it is deflected back, by mingling with a current from the south; all of which, except the last, are generally found to be cold winds. When the warm current from the south descends and sweeps the surface, we have a south wind if its motion northward is rapid; a south-west when its motion northward is retarded; a west wind when it is checked; and a north-west when it meets and mingles with a current from the north. All these, except the last, are generally warm winds, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> proves. The line of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> between the upper and lower cur-\n\n* Manch. Mem. IV. 584. Edinb. Trans. II. 213. Parry's Voyage, 269.\nrents should be where the mercury stands at 15 inches, which is at the height of 3\u00bd miles. This should be the region of clouds; and clouds do generally approach to this elevation.\n\nThis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a>, upon the whole, agrees tolerably well with the facts. But the variable surface and temperature of the land greatly affect the course and velocity of the winds. In the torrid zone, within the parallel of 25\u00b0 or 30\u00b0, on each side of the equator, the trade winds blow constantly from the east. From the superior warmth of the northern hemisphere, the line that separates the opposite trade winds is not the equator, but the 2d or 3d parallel north. To a certain extent, also, they follow the course of the sun, reaching a little further into the south hemisphere, and contracting their limits in the north when the sun is on the south side of the equator, and making a reverse change when he declines to the north. In a zone of variable breadth in the middle of this tract, calms and rains prevail, caused, probably, by the mingling and ascending of the opposite aerial currents. High lands change or interrupt the course of the trade winds. Thus, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEE\">lee</a> of the African shore, calms and variable winds prevail near the Cape Verde Islands, while an eddy or counter current of air from the south-west is generated under the coast of Guinea. The lofty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARRIER\">barrier</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANDES\">Andes</a> shelters the sea on the Peruvian shores from the trade winds, which are not felt till a ship has sailed 80 leagues to the westward; but the intervening space is occupied by a wind from the south. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> Ocean the trade wind is curiously modified by the lands which surround it on the north, east, and west. The southern trade wind blows regularly from the east and south-east, from 10\u00b0 of south latitude to the tropic, but in the space from 10\u00b0 south latitude to the equator, north-west winds blow during our winter (from October to April), and south-west in the other six months; while, in the whole space north of the equator, south-west winds blow during summer, and north-east during winter. The cause of these remarkable winds, which are called monsoons, has not been very satisfactorily ascertained. (Varenius's Gen. Geog. Chap. xxi.)\n\nThe region of constant winds is confined within the 30th parallel on each side of the equator. On the outer side of these limits, calms prevail pretty generally over a narrow space, beyond which the region of variable winds extends to the pole. In the open sea, where the true direction of the winds is best known, navigators have repeatedly observed that throughout this region the prevailing wind is from the west. Mr Forster observes, that beyond the tropics, the west winds are the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a>. That east winds have an ascendancy within the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTARCTIC\">Antarctic</a> circle, as he thinks, may be questioned; few observations having been made there, and those few not to be depended on, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the local influence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ICE\">ice</a>. (Observations, p. 127, et seq.) According to the author of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Anson's voyage, \"a westerly wind almost perpetually prevails in the southern parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PACIFIC_OCEAN\">Pacific Ocean</a>\" (he speaks of latitude 60\u00b0), and a similar wind in the northern parts carried the Spanish galleons from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JAPAN\">Japan</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CALIFORNIA\">California</a>, along the parallel of 35\u00b0 or 40\u00b0. (Book I. Chap. ix. II. Chap. x.) West winds prevail in Kamchatka; they blow three-fourths of the year in Hudson's Bay; the west and north-west winds predominate greatly at Melville Island; and it is a familiar fact among mariners, that, by means of these winds, the voyage eastward across the North Atlantic is generally accomplished in about half the time of the voyage westward. (Scoresby, I. 411. Parry, Voyage, 299.) On the west coast of Europe, too, the west and south-west winds are the most general. It is remarked also, that in our climate, south and south-east winds are the most rare; that winds between north and east are almost invariably cold; those between south and west warm; and those between north and west of a mixed character. So far the facts correspond generally with the theory, though many anomalous circumstances may be found.\n\nThe change of the seasons which affects the local temperature so much, necessarily influences the atmospheric currents. Accordingly, the most violent tempests are about the equinoxes, and in every country there are prevailing winds peculiar to certain seasons. It may be suspected that most of the winds observed on land or in confined seas are merely local eddies, or reflex currents, produced by the irregularities of the surface. Thus, while the south-west wind prevails almost one-half of the year at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOVER\">Dover</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, and in the west of England generally, it is scarcely felt at Liverpool, which lies in the gorge of a valley, where the western chain of hills is interrupted; and on the other hand, the south-east, so uncommon in the rest of England, is the predominating wind here. (Manch. Trans. IV. 601, 615.) In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> basin of the Red Sea, the wind blows in no direction but right up or down. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANCASTER\">Lancaster</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUND\">Sound</a>, Captain Parry found the wind to blow always either east or west. For ten months of the year a wind (which is probably a smaller branch of the north trade wind) blows constantly up the valleys of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MISSISSIPPI\">Mississippi</a> and Ohio, preserving a breadth in the latter of twelve or fifteen miles. (Tuckey, III. 70. Warden's Amer. I. 155.) In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of Vents Dominants for the interior of Europe, collected by Cotte, nothing like a system can be discovered\u2014nothing but local currents running in every possible direction, according to the position of mountains and valleys. Winds, indeed, even when strong, are often confined to a space surprisingly small. In the temperate, but still more in the frigid zone, two or three winds are often seen blowing from, or to, different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> within a few leagues; nay, of two ships within sight of one another, one is sometimes becalmed, while the other is seen struggling with a storm. In the northern seas even strong gales, when they have carried a ship into frozen water, invariably <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a> her, or give place to a wind which blows from the ice. The effect can only be attributed to the comparative coldness of the ice, and warmth of the water, generating a local descending current over the one, and an ascending current over the other. (Scoresby, I. 408\u2014409.)\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a> has a system of winds peculiar to itself, which we have not room to explain. All warm countries, where sandy deserts abound, give birth to pernicious hot winds. Such is the Si-\nmoom or hot wind of the desert, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIROCCO\">Sirocco</a>, so well known in the east, and along the shores of the Mediterranean. For the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of these, as well as the sea and land breezes, and other peculiar winds, we refer to the Article <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METEOROLOGY\">Meteorology</a>.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">Rain</a>, so essential to the fertility of the soil, is very unequally distributed to the different regions of the globe. Nature has arranged it so, that the supply of the atmospheric moisture is most abundant in those latitudes where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a> is most rapid. Or rather the processes of precipitation and evaporation, depending partly on the same principles, and exerting a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECIPROCAL\">reciprocal</a> influence, tend to adjust themselves to each other, though this tendency is perpetually disturbed by local causes. Rain is produced by the mixture of atmospheric currents of different temperatures. The power of air to hold water in solution does not increase in the same ratio with the increase of its temperature, but in a much higher ratio. Hence, when two masses of air, saturated with moisture, and of different temperatures, are mixed, the resulting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> is not capable of holding the whole water in solution, and a part of it is precipitated in rain. As the whole atmosphere when saturated is calculated not to hold in solution more water than would form a sheet of 5 inches in depth, while the mean annual deposit of rain and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEW\">dew</a> is probably 35 or 40 inches, it is obvious that the supply of atmospheric humidity must be many times renewed in the course of a year.\n\nThe quantity of rain at any place is affected chiefly by three circumstances. It is greater at the equator than towards the poles,\u2014at the sea coast than in the interior,\u2014and on mountains or high grounds than on plains. The winds, too, exert a certain influence, which, at any particular place, depends on their temperature, and on their travelling to that place over a dry or a humid surface. Where so many causes interfere, whose effects are scarcely capable of estimation, it would be difficult to determine the depth of rain proper to each parallel, even were our observations more numerous and accurate than they are. In a former part of this article we gave as an approximation 83 inches for the equator, and 8 inches for the pole. We have since found the following estimate by Humboldt, to whose authority we readily defer in every question of this kind. Except within the tropics, it corresponds generally with that which we gave.\n\n| Lat. | Eng. Inches | Lat. | Eng. Inches |\n|------|-------------|------|-------------|\n| 0\u00b0   | 96          | 45\u00b0  | 29          |\n| 19   | 80          |      |             |\n\nSince the supply of humidity is greatest in the vicinity of the sea, the rains must be generally more abundant there than in the interior. On the other hand, we know that currents of air fraught with vapour move with great rapidity, and that the atmosphere is far from needing an entirely new supply from the ocean after each precipitation, because three-fourths probably of the rain that falls soon rises again into the air, and continues thus to circulate between the clouds and the earth. These circumstances lead us to conclude, that the difference in the annual depth of rain, between inland places and those on the coast, is not so great as might be imagined. We find, accordingly, that a small increase of elevation compensates for a great distance from the sea. Thus 29\u00bd inches of rain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> at Puy at the sources of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOIRE\">Loire</a>, while 24\u00bd only fall at the sea-port of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROCHELLE\">Rochelle</a> near its mouth, and at Geneva the depth is 40 French inches, while at Paris, 300 miles nearer the sea, it is no more than 19\u00bd. If we compare <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOULOUSE\">Toulouse</a>, Paris, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOTTINGEN\">Gottingen</a>, inland places not far from the coast, with Buda and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRAGUE\">Prague</a>, places in the heart of Europe, and, like the others, not much elevated, the mean fall of rain at the three former is 20\u00bc French inches, at the two latter 14\u00bc. (Cotte, Jour. de Phys. T. XXXIX.) These facts are cited to support the idea of a decreasing scale of rain, rather than to mark the ratio of decrease. The latter is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a> for which we are yet unprovided with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATA\">data</a>. We may infer from theory, that the decrements, so far as they are affected by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> distance, will form a geometrical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a>. If the atmosphere, for instance, loses one-third of its moisture in the first 400 miles from the sea, it will lose one-third of what remains in the next 400; and so on.\n\nThe elevation of the land has a much more marked effect on the quantity of rain than its distance from the sea. Mountains precipitate the humidity of the atmosphere, not so much by attracting it to their summits, as in consequence of their rocky or grassy sides, when acted upon by the sun, heating large masses of air in the cold upper regions of the atmosphere. These warm masses of air, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> moisture from the aerial columns around them, stream upwards and mingle with the cold strata above, or come into contact with cold currents moving laterally, or suffer sudden and partial changes of temperature from the vicissitudes of night and day, and thus incessantly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATE\">generate</a> the circumstances which cause precipitation. It is evident that snow-clad mountains, from the constancy of their temperature, will serve much less perfectly than those whose sides are bare as nuclei for precipitating the atmospheric humidity; and that, in temperate climes, the rains will be more abundant on all mountains in summer than in winter. Along the shores of the Adriatic, and in the valley of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOMBARDY\">Lombardy</a>, the annual fall of rain is from 26 to 35 French inches; but in the Carnic and Julian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALPS\">Alps</a>, it amounts to 100 inches. From the effect of this great barrier in intercepting the aqueous vapour, and producing desiccation, Feltre, on the east side of the first chain, has one-half more rain than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRENT\">Trent</a>, which is higher, but on the west side; and Coire in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRISONS\">Grisons</a>, 1900 feet above the sea, has less rain than the champaign cities of Vicenza and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERONA\">Verona</a>. (Cotte's Tables.) In England it is found that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KESWICK\">Keswick</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KENDAL\">Kendal</a>, situated among the mountains, have 67 and 59 inches of rain respectively, while places in the level interior country and on the sea-coast have only about 24 inches. But though more rain falls in mountainous than level countries, the depth is greater at the bottom of a mountain than at the top, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> to the surface of the ground than at any distance above it, in all cases.\n\nIn the torrid zone, a small thick rain falls every day on that side of the equator on which the sun is, Torrid Zone.\nbut generally intermits during the night. When it ceases in the one hemisphere, it commences in the other, and is nearly perpetual in a zone of two or three degrees in breadth, which separates the two systems. When the rains begin, the heat increases, and the trade wind subsides. Yet, even in the torrid zone, there are tracts where rain seldom or never falls, such as the Sahara of Africa, the low coasts of Caracas, and the desert shore of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERU\">Peru</a>, between 15\u00b0 and 30\u00b0 of south latitude. In many parts there are two wet and two dry seasons in the year; and in some regions, from the effect of mountain ranges and peculiar winds, places under the same parallel have their wet and dry seasons at opposite periods.* Though the annual depth of rain is greatest within the tropics, the number of rainy days follows an inverse order, and diminishes as we advance from high latitudes to the torrid zone. According to Cotte, the mean number of rainy days from 12\u00b0 to 43\u00b0 of latitude is 78, while it is 161 from latitude 51\u00b0 to 60\u00b0. More rain falls in summer than winter in all latitudes, but in the temperate zones the rains of winter are more frequent than those of summer, though less in quantity. (Cotte, ubi supra.)\n\nMr Dalton reckons the annual deposit of water in England to be 31 inches of rain, and five of dew. His estimate is perhaps rather high. The distribution of the rain through the different seasons is so much affected by local circumstances, that it is difficult to ascertain the mean result. In general, the fall seems to be least in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>, and greatest in autumn, and less in the six winter months than in the summer. The following table affords an interesting view of the connection between the phenomena of wind and rain in this country. It gives, for one year (1775), the number of days each wind prevailed at London; the quantity of rain that fell during the prevalence of that wind; and the humidity of the winds, or the relative quantity of moisture which each would deposit in the same space of time.\n\n| Winds | Days | Rain | Humidity |\n|-------|------|------|----------|\n| N.    | 22   | 0.327| 11       |\n| S.    | 21   | 0.251| 9        |\n| E.    | 11   | 0.168| 12       |\n| W.    | 118  | 1.907| 82       |\n\nThe whole quantity of rain for that year was 27.11 inches; of which it will be observed that two-thirds fell with the south-west wind. The prevailing winds are the south-west and north-east, the primary winds of our hemisphere. The least frequent are the east and west. The south and north winds are the driest, and the south-west and west the most humid, as might be expected.\u2020\n\nThe geographical distribution of plants is a subject of such extent, that our narrow limits compel us to dismiss it with a few general remarks, extracted from Humboldt's Prolegomena de Distributione Geographica Plantarum. Each plant has generally a determinate climate, to which it is best adapted; there are other climates, however, in which it can be raised, though less advantageously; but beyond certain limits it either ceases to grow altogether, or is supplanted by other plants better adapted to the situation. Since vertical elevation has the same effect on climate as distance from the equator, there are properly no plants which are peculiar to the frigid zone, because the mountains of the torrid zone, embracing between their base and their summits every variety of climate, either produce, or are capable of producing, all the vegetables of the temperate and polar regions. Plants are absolutely most numerous, and exhibit the greatest variety of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>, and the most luxuriant growth, within the tropics, where nature has supplied most abundantly the heat and humidity which contribute chiefly to the development of their vital functions. They diminish in number, variety, and magnitude, as we recede from the tropics; and in Greenland, Spitzbergen, and the plains of Northern Russia, the wealth of the vegetable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> has shrunk to a very small number of mosses and stunted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHRUBS\">shrubs</a>. The lines that limit the growth of certain plants depend on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> summer temperature, for plants which require a long and moderate heat; on the temperature of the warmest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> for those which require a short but great heat; and on the temperature of the coldest month, for those which are unable to resist a considerable cold. Their growth is affected also by the foggy or serene state of the atmosphere, because the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> stimulus of the solar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> is as essential to the success of many plants as a certain determinate temperature. Instead of losing ourselves in the labyrinths of general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTANY\">botany</a>, we shall illustrate these principles by a few facts drawn from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of cultivated plants.\n\nThe plantain (Platano harton), which furnishes a primary article of food in tropical America, requires a mean annual heat from 82\u00b0 to 73\u00b0, and its proper climate is therefore from the equator to the 27th parallel. In the equinoctial zone (lat. 0\u00b0\u201410\u00b0) its fruit does not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIPEN\">ripen</a> at a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ALTITUDE\">altitude</a> than 500 toises (534 fathoms). The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANE\">cane</a> (Saccharum officinarum), which has nearly the same range, thrives where the mean annual temperature is from 82\u00b0 to 73\u00b0, and is cultivated, but with less advantage, in the old world to the latitude of 36\u00b0, where the annual temperature is about 67\u00b0. In North America, it is cultivated as far as latitude 31\u00b0, beyond which it does not succeed, for, though the summer heat is sufficient to ripen its produce as far as 35\u00b0 or 40\u00b0, the rigour of the winter destroys the plant. It succeeds on the table land of Mexico, at the altitude of 900 toises. The cotton plant (gossypium) has its favourite climate between latitude 0\u00b0 and 34\u00b0, where\n\n---\n\n* Humboldt, Pers.

But it succeeds wherever, with a mean summer heat of $73^\\circ$ or $75^\\circ$, that of winter is not below $4^\\circ$ or $48^\\circ$. It is cultivated as high as latitude $37^\\circ$ in America, beyond latitude $40^\\circ$ in Europe, and grows at Astrakhan in Western Asia, latitude $46^\\circ$. (Storch, Tableau de la Russie, II. 250.) The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a> palm (Phoenix) thrives best between latitude $29^\\circ$ and $35^\\circ$, but on the shores of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, in places sheltered from the north winds, it is cultivated as far as latitude $44^\\circ$. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-CITRON\">citron</a> (Citrus) has nearly the same range, and is cultivated at Nice in spots 150 toises high. This tree, with the sweet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">orange</a>, grows in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOUISIANA\">Louisiana</a>, under latitude $36^\\circ$, but above that it is injured by the frosts. (Darby's Louisiana, p. 151.) The olive (Olea) ranges in Europe between latitude $36^\\circ$ and $44^\\circ$. It succeeds wherever with a mean annual heat from $66^\\circ$ to $58^\\circ$, that of summer is not below $71^\\circ$, nor that of the coldest month below $42^\\circ$. This last condition excludes all the North American continent beyond latitude $34^\\circ$, though the olive thrives $10^\\circ$ farther north in Europe. The vine (Vitis) thrives where the mean annual heat is from $62^\\circ$ to $50^\\circ$, or even $47^\\circ$, providing that of winter is not below $33^\\circ$, nor that of summer below $66^\\circ$ or $68^\\circ$. These conditions are fulfilled on the sea-coast of Europe as high as latitude $47^\\circ$, in the interior as high as latitude $50^\\circ$, and in North America only as high as latitude $40^\\circ$. But the favourite climate of the vine in the Old Continent is between latitude $36^\\circ$ and $48^\\circ$, where it yields a generous and excellent wine. The Cerealia (wheat, rye, barley, and oats), so important to civilized life, yield profitable returns in places where the mean annual temperature descends to $29^\\circ$, providing that of summer rises to $52^\\circ$ or $53^\\circ$. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAPLAND\">Lapland</a>, barley comes to maturity whenever the mean temperature of the summer months rises to $47^\\circ$ or $48^\\circ$. Barley and oats, from the rapidity with which they germinate and ripen, adapt themselves to the short summers of the north, and are found along with the potatoe as high as latitude $69^\\circ$ in Lapland.\n\nIn Eastern Russia, upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENA\">Lena</a> (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a> $120^\\circ$), grain of any kind refuses to grow beyond latitude $60^\\circ$. (Sauer, p. 24, 137.) Wheat, which is a precarious crop, and little cultivated beyond latitude $58^\\circ$ in Western Europe, yields good returns at this part of the temperate zone, when the mean heat of the seven months from March to October is $55^\\circ$; but if it is no more than $46^\\circ$, neither this grain, nor barley, oats, or rye, come to maturity. The Cerealia generally, which succeed only in low grounds beyond latitude $60^\\circ$ in Europe, are cultivated to the height of 550 toises on the sides of the Alps in latitude $46^\\circ$; to the height of 1020 toises (barley and oats) on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAUCASUS\">Caucasus</a> in latitude $42^\\circ$; and on the sides of the Andes, under the equator, the proper climate of the Cerealia is found between 700 and 1600 toises of elevation ($4480$ and $10,240$ feet). Maize accompanies the vine in the west of Europe, but extends farther north on the east. It is most extensively cultivated in its native soil, the New World, where it forms the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> nourishment of man and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> animals from La Plata to the Canadian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>. Coming to maturity in four or five months from the time it is sown, and requiring a short but hot summer, it is admirably adapted to the climate of America. There are few situations under the latitude of $45^\\circ$ where it will not grow, but the parallel of $35^\\circ$ is that to which it is best adapted. (Darby's Louisiana, p. 188, 144.)\n\nThe oak ceases to grow beyond latitude $63^\\circ$ in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORWAY\">Norway</a>; it terminates at $60^\\circ$ or $61^\\circ$ in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINLAND\">Finland</a>; and at $57^\\circ$ in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERM\">Perm</a>. The Pinus sylvestris (Scots pine) reaches the height of 60 feet at the latitude of $70^\\circ$ in Lapland, and grows in situations 125 toises above the sea. The Betula <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALBA\">alba</a> is found under the same parallel at 250 toises of elevation. In the eastern parts of Asiatic Russia trees are very thin beyond latitude $65^\\circ$; the larch, pine, birch, and mountain ash, disappear about $66^\\circ$ or $68^\\circ$; willow and birch bushes, eight inches high, are found as far as $69^\\circ$. At Hudson's Bay trees of all kinds terminate about latitude $60^\\circ$. (Sauer's Account, &c., 70\u201491. Mackenzie's Voyage, p. 404.)\n\nLet us now endeavour to make a general summary range of these details, confining our view to the great con-ech Plant-tirets merely, without regard to the islands. The plantain or banana we find occupies a zone of $54^\\circ$ in breadth on either side of the equator, which embraces about four-fifths of Africa, one-sixth of Asia, and one-third of America, and excludes the whole of Europe. The climate of the sugar-cane, allowing it to extend to $30^\\circ$ on each side of the equator in the New World, and $35^\\circ$ or $36^\\circ$ in the Old, includes the whole of Africa, nearly one-third of Asia, and two-fifths of America, and only touches Europe at its southern extremity. The climate of the olive consists of two zones on the opposite sides of the equator, extending from latitude $35^\\circ$ to $44^\\circ$ in the old continent, and embracing very little of the new; this tree being equally injured by the excessive heat of the tropical, and the excessive cold of the extra tropical regions in America.* The vine grows as far north as $50^\\circ$ or even $52^\\circ$, but its profitable culture in Europe does not extend much beyond $48^\\circ$. In Asia it succeeds at Astrakhan latitude $46^\\circ$, in Bucharia, and at Hami in Chinese <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TARTARY\">Tartary</a>, latitude $43^\\circ$.\u2020 It, therefore, extends, we may suppose, to lat. $45^\\circ$ in Asia generally. Except in islands, or elevated plains, it is probable there are few palatable wines made at a lower latitude than $30^\\circ$. The vine may hence be considered as occupying a zone of $15^\\circ$ in breadth on each side of the equator (from $30^\\circ$ to $45^\\circ$) in the Old World, and two corresponding zones of $10^\\circ$ in breadth in the New (from $30^\\circ$ to $40^\\circ$). These zones embrace about one-sixth of America, one-third of Europe, two-sevenths of Asia, and one-tenth of\n\n* If Humboldt has accurately defined the temperature for the year, and the coldest month proper for this tree, there ought to be no part of North, and perhaps few parts of South America, where it will thrive. It has not been introduced into the territories of the United States,\u2014Darby's Louisiana, p. 150.\n\n\u2020 Topographie des Vignobles, 489, Paris, 1816. Pallas's Travels, II. 430.\nOf the productions which serve for the ordinary sustenance of man, maize and the potatoe have the widest range. The culture of the potatoe, as Humboldt observes, extends from the extremity of Africa to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LABRADOR\">Labrador</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ICELAND\">Iceland</a>, and Lapland. Maize bears any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> temperature, however high, and the only circumstance essential to its successful culture seems to be a mean summer heat, not below 68\u00b0 or 70\u00b0. In consequence of this advantage, its climate embraces the whole of the torrid zone, and reaches probably to lat. 48\u00b0 in America, to 50\u00b0 or 52\u00b0 in Europe, and 48\u00b0 in Eastern Asia. It hence includes about five-eighths of America, three-sevenths of Europe, the whole of Africa, and three-fifths of Asia. The Cerealia do not succeed in the torrid zone in low situations. The climate adapted to their culture, which begins about lat. 30\u00b0, extends to lat. 50\u00b0 in America, to 70\u00b0 in Lapland, 62\u00b0 in Finland, and 60\u00b0 throughout the north of Russia, generally including five-sixths of Europe, three-fifths of Asia, one-tenth of Africa, and one-fourth of America. The region of forests, or the climates adapted to the growth of wood, embraces the whole of the Old and New World, except a narrow zone on the north border of each, which includes one-tenth of America, one-tenth of Europe, and one-tenth of Asia. As the prolific powers of the soil depend chiefly on the stimulus of heat and moisture, it is reasonable to believe with Humboldt, that the general fertility of the earth increases as we approach the equator. (Pers. Nar. IV. 105.) In warm countries, the produce not only bears a much higher proportion to the seed, but the husbandman has the advantage generally of two harvests in one year. We may probably assume, then, without any great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>, that, with regard to plants which grow both in the warm and temperate zones, the productiveness of the soil increases in the ratio of the annual temperature, and the depth of rain; and that for countries under the same parallels, it is generally in proportion to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> and intensity of the summer heat. The cosine of the latitude, or the distance from the axis, as it expresses pretty nearly the proportions of heat and moisture for each parallel, may therefore be taken as an approximate measure of the relative fertility. But when we take into view the superior productiveness of vegetables which are peculiar to warm regions, such as maize, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICE\">rice</a>, and the banana, there can be no doubt that the power of the soil to sustain animal life, augments in a much higher ratio than the cosine of the latitude, and that at the equator it is at least ten times as great as at the latitude of 60\u00b0 in Europe. It is scarcely necessary to qualify those statements by saying, that we speak solely of low and level regions, and of ordinary soils.\n\nThere are warm valleys in the north, where the productions of southern climes will grow beyond the limits we have assigned; there are elevated tracts in the torrid zone where every plant found in cold countries can be raised; and in all the zones, there are deserts and rocks which bid defiance to the vivifying power of the sun, and the genial influence of the seasons.\n\nThe number of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> beings upon the globe has been variously estimated. A thousand millions have been mentioned, apparently for no other reason than the convenience of a round number. M. Malte-Brun, a late and very respectable authority, reduces the amount to 650,000,000. We think his enumeration for Asia, Africa, and America, still rather high, and without detailing the grounds of our judgment, or pretending to accuracy, where anything better than loose approximations is unattainable, we submit the following estimate as the result of our inquiries.\n\n| Region                  | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">Population</a>       |\n|-------------------------|------------------|\n| Europe                  | 185,000,000      |\n| Asia (with Australia and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-POLYNESIA\">Polynesia</a>) | 270,000,000     |\n| Africa                  | 55,000,000       |\n| America                 | 40,000,000       |\n\n550,000,000\n\nThe diversity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, stature, form, physiognomical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> (and we may add <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>), among Human different portions of the human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>, have at all Species times arrested <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>; and have in many cases created, and in all inflamed, those feelings and prejudices which have made nations the enemies of each other. Philosophers have endeavoured to analyse and class the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> which produce these diversities; and since migrations and conquests have blended the distinctive peculiarities of different races, they have attempted to ascertain those primary types, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of which all the other varieties have arisen. We have no room to discuss the many idle and fantastic hypotheses which have been built upon this subject, but shall merely give a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIEF\">brief</a> outline of the system of the learned Blumenbach, who has prosecuted the inquiry with the aid of a profound knowledge of physiology. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> has resolved the varieties of the human species into five primary classes,\u2014the Caucasian, Mongolian, Ethiopian, American, and Malay. In the Caucasian race the skin is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEEKS\">cheeks</a> red (a character scarcely found in any other race), the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a>, running into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>, soft, long, and undulating; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> symmetrical, and rather globular, the forehead moderately expanded, the cheek-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a> narrow, not prominent, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a> oval, the nose narrow and slightly aquiline, the lips gently turned out, the chin full and round, the facial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> large. This variety comprehends all the Europeans except the Finns, Samoieds, and Laplanders; the Western Asiatics, as far as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBY\">Oby</a> and the Ganges, and the people of North Africa. In the Mongolian variety, the skin is olive, the hair black, straight, and stiff, the head almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>, the cheek-bones prominent outwards, the face <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> and flat, and its parts less distinct than in the Caucasian race, the eye-brows little arched, and the space between them flat, the nose small and flat, the aperture of the eye-lids narrow. This includes the remaining Asiatics (except the Malays), the Finns, Samoieds, Laplanders, Greenlanders, and Esquimaux. In the Ethiopian race, the skin is black, the hair black and crisp, the head compressed laterally, the forehead receding, the cheek-bones standing much forward, the nose flat, and blending with the cheeks, the lips thick, the chin rather receding, the jaws lengthened forwards, and the under part of the face prominent. This includes all the African nations, except those of the Caucasian race in the north.\nIn the American race, the skin is of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a> colour, the hair black, stiff, and straight; the forehead short, the cheek-bones and face broad, the orbits and eyes deep, the nose rather flat, but still prominent. In this are included all the American tribes except the Esquimaux. In the Malay race, the skin is tawny, the hair black, soft, curled, thick, and abundant, the head rather narrow, the forehead slightly arched, the parietal bones prominent, but not the cheek-bones, the nose full, broad, and bottle-shaped at the point, the mouth large, the face projecting forward in the lower part, but the features viewed in profile, more distinct than in the Ethiopian race. This variety comprehends the inhabitants of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALACCA\">Malacca</a>, the Marian, Philippine, Molucca, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUNDA\">Sunda</a> Isles, and Polynesia. It is to be observed, that it is only in some particular tribes, or portions of each race, that its characteristics are strongly marked. None of the leading varieties are absolutely pure, and all of them may be found passing into each other by insensible gradations, from the effects of mixture.\n\nThe question has been long agitated, whether all the existing varieties have sprung from one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a> stock. The arguments in favour of the affirmative appear to us to preponderate. 1. All the different races are capable of uniting with each other, and begetting offspring, which continue themselves by procreation. This is held by naturalists to be one of the most decisive tests of identity of species. 2. There is no essential difference of structure in the various races. None of them have permanently a bone, a blood-vessel, or an organ of any kind, which the others want. There are no differences analogous to those of the stag and the roebuck, or the one and the two humped camel, which clearly mark a diversity of race. 3. The differences which do exist among mankind at large, such as those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a>, stature, physiognomy, and mental capacity are analogous to those which manifest themselves in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, and even in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>. We have, therefore, only to suppose that the causes which produce these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINOR\">minor</a> and accidental differences are rendered general and permanent in their operation, by peculiarities of food, climate, or habits, to account for the stronger and more lasting distinctions among nations. This view of the subject is farther confirmed by the changes which climate, food, and different modes of treatment, produce upon domestic animals. 4. The affinities of language, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> to throw much light on this subject when fully developed, have already afforded presumptive proofs of a common origin in the case of nations whom physiologists class under distinct races.*","sp":198,"ep":208},{"h":"PLAYFAIR","t":"a Mathematician and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">Philosopher</a> of great eminence and celebrity; and so peculiarly a benefactor to this publication, as would have made it fit that some memorial of him should be preserved in these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAGES\">pages</a>, even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> it could have been surmised that it might not have been found in any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>.

It is scarcely a stronger, though undoubtedly a very different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of his rare attainments, that when the Professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\"><a class=\"xref\" hr</a>ef=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">Natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">Philosophy</a>, Wilkie, the once celebrated author of the Epigoniad, was prevented by indisposition from delivering the regular lectures, he used generally to delegate the task of instruction to his youthful pupil. Wilkie, besides being a scholar and philosopher of no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a>, was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of primitive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a> and integrity, and of great vivacity in conversation; and the friendship which, in spite of the disparity of their years, was speedily formed between him and young Playfair, speaks as much for the social and moral character of the latter, as his substitution of him in the class-room does for his early proficiency in science. On this last subject we shall mention but one fact more. In 1766, when only eighteen years of age, he offered himself, with the approbation of his instructors at St Andrews, as candidate for the Professorship of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">Mathematics</a> in Marischal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">College</a>, Aberdeen, and sustained, with the most distinguished <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a>, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> or comparative <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>, which lasted eleven days, and embraced nearly the whole range of the exact sciences. Out of the six competitors who entered the lists against him, two only were judged to have excelled him,\u2014the Reverend Dr Trail, who was appointed to the office, and Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAMILTON\">Hamilton</a>, who afterwards succeeded to, and has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> filled it with much reputation.\n\nIn 1769, he removed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, where his merit and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a> very soon introduced him to the friendship of Dr Robertson\u2014<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADAM\">Adam</a> Smith\u2014Dr Matthew Stewart\u2014Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">Black</a>, and Dr Hutton; with all of whom he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> in terms of the utmost cordiality during the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of their lives. In 1772, he was a candidate for the Professorship of Natural Philosophy at St Andrews, vacant by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of his friend Dr Wilkie. There was no comparative trial on this occasion; and he was again unsuccessful\u2014under circumstances, which have led one of the most dutiful sons of that University (Dr Cook, in his Life of Principal Hill) to remark, \"how much it suffered in thus losing a man, by whose talents its reputation would have been so highly promoted.\"\n\nIn the course of the same year, the death of his father suddenly devolved upon him the burden of supporting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, and admonished him no longer to delay the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a> of a profession. He had been educated with a view to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">Church</a>, and was every way qualified to accept a living on the establishment; but his decided predilection for science had hitherto made him hesitate about engaging in a vocation, the duties of which, he felt, if conscientiously discharged, would necessarily interfere, to a great extent, with the studies he was loth to abandon. In this emergency, however, he thought himself no longer entitled to indulge in those predilections\u2014and, accordingly, made application to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Gray, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a>, for a presentation to the livings of Liff and Benvie, which had been filled by his father. His Lordship was too well aware of his merits to hesitate about conferring so great a benefit on the parishioners; and immediately issued a presentation in his favour, although, from some challenge of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRONAGE\">patronage</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDUCTION\">induction</a> was not obtained till late in the year 1773.\n\nFrom this period, till 1782, Mr Playfair was constantly resident at Liff, and occupied almost exclusively with the pastoral duties of his office. In this retreat, his leisure hours were dedicated to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> of his younger brothers, and to a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> and intimate correspondence with Mr Robertson (now Lord Robertson), the son of the illustrious historian, to whom he seems to have confided the remarks that occurred to him upon the different authors he perused, and the subjects of speculation which they suggested. We cannot help hoping, that some selection from this correspondence may one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> be given to the public. In the year 1779, he contributed to the Transactions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>\nOn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARITHMETIC\">Arithmetic</a> of Impossible Quantities, which exhibits, within a very small compass, a striking example of the rare and admirable talent of detaching the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> spirit of science from what may be termed its mysticism, and circumscribing, by the most precise and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUMINOUS\">luminous</a> boundaries, the vague and unlimited inquiries into which many mathematicians had been seduced by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the instruments they employed.\n\nIn the year 1782 he was induced, by very advantageous offers, to resign his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a>, and to superintend the education of the present Mr Ferguson of Raith, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>, Sir Ronald; an arrangement which restored him, in a great measure, to the literary and scientific society of Edinburgh, and enabled him to gratify himself by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> introduction to several of the most eminent cultivators of science in London. He had repeatedly visited Dr Maskelyne, Astronomer Royal, while that ingenious mathematician was busied, in 1774, in making a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of observations in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-PERTHSHIRE\">Perthshire</a> on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>; and while sharing the shelter of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TENT\">tent</a> on the side of Schehallien, contracted with him a cordial friendship, which continued unbroken for the remainder of their lives. Under these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> auspices, he made his first appearance in London in 1782, and was speedily introduced to all those in whom he was likely to take most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>. He seems to have kept a pretty full and correct journal of all that he observed during this journey to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a>; and a portion of it, which is prefixed to the late collection of his works, is, in our judgment, one of the most interesting parts of that publication. It is not only written with great elegance and accuracy, but affords, in the free, candid, and pointed observations which it contains on the different individuals with whom he comes in contact, a very remarkable proof of his quick and sagacious perception of character, and his power of selecting and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> to account, even in the fever and distraction of a first visit to such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a>, all that was really worthy of careful observation or permanent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-REMEMBRANCE\">remembrance</a>.\n\nIn 1785 he was received into the University of Edinburgh, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of an arrangement between his two illustrious associates, Dr Adam Ferguson and Mr Dugald Stewart. Mr Stewart exchanged the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a> of Mathematics, in which he had succeeded to his father, for that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORAL_PHILOSOPHY\">Moral Philosophy</a>, which had been long filled by Dr Ferguson; who, finding that the delicate state of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> would prevent him from discharging the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> duties of the mathematical professor, immediately devolved them upon Mr Playfair, for whom he procured the appointment of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> professor in that department.\n\nIn 1788 he published, in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, \"A Biographical Account of Dr Matthew Stewart,\" which is remarkable, not only for the ease and purity of the style, but also for containing a singularly clear and interesting account of the labours of Dr Simson in the restoration of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">geometry</a>, and of the success both of him and Dr Stewart in adapting the elegant simplicity of the Greek methods of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> to problems which had previously been regarded as insoluble except by the aid of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a>. He also published, in the same year, a paper On the Causes which affect the Accuracy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BAROMETRICAL_MEASUREMENTS\">Barometrical Measurements</a>, which is written with all the perspicuity, caution, and sagacity, that constitute the great excellence and the great difficulty of such disquisitions, where scientific principles are employed to give precision to physical observations.\n\nIn 1790 he published in the same Transactions a paper of still greater interest and delicacy, On the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">Astronomy</a> of the Brahmins\u2014a subject which had been recently recommended to the notice of the European scientific world by the curious and learned observations of M. Bailley, in his General History of Astronomy, but had never met with so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> and scrupulous an investigation as it now received at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of Mr Playfair. The whole treatise is written with a beautiful perspicuity, in an admirable spirit of candour and ingenuity, and in a style more elegant and spirited than had yet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENT\">lent</a> its attraction to subjects so recondite and abstruse. The publication accordingly attracted very general notice, both in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>; and gave rise to much discussion and research, the final value and result of which does not seem to be yet ascertained. This was followed in 1794 by a learned and very beautiful treatise On the Origin and Investigation of Porisms, in which the obscure nature of the very comprehensive and indefinite theorems to which this name was applied by the ancient geometers, is explained with the most lucid simplicity; and the extraordinary merits of Dr Simson, in deducing their true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> from the very vague and scanty notices of them which had come <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to his time, are commemorated with a noble spirit of emulation.\n\nIn 1795 he published his Elements of Geometry, for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of the pupils attending his class; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> which has since been held in such estimation by the public, as to have gone through five editions of 1000 copies each, four of which were called for since the work ceased to be used as a class-book in the University of Edinburgh. In 1797 he composed a sequel to his first paper on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> Astronomy, in the shape of Observations on the Trigonometrical Tables of the Brahmins; and also a masterly collection of Theorems on the Figure of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">Earth</a>. It is also understood that he occupied himself a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> at this time in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> On the Accidental Discoveries made by Men of Science while in Pursuit of some other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">Object</a>; although we find no portion of this curious discussion in the late collection of his works.\n\nHis excellent and ingenious friend Dr Hutton died in the year last mentioned; and Mr Playfair having undertaken to draw up a biographical account of him for the Royal Society, was first led to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> his ingenious, but somewhat crude speculations on the Theory of the Earth, and afterwards to lend them the assistance of his own powerful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEN\">pen</a> in his Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory. This work, on which he bestowed more time and labour than on any of his other productions, did not appear till 1802; and it was not till 1803 that he presented to their associates his admirable Memoir of their departed friend.\n\nWhatever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> may be formed, now or hereaf-\nter, of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> or soundness of the suppositions by which Dr Hutton endeavoured to explain the actual state and condition of our globe, it is impossible to doubt that Mr Playfair's illustration of that theory must always be ranked among the most brilliant and powerful productions of philosophic genius. The beautiful clearness, and captivating eloquence, with which the system itself is unfolded and explained\u2014the spirit and force of reasoning with which all the objections to it are combated\u2014the skill with which the infinite variety of facts which it brought into view are combined into one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> and legitimate induction\u2014and the judgment and extent of learning by which so many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> and profound views of nature are brought to bear upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> in discussion, and blended into one large and discursive argument, uniting the utmost logical precision with the richest variety of topics, and the highest graces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>\u2014are merits which have been universally acknowledged in this performance, even by those who have not been convinced by its reasonings\u2014and have extorted, even from the fastidious critics of France, the acknowledgment that \"Mr Playfair writes as well as Buffon, and reasons incomparably better.\"\n\nThe biographical account of Dr Hutton is by far the best of Mr Playfair's productions in this line, and contains not only an eloquent and luminous account of the speculations in which he was engaged, but what is too often forgotten in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of biography, a charming <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PORTRAIT\">portrait</a> of the individual\u2014drawn, no doubt, by a favourable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, but gaining far more in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a> and effect than it can possibly have lost in correctness, from the softening colours of affection.\n\nIn 1805 he quitted the chair of Mathematics to succeed Professor Robison in that of Natural Philosophy. The appointment of Mr Leslie, as his successor in the chair of Mathematics, was opposed at the time by a majority of the Presbytery of Edinburgh, and made the subject of very angry discussion, as well in various publications as in the General <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">Assembly</a> of the Church of Scotland. From both these fields of contention the opponents of Mr Leslie retired discomfited, and in the opinion, we believe, of many of the lookers on, disgraced. Among the heaviest blows they had to sustain were those that parted from the hand of Mr Playfair. He first addressed a Letter to the Lord Provost, in which, after asserting, with infinite spirit and freedom, the dignity of the science in question, he openly imputes the new sprung zeal for orthodoxy, which had prompted the attack on Mr Leslie, to a wish or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of some of the clergymen of Edinburgh to obtain for themselves a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of the chairs in that University, which had hitherto afforded sufficient occupation to the undistracted industry of laymen: and when this denunciation brought upon him a series of acrimonious and unhandsome attacks, he replied to them all in a pamphlet of greater bulk, written in a style of which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> polish and elegance only serve to give a keener edge to the unsparing severity of the exposures which it conveys.* We do not know, indeed, where to find a more perfect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLEMICAL\">polemical</a> or controversial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>; and much as it was to be regretted that an occasion should have arisen for employing such a pen and such a mind as Mr Playfair's on any temporary or personal theme, it is impossible not to admire the extraordinary talent and vigour with which, when the occasion did arrive, he could turn talents, exercised in far other studies, to the purposes suggested by the emergency.\n\nIn 1807 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London, and soon after presented to that learned body his Lithological Survey of Schehallion. In 1809 he contributed to the Edinburgh Transactions an excellent paper On Solids of the greatest Attraction, and in 1812, another On the Progress of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">Heat</a> in Spherical Bodies.\n\nIn 1814 he published, in two volumes 8vo, for the use of his class, an elementary work of great value, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of Outlines of Natural Philosophy. For some years before this, he had been much occupied in digesting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> and collecting the materials for a greatly enlarged edition of his Illustrations of the Hutonian Theory: with a view to which, he had not only carefully perused and extracted a vast body of voyages and travels, but had made various journeys, and very minutely examined almost all the places in the British dominions, the structure of which promised to throw any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> on the subject of his researches. No part of the work, however, was actually written, when the preparation for it was suspended by his being induced to draw up for this publication an introductory Dissertation on the Progress of Mathematical and Physical Science,\u2014a treatise which, though its author had written nothing else, would itself suffice to carry his name down with distinction to the latest posterity. The soundness of judgment\u2014the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> of the writing\u2014the extent of knowledge\u2014the candour and precision of the estimates of character, and the noble spirit of liberality and generous admiration for genius which breathes through the whole performance, give it an attraction which is rarely to be found in works of the same erudition, and renders it not only one of the most instructive, but one of the most interesting publications that philosophy has ever bestowed on the world.\n\nIn 1815 he drew up for the Royal Society of Edinburgh a very interesting Memoir of his distinguished predecessor Dr John Robison\u2014a philosopher in whose early life there was more adventure, and in his later days more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a>, than we usually find to diversify the history of men of science. Nothing can be more spirited and interesting than Mr Playfair's account of the former\u2014nothing more manly and tender than his reluctant but decided protestation against the excesses of the latter.\n\n* This piece is entitled, Letter to the Author of the Examination of Mr Stewart's Short Statement of Facts relative to the Election of Professor Leslie, 8vo, Edinb. 1806. It has not been reprinted in the recent collection of his works.\nAfter the general peace in 1815, had at last opened the Continent to British inquirers, Mr Playfair, at the age of sixty-eight, undertook a long journey through France and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWITZERLAND\">Switzerland</a> into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, and did not return for a period of nearly eighteen months. His principal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> was directed to the mineralogical and geological phenomena of the different regions which he visited, and he made many notes with a view to the great object, which he was not destined to accomplish, namely, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> and new modelling of his Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory. Every object of liberal curiosity, however, had for him an attraction as fresh as in his earliest youth, and the social simplicity and benevolence of his character and manners insured him a favourable reception in every new society to which he was introduced.\n\nOn his return from this expedition, he employed himself chiefly in preparing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">Second</a> Part of the Dissertation to which we have alluded; and he also drew up a Memoir on the Naval <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TACTICS\">Tactics</a> of Mr Clerk of Eldin, which was published after his death in the Philosophical Transactions, though only a fragment of a projected life of Mr Clerk which he did not live to complete. His health had been occasionally broken for several years by the recurrence of a painful affection of the bladder, which appeared with increased severity in the early part of 1819, but was so far got under as to enable him to complete his course of lectures in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>. It returned, however, in a still more distressing form in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, and at last put a period to his life on the 19th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a>. Though suffering great pain during the last part of his confinement, he retained not only his intellectual faculties quite unimpaired, but the serenity and mildness of his spirits, and occupied himself till within a few days of his death in correcting the proof sheets of the Dissertation; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINTING\">printing</a> of the Second Part of which had commenced sometime before his last illness.\n\nBefore concluding these notices of Mr Playfair's scientific and literary labours, we have still to mention, that, from the year 1804, he was a frequent contributor to the Edinburgh Review, and that, though most of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> were of a scientific description, he occasionally diverged into the field of general literature, or indulged in the refinements of metaphysical speculation. Many of his scientific articles attracted great attention on the Continent as well as at home; and several of them are written with a force and beauty that might well entitle them to a higher place than the pages of a periodical publication. There is no general account of the great facts and principles of astronomy, so clear, and comprehensive, and exact, nor half so beautiful and majestic in the writing, as his account of La Place's M\u00e9canique C\u00e9leste, in the eleventh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the publication <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> mentioned.\n\nIn this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIEF\">brief</a> sketch of the events of Mr Playfair's life, we have purposely omitted any general account either of his personal character, or of the distinguishing features of his intellectual powers and habits; thinking it better to give those by themselves, in the words in which they were recorded, to the satisfaction, we believe, of most of those who knew him intimately, in a periodical Journal which appeared a short time after his death. The portrait there given has been pronounced by one of the earliest and most illustrious of his surviving friends, \"a faithful and perfect resemblance;\"\u2020 and has accordingly been allowed a place in the prefatory Memoir which his nephew has prefixed to the recent Collection of his Works.\n\n\"It has struck many people, we believe, as very extraordinary, that so eminent a person as Mr Playfair should have been allowed to sink into his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a> in the midst of us, without calling forth almost so much as an attempt to commemorate his merit, even in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> newspaper; and that the death of a man so celebrated and so beloved, and, at the same time, so closely connected with many who could well appreciate and suitably describe his excellences, should be left to the brief and ordinary notice of the daily obituary. No event of the kind certainly ever excited more general sympathy; and no individual, we are persuaded, will be longer or more affectionately remembered by all the classes of his fellow-citizens; and yet it is to these very circumstances that we must look for an explanation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> neglect by which his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> has been followed. His humbler admirers have been deterred from expressing their sentiments by a natural feeling of unwillingness to encroach on the privilege of those whom a nearer approach to his person and talents rendered more worthy to speak of them,\u2014while the learned and eloquent among his friends have trusted to each other for the performance of a task which they could not but feel to be painful in itself, and not a little difficult to perform as it ought to be; or perhaps have reserved for some more solemn occasion that tribute for which the public impatience is already at its height.\n\n\"We beg leave to assure our readers that it is merely from anxiety to do something to gratify this natural impatience that we presume to enter at all upon a subject to which we are perfectly aware that we are incapable of doing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>.\u2014Of Mr Playfair's scientific attainments,\u2014of his proficiency in those studies to which he was peculiarly devoted, we are but slenderly qualified to judge: But, we believe we hazard nothing in saying that he was one of the most learned mathematicians of his age, and among the first, if not the very first, who introduced the beautiful discoveries of the later continental geometers to the knowledge of his countrymen; and gave their just value and true place, in the scheme of Eu-\n\n---\n\n* Besides the Dissertation, Mr Playfair contributed to this Supplement the valuable biographical account of \u00c6pinus, and the still more valuable article on Physical Astronomy.\n\n\u2020 Letter from Mr Dugald Stewart to Dr Playfair, in the Appendix to the Biographical Account of Professor Playfair, prefixed to the Collection of his Works, published at Edinburgh in 1822, in 4 vols. 8vo.\nEuropean knowledge, to those important improvements by which the whole aspect of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> sciences has been renovated since the days of our illustrious Newton. If he did not signalize himself by any brilliant or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>, he must, at least, be allowed to have been a most generous and intelligent judge of the achievements of others; as well as the most eloquent expounder of that great and magnificent system of knowledge which has been gradually evolved by the successive labours of so many gifted individuals. He possessed, indeed, in the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, all the characteristics both of a fine and a powerful understanding,\u2014at once penetrating and vigilant,\u2014but more distinguished, perhaps, for the caution and sureness of its march, than for the brilliancy or rapidity of its movements,\u2014and guided and adorned through all its progress by the most genuine enthusiasm for all that is grand, and the justest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> for all that is beautiful in the Truth or the Intellectual Energy with which he was habitually conversant.\n\n\"To what account these rare qualities might have been turned, and what more brilliant or lasting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> they might have produced, if his whole life had been dedicated to the solitary cultivation of science, it is not for us to conjecture; but it cannot be doubted that they added incalculably to his eminence and utility as a Teacher; both by enabling him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> his pupils to the most simple and luminous methods of inquiry, and to imbue their minds, from the very commencement of the study, with that fine relish for the truths it disclosed, and that high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of the majesty with which they were invested, that predominated in his own bosom. While he left nothing unexplained or unreduced to its proper place in the system, he took care that they should never be perplexed by petty difficulties, or bewildered in useless details, and formed them betimes to that clear, masculine, and direct method of investigation, by which, with the least labour, the greatest advantages might be accomplished.\n\n\"Mr Playfair, however, was not merely a teacher; and has fortunately left behind him a variety of works, from which other generations may be enabled to judge of some of those qualifications which so powerfully recommended and endeared him to his contemporaries. It is, perhaps, to be regretted that so much of his time, and so large a proportion of his publications, should have been devoted to the subjects of the Indian Astronomy, and the Huttonian Theory of the Earth. For though nothing can be more beautiful or instructive than his speculations on those curious topics, it cannot be dissembled that their results are less conclusive and satisfactory than might have been desired, and that his doctrines, from the very nature of the subjects, are more questionable than we believe they could possibly have been on any other topic in the whole circle of the sciences. To the first, indeed, he came under the great disadvantage of being unacquainted with the Eastern tongues, and without the means of judging of the authenticity of the documents which he was obliged to assume as the elements of his reasonings; and as to the other, though he ended, we believe, with being a very able and skilful mineralogist, we think it is now generally admitted that that science does not yet afford sufficient materials for any positive conclusion; and that all attempts to establish a Theory of the Earth must, for many years to come, be regarded as premature. Though it is impossible, therefore, to think too highly of the ingenuity, the vigour, and the eloquence of those publications, we are of opinion that a juster estimate of Mr Playfair's talent, and a truer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> of his genius and understanding, is to be found in his other writings,\u2014in the papers, both biographical and scientific, with which he has enriched the Transactions of our Royal Society;\u2014his account of Laplace, and other articles which he is understood to have contributed to the Edinburgh Review,\u2014the Outlines of his Lectures on Natural Philosophy,\u2014and, above all, his Introductory Discourse to the Supplement to the Encyclopedia Britannica, with the final correction of which he was occupied up to the last moments that the progress of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> allowed him to dedicate to any intellectual exertion.\n\n\"With reference to these works, we do not think we are influenced by any national, or other partiality, when we say that he was certainly one of the best writers of his age; and even that we do not now recollect any one of his contemporaries who was so great a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of composition. There is a certain mellowness and richness about his style, which adorns without disguising the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> and nervousness, which is its other great characteristic,\u2014a sedate gracefulness and manly simplicity in the more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a>,\u2014and a mild majesty and considerate enthusiasm where he rises above them, of which we scarcely know where to find any other example. There is great equability, too, and sustained force in every part of his writings. He never exhausts himself in flashes and epigrams, nor languishes into tameness or insipidity; at first sight you would say that plainness and good sense were the predominating qualities; but by and bye, this simplicity is enriched with the delicate and vivid colours of a fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>,\u2014the free and forcible touches of a most powerful intellect,\u2014and the lights and shades of an unerring and harmonizing taste. In comparing it with the styles of his most celebrated contemporaries, we would say that it was more purely and peculiarly a written style,\u2014and, therefore, rejected those ornaments that more properly belong to oratory. It had no impetuosity, hurry, or vehemence,\u2014no bursts or sudden turns or abruptions, like that of Burke; and though eminently smooth and melodious, it was not modulated to an uniform system of solemn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECLAMATION\">declamation</a> like that of Johnson, nor spread out in the richer and more voluminous elocution of Stewart; nor still less broken into that patch-work of scholastic pedantry and conversational smartness which has found its admirers in Gibbon. It is a style, in short, of great freedom, force, and beauty; but the deliberate style of a man of thought and of learning, and neither that of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WIT\">wit</a> throwing out his extempores with an affectation of careless grace,\u2014nor of a rhetorician thinking more of his manner than his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, and determined to be admired for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>, whatever may be the fate of his sentiments.\n\n\"His habits of composition, as we have understood, were not perhaps exactly what might have been expected from their results. He wrote rather slowly,\n\u2014and his first sketches were often very slight and imperfect,\u2014like the rude chalking for a masterly picture. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> effort and greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> was in their revisal and correction; and there were no limits to the improvement which resulted from this application. It was not the style merely, or indeed chiefly, that gained by it: The whole reasoning, and sentiment, and illustration, was enlarged and new modelled in the course of it, and a naked outline became gradually informed with life, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, and expression. It was not at all like the common finishing and polishing, to which careful authors generally subject the first draughts of their compositions\u2014nor even like the fastidious and tentative alterations with which some more anxious writers <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASSAY\">assay</a> their choicest passages. It was, in fact, the great filling in of the picture\u2014the working up of the figured weft, on the naked and meagre woof that had been stretched to receive it; and the singular thing in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> was, not only that he left this most material part of his work to be performed after the whole outline had been finished, but that he could proceed with it to an indefinite extent, and enrich and improve as long as he thought fit, without any risk either of destroying the proportions of that outline, or injuring the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a> and unity of the design. He was perfectly aware, too, of the possession of this extraordinary power, and it was partly, we presume, in consequence of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSCIOUSNESS\">consciousness</a> that he was not only at all times ready to go on with any work in which he was engaged, without waiting for favourable moments or hours of greater alacrity, but that he never felt any of those doubts and misgivings as to his being able to get creditably through with his undertaking, to which we believe most authors are occasionally liable. As he never wrote upon any subject of which he was not perfectly master, he was secure against all blunders in the substance of what he had to say; and felt quite assured, that if he was only allowed time enough, he should finally come to say it in the very best way of which he was capable. He had no anxiety, therefore, either in undertaking or proceeding with his tasks; and intermitted and resumed them at his convenience, with the comfortable certainty, that all the time he bestowed on them was turned to good account, and that what was left imperfect at one sitting might be finished with equal ease and advantage at another. Being thus perfectly sure both of his end and his means, he experienced, in the course of his compositions, none of that little fever of the spirits with which that operation is so apt to be accompanied. He had no capricious visitings of fancy which it was necessary to fix on the spot or to lose for ever,\u2014no casual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSPIRATION\">inspiration</a> to invoke and to wait for,\u2014no transitory and evanescent lights to catch before they faded. All that was in his mind was subject to his control, and amenable to his call, though it might not obey at the moment; and while his taste was so sure, that he was in no danger of overworking anything that he had designed, all his thoughts and sentiments had that unity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONGRUITY\">congruity</a>, that they fell almost spontaneously into harmony and order; and the last added, incorporated, and assimilated with the first, as if they had sprung simultaneously from the same happy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a>.\n\n\"But we need dwell no longer on qualities that may be gathered hereafter from the works he has left behind him. They who lived with him mourn the most for those which will be traced in no such memorial; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIZE\">prize</a> far above those talents which gained him his high name in philosophy, that personal character which endeared him to his friends, and shed a grace and a dignity over all the society in which he moved. The same admirable taste which is conspicuous in his writings, or rather the higher principles from which that taste was but an emanation, spread a similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARM\">charm</a> over his whole life and conversation; and gave to the most learned Philosopher of his day the manners and deportment of the most perfect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">Gentleman</a>. Nor was this in him the result merely of good sense and good temper, assisted by an early familiarity with good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a>, and a consequent knowledge of his own place and that of all around him. His good breeding was of a higher <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a>; and his powers of pleasing rested on something better than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> companionable qualities. With the greatest kindness and generosity of nature, he united the most manly firmness, and the highest principles of honour,\u2014and the most cheerful and social dispositions, with the gentlest and steadiest affections. Towards women he had always the most chivalrous feelings of regard and attention, and was, beyond almost all men, acceptable and agreeable in their society,\u2014though without the least levity or pretension unbecoming his age or condition: And such, indeed, was the fascination of the perfect simplicity and mildness of his manners, that the same tone and deportment seemed equally appropriate in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a>, and enabled him to delight the young and the gay with the same sort of conversation which instructed the learned and the grave. There never, indeed, was a man of learning and talent who appeared in society so perfectly free from all sorts of pretension or notion of his own importance, or so little solicitous to distinguish himself, or so sincerely willing to give place to every one else. Even upon subjects which he had thoroughly studied, he was never in the least impatient to speak, and spoke at all times without any tone of authority; while, so far from wishing to set off what he had to say by any brilliancy or emphasis of expression, it seemed generally as if he had studied to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISGUISE\">disguise</a> the weight and originality of his thoughts under the plainest form of speech and the most quiet and indifferent manner: so that the profoundest remarks and subtlest observations were often dropped, not only without any solicitude that their value should be observed, but without any apparent consciousness that they possessed any. Though the most social of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> beings, and the most disposed to encourage and sympathise with the gaiety and joviality of others, his own spirits were in general rather cheerful than gay, or at least never rose to any turbulence or tumult of merriment; and while he would listen with the kindest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a> to the more extravagant sallies of his younger friends, and prompt them by the heartiest approbation, his own satisfaction might generally be traced in a slow and temperate smile, gradually mantling over his benevolent and intelligent features, and lighting up the countenance of the Sage with the expression of the\nmildest and most genuine philanthropy. It was wonderful, indeed, considering the measure of his own intellect, and the rigid and undeviating propriety of his own conduct, how tolerant he was of the defects and errors of other men. He was too indulgent, in truth, and favourable to his friends; and made a kind and liberal allowance for the faults of all mankind,\u2014except only faults of baseness or of cruelty,\u2014against which he never failed to manifest the most open scorn and detestation.\n\nIndependent, in short, of his high attainments, Mr Playfair was one of the most amiable and estimable of men,\u2014delightful in his manners,\u2014inflexible in his principles, and generous in his affections, he had all that could charm in society or attach in private; and while his friends enjoyed the free and unstudied conversation of an easy and intelligent associate, they had at all times the proud and inward assurance that he was a being upon whose perfect honour and generosity they might rely with the most implicit confidence, in life and in death,\u2014and of whom it was equally impossible, that, under any circumstances, he should ever perform a mean, a selfish, or a questionable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, as that his body should cease to gravitate or his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> to live!\n\n\"If we do not greatly deceive ourselves, there is nothing here of exaggeration or partial feeling,\u2014and nothing with which an indifferent and honest chronicler would not concur. Nor is it altogether idle to have dwelt so long on the personal character of this distinguished individual: For we are ourselves persuaded, that this personal character has done almost as much for the cause of science and philosophy among us as the great talents and attainments with which it was combined,\u2014and has contributed in a very eminent degree to give to the better society of this our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> that tone of intelligence and liberality by which it is so honourably distinguished. It is not a little advantageous to philosophy that it is in fashion,\u2014and it is still more advantageous, perhaps, to the society which is led to confer on it this apparently trivial distinction. It is a great thing for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> at large,\u2014for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>, its prosperity, and its renown,\u2014that the upper and influencing part of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> should be made familiar, even in its untasked and social hours, with sound and liberal information, and be taught to know and respect those who have distinguished themselves for great intellectual attainments. Nor is it, after all, a slight or despicable reward for a man of genius to be received with honour in the highest and most elegant society around him, and to receive in his living person that homage and applause which is too often reserved for his memory. Now, those desirable ends can never be effectually accomplished, unless the manners of our leading philosophers are agreeable, and their personal habits and dispositions engaging and amiable. From the time of Hume and Robertson, we have been fortunate in Edinburgh in possessing a succession of distinguished men, who have kept up this salutary connection between the learned and the fashionable world; but there never, perhaps, was any one who contributed so powerfully to confirm and extend it, and that in times when it was peculiarly difficult, as the lamented individual of whom we are now speaking; and they who have had the most opportunity to observe how superior the society of Edinburgh is to that of most other places of the same size, and how much of that superiority is owing to the cordial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of the two aristocracies, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">Rank</a> and of Letters,\u2014of both of which it happens to be the chief <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCIAL\">provincial</a> seat,\u2014will be best able to judge of the importance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> he has thus rendered to its inhabitants, and through them, and by their example, to all the rest of the country.\"\n\n(<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLARISATION_OF_LIGHT\">POLARISATION OF LIGHT</a>.

Especially as the administration of the system, within the last twenty-five years, has been so essentially altered, as to render any previous account, in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, obsolete; and the effects of the system have been so widely extended, and so sensibly felt, as to obtain a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>.\n\nWe shall, therefore, under this article, explain, as briefly as possible, the laws on which the English Poor-System is founded; their practical administration; their effects <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> and moral; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> plans which have been proposed for the mitigation and ultimate removal of the evils inseparable from a system of compulsory and indiscriminate relief, involving an interference with the general concerns of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> portion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a>.\n\nIt is not necessary to trace, particularly, the circumstances of difficulty and hardship, to relieve which the compulsory provision for the poor was first instituted. From the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a> of the earliest statutes, the middle of the sixteenth century appears to have been the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> and wants of the poor began to attract legislative attention. In 1536, 1550, 1561, and 1563, sundry statutes were passed directing that every aged, disabled, and impotent person, should be relieved and kept in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> where they were born <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> had dwelt three years; and in the last of the acts referred to, the justices of the peace were empowered to make the payment of assessments for these purposes compulsory. The sudden alienation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABBEY\">abbey</a>-lands, the cessation of all customary relief from the monasteries, together with the rapid increase in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> price of commodities, occasioned by the influx of the precious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a> from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a> (estimated at 50 per cent. between the years 1550 and 1580), sufficiently account for the pressure on the labouring classes which these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> were intended to remove.\n\nHowever, in spite of all palliations, this evil grew, and led to the famous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of the 43d of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a>, which continues to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> and operative <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a> on this important subject. This statute enacts, \"That the churchwardens and overseers shall take order from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> to time (with the consent of two or more justices) for setting to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> the children of all such whose parents shall not be thought able to keep and maintain their children; and also, for setting to work all such persons, married or unmarried, having <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> means to maintain them, and using no ordinary or daily trade to get their living by; and also, to raise by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-TAXATION\">taxation</a>, &c., a convenient stock of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAX\">flax</a>, to set the poor on work; and also competent sums of money for and towards the necessary relief of the lame, impotent old, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a>, and such other among them, being poor and not able to work.\"\n\nBy this enactment, the State virtually undertook Results of to do two things, which were never before attempted the Act of by any national or legislative provision. It became Eliz. 43. pledged to support, at the public expense, all the poor, aged, and impotent members of the community; and, far worse, to provide employment for all those who would not or could not procure it for themselves.\n\nThe first of these undertakings, however humanely designed, is found by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> to eradicate some of the finest principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, and to create more distresses than it remedies.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, which compels the overseers to set to work all those for whose labour there is no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> demand, is in decided opposition to the known rules of political economy. The number of persons that can be employed in labour must absolutely depend upon the amount of the funds applicable to the maintenance of labour; so that, an enactment, engaging to find employment for as many as may demand it, undertakes a condition which it is not in the power of any law to fulfil.\n\nThe wonder which arises at the first view of a system like this\u2014a system which has the radical fault of assuming, or establishing, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> of the poor, i.e. as it may turn out, of the whole community, to support, at the expense of the community, is, that it should have existed more than 200 years, without occasioning the complete destruction of prosperity. This, however, is no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the innocence of the law; it results from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of its execution and administration. When persons were only relieved in their own parishes, and when relief was only to be had by application to an overseer, and often, of course, distributed in a capricious and insulting manner, few would seek it who could possibly subsist otherwise, and a becoming spirit of independence diminished the number of claimants. But above all, it was ordered by the law that the idle should be set to work, and the paupers maintained in workhouses.\n\nAccordingly, workhouses existed in all large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>; Administration in most considerable villages, and in some districts, where the parishes were small, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> workhouse was established by the union of several neighbouring parishes. Nothing could render these receptacles a comfortable abode, except the wisest management and most vigilant inspection. But few persons capable of adequately discharging such an office would undertake so unpromising an employment. All ages, and all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a>,\u2014the orphan or the illegitimate child; the prostitute <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a>, the idiots of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a>, the idle vagabond, whom no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> would take the trouble to reclaim; the aged widow and the decrepit labourer; the most pitiable members of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>, and those who had the least claim to compassion, were crowded into one comfortless home, and joined their quarrels, their com-\nplaints, and their sorrows together. Those who had any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of comfort or decency, would submit to the severest privations rather than obey the threatened <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ALTERNATIVE\">alternative</a>, and go to the workhouse.\n\nSo that, twenty-five or thirty years ago, the expenses arising from the poor-laws were, in a great measure, confined to the maintenance of workhouses; and the workhouses were a resource for the aged, destitute, and impotent; a place of restraint for the idle and disorderly, and an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of terror to the able and industrious. The outdoor relief was not extended beyond occasional assistance during temporary illness, or the woman's confinement; or beyond the payment of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the rent of the cottage in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> of large families; or a small weekly allowance to a few infirm persons of good character, who made up the rest of their support, by such trifling works of industry as they were able to perform. Some encroachments, no doubt, took place from time to time, and in peculiar situations, on these general principles of public relief; but no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> and in work ever thought of applying for parochial pay: and as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> encouragement had not yet disturbed, in any material degree, the general adaptation of the supply to the demand for labour, want of work was not a common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>. Thinking people, it is true, even then foresaw that the principle of the poor-laws was fundamentally wrong, and had a tendency to create the distress which it professed to remove; and particularly, they argued, that the idea of providing employ at the public expense was contrary to every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> rule of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> and policy. But, in fact, this part of the act of Elizabeth had not then been called into extensive operation, and went little further than the wholesome purpose of keeping those employed who were collected in workhouses; while the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a>, the disgrace, and the misery of the workhouse itself, acted the useful part of stimulating industry, and encouraging independence, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> as the alternative of entering it, or of providing independent support, was left by the Legislature, enforced by the parish, and required by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a>.\n\nNotwithstanding these checks, however, to the natural consequences of the system, the assessment to the poor is found to have progressively increased at every period for which returns have been preserved. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> sum applied to the relief of the poor for the years 1748, 1749, 1750, was L. 690,000 per annum. In 1776 it amounted to L. 1,531,000, an increase far beyond what the rise in the prices of corn would justify: * in 1783\u20144\u20145, to L.2,000,000, though the average price of corn had fallen during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> intermediate years; \u2020 so that such gradual increase, in spite of all obstacles, and without any sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> cause, can only be attributed to the known tendency of regular and indiscriminate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CHARITY\">charity</a> to create its own objects.\n\nBut in the year 1795 a change took place in the administration of the poor-laws, which has completely altered the state of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. This was a winter of unusual scarcity. The price of corn per <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>, which for the three preceding years had stood at L.2, 14s., averaged more than L. 4 during the whole of 1795 and 1796. As the returns of labour could not be expected to keep pace with such a sudden rise in the necessaries of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, distress was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a>; and there appeared as claimants for parochial relief not only the infirm and aged, but the able-bodied and industrious, who had few of them ever before resorted to the parish, and that only during temporary illness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISABILITY\">disability</a>. It was at this season of acknowledged difficulty that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> magistrates, first in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BERKSHIRE\">Berkshire</a>, and afterwards in other parts of the middle and south of England, agreed to relieve the poor according to a fixed and uniform scale, regulated by the price of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>; and issued a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>, which professed to show, at one view, what should be the weekly income of the labouring poor, which it fixed in a certain ratio, according to the price of bread, and the size of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>. \u2021 Whatever the man's labour produced less than the provisions of this table required was made up by the parish, whose compliance was subsequently enforced by the Legislature; and the justices were empowered, under certain conditions, to order relief out of the workhouse, and to those who possessed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of their own.\n\nThe practical operation of this system is as follows: Practical Every labourer is presumed to require a gallon loaf Operation of standard wheaten bread, weekly, for every member of his family, and one over: i.e., four loaves for three persons; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> for six.\u2014A. B. has a wife and four children; he claims seven gallon loaves, costing, we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> suppose, 12s. But his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WAGES\">wages</a> are only 9s.: therefore the parish supplies him with 3s. weekly. C. D. has a wife and six children; he requires nine gallon loaves, or 14s. 8d. He earns 10s.; the parish makes up the rest. E. F. is so idle and disorderly, that no one will employ him; but he has a wife and five children, and requires eight gallon loaves for their support. His allowance, then, is 9s. in lieu of the wages which he ought to earn, and 5s. or 6s. to make up the deficiency of these wages.\n\nMany, we doubt not, of the readers of this article will imagine that this is a remarkable or insulated case. So far from it, this sort of machinery has been going on, not only in a single parish, or a single district, but throughout half the country during\n\n---\n\n* Between 1750 and 1776, the price of wheat had risen from 35s. to 48s. The advance of price would thus account for an increase of about one-third, making the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> for expenditure upon the poor L.920,000; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> being increased about eighteen per cent., brings an addition of L. 165,600; making L.1,085,000 as the natural increase, instead of the actual increase, L. 1,531,000. See Second <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">Letter</a> to Mr Peel on the Increase of Pauperism, p. 84.\n\n\u2020 Average price of corn for ten years preceding 1775, L. 2, 11s. 3\u00bdd.; average from 1775 to 1785 L. 2, 7s. 8\u00bdd. The increase of population during that period did not exceed six per cent.\n\n\u2021 For the first introduction of this system, see Sir F. Eden on the Poor, Vol. I. p. 579, &c.\nThe magistrates with whom this fatal scale originated were actuated, no doubt, by feelings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>. The evil against which they had to contend was pressing; the price of provisions was rapidly rising, and the wages of labour bore no proportion to that increase; so that a man's weekly pay was clearly insufficient to support his family. The crisis, too, was formidable; discontent and insubordination existed very widely; and it was naturally thought, that, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> real were added to imaginary evils, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUNGER\">hunger</a> sharpened the exacerbation of previous ill temper, the peace of the community might be seriously endangered. The people had been often taught that revolution would make their condition better; and if it became clear that nothing could make it worse, no slight additional force would be given to the arguments of the evil-disposed and discontented. In these difficult circumstances, two modes of administering relief lay before them: one was a compulsory augmentation of the wages of labour to meet the existing case, which they were then empowered to order by a statute 5th Eliz. c. 4, since wisely repealed; the other was the enlargement of parochial aid, in the way we have described. Of two plans, both radically bad, it would be hazardous to decide which might have been followed with less permanent evil to society. Upon the consequences of interfering with the wages of labour, we can only speculate; but the consequences of legalizing this mode of public relief are too plainly written to be concealed. From its publication and general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADOPTION\">adoption</a>, the industry of the lower classes has deteriorated; their independent feeling has been annihilated; the public burdens have been enormously increased; and the proportion of supply and demand in all the numerous departments of labour has been deranged.\n\nEvery new experiment in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEGISLATION\">legislation</a> is interesting to the philosophical inquirer, and valuable to the practical statesman. A system like that which we have been describing, in particular, has placed the inhabitants of a great country in so new and untried a predicament, that it becomes a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of singular importance to trace its effects, political and moral. The poor, it must be acknowledged, in all crowded and highly civilized <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, present a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a> of great embarrassment. Where so much wealth and so much penury are seen in opposition; where there is on the one side so much superfluity, on the other so much deficiency; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> which promises a nearer equalization of the comforts of life brings a strong recommendation, at first sight, to the best feelings of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEGISLATOR\">legislator</a> and the moralist. On this account, our English system of poor-laws has been the subject of frequent eulogy;\u2014has been glanced at with a view to its adoption both with reference to France and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>; though the rulers of these countries have hitherto been wisely contented rather to take our warning than to follow our example. Scotland is still in a more hesitating state.\n\nWe shall therefore think it necessary, in this place, to point out the consequences of this artificial system, both as they affect the community which affords the relief, and the individuals who receive it. And it will be seen that the general principle which condemns such interference has been strongly confirmed by the practical evils resulting from its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INFRACTION\">infraction</a>.\n\n1. The first, and perhaps the greatest of the political mischief occasioned by the poor-laws is this; that they disturb the due proportion between the supply of labourers and the demand for labour. They encourage population, without reference to the funds by which that population is to be supported. They persuade the lower classes to marry as soon as inclination prompts, as if it were needless to reflect whether they can maintain the probable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a>.\n\nIn the natural and healthy course of things, the case of a society increasing too fast can hardly occur in a state of civilization. Some part of the community, indeed, will be pushed to distress and indigence in all countries; but this is not to be set to the account of over-population; it results from the misfortunes to which mankind are subject, and the vicious conduct in which they indulge; and may exist to a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, where it could not be argued that the country was over-peopled. The natural arrangement is, that a man and his family should depend upon himself; should be supported by his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> exertions: and knowing this, he considers before he marries whether the ordinary wages of labour in his peculiar vocation will support the probable expenses of the family which he has a right to expect: and if otherwise, he forbears to marry till he can either get better employment, or has laid by some provision to go in aid of his weekly earnings. When labour is so plentiful in the market, that he can only procure employ for half or two-thirds of the year; and when it is so scantily repaid, that though he may earn sufficient to support himself, he can do no more\u2014then he has a clear intimation that he cannot marry without the risk of entailing severe want upon himself and his family. Therefore the labourers, and the demand for labour, keep pace together, by a gentle and equable arrangement, which acts wherever mankind are so far civilized as to know the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of reason, and so prudently governed, as to be allowed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> it.\n\nBut the law which compels the public to furnish employment to as many as come to claim it, and regulates the wages given in return, not according to the market price of labour, but according to the wants of the labourer, removes at once the natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> which adjusts the proportion between the demand and the supply of labourers, and exposes the country to all the evils of a redundant population. For as matters are now disposed in England, the question is not whether the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a> can support his probable family, but whether the parish will; and the parish pledges itself, by allowed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>, to discharge the parental duty, when it allots a regular addition to the wages of labour in proportion to the number of children. A large family of children is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURE\">treasure</a> in America, because such is the demand for labour, that they can in very early life do more than maintain themselves: and they are a treasure in a country...\nStrange to say, an elaborate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of the poor-laws has been attempted on this very ground, that they are calculated to accelerate the progress of population at the cheapest rate to the community. Men are not inclined, it is said, to burthen themselves with a family, unless they can <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> themselves a reasonable share of comfort. That comfort can only be secured by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> wages. But high wages cannot be limited to those who deserve them by their services to the state, in rearing a numerous family: They must be given to single as well as to married men\u2014to those with small families as well as those with large. This would be unpardonably extravagant. Let us therefore sink the price of labour, but secure a support to those meritorious members of society, who furnish the manufactories and the armies with their superfluous children. Let \"the law say,\" provide the state with children, if you are inclined to marriage; and, should the produce of your industry not be sufficient to rear them in health and vigour, here is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUND\">fund</a> that will supply deficiencies; or, if the expense of rearing them prevents your making a provision for old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, here is a fund out of which you shall be supported with decency, whenever your infirmities prevent your power of supplying yourselves. Such a provision must soon counteract any natural impediment to a full supply of people; and if the application of the fund be guarded by wise provisions, securing a man's best exertions while capable, and those provisions are not perverted, the population raised thereby will be of the best sort; it will be robust, healthy, and industrious.\"\n\nAn argument so rash and so contradictory to experience as this requires little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONFUTATION\">confutation</a>. A statesman ought to have far more than human sagacity, who takes upon himself to give <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> encouragement to population, which he is allowed to do, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a> of the poor-laws, \"when it shall appear that an increase of people is necessary to the further progress of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> in wealth and prosperity.\"\u2020 This, surely, is an inquiry too profound and complex to be safely entrusted to any statesman: especially when we remember that encouragements to marriage, like those held out by our laws, cannot be appointed pro tempore: the engine, once set in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, cannot be checked or suspended at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>; it is itself artificial, but the provisions for its safe operation must, after all, be those alone which nature has established, whose primary laws were violated in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> speculation. Nature has established an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">index</a>, in the rate of wages, by which the wants of the society as to population may be clearly ascertained. To set aside this index, and substitute the temporary and short-sighted views of a statesman, as to \"the wants, resources, and political regulations of a country,\" is as pernicious in practice as it is unphilosophical in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a>. Nature, besides, has provided by an universal principle, that the case supposed to justify this rash and impolitic legislation shall never really exist. It is a point proved beyond the possibility of gainsaying, that population will not only increase up to the limit of available subsistence, but beyond it,\u2014will always reach a certain point of distress. Therefore, this instinctive principle, when left to itself, is always ready to fill up every channel of industry by which a family can be maintained. If, then, the politician ventures to interfere, and accelerate the natural force of this principle, he ought first to ensure the continuance of those circumstances which seem to him to require or justify such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ACCELERATION\">acceleration</a>. If this is confessedly beyond his power, he has no right to interfere at all.\n\nThese obvious objections against disturbing the natural order of things have met with a most striking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> since the peace of 1815. The unnatural acceleration which had taken place during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> became at its conclusion the cause of such severe distress, as almost to render peace a doubtful blessing. Extraordinary circumstances continuing certainly for an unprecedented length of time, had given encouragement to extraordinary exertions; the common observer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> nothing unsound or unhealthy in the state, as long as things remained the same; but the first change of circumstances produced a dangerous revulsion, and proved the evil of empiricism in legislation.\n\nThis leads us on to the second mischief arising out of the present state of the poor-laws, which is closely connected with the preceding. They tend to overburthen the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, upon which the funds for their support are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a>; and thus to introduce a system of universal pauperism.\n\nWhatever be the nature of the funds destined to support population, the tendency of population is to increase beyond them. This is matter of experience in every department of labour, from the highest to the lowest. In all the branches of national industry, there are always more claimants for employ than can attain it; and, though the excess, for obvious reasons, is at different periods very different in degree, the redundancy is always on the side of the labourer;\u2014there are always more workmen than can find employment in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a>;\u2014always more journeymen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a> than can be supplied with work;\u2014always more agricultural labourers, than, taking the year throughout, can be employed in useful husbandry. Not even the unhealthy, or degrading, or precarious nature of the employ prevents this effect of the expansive principle of population. Chimney-sweeping, street-sweeping, coal-heaving, mining, thieving, and begging, are all pursued beyond the possibility of maintenance; are all followed by claimants for support beyond the amount of support which they are capable of furnishing.\n\n* Inquiry into the Policy, Humanity, and past Effects of the Poor-Laws, page 41. The same argument is supported by the late Mr Rose, in his Observations on the Poor-Laws.\n\n\u2020 Weyland on Population and Production, p. 83.\nBut this tendency to increase, while it stimulates industry and foresight, occasions little practical disturbance as long as the funds by which such claimants are to be maintained arise from productive labour, and are dependent on it. Because the pressure of population, while it requires fresh funds as means of support, contributes to increase those funds by the return which it makes in productive labour.\n\nThe case is widely different with respect to eleemosynary funds. Those who claim them are continually becoming more numerous; but the funds themselves, the parish funds, or whatever funds the state can employ, though not exactly defined, are necessarily limited by the ability of the payers. The population, therefore, which is dependent upon these funds, being freed from the restraints which, under usual circumstances, prevent its redundancy, must ultimately surpass any funds that are not equally unlimited, and do not admit of progressive increase in proportion to the progressive demand.\n\nThe experiment of supporting all who may require eleemosynary maintenance has been too often made to render this conclusion doubtful. Catholic countries, in which the nature of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a> is every way misunderstood, afford, as might be expected, the most striking proofs that wherever gratuitous supplies are furnished, the demands soon rise above the means of meeting them, or, if the means are unlimited, increase in proportion. Rome, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPLES\">Naples</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CADIZ\">Cadiz</a>, and indeed all the principal cities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, are described by all travellers as being equally remarkable for indiscriminate bounties, and universal mendicity. The town of Oviedo, for instance, at the time when the late Mr Townsend visited it, afforded a most instructive example. There was an hospicio, or general workhouse, the revenues of which were L. 4000 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">Sterling</a>; equal probably in Spain to thrice that sum in England; this also served as a foundling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">hospital</a>; besides which refuge for the poor, and their children, the bishop ordered seventy reals to be distributed at his gates every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> to all comers, and weekly pensions both to widows and orphans. In addition to all this, the canons scattered alms plentifully as they walked through the streets; six <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONVENTS\">convents</a> administered bread and broth at noon, and a commodious hospital was ready to receive the sick and infirm. All these resources were too little, even among so small a population as 7500 souls. \"Notwithstanding all that has been done,\" says that intelligent traveller (and what more in the way of charity can be devised?) beggars, clothed in rags, and swarming with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VERMIN\">vermin</a>, abound in every street.\"\n\nIn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>, we are struck at once with the folly of such undistinguishing charity. Yet what do we see in the account of Oviedo, but that state on a small scale, which the poor-laws are calculated to render universal in England?\u2014Workhouses in every parish, supported at the public charge, and serving as foundling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOSPITALS\">hospitals</a>, and offering a refuge to the poor and their children. Besides a regular donation to those who may not like the confinement of the workhouse, but can prefer the claim of a burthensome family. And all this independent of the private charity, which we have no wish to see curtailed, but which ought to stand alone; the \"bread and broth at noon,\" judiciously administered, and the public \"hospital ready to receive the sick and infirm.\" The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> in the circumstances and character of the two countries has rendered the consequences hitherto less calamitous in England than in Spain; but the tendency is similar, and the effect equally disproportionate to the means; legal provision has been seen to be no preventive to individual want, or national distress.\n\nAnd why is this, but because the claimants are daily multiplying in number, and press closer and closer upon the funds destined to satisfy them? The increased and increasing burthen of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATES\">rates</a> in England is a sufficient proof of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> which we desire to establish. Notwithstanding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEGRADATION\">degradation</a> of dependence,\u2014the liability to vexatious, and often painful removals,\u2014the restraint of workhouses,\u2014and the murmurs of the reluctant dispensers of compulsory alms, to all which an English pauper must submit; experience has made it very evident that, as long as any public support can be relied on, the claimants for it will increase in number and importunity; and that, if any limit is to be set to the demand, it must be sought for somewhere else than in the forbearance of the people, or the decrease of indigence.\n\nAlready has the claim, in very many instances, exceeded the available resources. In numerous extensive districts, during the years 1816, 1817, and 1818, it proved impossible for the contributor to furnish the quota which the necessities of those without labour, and, therefore, without support, demanded. Admission into the work and alms-houses, once dreaded as the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a> of hopeless penury, has been courted as a boon, and accepted as a favour. Whilst in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, and other great towns, many almost starving families were deterred from applying to the parish by the crowded, unhealthy, and horrible state of the workhouses into which they would be received, if indeed they could be received at all; many parishes were absolutely unable to raise the assessments, the increase of which, according to the existing laws, has tended only to bring more and more persons upon the parish, and to make what was collected less and less effectual; and yet there was an almost universal cry from one end of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> to the other for voluntary charity to come in aid of the parochial assessments.*\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time, the amount of the rates themselves, which was, in 1785, L. 2,000,000, in 1803, had reached L. 4,267,000, in 1813, L. 6,294,000.\u2020 This increase, great in itself, becomes still more important as a proof of the effect of the system, when\n\n---\n\n* Malthus on Population, 5th edition, Vol. II. p. 352.\n\u2020 Report of Select <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMITTEE\">Committee</a>, 1817\u20131821. The \"Letter to Mr Peel\" estimates the increase in the price of wheat at 9 per cent. in 1803, and the increased population at 17. According to which, the amount ought to have been L. 2,438,670, instead of L. 4,267,965.\nwe remember that the intervening years had been years of unexampled demand for men and every kind of labour; and also, that, owing to the sudden growth of the burden during the scarcities of 1800 and 1801, a remarkable improvement had taken place in the collection and disbursement of the parochial funds, to so great a degree, that any material diminution cannot generally be expected from more prudent management, whilst the system itself remains. Under these circumstances, if the disorder had not been radical, the annual expenditure ought to have become less and less, instead of increasing, from 1803 to 1813, by a third of the whole, or about a sixth of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> amount, after allowing for the increase in population and the price of corn.\n\nIt is especially necessary that the price of corn should always be taken into the account. The public is very liable to be misled by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> decrease\u2014a decrease in the actual sum, whilst the increase is really proceeding, and the burthen heavier than ever. It is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, that L. 100, with wheat at 40s. per quarter, is equal to L. 200, with wheat at 80s., and is paid with far more difficulty by the agriculturist, who furnishes the great proportion of the rates. If corn continues at the prices of 1822, the rates will not be effectually lower, till the L.7,500,000 of 1819 are reduced to L.4,000,000; an event which we no more expect to witness than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> of three millions of the population.\n\nThe alarming distress which followed the spring of 1815, the consequent increase of the rates, and the difficulty of meeting this demand, led to a long and diligent inquiry into the whole subject before a Committee of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">House</a> of Commons, in the session of 1817. From the returns which were then made from the manufacturing towns of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BIRMINGHAM\">Birmingham</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANCHESTER\">Manchester</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COVENTRY\">Coventry</a>, &c.;* and also from many districts solely agricultural, it clearly appeared that the excess of demand above the funds prepared to answer it, was no theoretical or even distant danger, but one which some districts had already experienced, and to which all districts were more or less rapidly approaching. Distraint for rates became very general; and every distrait is an encroachment upon the national resources, and a conversion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> into income. We soon become alive to the probable result where an individual does this; and if a nation is but an aggregate of individuals, national extravagance and individual extravagance must pay the same penalty, and end in the same fate.\n\nIt is impossible to predict, with any certainty, how long or how short a time the present system might go on, before such a crisis arrived. Whenever the charge upon the land for the support of those who do not add enough to the annual produce of the country to support themselves, is so great that the land can be no longer cultivated with a profit, then, of course, it will be thrown up. This charge is gradually increasing every year, if not actually, yet relatively to the price of corn; and the natural effect has already followed in some districts where the pressure is particularly severe. It is evident that, in proportion as this takes place, the rates become still heavier on those who continue to pay. So that the tendency is to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> the contributors annually into a narrower and narrower circle, each step bringing some upon the rates for support who had before assisted to pay them, till the whole cement of society gives way, and the natural gradation of ranks and fortunes, on which its prosperity depends, is sunk and lost in national pauperism.\n\nSuch a crisis was clearly apprehended by the Committee of the House of Commons; and with a short extract from their deliberate and valuable Report, we shall confirm, as well as conclude, our own reasonings\u2014\n\n\"Whether the assessment be confined to land and houses, as at present, or other denominations of property be made practically liable to the same charge, the Committee feel it their imperious duty to state their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that, unless some efficacious check be interposed, there is every reason to think that the amount of the assessment will continue, as it has done, to increase, till at a period, more or less remote, according to the progress the evil has already made in different places, it shall have absorbed the profits of the property on which the rates may have been assessed: producing thereby the neglect and ruin of the land, and the waste or removal of other property, to the utter subversion of that happy order of society so long upheld in these kingdoms.\n\n\"The gradual increase which has taken place both in the number of paupers and in the assessment for their support, can hardly fail to have arisen from causes inherent in the system itself; as it does not appear to have depended entirely upon any temporary or local circumstances. Scarcity of provisions, and a diminished demand for particular manufactures, have occasioned, from time to time, an increased pressure in particular parishes. But by comparing the assessments in the two counties in this kingdom in which the largest portion of the population is employed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>, namely, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEDFORDSHIRE\">Bedfordshire</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEREFORDSHIRE\">Herefordshire</a>, it will be seen that there has been the same progressive augmentation in the amount of the assessments, as may be observed to have taken place in the manufacturing counties.\"\n\n| County of | Money Expended on Paupers, in the Year ending Easter 1776 (omitting fractions) | Average Expenditure on Paupers, 1783, 1784, 1785 | Expenditure, 1803. | Expenditure, 1815. |\n|-----------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEREFORD\">Hereford</a>, | L.10,593                                         | 16,727                                        | 48,067           | 59,255           |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEDFORD\">Bedford</a>,  | 16,662                                          | 20,977                                        | 38,070           | 50,370           |\n\n* In Manchester, the relief given to the out-door poor increased within ten years from 1805 to L.14,000, instead of L.8000 per annum; and the whole expenditure, from L.16,000 to L.27,000, in the most moderate years\u2014in dear seasons, one-third more. In Birmingham, the increase in ten years was one-third, being L.20,000 in 1806, L.30,000 in 1816.\u2014Commons' Report.\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> afforded by this table is not to be resisted. The charge on the rates, in 1815, not in two or three counties only, but taking England throughout, was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> its amount in 1795; though, in 1815, the price of corn had sunk to a moderate average. What then, except a change in the existing laws and management, is to hinder their doubling again in twenty more years\u2014at least virtually doubling, with respect to the ability of the payers? But it certainly cannot be supposed that land which now, in many cases, pays a rate equal, or more than equal, to the rent, can afford to double that charge, and be cultivated with a profit. In fact, many petitions were laid before <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a>, complaining that the annual value of the property assessed to the poor-rates, was not sufficient to maintain the numerous and increasing claimants, even if it were to be set free of rent; so that the parishes were threatened with a total abandonment of the occupiers of their land. And though these are, indisputably, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> cases, there is quite enough in the general appearance of the country to warrant the conclusion expressed in the Report, and to justify the worst apprehensions respecting the eventual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the system.\n\nThis is sufficiently proved by the experience of the five years succeeding 1815, as digested in the following table:\n\n| Years | Expended for the Relief of the Poor\u2020 | Average Price of Corn per Quarter |\n|-------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| 1815  | L.5,418,845                         | 70 6                             |\n| 1816  | 5,724,506                           | 61 10                            |\n| 1817  | 6,918,217                           | 87 4                             |\n| 1818  | 7,890,148                           | 90 7                             |\n| 1819  | 7,331,650                           | 82 9                             |\n| 1820  | 7,329,594                           | 69 5                             |\n\nNow, upon the first glance at this table, it will appear, that as the price of corn in 1815 and in 1820 was the same, the amount of the rates ought likewise to have been the same, with the addition of ten per cent. for increase of population. It ought, therefore, to have been six millions in 1820, according to the scale of 1815. But it is seven millions, giving a million, or one-sixth of the whole, as the actual growth of five years. This surely must satisfy every doubt concerning the ruinous tendency of the system, and shows that the only remaining question must be, not whether the evil is in its own nature progressive, but how the progressive evil may be most wisely and effectually restrained.\n\nSuch are the political consequences of the system of poor-laws, as now administered in England. Its moral effects are no less pernicious.\n\n1. The first of these which we shall mention is Poor-Laws, that total improvidence which exists in so remarkable a degree both among the manufacturing and agricultural labourers. In the former class, this is peculiarly inexcusable. The demand for all labour is improving, fluctuating, and liable to occasional and sudden variations. But in manufacturing labour such differences are of most frequent occurrence. A change of fashion at home, or a municipal regulation abroad, the discovery or failure of a mine, the wealth or poverty of a customer, all bear directly upon it, independently of the more important fluctuations arising from the hostile or peaceful relation of neighbouring countries. Therefore labour of this sort, though far more productive in its flourishing seasons, is far more precarious in its eventual success than any other.\n\nThe remedy against the inconveniences arising from these causes is to be found in that moral foresight which belongs to intelligent beings, and distinguishes, or ought to distinguish, the civilized and social man from the thoughtless <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a>. If it is the nature of manufacturing labour to be barren at one season, and productive at another, the superabundance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARVEST\">harvest</a> must provide against the time of scarcity. But notwithstanding all that must be clearly known, and bitterly experienced on this account, there is among the manufacturing bodies in our large towns a most profligate disregard of any moment beyond the present. The system of the savage is seen in the midst of a crowded population. For a time, on the sudden acquisition of plenty, there is the same waste, the same idleness, the same debauchery, which is quickly succeeded by a similar want, a similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> for extraordinary exertion. When the wages of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANUFACTURER\">manufacturer</a> experience a sudden rise, his weekly expenses rise in the same proportion. Perhaps he works but half the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>, and spends the rest in low and profligate excess. Perhaps he squanders his superfluous wages in a manner the most absurd, and the most unsuitable to his station in life. But at all events, when the year ends, he is in no sense better than he was at the beginning; his advantages have been altogether thrown away; he is not richer, and in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MORAL_SENSE\">moral sense</a> he is poorer, because his dissolute habits are more confirmed. It appeared in evidence before the House of Commons, that the ribbon weavers at Coventry, who were at that moment requiring parish relief, had six months before been in the receipt of two or three guineas a week, which they had expended in the most sumptuous manner upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POULTRY\">poultry</a> and other luxuries; in selecting which they were so fastidious, that the usual market of the place was not good enough for them, and supplies were regularly sent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> from London.\n\nThe agricultural labourer has fewer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> opportunities than the manufacturer; still most of them, with frugal habits, might <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> L. 5 per annum, whilst\n\n*Report on the Poor-Rate Returns, ordered to be printed 10th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> 1821.\n\u2020The particular sums expended in law and removals are not specified in the returns after 1815, and therefore cannot be subtracted from the total amount. They amounted in 1813, 1814, 1815, to about L. 330,000 per annum.\nthey are unmarried; whereas not one in fifty, perhaps, is master of that sum at any period of his life. Whenever their wages go beyond their actual necessities, the surplus is carried to the alehouse. If an accident, or an illness, or a failure in the demand for labour, keeps the man from work a fortnight, the parish is called upon to supply the deficiency. That he should have even a week's provision beforehand is entirely out of the question. It would be thought a most unreasonable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a>. Though perhaps he is a single man, and has no family demands; or a man in the flower of his age, who may have earned large wages at task-work for years; or an elderly man whose children are all off his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>. In short, whatever may have been his situation or opportunities, he has always lived, to use a common, but expressive phrase, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> to mouth.\n\nNow it is impossible to believe that the known and regular provision of the poor-laws is not at the bottom of this unprincipled extravagance, which has now become inveterate throughout the country. We cannot but suppose that in a land where so much intelligence, so strong a moral sense, so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> a spirit of industry exists, men who knew that they were liable to accidents and reverses, if they also knew that they had only themselves to depend upon, would employ some part of their present earnings to provide against future contingencies. It may be said that to men who work hard, and are necessarily much collected together, the temptation to low dissipation and extravagance is irresistible. But these temptations are not stronger to one part of the community than the other; and in servants, petty tradesmen, and small farmers, considered as a body, there is much of that forethought and frugality which is the best foundation of individual and national welfare. Many of these, during the unparalleled vicissitudes of the last 25 years, have had more to struggle with than the labourers; yet they have not, in the same regular manner, fallen upon the parish funds, because to these classes such a resource is still considered a reproachful degradation. We argue, that similar frugality would have characterised our labourers also, if their natural disposition to sensuality had not been favoured, rather than restrained, by the assurance of a systematic provision, when vice and imprudence should bring on their necessary results, and terminate in penury.\n\nAnother injurious effect of the poor-laws is the bad and discontented temper which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> of the real causes of poverty. Almost every thing which has hitherto been done for the poor has tended, as if with care and intention, to throw a veil of obscurity over this subject, and to hide from them the real origin of their difficulties. In all cases, the last man whom any one, labouring under misfortune, is inclined to accuse, is himself. But the poor-system tends to maintain the opinion, that he is the last person who ought to be accused. The workman who can find no employment; the labourer who feels his large and increasing family a burthen which he can ill support; the aged and decrepit, whose pittance barely furnishes them with the necessaries of life; each lay the fault of their particular distress upon the parish, or upon the overseer, or upon the magistrate; but never blame their own imprudence in neglecting a provision, or their extravagance in throwing one away. And when relieved, to the full extent that legal charity can relieve them, they never acknowledge any sense of obligation, unless they should be brought to a better mind by feelings which the poor-laws are rather calculated to extinguish than to awaken.\n\nWe can hardly be wrong in setting these errors to the account of the system itself. \"On these occasions,\" as Mr Malthus justly observes, \"the only way I have of judging, is to put myself in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> in the place of the poor man, and consider how I should feel in his situation.\" If I were told that the rich, by the laws of nature and the laws of the land, were bound to support me, I could not, in the first place, feel much obligation for such support; and, in the next place, if I were given any food of an inferior kind, and could not see the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> necessity of the change, which would probably be the case, I should think that I had good reason to complain. I should feel that the laws had been violated to my injury, and that I had been unjustly deprived of my right. Under these circumstances, though I might be deterred by the fear of an armed force from committing any overt acts of resistance, yet I should consider myself as perfectly justified in so doing if this fear were removed; and the injury which I believed that I had suffered, might produce the most unfavourable effects on my general dispositions towards the higher classes of society. I cannot, indeed, conceive anything more irritating to the human feelings, than to experience that degree of distress which, in spite of all our poor-laws and benevolence, is not unfrequently felt in this country; and yet to believe that these sufferings were not brought upon me, either by my own fault, or by the operation of those general laws which, like the tempest, the blight, or the pestilence, are continually falling hard upon particular individuals, while others entirely escape; but were occasioned solely by the avarice and injustice of the higher classes of society.\n\n\"On the contrary, if I firmly believed that, by the laws of nature, which are the laws of God, I had no claim of right to support, I should, in the first place, feel myself more strongly bound to a life of industry and frugality; but if want, notwithstanding, came upon me, I should consider it in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> of a sickness; as an evil incidental to my present state of being, and which, if I could not avoid, it was my duty to bear with fortitude and resignation. What I received would have the best effect on my feelings towards the higher classes. Even if it were much inferior to what I had been accustomed to, it would still, instead of an injury, be an obligation; and conscious that I had no claim of right, nothing but the dread of absolute famine, which might overcome all other considerations, could palliate the guilt of resistance.\n\n\"I cannot help believing, that, if the poor in this country were convinced that they had no claim of right to support, and yet in scarcities, and all cases of urgent distress, were liberally relieved, which I think they would be, the bonds which unite the rich with the poor would be drawn much closer than at\npoor-laws present; and the lower classes of society, as they would have less real reason for irritation and discontent, would be much less subject to such uneasy sensations.\"\n\n3. To this habitual discontent is to be added the selfishness and mercenary spirit arising from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> to parochial assistance in every emergency. Instead of that sympathy and active charity which would be shown, we fully believe, in this country at least as much as any other, if the poor were not brought up to expect that relief must be awarded to all in whatever shape it is required, a certain price, an adequate repayment, is demanded, for every trifling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>. If an aged parent is lodged under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a> of a child, the parish must give a remuneration. If an orphan is to be provided for, the first question of the relation is, what will the parish allow? If age or occasional illness require some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> attendance, a demand is regularly made for trouble and loss of time. Dr Chalmers speaks the result of experience both south and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> of the Tweed, when he laments it as \"a heavy encumbrance on the work of a clergyman, that, in addition to the primary and essential evils of the human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>, he has to struggle, in his holy warfare, against a system so replete, as pauperism is, with all that can minister to the worst, or that can wither up the best, affections of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>.\" (Christian and Civic Economy, No. 10.)\n\nThe effect upon the giver is certainly no better than that upon the receiver of these legal alms; and thus the most valuable part of real charity is thrown away. The immense sums distributed to the poor in this country by the parochial laws are improperly called charity. They want its most distinguishing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a>; and as might be expected from an attempt to force that which loses its essence the moment it ceases to be voluntary, their effects upon those from whom they are collected are as prejudicial as on those to whom they are distributed. On the side of the receivers of this miscalled charity, instead of real relief, we find accumulated distress and more extended poverty; on the side of the givers, instead of pleasurable emotions, unceasing discontent and irritation. How can it be otherwise? The rich, who are little affected by the amount of the rate, pay it as a tax, and either view it in no other light, or apply it as a quietus to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a>, as if having furnished their legal assessment, they had fulfilled their duty in the way of charity. The middling classes, upon whom the burthen presses most severely,\u2014as the little annuitants, small tradesmen, and inferior farmers,\u2014not only pay it as a tax, but feel it as a tax, and consider that they have the usual privilege of murmuring at its amount. Indeed, the Poor-Laws injustice of the system, as it sometimes falls upon payers of this nature, is so glaring, that nothing but the uselessness of remonstrance could prevent its being loudly heard. Those who are constantly supported, on parish pay are better off than a large number of those who contribute; they are certain of receiving, as long as there is any capital stock on which a distress can be levied; but the power of paying in the others depends upon their customers, and upon many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINGENT\">contingent</a> circumstances. The pauper also is secure in the possession of his effects, those of the contributor are daily liable to be seized.* The pauper, too, can afford to live better, and to spend more on his family or himself throughout the year, than the petty tradesman, or annuitant, or renter of a little land, or many others in that humble but useful class <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> above the common labourer. These are the persons on whom a scarcity falls heavy; these are the persons who must diminish their consumption; these are the persons who feel the revolutions of trade, and the pressure of taxes; their families must consume bread for potatoes, while their pauper neighbours are living in comparative plenty. Under such circumstances, it is scarcely possible for man not to complain; or to acknowledge the truth of the Christian maxim, \"It is more blessed to give than to receive.\"\n\n4. There are other immoral consequences of the poor-laws which are too obvious to need particular illustration. Husbands are encouraged to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a> their wives, and fly from the burthen of their families, knowing that they will not be unprovided for. Women are encouraged to admit illicit intercourse, from a confidence that if it should prove fruitful, a marriage will be probably forced from the ordinary operation of the laws; a calculation which begins in vice, and can only end in premature and ill-sorted marriages. Indeed, their general effect on character admits of indisputable proof, independently of all argument or theory. It is notorious that the most steady, industrious, and moral workmen, on whom the employer can place his surest reliance, are those who do not legally belong to the parish in which they are living. It would be impossible to desire a more convincing evidence of the pernicious tendency of the present laws. We shall therefore conclude this branch of the subject, by noticing a collateral evil of the system, also tending to demoralize the people. It collects an undue proportion of the population into towns. The population of cities and towns, instead of comprising, as had been calculated during a considerable part of the last, and the whole of the preceding century, about one-third of the na-\n\n---\n\n* \"You do not compel the poor man to sell his furniture before you relieve him?\u2014No\u2014certainly not. But if a man has to contribute to the relief of the poor, and from loss of trade, or from the pressure of children, he is not able to pay his rates, you sell his furniture and effects!\u2014I have been compelled to sign a warrant of distress. Then, is not the pauper that is relieved in a much better condition than the pauper who contributes?\u2014He is so far in a better condition, that what he possesses is more secure to him.\" Lords' Report, p. 25.\n\nBy a statute (34th Geo. III. c. 170, s. 11), such persons may now be, by magistrates, legally exonerated from charges.\ntion, now approaches to nearly one-half. From 1801 to 1811, the increase of houses in the towns of Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> average 12 per cent., and the inhabitants 15 per cent. In the country, the increase of houses somewhat exceeds 11 per cent., and the inhabitants 13 per cent.\n\nMr Colquhoun observes, that to whatever cause it may be attributed, there has been a considerable tendency to diminish the rural population, and to increase that of the towns in general.* But the cause is very evident to any one who has watched the operation of the poor-laws. Cottages entail upon the land so heavy a burthen, that no proprietor will suffer one to be erected upon his estate which is not absolutely necessary. He can obtain no rent which can indemnify him for the probable charges of an additional family, which will possess a perpetual claim for support upon his land. But in towns, where the property in land is much subdivided, the immediate advantage of letting small houses at a considerable profit, far overbalances the distant evil arising to the individual from the increase of the rates, to which all the inhabitants of the town will be forced to contribute their share. The consequence is, that there only are houses built, and thither the overflow of the country parishes resort, and going out into the neighbourhood for daily employ, spend their leisure hours in the town, and lose the simple habits as well as the simple recreations of the village.\n\nHaving now explained the poor-system, as it exists at present in England, and shown its injurious effects, both upon the moral and political health of the community, it only remains to advert to the several plans which have been hitherto proposed for its melioration or abolition. And of these, leaving the compulsory contribution to friendly or other provident <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a>; the assessment of all other property to the rates, as well as that upon which they have been heretofore raised; and the allotment of cottages, with a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of land to the labourers who might have the most numerous families;\u2014as either inadequate, inexpedient, or impracticable remedies\u2014we shall confine ourselves to the two which best deserve the attention of the Legislature, and have obtained the most of it. These are, first, the establishment of a maximum, beyond which the annual amount of the rates in each parish shall not be increased; and next, the gradual abrogation of the law of Elizabeth, on which the whole system has been erected.\n\nThe plan of fixing a maximum has been often recommended, under the alarm arising from the progressive increase of the annual rates. It is proposed to take the average of a certain number of years past, and fix that as the sum which no future assessment should exceed; so that, if the rates of any given parish had amounted, on an average of the largest and smallest sums during the last ten years, to L. 500, L. 500 should be considered as the utmost limit of charitable relief to which the claimants on that parish were legally entitled. A plan of this nature was brought forward in Parliament in the year 1821; but clogged with so many objectionable alterations in the law of settlement, that it met with less attention than the respectability of the mover would otherwise have secured it. There are, however, radical objections to the plan itself. \"Under such a law, if the distresses of the poor were to be aggravated tenfold, either by the increase of numbers or the recurrence of a scarcity, the same sum would invariably be appropriated to their relief. If, in the meantime, the statute which gives the poor a right to support, were to remain unexpunged, we shall add to the cruelty of starving them, the injustice of still professing to relieve them. If this statute were expunged or altered, we should virtually deny the right of the poor to support, and only retain the absurdity of saying that they had a right to a certain sum.\" (Malthus, III. p. 353.)\n\nIn order to obviate this evident objection to the measure, a provision was introduced into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BILL\">bill</a> allowing additions to be made to the fixed maximum, by an extraordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a> of the inhabitants and neighbouring magistrates, in very peculiar cases of local pressure or general scarcity. It is plain, however, that this is a virtual abandonment of the principle of the measure; and by necessary consequence, of the measure itself. The right of the people to certain support being recognized, no legislative fiat can limit the extent of that right. No inhabitant could resist the demands of the people; no magistrate could be expected to maintain the maximum, in any season of difficulty, when alone it would be of much practical value. If a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAM\">dam</a>, which is raised to keep out the encroachments of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, is to be opened whenever the water presses forcibly against it, the surrounding country has little reason to trust to its effect, when threatened with an inundation.\n\nThis objection equally applies to an amend. Plan of a ment which has been since proposed, to render the gradually maximum a gradually decreasing maximum, by Maximum subtracting from its amount 10s. or 20s. per cent. annually, till the whole was extinct. But to any one acquainted with the manner in which the affairs of a parish are and must be conducted, taking the country at large, such impossibilities must occur in the execution of a law of this nature, as render it quite undeserving attention as a national measure. The business of overseer, for the first half of the year, would go on smoothly enough. By that time, three-fourths of the legal assessment would probably be spent. Then all, whatever might be their wants, must be put on short allowance, and future claimants excluded. But each of such claimants would justly consider that he had as good a right to be supported in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> of need, as those who happened to be visited with misfortune a few months before; and those whose mischance it was to be in distress when the fixed sum was collected and expended, would be particularly ill used on being refused assistance, while so many others around them had enjoyed this advantage. If such a measure were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a>-\n\n* Colquhoun on the Population and Resources of the British Empire, p. 27.\nBesides, there is nothing in any measure of this kind, which tends to stem the progress of pauperism; nothing to prevent the numbers from annually increasing, which require public assistance. All the channels by which the main stream is supplied, as described in the beginning of this article, remain the same; why, then, should we expect that the stream itself should grow narrower, or cease to overflow its bounds? If, then, the sum collected were to be divided among all who might be in want, however their number might increase, great misery must ensue; and all the blame of it would be laid, not without much apparent justice, to the charge of the society, which undertook the support of the poor, yet supplied them so sparingly, that they must necessarily die of hunger and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>.\n\n2. The only measure which can be considered as either politically wise, or practically efficient, is one which shall gradually annihilate the system by attacking directly its vital principle, and striking at the root of the disease. To this end Mr Malthus proposes that a regulation should be made, declaring that no child born from any marriage taking place after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-EXPIRATION\">expiration</a> of a year from the date of the law, and no illegitimate child born two years from the same date, shall ever be entitled to parish assistance. And, to give a more general knowledge of this law, and to enforce it more strongly on the minds of the lower classes of people, the clergyman of each parish should, after the publication of banns, read a short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a>, stating the strong obligation on every man to support his own children; the impropriety, and even immorality, of marrying without a prospect of being able to do this; the evils which had resulted to the poor themselves from the attempt which had been made to assist by public institutions in a duty which ought to be exclusively appropriated to parents, and the absolute necessity which had at length appeared of abandoning all such institutions, on account of their producing effects totally opposite to those which were intended. \"This would operate as a fair, distinct, and precise notice, which no man could well mistake; and, without pressing hard upon any particular individuals, would at once throw off the rising <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a> from that miserable and helpless dependence upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> and the rich, the moral as well as physical consequences of which are almost incalculable.\"\n\nSome measure of this kind is not only expedient, but indispensable, if the Committee of the House of Commons are justified in solemnly stating it as their opinion, That unless some efficacious check be interposed, there is every reason to think that the amount of the assessment will continue as it has done to increase, till, at a period more or less remote, it shall have absorbed the profits of the property on which the rate has been assessed, producing thereby the neglect and ruin of the land.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> practical objection which has been urged against such an enactment is, that it would create two distinct classes, which would exist together in the country for a considerable period of time,\u2014the one class having, and the other not having, a claim to public support; and that this would occasion confusion, discontent, and ultimately turbulence, by which the nation would be kept in continual disorder.\n\nWe are of a different mind: and that not only on general grounds, but for reasons of experience. No new measure, in truth, can reduce the lower classes to a more unequal state than the existing system. Every parish has its own rule, founded partly on the ability of the payers, and partly on the character of the overseers. Every district has its own scheme of administration, dependent on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-DISCRETION\">discretion</a> or indiscretion, foresight or carelessness, of the local magistrates. A few parishes, a few bright spots appear, which careful management has preserved from the infection of the surrounding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAGUE\">plague</a>; and those parishes are in all respects the best satisfied, because the most comfortable. An account of one of these appears in the evidence before the House, in which the custom of employing labourers by taskwork has enabled them to support their families without application to the magistrate; and yet it comes out incidentally that this parish is so great a favourite, that false <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OATHS\">oaths</a> and other fraudulent means are frequently taken to get into it.\n\nAlready, too, there exist in every parish those who have, and those who have not, a claim to support, according as it may happen that they do or do not legally belong to it. What keeps the residents who are non-parishioners from turbulence, or even from complaint? The known law. We argue, that the known law would have the same effect upon those who are born without claim upon any parish. Indeed, the whole country abounds with inequalities of condition among those whose claims are similar; of whom some are, and some are not, effectually relieved by the law on which their claims are founded. Nothing, for instance, can be more different than the degree of assistance awarded to the manufacturing and the rural labourer. In country parishes, the poor do really receive some compensation for their low wages; their children, beyond a certain number, are really supported by the parish; and though it must be a most grating reflection to a labouring man, that he can hardly marry without becoming the father of paupers; yet if he can reconcile himself to this prospect, the compensation, such as it is, is no doubt made to him. But in London, and all the great towns of the kingdom, the evil is suffered without the compensation. The population raised by bounties in the country, naturally and necessarily flows into the town, and as naturally and necessarily tends to lower wages in them; while, in point of fact, those who marry in towns, and have large families, receive no assistance from their parishes, unless they are actually starving: and altogether the assistance which the manufacturing classes obtain for the support of their families, in return for their lowered wages, is perfectly inconsiderable. Whereas the nominal rate of wages is of no more consequence to the labourer who is married and has a family throughout the South of England, than its rate in Hindostan. (See Malthus, II. p. 369.)\n\nIt is plain, therefore, that the poor of this country have been used to unequal and very different treatment, and that with much greater appearance of in-\njustice than any difference which was founded upon an established law. To say nothing of the advantage which the impudent and daring have long possessed over the humble and unobtrusive character; which imposture has had over honesty, and shameless beggary over honest independence; the circumstance that men who were born in the same class, and labour in the same vocation, and are burdened with the same family, are liable to suffer, and do actually suffer, the widest variations according to the district in which they may happen to reside;\u2014according as the magistrates of that district agree to act; according to the scale of relief they may have adopted; according to the strictness of the inquiry which they are in the habit of making, before they issue an order for relief; in short, according to the views they may take of their own duty and of public expediency.\n\nSo that we should have no fear of discontent, in any material degree, from the operation of an enactment like that proposed. More especially, as the majority of those whom it concerned finding themselves, according to the natural order of things, so much the more prosperous in consequence of their depending on their own exertions, would be free from the principal temptation to murmur and complain.\n\nIt ought to be remembered, farther, that the system now in operation is by no means exempt from the danger of discontented turbulence. Every one is brought up with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> that the state is bound to provide him with employment and support. When, therefore, the employment assigned him is such as he does not approve, and the recompense awarded him falls below his expectations (and when the employment is a loss to the public, the recompense must often be below even reasonable expectations), he becomes an irritated and uneasy subject; and unless he is restrained by the fear of detection, or by the better influence of moral principles, he vents his spleen by any mischief that is in his power; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> of stock-yards, or the destruction of machinery, results from an unsatisfactory interview with the overseer, or an ineffectual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENCH\">bench</a> of magistrates. Proofs of this have been already too visible; and vestry meetings, in some counties, have assumed a very seditious appearance: quite enough to prove the evil of accustoming the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of the population to depend upon anything except the natural demand for their labour.\n\nShould it, however, be considered that more caution and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> is necessary to pave the way for a total <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> in a system of laws which are unhappily interwoven with the habits of the people; it would be an important step, to begin by repealing that part of the statute of Elizabeth, which empowers the overseers to set the poor to work; that is, in effect, which empowers the labourer to demand work, or money as its substitute. This would confine relief to the impotent and aged, and would take away that part of the law which is most confessedly adverse to all sound principles of policy, and is least capable of any rational defence. There is a satisfaction, no doubt, attendant upon the knowledge, that every individual in the country, if reduced to helpless indigence, has a \"local habitation\" and a home; that the aged, and the infirm, and the orphan, have a sure provision. And though man may, no doubt, become improvident, and parents may sometimes be induced to abandon their children, from a conviction, that they will not be allowed to starve, yet if relief had never been extended beyond these objects, the evil would not have become practically burdensome as it is now experienced to be.\n\nIf then it should be determined, for the present at least, to retain this part of the system, let a wiser course be commenced, by laying aside the attempt to \"set the poor on work;\" and let it be declared that from such a time, no able-bodied man shall have any claim to employment or relief from the parish for himself or his family. Such a measure has the advantage of being strongly recommended by the Report of the Committee, to which we have so often alluded. Indeed, a decided opinion is there given, that, even as the law now stands, \"an order for relief is invalid, which does not adjudge the party to be 'impotent,' as well as 'poor.'\" And a mode is suggested in which this alteration of the prevailing system might be effected humanely and gradually. It is submitted to the consideration of the House, whether, when the demand for labour may have revived, it may not be safely provided, that from and after a certain time, no relief shall be extended to any child whose father, being living, is under years of age; a principle which, by altering the age from time to time, might, if it should be thought desirable, be carried still further into operation. It may also be provided, with a similar view, that from and after a specific time, no relief shall be provided for any child whose father, being living, has not above children, under years of age. The Report proceeds to suggest that it may be hereafter enacted, that no person should be provided with work by the parish other than those who are already so provided, and who might be permitted to continue till they could provide for themselves; but if the change made by this provision might be thought too rapid, limitations might still be introduced, the effect of which would render it more gradual: as, by enacting that none shall be provided with employment who are between the ages of 18 and 30, and then, after a certain\n\n---\n\nThis feeling has induced the author of the Letter to Mr Peel, who well deserves attention, to make the following reflection:\u2014\"Let me thus dismiss the present branch of the argument, with the hope that indigence, arising either from infirmity, age, infancy, great number of children, and even accidental failure of employment, may possibly be relieved by law\u2014not fully and adequately to our feelings\u2014yet permanently and systematically, without necessarily extending the evil.\"\n\nSuch a concession, from one so well aware of the moral evils of the poor-laws, shows the embarrassments with which the subject is involved.\nWe entertain no sort of doubt that a law of this kind would, in a very short time, benefit the labourers themselves. What, indeed, can be more depressing or injurious to them, than the system which is common in some districts, according to which labourers, under the denomination of roundsmen, are sent from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARM\">farm</a> to farm, and paid at the lowest possible rate, and that rate not depending upon their skill or industry, but upon the largeness of their families? and not by the person for whom they labour, but, in a great part, out of the parish funds? Both the Committees reprobate this practice in pointed terms, but the Lords do not seem to have observed that it grows naturally out of the system of our poor-laws; and if that \"system is essentially maintained,\" every labourer in the kingdom must in the end be treated as a roundsman. The poor-laws encourage the increase of the number of workmen beyond the demand for their labour: the poor-laws then oblige the parish to employ these supernumeraries at its own expense. But none of the employers of labour are in want of these hands, otherwise they would not be left to seek for work: still they must be supported: what alternative is there, except either to maintain them in idleness, or to parcel them out in the district which contributes to the rate? Certainly it is a plan which reduces the free labourer to the condition of a slave; but let the blame <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> where it is due, upon the law itself; or let it be shown how some such scheme can be avoided, unless the men are to be unemployed altogether.\n\nIn conjunction with some enactment denying the claim of the able-bodied labourer to legal relief in any shape, and so tending to undermine the whole system\u2014a limitation of the assessment to be annually raised might be useful, because it would be a sort of acknowledgment of the indisputable truth, that the Legislature had hitherto taken more upon itself than it was able to accomplish, and that the funds for the relief of the distressed, as well as for the employment of labour, really are limited, though the practice of the country supposes them inexhaustible; and that, in point of fact, they have already reached the bounds beyond which it is either not possible or not safe to proceed. This would gradually open the eyes of the poor to a truth which cannot be long concealed, and induce them to depend upon themselves. It would also furnish an argument to those who attempt to restore, or rather to create, in the poor a feeling of reliance on their own industry. As matters stand at present, all recommendations of Saving Banks, all enforcements of the necessity of foresight, are cut short by reference to the parish. You may be out of work; the parish must find it for me. You may be overburdened with a young family; the parish must allow accordingly. You may grow infirm or old; I can but come to the parish. But if a positive limit were set to the parochial assessment, what is theoretically absurd, might be practically useful; because there would be opportunity of rejoinder to these conclusive reasonings, from the inadequacy of the parish allowances; and a whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAL\">meal</a> from former savings might appear better than the half loaf which public charity would procure. But, in the mean time, the encouragement of frugal habits is proved to be a visionary hope among the lower classes of the community; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECLARATION\">declaration</a> of the Lords' Committee, however undeniable, will remain a dead letter as to practical effect: \"Parochial relief, under the best and most considerate administration of it, can never be so satisfactory to the person who is the object of it, or so consistent with those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> feelings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a> and independence which are implanted in the heart of man, as that resource which is the result of his own industry and the produce of his own exertions.\" This is unintelligible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, to those at least who have been born in the south of England within the last forty years. Parish relief, instead of being dreaded as a disgrace, or looked to as a last resource, is, in truth, the first consideration. To become domiciliated in a good parish is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> object, and leads to numberless cheats and perjuries; the next concern is to obtain as much as possible from it; which the single men effect by threatening to bring a wife and family upon the parish funds, if they are not relieved to their satisfaction; and the married men by actually doing so. A system which encourages these feelings and habits has been called a humane, a wise, an economical system; and justly, if it is humanity to support profligacy at the expense of the industrious; if it is wise to diffuse habits of improvidence, vice, and dishonesty throughout the land; if it is economical to sink capital in order to furnish income to the extravagant.\n\nThe most plausible objection to this plan of commencing an improvement in the principle of the poor-laws, by confining relief to the impotent poor, arises from the variations in the price of corn; a recurrence of which it seems right to anticipate in the present state of our agriculture and population. There have been many years since 1795 in which the market rate of wages would not generally support a family: neither is it in the nature of things that the wages of labour should rise with the price of corn, when that increase of price is occasioned by a deficiency in the supply. To raise them arbitrarily, as some persons have ventured to recommend, would only be to relieve one evil in the body politic by the introduction of another; and, though no remedy could easily be worse than the present disease, it is wiser, at all events, to \"bear the ills we have, than fly to others which we know not of.\"\n\nIn reply, however, to this objection, it may be remarked, that the natural price of labour will be more nearly approached by the market price, in proportion as parochial payments are done away; and the employer will still be a gainer, because his assessment will be diminished in the same proportion: while population and production, keeping more even pace together, when relieved from the disturbing influences which prevail at present, the prices of corn will be subject to less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a>. In the case, however, of any unusual disparity between the price of labour and the price of provisions, such as occurred in the years 1795 and 1800, or of any temporary or local pressure, from a difficulty in procuring employment, such as must always be expected.\nin some districts of a great manufacturing county, and which was almost universal in the years immediately succeeding the peace;\u2014the principal inhabitants ought to agree together on the most practicable mode of assisting the largest families, and enabling their poorer neighbours to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> the exigencies of the season. The political objections which exist against indiscriminate relief do not affect extraordinary cases. That which would be most pernicious as daily diet, when applied as medicine, restores health to the constitution. Neither are we so forgetful of the duties enjoined upon us as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> as to exclude charity from our domestic economy: our object is not to annihilate charity, but to render it profitable both to the giver and receiver. This is truly the case when our assistance, of whatever sort, is bestowed upon a known object, and for a definite purpose, instead of being thrown into a common fund, for which all scramble, and from which those who scramble most shamelessly get the largest share. The known claim to parochial aid, and the actual pressure of the funds which it demands, are an impediment, in the present state of the law, to private benevolence; together with a general conviction, that what is called, though falsely called, the charity of the country, has increased the distress which it professes to relieve.\n\nAnd to say the truth, when we consider the degree of labour, and attention, and intelligence employed upon the concerns of the poor in late years, we may justly affirm, that, if it had been possible for things to go on well upon a wrong system, and to succeed on an erroneous principle, they must have succeeded, and the condition of the poor in England must have been most prosperous; and that it has not been so, with all these advantages, is in itself a sufficient evidence that the principle is radically unsound.\n\nIt will be observed, that our remarks in the preceding article apply principally to England, as the native country of the poor-laws, and to those few districts of Scotland where the practice has been assimilated to that of England. An <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> of the laws which relate to the assistance and management of the poor in Scotland will be found in the Encyclopaedia. We must add, however, that, since that publication, a very important case has been determined by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">Court</a> of Session, which turned upon this question; viz. Whether, under the Scotch poor-laws, those persons are entitled to relief who, without any personal infirmity, are rendered unable, by the high price of provisions, to maintain themselves in time of dearth? And whether an assessment for the relief of such persons was legal? The Court decreed, on the 17th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1804, that such relief and assessment were legal under the statutes; and the arguments used to obtain a contrary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECREE\">decree</a> were, not that the statutes were not in force, but that they did not strictly include this particular case. It came from the parish of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUNSE\">Dunse</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol4.html#article-BERWICKSHIRE\">Berwickshire</a>.\n\nThe Court of Session has also repeatedly decided that \"a pauper has a title to the charity of any parish in which he has resided three years, supporting himself during that period by his own industry.\"\n\nIn consequence, many parishes have had recourse to legal assessments. \"In small country parishes, or in parishes where there are no considerable towns or villages, the assessments are levied according to the valued rent of the lands, the one-half being paid by the heritors, and the other half by the tenants. But in large parishes, the assessments are made according to the real annual rents of lands and houses, a fourth part being deducted to the proprietors of houses for reparations; the half of the assessment is paid by the proprietors or landlords, and the other half by the tenants or possessors. The assessments are made annually by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> meeting of the heritors and kirk-session of the parish, held, by act of Parliament, on first Tuesday of August or first Tuesday of July, who appoint a collector, who makes a new rental each year of lands and houses.\"\n\nThe parishes in which such assessments have been enforced present a striking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTRAST\">contrast</a> to those which are managed upon the more primitive and economical system. The demands upon the legal funds have increased at least tenfold, and thus furnish a remarkable confirmation of the arguments by which the English poor-laws are impugned; against the further admission of which into this comparatively prudent and well regulated country, all its wisest and most benevolent members are lifting up their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> of warning and exhortation.\n\nDr Chalmers, in particular, in addition to all his other important obligations, has recently conferred a new benefit upon the public, by practically showing that even the unpromising population of Glasgow may be satisfactorily provided for through the old channel of voluntary contributions, without recourse to compulsory funds. We would gladly refer any readers of the foregoing article who may entertain a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> against its tendency, to the Speech delivered by that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> before the General Assembly of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">Church</a> of Scotland in May 1822, and especially to the practical details related in the Appendix to it.\n\n---\n\n* In this way of occasional contribution, great local distress in Ireland has been effectually relieved during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> of 1832. But what miserable politicians would those prove, who, on account of a temporary evil in a country so every way anomalous as Ireland, would venture to introduce, and apply to the Irish character, a permanent system of parochial legislation?\n\n\u2020 See Notes on the Scotch Poor-Laws, by the Reverend Sir Henry Moncreiff Wellwood, and the late Mr Horner, appended to Mr Whitbread's Speech on the Poor-Laws, 1807.\n\n\u2021 Report of the Committee of the General Assembly, 1817, appended to the Report of the House of Commons.\nThe population of the principal states, of which an account has been given in the course of this work, will be found under their proper heads. The object of this article is to explain the general laws which regulate the increase or decrease of population, and the manner in which they affect the state and condition of human society.\n\nIn taking a view of animated nature, we cannot fail to be struck with a prodigious power of increase in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> and animals. Their capacity in this respect is, indeed, almost infinitely various, according with the endless variety of the works of nature, and the different purposes which they seem appointed to fulfil. But whether they increase slowly or rapidly, if they increase by seed or generation, their natural tendency must be to increase in a geometrical ratio, that is, by multiplication; and at whatever rate they are increasing during any one period, if no further obstacles be opposed to them, they must proceed in a geometrical progression.\n\nIn the growth of wheat, a vast quantity of seed is unavoidably lost. When it is dabbled instead of being sown in the common way, two pecks of seed wheat will yield as large a crop as two bushels, and thus quadruple the proportion of the return to the quantity of seed put into the ground. In the Philosophical Transactions for 1768, an account is given of an experiment in which, by separating the roots obtained from a single grain of wheat, and transplanting them in a favourable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, a return was obtained of above 500,000 grains. But, without referring to peculiar instances, or peculiar modes of cultivation, it is known that calculations have often been made, founded on positive experience of the produce of wheat in different soils and countries, cultivated in an ordinary way, and making allowance for all ordinary destruction of seed.\n\nHumboldt has collected some estimates of this kind, from which it appears that France, the north of Germany, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLAND\">Poland</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a>, taken generally, produce from five to six grains for one; some fertile lands in France produce fifteen for one; and the good lands in Picardy and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLE\">Isle</a> of France from eight to ten grains for one. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUNGARY\">Hungary</a>, Croatia, and Sclavonia, yield from eight to ten grains for one. In the Regno de la Plata, twelve grains for one are produced: near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Buenos Ayres, sixteen for one: in the northern part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEXICO\">Mexico</a> seventeen; and in the equinoctial regions of Mexico twenty-four for one. (Nouvelle Espagne, L. IV. C. ix. p. 98.)\n\nNow, supposing that in any one country during a certain period, and under the ordinary cultivation, the return of wheat was six grains for one, it would be strictly correct to say, that wheat had the capacity of increasing in a geometrical ratio, of such a nature as to sextuple itself every year. And it might safely be calculated hypothetically, that if, setting out from the produce of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACRE\">acre</a>, land of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> could be prepared with sufficient rapidity, and no wheat were consumed, the rate of increase would be such as completely to cover the whole earthly surface of our globe in fourteen years.\n\nIn the same manner, if it be found by experience that on land of a certain quality, and making allowance for the ordinary mortality and accidents, sheep will increase on an average, so as to double their numbers every two years, it would be strictly correct to say, that sheep have the natural capacity of increasing in a geometrical progression, of which the common multiple is two, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> two years; and it might safely be said, that if land of the same quality could be provided with sufficient rapidity, and no sheep were consumed, the rate of increase would be such, that if we were to begin with the full number which could be supported on an acre of land, the whole earthly part of the globe might be completely covered with sheep in less than 76 years.\n\nIf out of this prodigious increase of food, the full support of mankind were deducted, supposing them to increase as fast as they have ever yet increased in any country, the deduction would be comparatively inconsiderable; and the rate of increase would still be enormous, till it was checked, either by the natural want of will on the part of mankind to make efforts for the increase of food, beyond what they could possibly consume, or after a certain period, by their absolute want of power to prepare land of the same quality, so as to allow of the same rate of progress.\n\nOwing to these two causes combined, we see that, notwithstanding this prodigious power of increase in vegetables and animals, their actual increase is extremely slow; and it is obvious, that, owing to the latter cause alone, and long before a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> stop was put to all further progress, their actual rate of increase must of necessity be very greatly retarded; as it would be impossible for the most enlightened human efforts to make all the soil of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> equal in fertility to the average quality of land now in use; while the practicable approaches towards it would require so much time as to occasion, at a very early period, a constant and great check upon what their increase would be, if they could exert their natural powers.\n\nElevated as man is above all other animals by his intellectual faculties, it is not to be supposed that\nthe physical laws to which he is subjected should be essentially different from those which are observed to prevail in other parts of animated nature. He may increase slower than most other animals; but food is equally necessary to his support; and if his natural capacity of increase be greater than can be permanently supplied with food from a limited territory, his increase must be constantly retarded by the difficulty of procuring the means of subsistence.\n\nThe main peculiarity which distinguishes man from other animals, in the means of his support, is the power which he possesses of very greatly increasing these means. But this power is obviously limited by the scarcity of land, by the great natural barrenness of a very large part of the surface of the earth, and by the decreasing proportion of produce which must necessarily be obtained from the continual additions of labour and capital applied to land already in cultivation.\n\nIt is, however, specifically with this diminishing and limited power of increasing the produce of the soil, that we must compare the natural power of mankind to increase, in order to ascertain whether, in the progress to the full cultivation and peopling of the globe, the natural power of mankind to increase must not, of absolute necessity, be constantly retarded by the difficulty of procuring the means of subsistence, and if so, what are likely to be the effects of such a state of things.\n\nIn an endeavour to determine the natural power of mankind to increase, as well as their power of increasing the produce of the soil, we can have no other guide than past experience.\n\nThe great check to the increase of plants and animals, we know from experience, is the want of room and nourishment; and this experience would direct us to look for the greatest actual increase of them in those situations where room and nourishment were the most abundant.\n\nOn the same principle, we should expect to find the greatest actual increase of population in those situations where, from the abundance of good land, and the manner in which its produce is distributed, the largest portion of the necessaries of life is actually awarded to the mass of the society.\n\nOf the countries with which we are acquainted, the United States of America, formerly the North American <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">Colonies</a> of Great Britain, answer most nearly to this description. In the United States not only is there an abundance of good land, but from the manner in which it has been distributed, and the market which has been opened for its produce, there has been a greater and more constant demand for labour, and a larger portion of necessaries has been awarded to the labourer than in any of those other countries which possess an equal or greater abundance of land and fertility of soil.\n\nHere, then, we should expect to find that the natural power of mankind to increase, whatever it may be, would be most distinctly marked; and here, in consequence, it appears that the actual rate of the increase of population has been more rapid than in any known country, although, independently of the abundance of good land, and the great demand for labour, it is distinguished by no other circumstances which appear to be peculiarly favourable to the increase of numbers.\n\nIt has been stated that all animals, according to the known laws by which they are produced, must have a capacity of increasing in a geometrical progression. And the question with regard to man is, what is the rate of this geometrical progression?\n\nFortunately in the country to which we should naturally turn our eyes for an exemplification of the most rapid rate of increase, there have been four enumerations of the people, each at the distance of ten years; and though the estimates of the increase of population in the North American Colonies at earlier periods were of sufficient authority, in the absence of more certain documents, to warrant most important inferences, yet as we now possess such documents, and as the period they involve is of sufficient length to establish the point in question, it is no longer necessary to refer to earlier times.\n\nAccording to a regular census made by order of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONGRESS\">Congress</a> in 1790, which there is every reason to think is essentially correct, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> population of the United States was found to be 3,164,148. By a similar census in 1800, it was found to have increased to 4,312,841. It had increased then during the ten years from 1790 to 1800, at a rate equal to 36.3 per cent., a rate which, if <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>, would double the population in twenty-two years and about four months and a half.\n\nAccording to a third census in 1810, the white population was found to be 5,862,092,* which, compared with the population of 1800, gives an increase in the second ten years at the rate of nearly 36 per cent., which, if continued, would double the population in about twenty-two years and a half.\n\nAccording to the fourth census in 1820, the white population was found to be 7,861,710,+ which, compared with the population of 1810, gives an increase in the third ten years at a rate per cent. of 34.1, which, if continued, would double the population in twenty-three years and seven months.\n\nIf we compare the period of doubling according to the rate of increase in the most unfavourable ten years of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a>, with twenty-five years, we shall find the difference such as fully to cover all the increase of population which would have taken place from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMIGRATION\">emigration</a>.\n\nIt appears from a reference to the most authentic documents which can be collected on both sides of the Atlantic, that the emigration to the United States, during the last twenty-five years, falls decidedly short.\n\n* These numbers are taken from Dr Seybert's Statistical Annals, p. 23.\n+ This number is taken from the American National <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-CALENDAR\">Calendar</a> for 1822, and has since been compared with the original census as published for the use of the members of Congress.\nPopulation of an average of 10,000 a-year. Dr Seybert, the best authority on the other side of the water, states that, from 1790 to 1810, it could not have been so much as 6000 a-year. Our official accounts of the number of emigrants to the United States from England, Ireland, and Scotland, during the ten years from 1812 to 1821, inclusive, give an average of less than 7000, although the period includes the extraordinary years 1817 and 1818, in which the emigrations to the United States were much greater than they were ever known to be before or since. The official American accounts, as far as they go, which is only for two years from the 30th September 1819, tend to confirm this average, and allowing fully for the emigrants from other European countries, the general average will still be under the ten thousand.\n\nA new mode has, however, lately been suggested of estimating the amount of increase in any country derived from emigration. It has been justly stated, that when a census is taken every ten years, and the population is distinguished into those above, and those below ten years of age, all above ten years of age, exclusive of emigrants, must have existed in the census immediately preceding, and, consequently, after having made a proper allowance for the mortality during these ten years, the excess above the remaining number must be attributed to emigration. If we had the means of estimating with accuracy the loss which would be sustained in America in ten years by a population not increased by additional births, this mode of estimating the amount of emigration would be unobjectionable, and often very useful.\n\nBut, unfortunately, the means are deficient. Even the annual mortality in the United States is not known. It was supposed by Dr Price (Vol. II. p. 50, 7th edit.) to be 1 in 50; by Mr Barton, in the Transactions of the Society at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILADELPHIA\">Philadelphia</a> (Vol. III. No. 7), 1 in 45; and it is stated by Mr Bristed, in his work on America and her Resources (p. 20), that the annual deaths average throughout the United States 1 in 40, in the healthiest districts 1 in 56, and in the most unhealthy 1 in 35.\n\nIf, however, we could ascertain accurately the average annual mortality, we should still be unable to ascertain the amount of the loss in question; as, under any given law of mortality, it would depend so very much upon the rate at which the population was increasing. The truth of this observation will be placed in a striking light by the following short table, with which we have been favoured by a very able calculator, Mr Milne, author of a well-known Treatise on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ANNUITIES\">Annuities</a> and Assurances. It is constructed on the supposition that the population, in each case, is always subject to the same law of mortality as that which prevailed in all Sweden Population and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINLAND\">Finland</a> during the five years, ended with 1805, and that the number of births in the present year living in each case is 10,000.\n\n| Total population ten years since | 393,848 |\n|---------------------------------|---------|\n| Total above 10 years of age now | 320,495 |\n| Died during the term of 10 years, out of those living at its commencement | 73,353 |\n| Being one of | 5,3692 |\n\nWe see from this table, that, under the same law of mortality, the difference of loss sustained in ten years, by a people not increased by fresh births, would in the three cases supposed of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a> population, a population doubling in 50 years, and a population doubling in 25 years, be as 1 in 5,3692, 1 in 6,6786, and 1 in 7,9396; and that when the population is doubling itself in 25 years, the loss would be very little more than one-eighth.\n\nBut the censuses must be allowed to form a prima facie evidence, that the population of the United States has, for a considerable time, been going on doubling itself in 25 years; and assuming this evidence to be true, which we are warranted in doing till better evidence is produced on the other side, it will appear that the amount of immigration, deduced from the rule here referred to, is less than 10,000 a-year.\n\nThus the white population of the United States in 1800 was 4,312,841. This population, without further accession of births, would in 1810 be diminished one-eighth, or reduced to 3,773,736. In 1810 the population above ten years of age was 3,845,389; and subtracting the former number from the latter, the difference, or amount of emigration, will be 71,653, or 7,165 a-year.\n\nAgain, the white population of 1810 was 5,862,092, which, diminished by one-eighth in ten years, would be 5,129,331. The population above ten years of age in 1820 was 5,235,940. Subtracting the former from the latter, the difference, or amount of emi-\n\n---\n\n* American National Calendar for 1821, p. 237, and North American Review for October 1822, p. 304.\n\u2020 This mode was suggested by Mr Booth in Mr Godwin's Answer to Mr Malthus.\n\u2021 Seybert's Statistical Annals, p. 23.\n\u00a7 American National Calendar for 1822, p. 246.\ngration, is 106,608, or 10,660 a-year; showing, as we should expect, a greater amount of emigration from 1810 to 1820 than from 1800 to 1810, but even in the latter ten years, and including emigrations from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CANADA\">Canada</a>, as well as all other countries, little exceeding 10,000.\n\nAltogether then we can hardly err in defect, if we allow 10,000 a year for the average increase from emigration during the 25 years from 1795 to 1820, and applying this number to the slowest period of increase, when the rate was such as to double the population in 23 years and 7 months; it may be easily calculated, that in the additional year and five months, a population of 5,862,000 would have increased to an amount much more than sufficient to cover an annual emigration of 10,000 persons, with the increase from them at the same rate.\n\nSuch an increase from them, however, would not take place. It appears from an account in the National Calendar of the United States for the year 1821, that of the 7001 persons who had arrived in America from the 30th of September 1819 to the 30th of September 1820, 1959 only were females, and the rest, 5042, were males,*\u2014a proportion, which, if it approaches towards representing the average, must very greatly reduce the number from which any increase ought to be calculated.\n\nIf, however, we omit these considerations; if we suppose a yearly emigration from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> to America of 10,000 persons for the 25 years, from 1795 to 1820, the greatest part of which time Europe was involved in a most extensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of warfare requiring all its population; and further, if we allow for an increase of all the emigrants during the whole period, at the fullest rate, the remaining numbers will still be sufficient to show a doubling of the population in less than 25 years.\n\nThe white population of 1790 was 3,164,148. This population, according to the rate at which it was increasing, would have amounted to about 3,694,100 in 1795; and supposing it to have just doubled itself in the 25 years, from 1795 to 1820, the population in 1820 would have been 7,388,200. But the actual white population of 1820 appears, by the late census, to be 7,861,710, showing an excess of 473,510, whereas an emigration of 10,000 persons annually, with the increase from them at 3 per cent., a rate which would double a population in less than 24 years, would only amount to 364,592.\n\nBut the most striking confirmation of the censuses of the United States, and the most remarkable proof of the rate of increase being occasioned almost exclusively by procreation, have been furnished to us by Mr Milne. In his work on Annuities and Assurances, which contains much valuable and interesting information on the subject of population, he had noticed the effects of the frequent pressure of want on the labouring classes of Sweden; which, by increasing the proportion of deaths, rendered the law of mortality so accurately observed in that country by Professors Wargentin and Nican der, inapplicable to other countries more favourably circumstanced. But the law of mortality was observed to be gradually improving from the time that Dr Price constructed his Swedish table; and the period from 1800 to the end of 1805 was so free from scarcities and epidemics, and the healthiness of the country had been further so much improved by the introduction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-VACCINATION\">vaccination</a>, that he justly thought the law of mortality, as observed during these five years, might <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> countries where the condition of the people was known to be much better than it had generally been in Sweden. On these grounds he applied the Swedish law of mortality, during the term mentioned, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> of a population which had been increasing by procreation, in geometrical progression, for more than a hundred years, so as to double every twenty-five years. Assuming this population to be one million, he distributed it, by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> well known to persons conversant with these subjects, into the different ages referred to in the American censuses, and then compared them with the same number of persons distributed according to the actual returns of the ages in the American censuses for the three periods of 1800, 1810, and 1820.\n\nThe results are as follows:\n\nDistribution of a Population of 1,000,000 Persons in the under mentioned intervals of Age.\n\n| Ages of | According to |\n|---------|--------------|\n| Between the Ages of | The Hypothesis | United States Census of 1800 | Census of 1810 | Census of 1820 |\n| 0 & 10 | 337,592 | 334,556 | 344,024 | 333,995 |\n| 10 & 16 | 145,588 | 154,898 | 156,345 | 154,913 |\n| 16 & 26 | 186,222 | 185,046 | 189,227 | 198,114 |\n| 26 & 45 | 213,013 | 205,289 | 190,461 | 191,139 |\n| 45 & 100 | 117,590 | 120,211 | 119,943 | 121,839 |\n| 0 & 100 | 1,000,000 | 1,000,000 | 1,000,000 | 1,000,000 |\n| Under 16 | 483,175 | 489,454 | 500,369 | 488,908 |\n| Above 16 | 516,825 | 510,546 | 499,631 | 511,092 |\n\nThe general resemblance in the distribution of the ages in the three different censuses to each other, and to the hypothesis, clearly proves,\n\n1st, That the distribution of the ages in the different enumerations must be made with some care, and may, therefore, be relied on as in the main correct.\n\n2dly, That the law of mortality assumed in the hypothesis, cannot deviate essentially from the law of mortality which prevails in the United States; and,\n\n* The details for the next year have not yet been printed, but it is known that the whole number of passengers arriving in the United States was 10,722, of which 2415 were from the United States, leaving 8307 foreigners. American Review for October 1822, p. 304.\nThat the actual structure of the American population differs very little from what it would be if it were increasing regularly from procreation only, in geometrical progression, so as to double itself every 25 years; and that we may, therefore, safely infer that it has been very little disturbed by immigration.\n\nIf to these proofs of the rapid increase of population which has actually taken place, we add the consideration that this rate of increase is an average applying to a most extensive territory, some parts of which are known to be unhealthy; that some of the towns of the United States are now large; that many of the inhabitants must be engaged in unwholesome occupations, and exposed to many of those checks to increase which prevail in other countries; and further, that in the western territories, where these checks do not occur, the rate of increase is beyond <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> more rapid than the general average, after making the fullest allowance for immigration, it must appear certain, that the rate at which the population of the whole of the United States has actually increased for the last 30 years, must fall very decidedly short of the actual capacity of mankind to increase under the most favourable circumstances.\n\nThe best proof that can be obtained of the capacity of mankind to increase at a certain rate, is their having really increased at that rate. At the same time, if any peculiarly rapid increase which had appeared to take place in a particular country, were quite unsupported by other evidence, we might be disposed to attribute it to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> or accident, and might scarcely be justified in founding important conclusions upon it. But this is far from being the case in the present instance. The rate of increase which has at times taken place in other countries, under the operation of great and obvious checks to the progress of population, sufficiently shows what might be expected if these checks were removed.\n\nThe countries most resembling the United States of America are those territories of the New World which lately belonged to Spain. In abundance and fertility of soil they are indeed superior; but almost all the vices in the government of the mother country were introduced into her colonial possessions, and particularly that very unequal distribution of landed property which takes place under the feudal system. These evils, and the circumstance of a very large part of the population being Indians in a depressed state, and inferior in industry and energy to Europeans, necessarily prevent that rapid increase of numbers which the abundance and fertility of the land would admit of. But it appears from the instructive and interesting account of New Spain, which M. Humboldt has not long since given to the public, that for the last half of the eighteenth century, the excess of the births above the deaths, and the progress of the population, have been very great.\n\nThe following are the proportions of burials to baptisms in the registers of eleven villages, the details of which were communicated to M. Humboldt by the curates:\n\n| Burials | Baptisms |\n|---------|----------|\n| At Dolores | 100 | 253 |\n| Singuilucan | 100 | 234 |\n| Calymaya | 100 | 202 |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUANAXUATO\">Guanaxuato</a> | 100 | 201 |\n| St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANNE\">Anne</a> | 100 | 195 |\n| Marsil | 100 | 194 |\n| Queretaro | 100 | 188 |\n| Axapuzco | 100 | 157 |\n| Yguala | 100 | 140 |\n| Malacatepec | 100 | 130 |\n| Panuco | 100 | 123 |\n\nThe mean proportion is 100 to 183.\n\nBut the proportion which M. Humboldt considers as best suited to the whole of the population is 100 to 170.\n\nIn some of the villages above mentioned, the proportion of the births to the population is extraordinarily great, and the proportion of deaths very considerable, showing, in a striking point of view, the early marriages and early deaths of a tropical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, and the more rapid passing away of each generation.\n\nAt Queretaro, it appears that the baptisms were to the population as 1 to 14, and the burials as 1 to 26.\n\nAt Guanaxuato, including the neighbouring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> of St Anne and of Marsil, the baptisms were to the population as 1 to 15, and the burials as 1 to 29.\n\nThe general result from all the information which could be collected was, that the proportion of births to the population, for the whole of the kingdom of New Spain, was as 1 to 17, and of the deaths as 1 to 30. These proportions of births to deaths, if they were continued, would double the population in 27\u00bd years.\n\nM. Humboldt further observes, that the information which he had collected respecting the proportions of the births to the deaths, and of these to the whole population, proves, that if the order of nature were not interrupted by some extraordinary and disturbing causes, the population of New Spain ought to double itself every nineteen years.\n\nIt is known, however, that these causes do occur in the actual state of things; consequently we cannot consider the actual rate of the increase of population in New Spain as greater than according to the former calculation. But a rate of increase such\n\n---\n\n* The details which M. Humboldt has given of the population of New Spain are highly interesting, as they are the first of any consequence which the public has yet received of a tropical climate. The peculiarities which mark them are exactly of the kind which might have been expected, though the proportion of births is still greater than we could have ventured to suppose.\n\n\u2020 Essai Politique sur le Royaume de la Nouvelle Espagne, Liv. II. Chap. iv. pp. 330, et seq. Vol. I. Oct.\nPopulation, as to double the population in 27\u00bd, in spite of all the obstacles enumerated by M. Humboldt, is very extraordinary. It is next to the increase of the United States, and greatly superior to any that can be found in Europe.\n\nYet in Europe, the tendency to increase is always very strongly marked, and the actual increase for periods of some length is sometimes much greater than could be expected beforehand, considering the obstacles to be overcome.\n\nIt appears from Sussmilch, * that the population of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUSSIA\">Prussia</a> and Lithuania, after the great plague in 1709 and 1710, doubled itself in about 44 years, from the excess of the births above the deaths enumerated in the registers.\n\nIn Russia, the whole population in 1763 was estimated, by enumeration and calculation, at twenty millions, and in 1796 at thirty-six millions. \u2020 This is a rate of increase which would occasion a doubling in less than 42 years.\n\nIn 1695, the population of Ireland was estimated at 1,034,000. According to the late returns in 1821, it had increased to the prodigious amount of 6,846,949:\u2021 and it is thought that when the deficiencies have been supplied by the final returns of the numerators, it will be upwards of seven millions. This is an example of an actual increase for 125 years together, at a rate which would double the population in about 45 years; and this has taken place under the frequent pressure of great distress among the labouring classes of society, and the practice of frequent and considerable emigration.\n\nBut for the proof of the power of population to increase under great obstacles of the preventive, as well as of the positive kind, we need not go out of Great Britain. The rate of increase since our enumerations have commenced has been very remarkable for a country which was considered as well peopled before, and some of the details accompanying the returns tend strikingly to illustrate the principle of population.\n\nThe population of Great Britain, according to the late enumerations, was, in 1801, 10,942,646, and, in 1811, 12,596,803.\u00a7 This is a rate of increase, during the ten years, of rather above 15 per cent., a rate which, if continued, would double the population in between 49 and 50 years.\n\nBy the last enumeration of 1821, it appears that the population was 14,391,631,|| which, compared with the population of 1811, gives a rate of increase during the ten years of 14.25 per cent., a rate which would double the population in about 52 years.\n\nAccording to these numbers, the rate of increase during the last ten years was slower than that of the first; but it appears from the excess of the number of males above females in the enumeration of 1811, so opposite to the state of the population in 1801 and 1821, when the females exceeded the males, particularly at the latter period, that of the large number added to the population for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">navy</a>, and registered merchant ships in 1811, a considerable proportion must have been foreigners. On this account, and on account of the further difficulty of knowing what part of this number might properly belong to Ireland, it has been proposed to estimate the rate per cent. at which the population has increased in each of the ten years by the females only; and according to this mode of computation the population increased during the first period at the rate of 14.02 per cent., and during the second at the rate of 15.82.\u2014(<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRELIMINARY\">Preliminary</a> Observations, p. 8.) This last rate of increase would double the population in less than 48 years.\n\nThe only objection to this mode of computation is, that it does not take into consideration the greater destruction of the males during the war. In 1801, the females exceeded the half of the population by 21,031, and in 1821 by 63,890, while, at the intermediate period, owing to the causes above mentioned, the females fell short of the half of the males by 35,685.\n\nWhen, however, a proper distribution has been made of the army and navy among the resident population, and taking England and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a> alone, it appears that from 1801 to 1811 the population increased at the rate of 14\u00bd per cent., and from 1811 to 1821, at the rate of 16\u00bd per cent.\u2014(Preliminary Observations, p. 32.) At the former of these rates, the period of doubling would be rather above 50 years\u2014at the latter, under 46 years, and taking the whole period, the time of doubling would be about 48 years. Yet in Great Britain, there is a much larger proportion of the population living in towns, and engaged in occupations considered as unhealthy, than in any other known country of the same extent. There are also the best reasons for believing that in no other country of the same extent is there to be found so great a proportion of late marriages, or so great a proportion of persons remaining unmarried, as in Great Britain. It is further known that the number of emigrants from Great Britain greatly exceed those who come into the country. And if, under these circumstances, a demand for labour and an increase of the funds for its maintenance, could for 20 years together occasion such a rate of increase, as, if continued, would double the population in 48 years, and quadruple it in 96 years, it is in the highest degree probable, that if the encouragements to marriage and the means of supporting a family were as great as in America, the period of doubling in Great Britain would not be more than 25 years, even in spite of her great towns and manufactories; and would be decidedly less if these obstacles were removed.\n\n* Gotliche Ordnung, Vol. I.

Preliminary Observations, p. 8.\n|| Ibid.\nTaking, therefore, into consideration the actual rate of increase, which appears from the best documents to have taken place over a very large extent of country in the United States of America, very variously circumstanced as to healthiness and rapidity of progress; considering further, the rate of increase which has taken place in New Spain, and also in many countries of Europe, where the means of supporting a family, and other circumstances favourable to increase, bear no comparison with those of the United States; and adverting particularly to the great increase of population which has taken place in this country during the last 20 years, under the formidable obstacles to its progress which must press themselves upon the attention of the most careless observer, it must appear, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSUMPTION\">assumption</a> of a rate of increase such as would double the population in 25 years, as representing the natural progress of population, when not checked by the difficulty of procuring the means of subsistence, or other peculiar causes of premature mortality, must be very decidedly within the truth.\n\nIt may be safely asserted, therefore, that population, when unchecked, increases in a geometrical progression of such a nature as to double itself every twenty-five years.\n\nIt would be unquestionably desirable to have the means of comparing the natural rate of the increase of population when unchecked, with the possible rate of the increase of food, in a limited territory, such as that in which man is actually placed; but the latter estimate is much more difficult and uncertain than the former. If the rate of the increase of population at a particular period of some little extent can be ascertained with tolerable exactness, we have only to suppose the continuance of the same encouragements to marriage, the same facility of supporting a family, the same moral habits, with the same rate of mortality, and the increase of the population at the same rate, after it had reached a thousand millions, would be just as probable as at any intermediate and earlier period; but it is quite obvious that the increase of food in a limited space must proceed upon a principle totally different. It has been already stated, that while land of good quality is in great abundance, the rate at which food might be made to increase would far exceed what is necessary to keep pace with the most rapid increase of population which the laws of nature in relation to human kind permit. But if society were so constituted as to give the fullest scope possible to the progress of cultivation and population, all such lands, and all lands of moderate quality, would soon be occupied; and when the future increase of the supply of food came to depend upon the taking of very poor land into cultivation, and the gradual and laborious improvement of the land already cultivated, the rate of the increase of food would certainly have a greater resemblance to a decreasing geometrical ratio than an increasing one. The yearly increment of food would, at any rate, have a constant tendency to diminish, and the amount of the increase of each successive ten years would probably be less than that of the preceding.\n\nPractically, however, great uncertainty must take place. An unfavourable distribution of produce, by prematurely diminishing the demand for labour, might retard the increase of food at an early period, in the same manner as if cultivation and population had been further advanced; while improvements in agriculture, accompanied by a great demand for labour and produce, might for some time occasion a rapid increase of food and population at a later period, in the same manner as if cultivation and population had been in an earlier stage of their progress. These variations, however, obviously arise from causes which do not impeach the general tendency of a continued increase of produce in a limited territory to diminish the power of its increase in future.\n\nUnder this certainty with regard to the general Supposition tendency, and uncertainty in reference to particular periods, it must be allowable, if it throws light on the subject, to make a supposition respecting the increase of food in a limited territory, which, without pretending to accuracy, is clearly more favourable to the power of the soil to produce the means of subsistence for an increasing population, than any experience which we have of its qualities will warrant.\n\nIf, setting out from a tolerably well peopled country such as England, France, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, or Germany, we were to suppose that, by great attention to agriculture, its produce could be permanently increased every twenty-five years by a quantity equal to that which it at present produces, it would be allowing a rate of increase decidedly beyond any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> of realization. The most sanguine cultivators could hardly expect that, in the course of the next two hundred years, each farm in this country on an average would produce eight times as much food as it produces at present, and still less that this rate of increase could continue, so that each farm would produce twenty times as much as at present in 500 years, and forty times as much in 1000 years. Yet this would be an arithmetical progression, and would fall short, beyond all comparison, of the natural increase of population in a geometrical progression, according to which the inhabitants of any country in 500 years, instead of increasing to twenty times, would increase to above a million times their present numbers.\n\nIt will be said, perhaps, that many parts of the earth are as yet very thinly peopled, and, under proper management, would allow of a much more rapid increase of food than would be possible in the more fully inhabited states of Europe. This is unquestionably true. Some parts of the earth would no doubt be capable of producing food at such a rate as to keep pace for a few periods with an unrestricted increase of population. But, to put this capacity fully into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, is of all things the most difficult. If it is to be accomplished by the improvement of the actual inhabitants of the different parts of the earth in knowledge, in government, in industry, in arts, and in morals, it is scarcely possible to say how it ought to be commenced with the best prospect of success, or to form a conjecture as to the time in which it could be effected.\n\nIf it is to be accomplished by emigration from the more improved parts of the world, it is obvious that it must involve much war and extermination; besides all the difficulties usually attendant upon new\nPopulation settlements in uncivilized countries; and these alone are so formidable, and for a long time so destructive, that, combined with the unwillingness which people must always naturally feel to quit their own country, much distress would be suffered at home before relief would be sought for in emigration.\n\nBut, supposing for a moment that the object could be fully accomplished, that is, supposing that the capacity of the earth to produce the necessaries of life could be put fully into action, and that they were distributed in the proportions most favourable for the growth of capital, and the effective demand for labour, the increase of population, whether arising from the increase of the inhabitants of each country, or from emigrants issuing from all those countries which were more advanced in cultivation, would be so rapid, that, in a period comparatively quite short, all the good lands would be occupied, and the rate of the possible increase of food would be reduced much below the arithmetical ratio above supposed.\n\nIf, merely during the short period which has elapsed since our Revolution of 1688, the population of the earth had increased at its natural rate when unchecked, supposing the number of people at that time to have been only 800 millions, all the land of the globe, without making allowance for deserts, forests, rocks, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>, would on an average be equally populous with England and Wales at present. This would be accomplished in five doublings, or 125 years; and one or two doublings more, or a period less than that which has elapsed since the beginning of the reign of James the First, would produce the same effect from the overflowings of the inhabitants of those countries, where, owing to the further progress of cultivation, the soil had not the capacity of producing food so as to keep pace with the increase of an unrestricted population.\n\nWhatever temporary and partial relief, therefore, may be derived from emigration by particular countries in the actual state of things, it is quite obvious, that, considering the subject generally and largely, emigration may be fairly said not in any degree to touch the difficulty. And, whether we exclude or include emigration,\u2014whether we refer to particular countries, or to the whole earth, the supposition of a future capacity in the soil to increase the necessaries of life every twenty-five years by a quantity equal to that which is at present produced, must be decidedly beyond the truth.\n\nBut, if the natural increase of population, when unchecked by the difficulty of procuring the means of subsistence, or other peculiar causes, be such as to continue doubling its numbers in twenty-five years; and the greatest increase of food, which, for a continuance, could possibly take place on a limited territory like our earth in its present state, be at the most only such as would add every twenty-five years an amount equal to its present produce; it is quite clear that a powerful check on the increase of population must be almost constantly in action.\n\nBy the laws of nature man cannot live without food. Whatever may be the rate at which population would increase if unchecked, it never can actually increase in any country beyond the food necessary to support it. But, by the laws of nature in respect to the powers of a limited territory, the conditions which can be made in equal periods to the food which it produces must, after a short time, either be constantly decreasing, which is what would really take place; or, at the very most, must remain stationary, so as to increase the means of subsistence only in an arithmetical progression. Consequently, it follows necessarily that the average rate of the actual increase of population over the greatest part of the globe, obeying the same laws as the increase of food, must be totally of a different character from the rate at which it would increase if unchecked.\n\nThe great question, then, which remains to be considered, is the manner in which this constant and racter of the necessary check upon population practically operates.\n\nIf the soil of any extensive well peopled country were equally divided amongst its inhabitants, the check would assume its most obvious and simple form. Perhaps each farm in the well peopled countries of Europe might allow of one, or even two doublings, without much distress, but the absolute impossibility of going on at the same rate is too glaring to escape the most careless thinker. When, by extraordinary efforts, provision had been made for four times the number of persons which the land can support at present, what possible hope could there be of doubling the provision in the next twenty-five years?\n\nYet there is no reason whatever to suppose that anything besides the difficulty of procuring in adequate plenty the necessaries of life, should either indispose this greater number of persons to marry early, or disable them from rearing in health the largest families. But this difficulty would of necessity occur, and its effect would be either to discourage early marriages, which would check the rate of increase by preventing the same proportion of births; or to render the children unhealthy from bad and insufficient nourishment, which would check the rate of increase by occasioning a greater proportion of deaths; or, what is most likely to happen, the rate of increase would be checked, partly by the diminution of births, and partly by the increase of mortality.\n\nThe first of these checks may, with propriety, be called the preventive check to population; the second, the positive check; and the absolute necessity of their operation in the case supposed is as certain and obvious as that man cannot live without food.\n\nTaking a single farm only into consideration, no man would have the hardihood to assert that its produce could be made permanently to keep pace with a population increasing at such a rate as it is observed to do for 20 or 30 years together at particular times and in particular countries. He would, indeed, be compelled to acknowledge, that if, with a view to allow for the most sanguine speculations, it has been supposed that the additions made to the necessaries produced by the soil in given times might remain constant, yet that this rate of the increase of produce could not possibly be realized; and that, if the capacity of the soil were at all times put properly into action, the additions to the pro-\nduce would, after a short time, and independently of new inventions, be constantly decreasing, till, in no very long period, the exertions of an additional labourer would not produce his own subsistence.\n\nBut what is true, in this respect, in reference to a single farm, must necessarily be true of the whole earth, from which the necessaries of life for the actual population are derived. And what would be true in respect to the checks to population, if the soil of the earth were equally divided among the different families which inhabit it, must be true, under the present unequal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of property, and variety of occupations. Nothing but the confusion and indistinctness arising from the largeness of the subject, and the vague and false notions which prevail respecting the efficacy of emigration, could make persons deny in the case of an extensive territory, or the whole earth, what they could not fail to acknowledge in the case of a single farm which may be said fairly to represent it.\n\nIt may be expected, indeed, that in civilized and improved countries, the accumulation of capital, the division of labour, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of machinery, will extend the bounds of production; but we know from experience, that the effects of these causes, which are quite astonishing in reference to some of the conveniences and luxuries of life, are very much less efficient in producing an increase of food; and although the saving of labour and an improved system of husbandry may be the means of pushing cultivation upon much poorer lands than could otherwise be worked; yet the increased quantity of the necessaries of life so obtained can never be such as to supersede, for any length of time, the operation of the preventive and positive checks to population. And not only are these checks as absolutely necessary in civilized and improved countries, as they would be, if each family had a certain portion of land allotted to it, but they operate almost exactly in the same way. The distress which would obviously arise in the most simple state of society from the natural tendency of population to increase faster than the means of subsistence in a limited territory, is brought home to the higher classes of an improved and populous country in the difficulty which they find in supporting their families in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of life with themselves; and to the labouring classes which form the great mass of society, in the insufficiency of the real wages of common labour to bring up a large family.\n\nIf in any country the yearly earnings of the commonest labourers determined, as they always will be, by the state of the demand and the supply of necessaries compared with labour, be not sufficient to bring up in health the largest families, one of the three things before stated must happen; either the prospect of this difficulty will prevent some and delay other marriages; or the diseases arising from bad nourishment will be introduced, and the mortality be increased; or the progress of population will be retarded, partly by one cause and partly by the other.\n\nAccording to all past experience, and the best observations which can be made on the motives which operate upon the human mind, there can be no well founded hope of obtaining a large produce from the soil, but under a system of private property. It seems perfectly visionary to suppose that any stimulus short of that which is excited in man by the desire of providing for himself and family, and of bettering his condition in life, should operate on the mass of society with sufficient force and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTANCY\">constancy</a> to overcome the natural indolence of mankind. All the attempts which have been made since the commencement of authentic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> to proceed upon a principle of common property, have either been so insignificant that no inference can be drawn from them, or have been marked by the most signal failures; and the changes which have been effected in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> times by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>, do not seem to advance a single step towards making such a state of things more probable in future. We may, therefore, safely conclude that while man retains the same physical and moral constitution which he is observed to possess at present, no other than a system of private property stands the least chance of providing for such a large and increasing population as that which is to be found in many countries at present.\n\nBut though there is scarcely any conclusion which seems more completely established by experience than this, yet it is unquestionably true that the laws of private property, which are the grand stimulants to production, do themselves so limit it, as always to make the actual produce of the earth fall very considerably short of the power of production. On a system of private property no adequate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of cultivation can exist, unless the returns are sufficient not only to pay the wages necessary to keep up the population, which, at the least, must include the support of a wife and two or three children, but also afford a profit on the capital which has been employed. This necessarily excludes from cultivation a considerable portion of land, which might be made to bear corn. If it were possible to suppose that man might be adequately stimulated to labour under a system of common property, such land might be cultivated, and the production of food and the increase of population might go on, till the soil absolutely refused to grow a single additional quarter, and the whole of the society was exclusively engaged in procuring the necessaries of life. But it is quite obvious that such a state of things would inevitably <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> to the greatest degree of distress and degradation. And, if a system of private property secures mankind from such evils, which it certainly does, in a great degree, by securing to a portion of the society the leisure necessary for the progress of the arts and sciences, it must be allowed that such a check to the increase of cultivation confers on society a most signal benefit.\n\nBut it must perhaps also be allowed, that, under a system of private property, cultivation is sometimes checked in a degree, and at a period, not required by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> of society. And this is particularly likely to happen when the original divisions of land have been extremely unequal, and the laws have not given sufficient facility to a better distribution of them. Under a system of private property, the only effectual demand for produce must come from the owners of property; and though it be true that the effectual demand of the society, whatever it may be,\nPopulation is best supplied under the most perfect system of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, yet it is not true that the tastes and wants of the effective demanders are always, and necessarily, the most favourable to the progress of national wealth. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> for hunting and the preservation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAME\">game</a> among the owners of the soil will, without fail, be supplied, if things be allowed to take their natural course; but such a supply, from the manner in which it must be effected, would inevitably be most unfavourable to the increase of produce and population. In the same manner, the want of an adequate taste for the consumption of manufactured commodities among the possessors of surplus produce, if not fully compensated by a great desire for personal attendance, which it never is, would infallibly occasion a premature slackness in the demand for labour and produce, a premature fall of profits, and check to cultivation.\n\nIt makes little difference in the actual rate of the increase of population, or the necessary existence of checks to it, whether that state of demand and supply which occasions an insufficiency of wages to the whole of the labouring classes be produced prematurely by a bad structure of society, and an unfavourable distribution of wealth, or necessarily by the comparative exhaustion of the soil. The labourer feels the difficulty nearly in the same degree, and it must have nearly the same results, from whatever cause it arises; consequently, in every country with which we are acquainted, where the yearly earnings of the labouring classes are not sufficient to bring up in health the largest families, it may be safely said, that population is actually checked by the difficulty of procuring the means of subsistence. And, as we well know that ample wages, combined with full employment for all who choose to work, are extremely rare, and scarcely ever occur, except for a certain time, when the knowledge and industry of an old country is applied, under favourable circumstances, to a new one; it follows, that the pressure arising from the difficulty of procuring subsistence is not to be considered as a remote one, which will be felt only when the earth refuses to produce any more, but as one which not only actually exists at present over the greatest part of the globe, but, with few exceptions, has been almost constantly acting upon all the countries of which we have any account.\n\nIt is unquestionably true, that, in no country of the globe have the government, the distribution of property, and the habits of the people, been such as to call forth, in the most effective manner, the resources of the soil. Consequently, if the most advantageous possible change in all these respects could be supposed at once to take place, it is certain that the demand for labour, and the encouragement to production, might be such, as for a short time, in some countries, and for rather a longer in others, to lessen the operation of the checks to population which have been described. It is specifically this truth constantly obtruding itself upon our attention, which is the great source of delusion on this subject, and creates the belief that man could always produce from the soil much more than sufficient to support himself and family. In the actual state of things, this power has perhaps always been possessed. But for it we are indebted wholly to the ignorance and bad government of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>. If they had properly called forth the resources of the soil, it is quite certain that we should now have but scanty means left of further increasing our food. If merely since the time of William the Conqueror, all the nations of the earth had been well governed, and, if the distribution of property, and the habits both of the rich and the poor had been the most favourable to the demand for produce and labour, though the amount of food and population would have been prodigiously greater than at present, the means of diminishing the checks to population would unquestionably be less. That difficulty in procuring the necessaries of life which is now felt in the comparatively low wages of labour almost all over the world, and is occasioned partly by the necessary state of the soil, and partly by a premature check to the demand for produce and labour, would then be felt in a greater degree, and would less admit of any relaxation in the checks to population, because it would be occasioned wholly and necessarily by the state of the soil.\n\nIt appears, then, that what may be called the proportionate amount of the necessary checks to population depends very little upon the efforts of man in the necessity of the cultivation of the soil. If these efforts had been directed from the first in the most enlightened and efficient manner, the checks necessary to keep the population on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> with the means of subsistence, so far from being lightened, would in all probability be operating with greater force; and the condition of the labouring classes, so far as it depends on the facility of procuring the means of subsistence, instead of being improved, would in all probability be deteriorated.\n\nIt is to the laws of nature, therefore, and not to the conduct and institutions of man, that we are to attribute the necessity of a strong check on the natural increase of population.\n\nBut, though the laws of nature which determine the rate at which population would increase if unchecked, and the very different rate at which the food required to support population could be made to increase in a limited territory, are undoubtedly the causes which render necessary the existence of some great and constant check to population, yet of the vast mass of responsibility remains behind on man and the institutions of society.\n\nIn the first place, they are certainly responsible for the present scanty population of the earth. There are few large countries, however advanced in improvement, the population of which might not have been doubled or tripled, and there are many which might be ten, or even a hundred times as populous, and yet all the inhabitants be as well provided for as they are now, if the institutions of society, and the moral habits of the people, had been for some hundred years the most favourable to the increase of capital, and the demand for produce and labour.\n\nSecondly, Though man has but a trifling and temporary influence in altering the proportionate amount of the checks to population, or the degree in which\nthey press upon the actual numbers, yet he has a great and most extensive influence on their character and mode of operation.\n\nIt is not in superseding the necessity of checks to population, in the progress of mankind to the full peopling of the earth (which may with truth be said to be a physical impossibility), but in directing these checks in such a way as to be the least prejudicial to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> of society, that government and human institutions produce their great effect. Here we know, from constant experience, that they have great power. Yet, even here it must be allowed, that the power of Government is rather indirect than direct, as the object to be attained depends mainly upon such a conduct on the part of individuals, as can seldom be directly enforced by laws, though it may be powerfully influenced by them.\n\nThis will appear, if we consider more particularly the nature of those checks which have been classified under the general heads of Preventive and Positive.\n\nIt will be found that they are all resolvable into moral restraint, vice, and misery. And if, from the laws of nature, some check to the increase of population be absolutely inevitable, and human institutions have any influence upon the extent to which each of these checks operates, a heavy responsibility will be incurred, if all that influence, whether direct or indirect, be not exerted to diminish the amount of vice and misery.\n\nMoral restraint, in application to the present subject, may be defined to be, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTINENCE\">abstinence</a> from marriage, either for a time or permanently, from prudential considerations, with a strictly moral conduct towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEX\">sex</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a>. And this is the only mode of keeping population on a level with the means of subsistence, which is perfectly consistent with virtue and happiness. All other checks, whether of the preventive or the positive kind, though they may greatly vary in degree, resolve themselves into some form of vice or misery.\n\nThe remaining checks of the preventive kind, are the sort of intercourse which renders some of the women of large towns unprolific; a general corruption of morals with regard to the sex, which has a similar effect; unnatural passions and improper arts to prevent the consequences of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> connections. These evidently come under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of vice.\n\nThe positive checks to population include all the causes, which tend in any way prematurely to shorten the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> of human life; such as unwholesome occupations\u2014severe labour and exposure to the seasons\u2014bad and insufficient food and clothing arising from poverty\u2014bad nursing of children\u2014excesses of all kinds\u2014great towns and manufactories\u2014the whole train of common diseases and epidemics\u2014wars, infanticide, plague, and famine. Of these positive checks, those which appear to arise from the laws of nature, may be called exclusively misery; and those which we bring upon ourselves, such as wars, excesses of all kinds, and many others, which it would be in our power to avoid, are of a mixed nature. They are brought upon us by vice, and their consequences are misery.\n\nSome of these checks, in various <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a>, and operating with various force, are constantly in action in all the countries with which we are acquainted, and form the immediate causes which keep the population on a level with the means of subsistence.\n\nMr Malthus, in his work on this subject, has taken a view of the checks of population in most of the countries of which we have the best accounts. His object was evidently to trace in each country those checks which appeared to be most effective in repressing population; and to endeavour to answer the question, generally, which had been applied, particularly, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NEW_HOLLAND\">New <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a> by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> Cook, namely, By what means is the population of this country kept down to the number which it can subsist?\n\nIt was hardly to be expected, however, that the Prudential general accounts of countries which are to be met with, should contain a sufficient number of details of the kind required, to enable us to ascertain what portion of the natural increase of population each individual check which could be traced, had the power to overcome. In particular, it was not to be expected, that any accounts could inform us of the degree in which moral restraint prevails, when taken in its strictest sense. It is necessary, therefore, to attend chiefly to the greater or smaller number of persons who remain unmarried or marry late; and the delay of marriage, owing to the difficulty of providing for a family, when the degree of irregularity to which it may lead cannot be ascertained, may be usefully called the prudential restraint on marriage and population. And this will be found to be the chief mode in which the preventive check practically operates.\n\nBut if the preventive check to population, that check which can alone supersede great misery and principally affect the mortality, operates chiefly by a prudential restraint on marriage, it will be obvious, as was before stated, that direct legislation cannot do much. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUDENCE\">Prudence</a> cannot be enforced by laws, without a great violation of natural liberty, and a great risk of producing more evil than good. But still, the very great influence of a just and enlightened government, and the perfect security of property in creating habits of prudence, cannot for a moment be questioned. The principal causes and effects of these habits are thus stated in Mr Malthus's last work. (Principles of Political Economy, c. iv. sec. 2.)\n\n\"From high wages, or the power of commanding a large portion of the necessaries of life, two very different results may follow; one, that of a rapid increase of population, in which case, the high wages are chiefly spent in the maintenance of large and frequent families; and the other, that of a decided improvement in the modes of subsistence, and the conveniences and comforts enjoyed, without a proportionate acceleration in the rate of increase.\n\n\"In looking to these different results, the causes of them will evidently appear to be the different habits existing among the people of different countries, and at different times. In an inquiry into the...\"\ncauses of these different habits, we shall generally be able to trace those which produce the first result to all the circumstances which contribute to depress the lower classes of the people, which make them unable or unwilling to reason from the past to the future, and ready to acquiesce for the sake of present gratification, in a very low standard of comfort and respectability; and those which produce the second result, to all the circumstances which tend to elevate the character of the lower classes of society, which make them approach the nearest to beings who \"look before and after,\" and who, consequently, cannot acquiesce patiently in the thought of depriving themselves and their children of the means of being respectable, virtuous, and happy.\n\n\"Among the circumstances which contribute to the character first described, the most efficient will be found to be despotism, oppression, and ignorance; among those which contribute to the latter character, civil and political liberty, and education.\n\n\"Of all the causes which tend to encourage prudential habits among the lower classes of society, the most essential is unquestionably civil liberty. No people can be much accustomed to form plans for the future, who do not feel assured that their industrious exertions, while fair and honourable, will be allowed to have free scope; and that the property which they either possess or may acquire, will be secured to them by a known code of just laws impartially administered. But it has been found by experience, that civil liberty cannot be permanently secured without political liberty. Consequently, political liberty becomes almost equally essential; and in addition to its being necessary in this point of view, its obvious tendency to teach the lower classes of society to respect themselves, by obliging the higher classes to respect them, must contribute greatly to all the good effects of civil liberty.\"\n\n\"With regard to education, it might certainly be made general under a bad form of government, and might be very deficient under one in other respects good; but it must be allowed that the chances, both with regard to its quality and its prevalence, are greatly in favour of the latter. Education alone could do little against insecurity of property; but it would powerfully assist all the favourable consequences to be expected from civil and political liberty, which could not indeed be considered as complete without it.\"\n\nThe varying prevalence of these habits, owing to the causes above referred to, combined with the smaller or greater mortality occasioned by other customs, and the varying effects of soil and climate, must necessarily produce great differences in different countries, and at different periods, in the character of the predominant checks to population and the force of each. And this inference, which inevitably follows from theory, is fully confirmed by experience.\n\nIt appears, for instance, from the accounts we have received of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> nations, and of the less civilized parts of the world, that war and violent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIS\">dis</a>-\nsent keeps the population down to the level of the actual means of subsistence, is the prudential restraint on marriage.\n\nYet in comparing together the accounts and registers of the different countries of modern times, we shall still find a vast difference in the character and force of the checks which are mainly in action; and it is precisely in this point of view that these accounts afford the most important instruction. Some parts of Europe are yet in an unimproved state, and are still subject to frequent plagues and mortal epidemics. In these countries, as might be expected, few traces are to be found of the prudential restraint on marriage. But even in improved countries, the circumstances may be such as to occasion a great mortality. Large towns are known to be unfavourable to health, particularly to the health of young children; and the unwholesomeness of marshy situations may be such as in some cases to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> the principle of increase, even when nearly the whole of the procreative power is called into action, which is seldom the case, in large towns.\n\nThus in the registers of twenty-two Dutch villages given by Sussmilch, quoted by Mr Malthus, the mortality (occasioned, as may be supposed, chiefly by the natural unhealthiness of the country) was as high as one in twenty-two or twenty-three, instead of the more common proportion of one in thirty-five or forty; and the consequence was, that the marriages, instead of being in the usual proportion of one in about 108 of the population, were in the extraordinary high proportion of one in sixty-four; showing a most unusual frequency of marriage, while, on account of the great mortality, the number of inhabitants was nearly stationary, and the births and deaths about equal.\n\nOn the other hand, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORWAY\">Norway</a>, where the climate and modes of living seem to be extremely favourable to health, and the mortality was only one in forty-eight, the prudential restraint on marriage was called more than usually into action, and the marriages were only one in 130 of the population. (Malthus, Vol. I. p. 365, 5th ed.)\n\nThese may be considered as extreme cases, but the same result in different degrees is observable in the registers of all countries; and it is particularly to be remarked, that in those countries where registers of births, deaths, and marriages have been kept for a considerable time, the progressive diminution of mortality occasioned by the introduction of habits more favourable to health, and the consequent diminution of plagues and mortal epidemics, have been accompanied invariably by a smaller proportion of marriages and births. Sussmilch has given some striking instances of the gradual diminution in the proportion of the number of marriages during a part of the last century. (Gottliche Ordnung, Vol. I. pp. 134, et seq.)\n\nIn the town of Leipsic, in the year 1620, the annual marriages were to the population as 1 to 82; from the year 1741 to 1756, they were as 1 to 120.\n\nIn Augsburg, in 1510, the proportion of marriages to the population was 1 in 86; in 1750 as 1 to 123.\n\nIn Dantzig, in the year 1795, the proportion was as 1 to 89; in 1745, as 1 to 118.\n\nIn the Dukedom of Magdeburgh, in 1700, the proportion was as 1 to 87; from 1752 to 1755, as 1 to 125.\n\nIn the principality of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HALBERSTADT\">Halberstadt</a>, in 1690, the proportion was as 1 to 88; in 1756, as 1 to 112.\n\nIn the Dukedom of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CLEVES\">Cleves</a>, in 1705, the proportion was 1 to 83; in 1755, 1 to 100.\n\nIn the Churmark of Brandenburgh, in 1700, the proportion was 1 to 76; in 1755, 1 to 108.\n\nInstances of this kind are numerous, and they tend to show the dependence of the marriages on the deaths in all old countries. A greater mortality almost invariably produces a greater number of marriages; and it must be equally certain, that except where the means of subsistence can be adequately increased, a greater proportion of marriages must occasion a greater mortality.\n\nThe proportion of yearly births to the whole population, must evidently depend principally on the proportion of marriages; and it appears, consequently, from registers, that in countries which will not admit of any considerable increase of population, the births, as well as the marriages, are mainly influenced by the deaths. When an actual decrease of population is not taking place, the births will always supply the vacancies made by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, and exactly so much more as the increasing wealth of the country and the demand for labour will admit. Everywhere in the intervals of plagues, epidemics, and destructive wars, the births considerably exceed the deaths; but while from these and other causes the mortality in different countries is extremely various, it appears from registers that, with the exception above stated, the births vary in the same proportion.\n\nThus, in 39 villages of Holland, where the deaths, at the time to which the registers refer, were about 1 in 23, the births were also 1 in 23. In 15 villages round <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, the births bore the same, or even a greater proportion to the whole population, on account of a still greater mortality, the births being 1 in 22, and the deaths the same. In the small towns of Brandenburgh, which were in an increasing state, the mortality was 1 in 29, and the births 1 in 24. In Sweden, where the mortality was about 1 in 34, the births were 1 in 28. In 1056 villages of Brandenburgh, in which the mortality was about 1 in 39 or 40; the births were about 1 in 30. In Norway,\n\n---\n\n* Gottliche Ordnung, Vol. I. c. iv. s. 57, p. 128.\u2014Malthus' <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> on Population, B. II. c. iv. p. 444 of Vol. I. 5th edition.\n\n\u2020 This very large proportion of marriages could not all have been supplied from the births in the country, but must have been occasioned in part by the influx of strangers.\n\n\u2021 Sussmilch, Gottliche Ordnung, Vol. I. p. 225.\u2014Essay on Population, Vol. I. p. 456, 5th ed.\nIn all these instances the births are evidently measured by the deaths, after making a proper allowance for the excess of births which the state of each country will admit. In such a country as Russia, this allowance must be great; as although the mortality might perhaps be taken as low as 1 in 48 or 50; the births were as high as 1 in 25, owing to the increasing resources of the country which admit of a rapid increase of the population.\n\nOf all the countries which Mr Malthus has reviewed, there is none which so strikingly illustrates the most important fact of the dependence of the proportions of marriages and births on the deaths, and the general principles of population, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWITZERLAND\">Switzerland</a>. It appears, that between 1760 and 1770, an alarm prevailed respecting the continued <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEPOPULATION\">depopulation</a> of the country; and to ascertain the point, M. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MURET\">Muret</a>, minister of Vevey, made a very laborious and careful search into the registers of different parishes from the time of their first establishment. He compared the number of births which had taken place during three different periods of 70 years each, the first ending in 1620, the second in 1690, and the third in 1760. And finding by this comparison, that the number of births was less in the second period than in the first, and less in the third period than in the second, he considered the evidence of a continued depopulation of the country from the year 1055 as incontrovertible.* But the accounts which he himself produces, clearly show that, in the earlier periods to which he refers, the mortality was very much greater than in the latter; and, that the greater number of births found in the registers formerly, was not owing to a greater population, but to the greater proportion of births which always accompanies a greater mortality.\n\nIt appears from accounts, which are entirely to be depended on, that during the last period, the mortality was extraordinarily small, and the proportion of children reared from infancy to puberty extraordinary great. At the time when M. Muret wrote his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, in 1766, the proportion of deaths to the population in the Pays de Vaud, was 1 in 45, of births 1 in 36, and of marriages 1 in 140. These are all very small proportions of births, deaths, and marriages, compared with other countries; but the state of things must have been totally different in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. M. Muret gives a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of all the plagues which had prevailed in Switzerland from 1520, from which it appears that this dreadful scourge desolated the country at short intervals during the whole of the first period, and extended its occasional ravages to within 22 years of the termination of the second. We may safely conclude, that, in these times, the average mortality was very much greater than at present. But what puts the question beyond a doubt, is the great mortality which prevailed in the neighbouring town of Geneva in the sixteenth century, and its gradual diminution in the seventeenth and eighteenth. It appears from calculations, published in the Biblioth\u00e8que Britannique, (Tom. IV. p. 328,) that in the sixteenth century, the probability of life, or the age to which half of the born lived, was only 4-883, or under four years and eleven months; and the mean life, or the average number of years due to each person 18.511, or about eighteen years and a half. In the seventeenth century, the probability of life in Geneva was 11.607, about eleven years and seven months; the mean life 23.358, or twenty-three years and four months. In the eighteenth century, the probability of life had increased to 27.183, twenty-seven years and two months; and the mean life to thirty-two years and two months.\n\nThere can be no doubt, from the prevalence of the plague, and its gradual extinction as noticed by M. Muret, that a diminution of mortality of the same kind, though not perhaps to the same extent, must have taken place in Switzerland; but if with a mortality, which could not have been less than 1 in 30 or 32, the proportion of births had been what it was when M. Muret wrote, it is quite evident that the country would have been rapidly depopulated. But as it is known, from the actual amount of births found in the registers, that this was not the case, it follows as a necessary consequence, that the greater mortality of former times was accompanied by a greater proportion of births. And this at once shows the error of attempting to determine the actual population, either of different countries, or of different periods in the same country, by the amount of the births; and the strong tendency of population to fill up all vacancies, and very rarely to be limited by any other cause than the difficulty of supporting a family.\n\nSwitzerland and the Pays de Vaud afford other most striking instances of the dependence of the births on the deaths; and the accounts of them are perhaps more to be depended upon, as they appear to contradict the preconceived opinions of the person who collected them.\n\nSpeaking of the want of fruitfulness in the Swiss women, M. Muret says, that Prussia, Brandenburgh, Sweden, France, and indeed every country, the registers of which he had seen, give a greater proportions of baptisms to the number of inhabitants than the Pays de Vaud, where this proportion is only as 1 to 36. He adds, that from calculations lately made in the Lyonois, it appeared that in Lyons itself the proportion of baptisms was 1 in 28, in the small towns 1 in 25, and in the villages 1 in 23 or 24. What a prodigious difference, he exclaims, between the Lyonois and the Pays de Vaud, where the most favourable proportion, and that only in two small parishes of extraordinary fecundity, is not above 1 in 26, and in many parishes it is considerably less than 1 in 40. The same difference, he remarks, takes place in the mean life. In the Lyonois it is little\n\n* M\u00e9moires, &c. par la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00c9conomique de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BERNE\">Berne</a>, 1766, pp. 15, et seq.\u2014Essay on Population, Vol. I. pp. 464, et seq. 5th edit.\nabove 25 years; while in the Pays de Vaud, the lowest mean life, and that only in a single marshy and unhealthy parish, is 29\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) years, and in many places it is above 45 years.\n\n\"But whence comes it (he says,) that the country where children escape the best from the dangers of infancy, and where the mean life, in whatever way the calculation is made, is higher than in any other, should be precisely that in which the fecundity is the smallest? How comes it again, that of all our parishes, the one which gives the mean life the highest, should also be the one where the tendency to increase is the smallest?\"\n\nTo resolve this question, M. Muret says, \"I will hazard a conjecture, which, however, I give only as such. Is it not that, in order to maintain in all places a proper equilibrium of population, God has wisely ordered things in such a manner as that the force of life in each country should be in the inverse ratio of its fecundity? In fact, experience verifies my conjecture. Leyzin (a village in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALPS\">Alps</a>), with a population of 400 persons, produces but a little above eight children a-year. The Pays de Vaud, in general, in proportion to the same number of inhabitants, produces 11, and the Lyonnais 16. But if it happen that at the age of 20 years, the 8, the 11, and the 16 are reduced to the same number, it will appear that the force of life gives in one place what fecundity does in another. And thus the most healthy countries, having less fecundity, will not over-populate themselves, and the unhealthy countries, by their extraordinary fecundity, will be able to sustain their population.\"\n\nThese facts and observations are full of the most important instruction, and strikingly illustrate the principle of population. The three gradations in the proportion of births which are here so distinctly presented to our view, may be considered as representing that variety in the proportion of births which is known to take place in different countries, and at different periods; and the practical question is, Whether, when this variety prevails without a proportionate difference in the rate of increase, which is almost universally the case, we are to suppose, with M. Muret, that a special <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">providence</a> is called into action to render women less prolific in healthy countries, and where improved habits of cleanliness have banished plagues and mortal epidemics; or to suppose, as experience warrants, that the smaller mortality of healthy and improved countries is balanced by the greater prevalence of the prudential restraint on marriage and population.\n\nThe subject is seen with particular clearness in Switzerland, on account of the population of some of the districts being stationary. The number of inhabitants on the Alps was supposed to have diminished. This was probably an error; but it is not improbable that they should have remained stationary, or nearly so. There is no land so little capable of providing for an increasing population as mountainous pastures. When they have been once fully stocked with cattle, little more can be done; and if there be neither emigration to take off the superabundant numbers, nor manufactures wherewith to purchase an additional quantity of food, the deaths must equal the births.\n\nThis was the case with the Alpine parish of Leyzin before referred to, where, for a period of 30 years, the mortality and the proportion of births almost accurately kept pace with each other; and where, in consequence, if the positive checks to population had been unusually small, the preventive checks must have been unusually great. In the parish of Leyzin, according to M. Muret, the probability of life was as high as 61 years;\u2020 but it is obvious that this extraordinary degree of healthiness could not possibly have taken place under the actual circumstances of the parish with respect to the means of subsistence, if it had not been accompanied by a proportionate action of the prudential restraint on marriage; and accordingly the subsisting marriages, being late and unprolific, yielded only one birth to every twelve; the births were only 1 in 49, and the number of persons below 16 was only \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the population.\n\nThere can be little doubt that in the present case the extreme healthiness of the people, arising from their situation and employments, had more effect in producing the prudential check to population, than the prudential check in producing the extreme healthiness; yet it is quite certain that they must constantly act and re-act upon each other, and that if, when the circumstances are such as to furnish no adequate means for the support of an increased population, and no relief in emigration, the prudential check does not prevail, no degree of natural healthiness could prevent an excessive mortality. Yet to occasion such a mortality, a much greater degree of poverty and misery must have taken place, than in districts less favourably circumstanced with regard to health; and we see at once the reason why, in countries of mountainous pasture, if there be no vent in emigration, the necessity of the prudential check should be more strongly forced on the attention of the inhabitants, and should, in consequence prevail to a greater degree.\n\nTaking countries in general, there will necessarily be differences as to natural healthiness in all the gradations, from the most marshy habitable situations to the most pure and salubrious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>. These differences will be further increased by the nature of the employments of the people, their habits of cleanliness, and their care in preventing the spread of epidemics. If in no country was there any difficulty in obtaining the means of subsistence, these different degrees of healthiness would make a great difference in the progress of population; and as there are many countries naturally more healthy than the United States of America, we should have instances of a more rapid increase than that which has there taken place. But as the actual progress of population is, with very few exceptions, determined by the\n\n---\n\n* M\u00e9moires, &c. par la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Econ. de Berne, 1766, pp. 48, et seq.\n\u2020 Ibid., Table V. p. 65 of the Tables.\nrelative difficulty of procuring the means of subsistence, and not by the relative natural powers of increase, it is found by experience that, except in extreme cases, the actual progress of population is little affected by unhealthiness or healthiness; but that these circumstances show themselves most powerfully in the character of the checks which keep the population down to the level of the means of subsistence, and occasion that sort of variety in the registers of different countries which was noticed in the instances mentioned by M. Muret.\n\nThus the population of two or three countries may be increasing at nearly the same rate, but one may be increasing chiefly from a great proportion of births, another from a small proportion of deaths, and a third from a more common proportion of both, in which three different cases the structure of the population and the registers of births, deaths, and marriages will be essentially different.\n\nThe rate at which the population of Sweden and Norway was increasing, at the time referred to by Mr Malthus, was not far from the same; but their registers differed in almost all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>. While the births in Sweden were 1 in 28 of the population, the births in Norway were only 1 in 34; while the marriages in Sweden were 1 in 112, in Norway they were only 1 in 130; and while the mortality in Sweden was 1 in 34\u00bd, in Norway it was only 1 in 48.* These different proportions of births, deaths, and marriages must essentially alter the whole structure of the population. The proportion of persons living at different ages, would be essentially different; the generations in one country would pass away sooner than the generations in the other; and Sweden might be said to increase principally from the large proportion of its births, and Norway, from the small proportion of its deaths, or its small mortality.\n\nA large proportion of births, when they have room to expand themselves, is the most powerful element of increase, and is absolutely necessary in order to effect the shortest period of doubling with which we are acquainted; but two countries may have nearly the same proportion of births, and yet the population of one be quite stationary, while the population of the other is increasing with the greatest known rapidity. The proportion of births in the Dutch villages first noticed, approaches towards that of the United States of America; yet in the one case the population did not increase at all, and in the other it has increased so fast, as to be taken as a specimen of the natural progress of population when interrupted by the fewest checks to which human society is subject. In this case, though the proportions of births and marriages to the whole population might not be very unlike, and possibly no very great difference might appear in the proportion of marriages to births, the other points in the registers would be in the opposite extremes. While the mortality in the Dutch villages was as high as 1 in 22, it would probably be 1 in 41, or less, in the United States.\u2014While the births and deaths in the Dutch villages were in the ratio of equality, in the United States they would be nearly in the proportion of 41 to 19.\n\nIn the same manner, two countries might have nearly the same mortality, and yet, in other points, be very different; and while one was increasing most rapidly, the other might be increasing very slowly. The proportion of deaths to the population in the Pays de Vaud, is not very essentially different from that of the United States, but the proportion of births, and the structure of the population present the most striking contrasts. The proportion of births for the whole of the Pays de Vaud was, according to M. Muret, 1 in 36, in many parishes it was considerably less than 1 in 40, and in one parish as low as 1 in 49; while, in the United States, it must be somewhere between 1 in 19 and 1 in 20.\u2014The structure of the population was different accordingly. In the whole of the Pays de Vaud, the proportion of the population under 16 was one-third, in many parts and in the whole of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CANTON\">Canton</a> of Berne one-fourth, while in the United States, it is as high as one-half.\n\nWe have seen, that, according to M. Muret, the variations probability of life, or the age to which half the born in the Age live, was, in the extraordinary parish of Leyzin, as to which half high as 61 years. On the same authority, it appears that in nine other parishes of the Alps it was as high as 47; in 41 parishes of the Pays de Vaud and trices <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JURA\">Jura</a> 42; in 12 corn parishes 40; in 18 parishes among the great vineyards 37, in one marshy parish 24.\u2020 From other authorities we learn, that in country villages and parishes, the age to which half of the born live is such, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJOR\">major</a> part will probably live to marry.\u2021 In the parish of Ackworth in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORKSHIRE\">Yorkshire</a>, it appears from an exact account kept by Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEE\">Lee</a> of the ages at which all died there for 20 years, from 1747 to 1767, that half the inhabitants live to the age of 46 (Price, Vol. II. p. 35, 7th edit.); and if the same account had been kept in many of the other healthy parishes in England, where the yearly mortality, instead of being 1 in 47 as in Ackworth, was 1 in 60, 1 in 66, and even 1 in 75 (Vol. II. p. 224), half of the born would be found to have lived to above 50 or 55. In the whole of Sweden, where the annual mortality, at the time referred to by Dr Price, was greater than 1 in 35, it appears from his tables, that half of the born must have lived to above 33 (Vol. II. p. 413, 7th edit.); and in Great Britain generally, where the mortality at present, after making due allowance for the omissions in the deaths, appears to be less than 1 in 51, it cannot be doubted that there is scarcely a village in the country tolerably well situated, where half of the born do not live till above 40. In towns the case is very different. According to\n\n* See Malthus On Population, Chapters i. and ii. of Book II.\n\u2020 Memoires, &c. par la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Economique de Berne, 1766, Table VIII. p. 92 of the Tables. As these calculations seem all to have been made from mortuary registers, they are all too low, except where the population was absolutely stationary.\n\u2021 Graunt's and Short's Observations, &c. referred to by Dr Price, Vol. II. pp. 41, 42, &c. 7th edit.\nthe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATA\">data</a> collected by Dr Price, one half of the born died in London under three years of age; in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIENNA\">Vienna</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STOCKHOLM\">Stockholm</a> under two; in Manchester under five; in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTHAMPTON\">Northampton</a> under ten (Vol. II. p. 33); and although in most of these towns, particularly those in England, a great improvement has taken place in their healthiness of late years, yet still they will always fall far short of the healthiness of country situations.\n\nThe age to which half the born live appears, therefore, to vary in different countries and places, and under different circumstances, in the very extraordinary degree of from 3 to 60.*\n\nThe mean age of death, or the expectation of life, must necessarily be more steady; yet it appears to vary from about 16 or 17 to 50.\n\nIn Stockholm, according to a table calculated by Dr Price, from the medium of three different enumerations in 1757, 1760, and 1763, the expectation of life for males at birth was 14.25, and for females 18.10.\u2020 Taken together, the expectation of life was a little above 16. In Vienna, as appears from another table, it was 16\u00bd.\u2021 While, according to M. Muret, at Leyzin, the expectation of life at birth was, about the same period, 50 years.\u00a7\n\nThe annual mortality, which is different, both from the age to which half of the born live, and the mean age of death, is found to vary in different places and countries, from about 1 in 19 to about 1 in 70. In Stockholm, the annual mortality was but 1 in 19 (Price's Observations, Vol. II. p. 136); and in some of the villages in England, even at the time that Dr Price wrote, it was as low as 1 in 70 and 1 in 75.\n\nThe proportion of births to the population appears to vary in different countries and under different circumstances, from about 1 in 17 to 1 in 49. In New Spain, according to Humboldt, it was 1 in 17. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-NEW_JERSEY\">New <a cla</a>ss=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERSEY\">Jersey</a>, according to the rate of increase determined by the census taken in 1788 and seven years afterwards, the proportion of births must have been about 1 in 18. (Price, Vol. II. p. 50.) At present, as far as can be collected from scattered facts and inferences, the proportion of births in the whole of the United States is about 1 to 19. In the table for Prussia and Lithuania given by Sussmilch, it appears, that after the great plague of 1709 and 1710, and omitting the extraordinary year immediately subsequent, the proportion of births in the five years, ending with 1716, was 1 in less than 17.|| While, according to M. Muret, in the parish of Leyzin, the proportion of births was only 1 in 49 of the population.\n\nThe number of subsisting marriages, which yields one annual birth, appears to vary from 12 to 4, and the two extreme cases occur in what may be called Population, the same country, and are both noticed by M. Muret; the one in the parish of Leyzin, which presents all the symptoms of the prudential check to population in the greatest excess, and where twelve subsisting marriages yield only one annual birth; and the other in the parish of St Cergue in the Jura, where marriage is encouraged by the habit of emigration, and four subsisting marriages are sufficient to yield one annual birth.\n\nThe proportion of the population under 16 years of age, to that above 16, seems to vary in different countries and places, and under different circumstances, from one-half to one-fourth. In the United States, it appears by the late census, that it is one-half; while in the canton of Berne it is not much more than one-fourth, and in the parish of Leyzin not more than one-fourth.\u00b6\n\nThe mortality under the age of 15 varies in different places and circumstances, from above two-thirds to one-fifth. It appears from a table of Dr Price, that in Stockholm, above two-thirds died under 15 (Vol. II. p. 418); while, according to M. Muret, the proportion of the deaths under the age of 15 was, in the whole of the Pays de Vaud, one-third, in many parishes of the Alps one-fourth, and the extraordinary parish of Leyzin only one-fifth.**\n\nUnder these very great variations in the registers of different countries and places, and in the structure of their population, it is obvious that we might fall into the grossest possible errors, by applying the registers of one country to the population of another. Even if we could find a country which was near to a just mean between these opposite extremes, and the registers of which were kept with the greatest accuracy, we could not apply such registers to any other country with a view to any important inferences; unless we knew that the two countries nearly resembled each other, not only in one or two particulars, but in all the main points relating to the structure of their population and the character of the prevailing checks to it.\n\nWhen attention was first directed to tables of mortality, with a view to Assurances on lives and survivorships, these tables were almost universally formed from the registers of towns and of the neighbouring villages influenced by them. Buffon, calculating the probability of life from the registers of three parishes in Paris, and twelve country parishes in the neighbourhood, collected by M. Dupr\u00e9 de St Maur, makes it appear, that half of the born died under eight years of age. The parishes in Paris seemed to be healthier than the villages in the neighbourhood, which was occasioned by the custom of sending the\n\n* This last number, stated by M. Muret for the parish of Leyzin on the Alps, is so very extraordinary, that possibly it may not be correct.\n\n\u2020 Observations on Reversionary Payments, Vol. II. p. 421, 7th edit.\n\n\u2021 Id.

Now, from the evidence of registers of this kind which have been carefully kept in country parishes, it appears that the age to which half of the born live is much nearer to 40 than to the age of puberty. Even in Sweden, where the general mortality is unquestionably very great, owing to the poverty of the labouring classes, and the diseases brought upon them by bad and insufficient food during seasons of scarcity, the age to which half of the born live is, as before stated, above 33;* in the whole of the Pays de Vaud it is 41; in many particular parishes 47, in a parish in England not so healthy as many others 47; and as the expectation of life appears, by the late returns from the parish registers of Great Britain, to be as high as in Switzerland, there is little reason to doubt, from the evidence of registers, that the age to which half of the born live in this country can fall but little short of what it is in the Pays de Vaud\u2014that is, it must be somewhere near 40. But it will hardly be contended that there is no premature mortality in Great Britain occasioned by the pressure of poverty, and the effect of large towns and unwholesome occupations. Consequently, unless we are prepared to say that agricultural employments, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIRY\">airy</a> and moderately sized towns, cleanliness, healthy occupations, and prudence, are against the constitution and course of nature, as applied to reasonable beings, we must acknowledge, that if the constitution and course of nature were carefully observed, and the admonitions which they give properly attended to, half of the born would, in healthy climates, live on an average to 45. Taking things, however, as they are, it is obvious that, according to the testimony of the best registers, more than half of the born might live to marry in most countries, even if the average age of marriage was so late as 30.\n\nThe immediate cause of the increase of population is the excess of the births above the deaths; and the rate of increase, or the period of doubling, depends upon the proportion which the excess of the births above the deaths bears to the population.\n\nThe excess of births is occasioned by, and proportioned to, three causes: 1st, The prolificness of the marriages. 2dly, The proportion of the born which lives to marry; and, 3dly, The earliness of these marriages compared with the expectation of life, or the shortness of a generation by marriage and birth, compared with the passing away of a generation by death.\n\nIn order that the full power of increase should be called into action, all these circumstances must be favourable. The marriages must be prolific, owing to their being contracted early; the proportion of the born living to marry must be great, owing both to the tendency to marriage, and the great proportion of births rising to the age of puberty; and the interval between the average age of marriage and the average age of death must be considerable, owing to the great healthiness of the country, and the expectation of life being high. Probably these three causes, each operating with the greatest known force, have never yet been found combined. Even in the United States, though the two first causes operate very powerfully, the expectation of life, and, consequently, the distance between the age of marriage and the average age of death is not so favourable as it might be. In general, however, the excess of births which each country can admit being very far short of the full power of increase, the causes above mentioned contribute to the required supply in very various proportions, according to the different circumstances and habits of each state.\n\nIt would be very desirable to know something of these proportions with a view to their influence on the happiness of society. Our main sources of information on this subject are registers of births, deaths, and marriages; but in order to draw just inferences from them, we must consider well what they imply. The following observations and rules modified from Mr Malthus's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> on the fruitfulness of marriages may be useful for this purpose.\n\nIf we suppose a country where the population is stationary, where there are no emigrations, immigrations, or illegitimate children, and where the registers are accurate, then the proportion of the annual births to the annual marriages will accurately express both the number of children born to each marriage, including second and third marriages, and also the\n\n---\n\n* We allude to the registers and tables referred to by Dr Price. Since his time the health of the country has increased, like most of the countries in Europe, and the proportions of both the births and deaths have decidedly diminished.\nproportion of the born which lives to marry once or oftener; while the annual mortality will accurately express the expectation of life.\n\nBut if the population be either increasing or decreasing, and the births, deaths, and marriages, increasing or decreasing in the same ratio, such a movement will necessarily disturb all the proportions; because the events which are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">contemporary</a> in the registers are not contemporary in the order of nature.\n\nIn the first place, the births of any year cannot, in the order of nature, have come from the contemporary marriages, but must have been derived principally from the marriages of preceding years.\n\nIf we were to cut off a period of 30 years in the registers of any country some time ago, and inquire what was the number of births which had been produced by all the marriages included in the period cut off, it is evident, that, with the marriages at the beginning of the period will be arranged a number of births proceeding from marriages anterior to it; and at the end a number of births produced by the marriages included in the period, will be found arranged with the marriages of a succeeding period. Now, if we could subtract the former number, and add the latter, we should obtain exactly all the births produced by the marriages of the period, and thus ascertain the real prolificness of marriages. If the population had been stationary, the number of births to be added would exactly equal the number to be subtracted, and the proportion of births to marriages, as found in the registers, would exactly represent the real prolificness of marriages. But if the population be increasing, the number to be added would be greater than the number to be subtracted, and of course the proportion of births to marriages, as found in the registers, would always be too small to represent the true prolificness of marriages. A contrary effect would take place in a decreasing population. The question, therefore, is, what we are to add, and what to subtract, when the births and deaths are not equal.\n\nThe average proportion of births to marriages in Europe, as taken from registers, is about 4 to 1. Let us suppose, for the sake of illustration, that each marriage yields four children, one every other year. In this case, wherever the period in the registers is begun, the marriages of the preceding eight years will only have produced half their births, and the other half will be arranged with the marriages within the period, and ought to be subtracted from them. In the same manner the marriages of the last eight years of the period will only have produced half their births, and the other half ought to be added. But half the births of any eight years may be considered as nearly equal to all the births of the succeeding 8\u00bd years. In instances of the most rapid increase it will rather exceed the births of the next 8\u00bd years, and in cases of slow increase, approach towards the births of the next 4 years. The mean, therefore, may be taken at 3\u00bd years. Consequently, if we subtract the births of the first 3\u00bd years, and add the births of the 3\u00bd years subsequent to the period, we shall have a number of births nearly equal to the number of births produced by all the marriages included in the period, and, of course, the prolificness of marriages. But, if the population of a country be increasing regularly, and the births, deaths, and marriages continue always to bear the same proportion to each other, and to the whole population, it is evident that all the births of any period will bear the same proportion to all the births of any other period of the same extent, taken a certain number of years later, as the births of any single year to the births of a single year, taken the same number of years later. And, consequently, to estimate the prolificness of marriages, we have only to compare the marriages of the present, or any other year, or the mean of five years, with the births of a subsequent year, or the mean of five years, taken 3\u00bd years later.\n\nIt has been supposed, in the present instance, that each marriage yields four births; but the proportion of births to marriages apparent in the registers of most of the countries of Europe, is 4 to 1, and, as the population of most of the countries of Europe is known to be increasing, the prolificness of marriages must be greater than 4. If, allowing for this circumstance, we take the distance of 4 years instead of 3\u00bd years, we shall still be sure of not erring in excess. And though undoubtedly the period which we take, whatever it may be, will not answer exactly in different countries, yet its application generally will not be so incorrect as we might at first imagine; because, in countries where the marriages are more prolific, the births generally follow at shorter intervals, and where they are less prolific at longer intervals; and, with different degrees of prolificness, the length of the period might still remain the same.\n\nProbably, however, the period here assumed, which is the one taken by Mr Malthus, is too short. If, as he says, there is reason to think, that, in almost all registers, the omissions in the births and deaths are greater than in the marriages, there ought to be a greater number of births to each marriage, in which case it would take a longer time to have them in; and if, further, it is probable that a birth every other year is too rapid a succession for those countries where the marriages are frequently late, it may be thought that the births at the distance of five years will more nearly represent the prolificness of marriages than at the distance of 4 years. But this matter must be left to the judgment of the reader.\n\nAt all events, it will follow, from what has been said, that the more rapid is the increase of population, the more will the real prolificness of marriages exceed the proportion of births to marriages in the registers.\n\nThe rule which has here been laid down attempts to estimate the prolificness of marriages, taken as they occur; but this prolificness should be carefully distinguished from the prolificness of first marriages, and of married women, and still more from the natural prolificness of women in general, taken at the most favourable age. It is probable that the natural prolificness of women is nearly the same in most parts of the world; but the prolificness of marriages is liable to be affected by a variety of circumstances peculiar to each country, and particularly by the number of second and third, and late marriages. In all countries the second and third marriages alone form\nPopulation, a most important consideration, and materially influence the average proportions. According to Sussmilch, in all Pomerania from 1748 to 1756, both included, the number of persons who married were 56,956, and of these 10,586 were widows and widowers (G\u00f6ttliche Ordnung, Vol. I. Tables, p. 98). According to Busching, in Prussia and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SILESIA\">Silesia</a> for the year 1781, out of 29,308 persons who married, 4841 were widows and widowers (Malthus, Vol. II. p. 140); and, consequently, the proportion of marriages will be given full one-sixth too much. In estimating the prolificness of married women, the number of illegitimate births would tend, though in a slight degree, to counterbalance the overplus of marriages; and as it is found that the number of widowers who marry again is greater than the number of widows, the whole of the correction should not, on this account, be applied; but, in estimating the proportion of the born which lives to marry, which is what we are now about to proceed to, the whole of this correction is always necessary.\n\nTo find the proportion of the born which lives to marry from registers, we must consider that the marriages of any year can never be contemporary with the births from which they have resulted, but must always be at such a distance from them, as is equal to the average age of marriage.\n\nIf the population be increasing, the marriages of the present year have resulted from a smaller number of births, than the births of the present year; and, of course, the marriages compared with the contemporary births, will always be too few to represent the proportion of the born which lives to marry, and the contrary will take place if the population be decreasing; and to find this proportion, after having first made the proper correction for second and third marriages, we must compare the marriages of any year with the births of a previous year at the distance of the average age of marriage.*\n\nThe third principal object which it is desirable to attain, and of which some estimate may be formed from registers, is the expectation of life. It has before been stated, that, in a country where the births and deaths are equal, the rate of the annual mortality will express the expectation of life, or the average age of death. But, if the population be increasing, the actual population of any one year will be greater than would belong to the contemporary deaths, supposing the births equal to the deaths, and less than would belong to the contemporary births, supposing the deaths equal to the births. Consequently, if we divide the actual population by the number of contemporary deaths in an increasing country, the result will be too high to express the average age of death belonging to any given number of births. If we divide the actual population by the number of births, the result will be too low to express this average, or, in other words, to express the expectation of life. And, in order to approximate to the true proportion, we are directed by Dr Price (Vol. II. p. 39, 7th ed.), in the absence of better data, to divide the actual population by a mean between the proportions of deaths and births. Consequently, when we know the proportion of births to deaths in any country, and the proportions which they usually bear to the whole population, we may form some estimate of the expectation of life or the average age of death.\n\nIf we attend to these observations in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> our inferences from registers, we shall generally be able to form an approximating estimate of the prolificness of marriages, the proportion of the born living to marry, and the expectation of life, in different countries and places, and under different circumstances; or if we cannot do this satisfactorily, owing to the varying rate of increase, and the inaccuracy of the registers, we shall at least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> ourselves against drawing incorrect inferences from them in their present state, and reconcile many of the difficulties with which they appear to be accompanied.\n\nThus to estimate the prolificness of marriages in England. The proportion of the marriages to the births, according to the parochial returns ending with 1820, was 100 to 369; adding \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) for the omissions in the births, or on the present occasion only \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), in order to make full allowance for illegitimate births, the proportion of marriages to births will be as 100 to 422. These births, at the rate at which the population was increasing in England and Wales from 1810 to 1820, would, in about 4\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) years, increase .07, which, added to 4.22, makes 4.51. Consequently, the prolificness of marriages, taken as they occur, and including second and third marriages, would be 4.51. If we wish to estimate the prolificness of married women, we must subtract from the marriages those which consist of widows who have married again. According to some tables of Sussmilch, this would be little less than one-sixth; according to others one-eighth. If we take one-seventh, and deduct it from the marriages, the proportion will be 1 to 5.26, that is, each married woman will have 5.26 births. But of these married women, some have married at above 45 years of age, and many more above 35, so that there can be little doubt that, if the births could be collected from all the marriages in which the age of the woman did not exceed 35, nor the age of the man 45, the births would appear to be nearly six; and this number would be still further increased if the average age of marriage for males was 22, and for females 20. These conclusions are fully confirmed by some accurate observations of M. Muret. At Vevey, where the proportion of marriages to births, in the registers, was as 10 to 39, he found that 375 mothers had had 2093 children born alive, by which it appears that each mother had produced 5.55 births. But these, M. Muret observes, were all mothers, which is not the case of all married women. Allowing, however, for the usual proportion of barren wives at Vevey, which was about 20 out of 478, it appears that the married women, one with another, must have had above 5.3\n\n* It is a shorter and more obvious process to compare the marriages at once with the births of the earlier period, than with the deaths, as Mr Malthus has done.\nYet this was in a town, where he intimates that the inhabitants do not enter into the marriage state at the time when nature calls them, nor when married always have as many children as they might have. It is evident, therefore, that the proportions of marriages to births, to be found in registers, require considerable and important corrections, in order to deduce from them just estimates of the prolificness of marriages, the prolificness of married women, and the prolificness of women marrying at the most favourable age. The instance here given is sufficient to illustrate the mode in which the rule should be applied.\n\nIf we wish to apply the rule for estimating the proportion of the born living to marry in England, we must first take the proportion of marriages to births in the registers. This proportion, as before stated, was, during the ten years ending with 1820, as 100 to 369; which, increased by one-sixth, the supposed omissions in the registers of births, will be as 100 to 430. But the marriages of the present year must have resulted, not from the births of the present year, but from the births at such an earlier period in the registers, as is equal to the average age of marriage. Suppose this age to be 28, then at the rate at which the population was increasing, the present marriages must have resulted from a number of births, equal to about two-thirds of the present number, so as to be to the present marriages in the proportion of 286 instead of 430 to 100. But of the 200 persons forming the 100 marriages, more than one-sixth have been married before. Deducting, therefore, one-sixth from the marriages, the proportion of the marriages to the births from which they have resulted, will be as 100 to 343; or out of 343 births, 200 have lived to be married once or oftener; from which it would appear, that on account of the late increase in the healthiness of the country, a greater proportion had lived to marry than when Mr Malthus last estimated it; which, together with a slight increase in the prolificness of marriages apparent in the latter registers, may account for the more rapid increase of the population from 1810 to 1820. It should be recollected, however, that as the rate of increase which prevailed from 1810 to 1820 had by no means prevailed during the whole 28 years, the births, from which 200 persons had lived to marry in 1820, were decidedly more than 343.\n\nIt will be observed how very important the correction for second and third marriages is. Supposing each marriage to yield four births, and the births and deaths to be equal, it might at first be thought necessary, that in order to keep up the population, half of the born should live to marry; but if, on account of the second and third marriages, we subtract one-sixth from the marriages, and then compare them with the births, the proportion will be as 5 to 24; and it will appear, that instead of one-half, it will only be necessary that out of 24 births 10 should live to marry. Upon the same principle, if the births were to the marriages as 4 to 1, and exactly half of the born lived to marry, it might be supposed at first that the population would be stationary; but if we subtract one-sixth from the marriages, and then compare them with the births, it will be obvious that, on the supposition of half the born living to marry, the births at the earlier period in the registers, at the distance of the age of marriage, must be to the present births as 5 to 6, which would imply a moderate rate of increase.\n\nTo estimate the proportion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> births living to marry, we must subtract full one-fifth from the marriages; and according to this correction, if each marriage yielded four births, it would only be necessary that two male children out of five should live to marry, in order to keep up the population. It is necessary also, in estimating the proportion of male births living to marry, to make allowance for the greater number of males born.\n\nThe foregoing illustrations and remarks show the error of supposing that a country must be in a precarious state when the proportion of births to marriages in the registers is less than 4 to 1. If, indeed, this observation were just, the population of many countries in Europe would be in a precarious state, as in many countries the proportion is less than this. But it has been shown in what manner this proportion in the registers should be corrected, in order to make it a just representation of the prolificness of marriages; and if a large part of the born live to marry, and the age of marriage be considerably earlier than the expectation of life, such a proportion in the registers is by no means inconsistent with a rapid increase of population.\n\nIn Russia, the proportion of births to marriages is less than 4 to 1. Yet on account of the large proportion of the born living to marry, the early age of marriage, and the high expectation of life, it is one of the countries in Europe which increases the fastest. In England, the population increases much more rapidly than in France; yet in England, the proportion of births to marriages in the registers, when allowance has been made for omissions, was, from 1800 to 1810, 4 to 1, while in France it was 4\u00bd to 1. (Malthus, Vol. II. p. 161, 5th edit.)\n\nIn England, indeed, for the ten years from 1810 to 1821, the proportion of births to marriages seems slightly to have exceeded the former proportion, being about 4.22 to 1; but this excess has been accompanied by such a rapidity of increase as would double the population in less than 46 years; and comparing this rapid rate of increase with the slow increase of France, where the births were to the marriages as 4\u00bd to 1, and in Sweden, when these proportions were as 4\u00bd to 1\u2014it follows that the two other causes of the excess of births above the deaths, besides the prolificness of marriages, must have very great power, and that the proportion of births to marriages, as found in registers, when taken alone, is a most uncertain criterion of increase.\n\nTo apply the rule for estimating the average age of death, or the expectation of life in England, we of Life must first ascertain from the registers the proportions which the births and deaths bear to the whole population. The annual average of the births for the ten years, from 1810 to 1821, was 325,506, of the deaths 200,999. Adding one-sixth to the births, and one-twelfth to the deaths, for the omission in the registers, the births will be 379,757, and the deaths 217,749. The population of England and\nWales, according to the last corrected accounts, was, in 1810, 10,502,500; in 1821, 12,218,500, the mean of which in 11,360,500. The average births and deaths, compared with the mean population, give\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{29.9} \\text{ as the proportion of the births, and } \\frac{1}{52.17} \\text{ as the proportion of the deaths; and, according to Dr Price, the mean between them, which, in this case, is } 41, \\text{ will give the expectation of life. This rule, however, is only a rough approximation, and, in the few cases, where sufficient data have been obtained in progressive countries for calculating the expectation of life more accurately, it has turned out to be much nearer to the annual mortality than to the mean here referred to. While, according to the more correct estimates before adverted to, the annual mortality might, with the same expectation of life, be in different countries 1 in 39.38, 1 in 41.97, or 1 in 41.09, according as the population was stationary, or progressive at various rates.}\n\nThis appears in the table which Dr Price himself calculated for Sweden (Vol. II. p. 410, 7th edit.), founded on data which he considered as quite satisfactory. It also appears in the table for Sweden and Finland, subsequently calculated by Mr Milne from similar data, in his Treatise on Annuities and Assurances. (Vol. II. p. 569.) And further, in a table for Sweden and Finland, published in this Supplement, under the head of Mortality. We have also lately seen a calculation by Mr Milne, by which it appears that the difference between the annual mortality and the expectation of life goes on increasing with the rate of the increase of the population to a certain point, but afterwards, owing to the increasing proportion of young children included in the population, diminishes; and is less when the population doubles in twenty-five years, than when it doubles in fifty years. Thus, on the three different suppositions of a stationary population, a population doubling in fifty years, and a population doubling in twenty-five years (all subjected to the same law of mortality as that which prevailed in Sweden and Finland during the five years ended with 1805)\u2014in the first case, both the expectation of life and the annual mortality would be 39.388, and, of course, the expectation of life would be the same in all the cases; but in the second case, the annual mortality would be 1 in 41.971; and in the third, 1 in 41.096. It would be difficult, however, or at least premature, without further data, to lay down a general rule, with a view to determine correctly the expectation of life at birth, in countries progressive at various rates. But from what has been stated, it may safely be concluded, that the expectation of life lies very much nearer the annual mortality, particularly in cases of very rapid increase, than to the mean proposed by Dr Price; and that both the expectation of life, and the age to which half of the born live, are, in most countries, and especially in England, at the present time, considerably higher than they have generally been estimated.\n\nIt may be remarked here, in reference to England Population during the ten years, from 1810 to 1821, that the omissions assumed in the births and deaths do not give such proportions as to make the increase of population, from the excess of births above the deaths, answer to the increase determined by the two censuses,\u2014an agreement which must necessarily take place if both the enumerations and the registers are accurate, and no external causes disturb the result. An addition of one-sixth to the births, and one-twelfth to the deaths, seemed to answer correctly for the interval from 1800 to 1810; but to produce the same coincidence under the more rapid increase of the subsequent ten years, either a greater allowance must be made for omissions in the births, or a less allowance for the omissions in the deaths. If we add one-fifth instead of one-sixth to the births, retaining one-twelfth for the deaths, the excess of births above deaths in the ten years will be 1,728,587; the excess according to the censuses being 1,716,000. If we add only one-thirtieth to the deaths, retaining one-sixth for the births, the excess will be 1,720,502, within 4502 of the excess, as shown by the censuses. Whereas, under the actual allowances which have been made for omissions, the excess will be only 1,620,800, leaving a difference of 95,200, on the wrong side. On account of the almost incredible healthiness, considering our great towns and manufactories, which would be implied by supposing the deaths to be only deficient one-thirtieth, an increased omission in the births might be thought more probable; but it is believed, that since 1812 the omissions in the births have been diminished rather than increased; and under this uncertainty it has been thought better to leave the question as it stands at present, rather than attempt to determine it on insufficient data. It should always be remembered, however, that if the increase of population by the enumerations, is different from the increase of population by the registers, one or the other must be incorrect.\n\nOn the supposition that the omissions in the deaths were only one-thirtieth, the average mortality, compared with the average population, would be 1 in 54.7; and the proportion of births, with the addition of one-sixth, being, as before stated, 1 in 29.9, the expectation of life, according to Dr Price's rule, would be 42.3. On the other supposition, of an omission of one-fifth of the births, and one-twelfth in the five deaths, the births would be 1 in 29, and the deaths 1 in 52.17, and the expectation of life would be 40.58.\n\nIt appears, then, that when the population of a country is progressive, it would be erroneous to estimate its healthiness by the proportion which the annual mortality bears to the whole population. Healthiness must be measured by the expectation of life; and if, with the same expectation of life, the annual mortality is affected by the rate of increase, it is obvious that the healthiness of different countries may be different, with the same rate of annual mortality.\n\n* Preliminary Observations to Population Abstracts, p. 32.\nBut while it is evidently necessary that we should be cautious in inferring, that a country is healthy just in proportion to the smallness of its annual mortality, we should be still more cautious in inferring that it is unhealthy at all the ages under puberty, on account of the number which appear to die in mortuary registers under that age. Here, as in the preceding case, but in a much greater degree, the excess of the births above the deaths has a powerful effect, but exactly in the opposite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>. When we compare the annual mortality of an increasing country with its actual population, we compare with it a number of deaths which may be said, properly speaking, to belong to an earlier and smaller number of births, and must necessarily represent the country as more healthy than it really is. On the other hand, when in a mortuary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGISTER\">register</a>, we compare the deaths under puberty with those above, if the population be increasing, we evidently compare the deaths belonging to a much greater number of births than those which have furnished the deaths above the age of puberty; and, consequently, these proportions must represent the country as much less healthy than it really is.\n\nAccording to the mortuary registers of Sweden for 21 years, from 1755 to 1776, more than half of the deaths were under 15, but it was by no means true that half of the born died under 15. In the tables of mortality for Sweden during the same period, constructed by Dr Price, it appears that half of the born lived to above 33 years.\n\nIn the same manner, in drawing inferences from an abstract of the mortuary registers of the principal cities in America, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALTIMORE\">Baltimore</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOSTON\">Boston</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NEW_YORK\">New <a c</a>lass=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a>, and Philadelphia, given by Dr Seybert (Statistical Annals, p. 48), we must take care not to conclude that the proportions of the deaths which take place under 20 years of age, represent the proportions of any given number of births in these cities which die under 20. As, on account of the excess of the births above the deaths, all the early ages of the population are more numerous in proportion than the other, there will necessarily be a greater proportion of the deaths at these ages, than would naturally belong to a given number of births, if each infant born were traced to the age of its death.\n\nIn the present case, the abstract is only for a year, and no safe conclusions, therefore, can be drawn from it; but so far as it goes, as even notwithstanding the increase of population, these mortuary registers show that considerably less than half of the deaths take place under twenty (on an average only about 45\u00bd per cent.), it would appear, that in the early ages of life, even the towns of America are more healthy than the whole of Sweden from 1755 to 1776. It should, however, be considered, that though the towns in America may be increasing fast by procreation, they are increasing still faster by the population influx of inhabitants from the country; and as these inhabitants generally come to the towns after the age of sixteen, this accession diminishes the proportion of persons in the earlier ages of life so much, that there is probably a larger proportion of mortality at these ages in the country than in the towns.\n\nOne of the most interesting and useful points of view in which registers can be considered, is in the proofs which they afford of the varying prevalence of the prudential check to marriage and population restraint in different countries and places. It has been not an uncommon opinion, and has even been strongly expressed of late years, although the subject has been much better understood than formerly, that the labouring classes of people, under the circumstances in which they are placed, cannot reasonably be expected to attend to prudential considerations in entering upon the marriage state. But that this opinion does them great injustice, is not only obvious to common observation, by which we can scarcely fail to see that numbers delay marriage beyond the period when the passions most strongly prompt to it, but is proved by the registers of different countries, which clearly show, either that a considerable number of persons of a marriageable age never marry, or that they marry comparatively late, and that their marriages are consequently less prolific than if they had married earlier. As the prudential restraint on marriage may show itself in either of these ways, it may prevail nearly in the same degree with a different proportion of marriages to the whole population. But on the supposition of the same natural prolificness in the women of most countries, the smallness of the proportion of births will generally indicate with tolerable correctness the degree in which the prudential check to population prevails, whether arising principally from late, and consequently unprolific marriages, or from a large proportion of the population dying unmarried.\n\nReferring then to the different proportions of births in different countries as the best criterion of the different degrees in which the prudential restraint on marriage operates, it will be recollected, that these proportions vary from about 1 in 36 to about 1 in 19, or even 17, in different countries, and in a much greater degree in different parishes or districts.\n\nA particular parish in the Alps has already been mentioned, where the births were only a forty-ninth part of the population; and it appears by the late returns of the parish registers of England and Wales, that the births in the county of Monmouth are only 1 in 47, and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-BRECON\">Brecon</a>, 1 in 53; which, after making ample allowance for omissions, would show the prevalence of the prudential restraint on marriage in a high degree.\n\nIf in any country all were to marry at 20 or 21,\n\n---\n\n* In the first case, the effect is, in a considerable degree, counteracted by the large proportion of children under four years old, which a rapid increase occasions. In the second case, the effect has no such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWBACK\">drawback</a>.\n\n\u2020 Price's Observations, Vol. II. p. 405. 7th edit.\n\n\u2021 Ibid. Table XLV. Vol. II. p. 413.\n\n\u00a7 Preliminary Observations, p. 27.\nPopulation\u2014the proportion of the births would probably be more than 1 in 19; and this result would be still more certain if the resources of the country could not support an accelerated rate of increase, than if the means of subsistence were in the greatest abundance, and the demand for labour as effectual as it has ever been in the United States. On the latter supposition, taking the births at one-nineteenth, and the expectation of life the same as it is in England, the effect would be to occasion a most rapid increase of population; and the period of doubling, instead of being about 46 or 48 years, would be less than in America. On the other hand, if the resources of the country could not support a more rapid increase than that which has taken place in England and Wales during the ten years previous to the census of 1821, the effect would be a great diminution in the expectation of life. If the births were 1 in 19 instead of 1 in nearly 30, the same rate of increase would take place as at present, if the annual mortality were increased to about 1 in 26\u00bd; and in that case, the expectation of life would be reduced in the proportion of from 41, or, as is more probable, from above 45 to less than 26.* This is the kind of effect which must inevitably follow the absence of the prudential check to marriage and population; and it cannot be doubted, that a considerable part of the premature mortality which is found to take place in all parts of the world is occasioned by it. The laws of nature, in application to man as a reasonable being, show no tendency to destroy half of the human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> under the age of puberty. This is only done in very particular situations, or when the constant admonitions which these laws give to mankind are obstinately neglected.\n\nIt has been said, that a tendency in mankind to increase at such a rate as would double the population in 25 years, and, if it had full scope, would fill the habitable globe with people in a comparatively short period, cannot be the law of nature; as the very different rate of increase which is actually found to take place, must imply such an excessive degree of mortality and destruction of life as to be quite irreconcilable with actual facts and appearances. But the peculiar advantage of a law of increase in a geometrical progression is, that, though its power be absolutely immense, if it be left unchecked, yet, when this becomes impossible, it may be restrained by a comparatively moderate force. It can never, of course, happen, that any considerable part of that prodigious increase which might be produced by an uninterrupted geometrical progression should exist, and then be destroyed. The laws of nature which make food necessary to the life of man, as well as of plants and animals, prevent the continued existence of an excess which cannot be supported, and thus either discourage the production of such an excess, or destroy it in the bud, in such a way as to make it scarcely perceptible to a careless observer. It has been seen, that, in some countries of Europe, where the actual progress of the population is slower than in many others, as in Switzerland and Norway, for instance, the mortality is considerably less. Here, then, the necessity of a greater check to the natural progress of population produces no increase of mortality. And it appears, farther, that even the degree of mortality which in each year would be sufficient to destroy that excess of births which would naturally be produced if all married young, and all could be supported, might take place, and often does take place in particular situations, and yet is very little noticed. About the middle of last century, the mortality in Stockholm and London was about 1 in 19, and 1 in 20. This is a degree of mortality which would probably keep the births on a level with the deaths, even though all married at twenty. And yet numbers resorted both to Stockholm and London from choice; the greater part probably not aware that, by so doing, they would shorten their own lives and those of their children; and the rest thinking that the difference was not worth attending to, or was at least balanced by the advantages of society and employment which the town presented. There is nothing, therefore, in the actual state of the mortality observed to take place in different countries and situations, which, in the slightest degree, contradicts the supposition of a natural tendency to increase quite as great as that which has been stated.\n\nIt has been further remarked, that as, in point of fact, it very rarely happens that mankind continue to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> increase in a geometrical progression of any kind, and only in a single instance in such a one as to double the population in 25 years, it is useless and absurd to lay any stress upon tendencies which never for any length of time together produce their natural effects. But it might really as well be said, that we are not to estimate the natural rate of increase in wheat or sheep; as it is quite certain that their natural tendency to increase has never practically continued to develope itself for so long a time together, as that of mankind. Both as a physical, and even economical question, it is curious and desirable to know the natural law of increase which prevails among the most important plants and animals. In the same view, it must be still more interesting to know the natural law of increase with respect to man. It may be said indeed, with truth, that the actual appearances all around us,\u2014the varying rate of increase in different countries,\u2014its very slow progress, or stationary state, in some, and its very rapid progress in others,\u2014must be a mass of anomalies, and quite contrary to the analogies of all the rest of animated nature; if the natural tendency of mankind to increase be not, at the least, as great as that which is developed under the most favourable circum-\n\n* If, as it has appeared, the expectation of life, though by no means the same, does not differ very much from the annual mortality, and the annual mortality in this country during the ten years from 1810 to 1820, after every abatement, appears to be not more than 1 in 51, the expectation of life cannot be less than 45, and is probably greater.\nstances, while in all others it is kept down by the varying difficulties which the state of the soil, and other obstacles oppose to it. But the question, as it applies to man, assumes at once a tenfold importance, in reference to the moral and political effects which must result from those checks to increase, the existence and operation of which, in some form or other, no human exertions can by possibility prevent. A field is here opened for the most interesting inquiries which can engage the friends of human happiness.\n\nBut, as a preliminary to these inquiries, it is obvious that we must know the degree of force to be overcome, and the varying character of the checks which, in the different countries of the world, are practically found to overcome it; and, for this purpose, the first step must be an endeavour to ascertain the natural law of population, or the rate at which mankind would increase under the fewest known obstacles. Nor can this tendency to increase ever safely be lost sight of in the subsequent inquiries, which have for their object the improvement of the moral condition of man in society.\n\nThe existence of a tendency in mankind to increase, if unchecked, beyond the possibility of an adequate supply of food in a limited territory, must at once determine the question as to the natural right of the poor to full support in a state of society where the law of property is recognized. The question, therefore, resolves itself chiefly into a question relating to the necessity of those laws which establish and protect private property. It has been usual to consider the right of the strongest as the law of nature among mankind as well as among <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUTES\">brutes</a>; yet, in so doing, we at once give up the peculiar and distinctive superiority of man as a reasonable being, and class him with the beasts of the field. In the same language it may be said that the cultivation of the earth is not natural to man. It certainly is not to man, considered merely as an animal without reason. But to a reasonable being, able to look forward to consequences, the laws of nature dictate the cultivation of the earth, both as the means of affording better support to the individual, and of increasing the supplies required for increasing numbers; the dictates of those laws of nature being thus evidently calculated to promote the general good, and increase the mass of human happiness. It is precisely in the same way, and in order to attain the same object, that the laws of nature dictate to man the establishment of property and the absolute necessity of some power in the society capable of protecting it. So strongly have the laws of nature spoken this language to mankind, and so fully has the force of it been felt, that nothing seems to be thought so absolutely intolerable to reasonable beings as the prevalence in the same society of the right of the strongest; and the history of all ages shows that if men see no other way of putting an end to it, than by establishing arbitrary power in an individual; there is scarcely any degree of tyranny, oppression, and cruelty which they will not submit to from some single person and his satellites, rather than be at the mercy of the first stronger man who may wish to possess himself of the fruit of their labour. The consequence of this universal and deeply-seated feeling, inevitably produced by the laws of Population, nature, as applied to reasonable beings, is that the almost certain consequence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANARCHY\">anarchy</a> is despotism.\n\nAllowing, then, distinctly, that the right of property is the creature of positive law, yet this law is so early and so imperiously forced on the attention of mankind, that if it cannot be called a natural law, it must be considered as the most natural as well as the most necessary of all positive laws; and the foundation of this pre-eminence is, its obvious tendency to promote the general good, and the obvious tendency of the absence of it to degrade mankind to the rank of brutes.\n\nAs property is the result of positive law, and the ground on which the law which establishes it rests, is the promotion of the public good and the increase of human happiness, it follows, that it may be modified by the same authority by which it was enacted, with a view to the more complete attainment of the objects which it has in view. It may be said, indeed, that every tax for the use of the government, and every country or parish rate is a modification of this kind. But there is no modification of the law of property having still for its object the increase of human happiness, which must not be defeated by the concession of a right of full support to all that might be born. It may be safely said, therefore, that the concession of such a right, and a right of property are absolutely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a>, and cannot exist together.\n\nTo what extent assistance may be given even by law to the poorer classes of society when in distress, without defeating the great object of the law of property, is essentially a different question. It depends mainly upon the feelings and habits of the labouring classes of society, and can only be determined by experience. If it be generally considered as so discreditable to receive parochial relief, that great exertions are made to avoid it, and few or none marry with a certain prospect of being obliged to have recourse to it, there is no doubt that those who were really in distress might be adequately assisted, with little danger of a constantly increasing proportion of paupers; and in that case a great good would be attained without any proportionate evil to counterbalance it. But if, from the numbers of the dependent poor, the discredit of receiving relief is so diminished as to be practically disregarded, so that many marry with the almost certain prospect of becoming paupers, and the proportion of their numbers to the whole population is in consequence continually increasing; it is certain that the partial good attained must be much more than counterbalanced by the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DETERIORATION\">deterioration</a> in the condition of the great mass of the society, and the prospect of its daily growing worse: so that, though from the inadequate relief which is in many cases granted, the manner in which it is conceded, and other counteracting causes, the operation of poor-law such as they exist in England might be very different from the effects of a full concession of the right, and a complete fulfilment of the duties resulting from it; yet such a state of things ought to give the most serious alarm to every friend to the happiness of society, and every effort consistent with justice and humanity ought to be made to remedy it.\nBut whatever steps may be taken on this subject, it will be allowed, that with any prospect of legislating for the poor with success, it is necessary to be fully aware of the natural tendency of the labouring classes of society to increase beyond the demand for their labour, or the means of their adequate support, and the effect of this tendency to throw the greatest difficulties in the way of permanently improving their condition.\n\nIt would lead far beyond the limits which must be prescribed to this article, to notice all the various objections which have been made by different writers to the principles which have been here explained. Those which contain in them the slightest degree of plausibility have been answered by Mr Malthus in various parts of the late editions of his work, and particularly in the appendix to the fifth edition, to which we refer the reader. We will only, therefore, further notice the objection which has been made by some persons on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> grounds; for, as it is certainly of great importance that the answer which has been given to it should be kept in mind, we cannot refuse a place to a condensed statement of it at the end of this article.\n\nIt has been thought that a tendency in mankind to increase, beyond the greatest possible increase of food which could be produced in a limited space, impeaches the goodness of the Deity, and is inconsistent with the letter and spirit of the Scriptures. If this objection were well founded, it would certainly be the most serious one which has been brought forwards; but the answer to it appears to be quite satisfactory, and it may be compressed into a very small compass.\n\nFirst, It appears that the evils arising from the principle of population are exactly of the same kind as the evils arising from the excessive or irregular gratification of the human passions in general, and may equally be avoided by moral restraint. Consequently there can be no more reason to conclude, from the existence of these evils, that the principle of increase is too strong, than to conclude, from the existence of the vices arising from the human passions, that these passions are all too strong, and require diminution or extinction, instead of regulation and direction.\n\nSecondly, It is almost universally acknowledged, that both the letter and spirit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVELATION\">revelation</a> represent this world as a state of moral discipline and probation. But a state of moral discipline and probation cannot be a state of unmixed happiness, as it necessarily implies difficulties to be overcome, and temptations to be resisted. Now, in the whole range of the laws of nature, not one can be pointed out which so especially accords with this scriptural view of the state of man on earth; as it gives rise to a greater variety of situations and exertions than any other, and marks, in a more general and stronger manner, and nationally, as well as individually, the different effects of virtue and vice, of the proper government of the passions, and the culpable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a> of them. It follows, then, that the principle of population, instead of being inconsistent with Revelation, must be considered as affording strong additional proofs of its truth.\n\nLastly, It will be acknowledged, that in a state of probation, those laws seem best to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCORD\">accord</a> with the views of a benevolent Creator, which, while they furnish the difficulties and temptations which form the essence of such a state, are of such a nature as to reward those who overcome them with happiness in this life as well as in the next. But the law of population answers particularly to this description. Each individual has the power of avoiding the evil consequences to himself and society resulting from it, by the practice of a virtue dictated to him by the light of nature, and sanctioned by revealed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>. And, as there can be no question that this virtue tends greatly to improve the condition, and increase the comforts both of the individuals who practise it, and through them of the whole society, the ways of God to man with regard to this great law are completely vindicated.\n\nSubjoined are two Tables which may assist the reader in calculating the rate of increase in different countries, under different circumstances, and from different data. The first is the table calculated by Euler, and printed in Mr Malthus's work, at the end of his chapter on the Fruitfulness of Marriage; and the second has been calculated by Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIDGE\">Bridge</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>, well known as an able mathematician, and most useful elementary writer.\n\nThe first is to be used when it is wished to estimate the rate of increase by the proportions of the births to the deaths, and of these to the whole population. The yearly increase of people, independently of immigration, is the yearly excess of the births above the deaths, and the yearly rate of increase is measured by the proportion which this excess bears to the whole population. The fraction expressing the deaths must therefore be subtracted from the fraction expressing the births; and the remainder will be the fraction expressing the yearly rate of increase; opposite to which will be found the number of years in which the population will double itself, supposing the yearly rate of increase to continue the same for a sufficient length of time.\n\nThe second table is to be used when it is wished to know the period of doubling, resulting from a given per centage increase in ten years, determined by enumeration. An estimate of population from births and deaths is always liable to much uncertainty on account of the varying proportions which they bear to the population. The only remedy for this uncertainty is a census; and as the useful custom of taking a census of the population every ten years has latterly prevailed in some countries, the second table is constructed to show the period of doubling, or general rate of increase, which results from any given per centage increase in ten years. The first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> represents the per centage increase in ten years determined by two enumerations; and the second column the number of years in which the population will double itself, supposing it to proceed at the same rate.\n### Table I\n\n| Proportion of Births above Deaths | Periods of Doubling in Years and Ten Thousandths Parts

25th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> 1759, was the son of Mr Huggin Porson, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> clerk of East Ruston, near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">North</a> Walsham, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORFOLK\">Norfolk</a>.\n\nHis father taught him, in his childhood, to practise all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> rules of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARITHMETIC\">arithmetic</a> by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> only; and, before he was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> years old, he had learned to extract the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUBE\">cube</a> root in this manner. He employed, at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, for teaching him to read and write, the method which has since been generally introduced in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a> of mutual instruction, making him draw the letters with chalk <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>: and the neatness and accuracy of his handwriting, for which he was distinguished through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, may be considered as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> ample testimony to his father's ingenuity and success.\n\nAt the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of nine he was sent to a village school, kept by a Mr Summers; but his father still made him repeat by heart in the evening the whole of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LESSONS\">lessons</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, and there seems to be sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> for considering this practice of exercising the memory continually, in very early life, as the best, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> not the only method of cultivating, if not of producing great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a>: for though a strong memory by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> means constitutes talent, yet its possession is almost a necessary condition for the successful exertion of talent in general, and, indeed, it is very possible that the other faculties of the mind may be strengthened by the early cultivation of this one.\n\nIt is remarkable that Wallis, who was as deservedly celebrated in his day as Porson, for his unerring sagacity, had also a singular facility of retaining numbers and calculations in his memory, but without having taken any particular pains to acquire the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a>. Mr Hewitt, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VICAR\">vicar</a> of the parish of East Ruston, hearing of young Porson's uncommon capacity, undertook to instruct both him and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> Thomas in classical literature; and when he was about fifteen, Mr Norris, a wealthy and respectable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> of the neighbourhood, having ascertained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of the reports that he heard of him, resolved to be at the expense of sending him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ETON\">Eton</a>.\n\nWithout this assistance, it would have been impossible for Porson to have acquired great excellence in any intellectual pursuit; for his father's situation in life was not such as to exempt his son even from the subordinate occupations of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. He went out gleaning, in the autumn, with a Horace in his pocket; and he had learned by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> to appreciate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> labours of Penelope, before he was much acquainted with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> and wanderings of Ulysses.\n\nAt Eton, his talents procured him the friendship and admiration of the seniors among his schoolfellows, and, upon the unfortunate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of his first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a>, Mr Norris, he found a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of liberal contributors, who stepped forward to supply the deficiency; but by far the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> of them was Sir George Baker, then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">President</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">College</a> of Physicians; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> as much distinguished by his own classical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> and acquirements, as by his laudable disposition to cherish learning in others. He received the boy into his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> for a vacation, and undertook, at the request of a relation of Mr Norris, the disagreeable task of receiving, in small sums, as much as was sufficient to purchase an income of L. 80 a year, for a few years, in the short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ANNUITIES\">annuities</a>, which served, with great economy, to enable him to remain at Eton. This favour appears to have been too great to be properly acknowledged, or perhaps even duly appreciated, by its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>, who only after many years paid Sir George the tardy compliment of a dedication, not, however, of an edition, but of a handsome <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> of a single play of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EURIPIDES\">Euripides</a>. In his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, Porson learned little at Eton besides the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of syllables, being able to repeat by heart before he went there the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the authors that he had to read; that is, almost the whole of Horace and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGIL\">Virgil</a>, and the Iliad, and many parts of Cicero, Livy, and the Odyssey. A story is accordingly told of his book having been changed by one of his schoolfellows in joke, when he was going up to a lesson in Horace, and of his having read and translated what was required of him, without at all betraying the change to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>. At the same time, the emulation of a public school must have been a great advantage to him, as affording him a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a> for exertion in his exercises, whether they were to be called his own, or to be written for other boys. It was a copy of Toup's Longinus, presented to him as a reward for a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a>, that first gave him a decided inclination for the pursuit of critical researches; but he always considered Bentley and Dawes as his great masters in criticism.\n\nIn 1777 he was sent to Trinity College, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>, and at first he began to apply more particularly to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a>, which had been the favourite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of his boyhood, and in which, as he himself remarked, his proficiency first brought him into a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of public notice. However, soon diverted from the pursuit, although he attained a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> among the senior optimes of his year. But he was in fact more calculated for classical than for mathematical excellence; his memory would have been in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> thrown away, if he had been employed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> calculations; and his inventive powers do not appear to have been at all of the same class with his retentive faculties; although certainly in the mechanical pursuit of the fashionable methods of modern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a>, which are intended, like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEAM\">steam</a> engines, to overcome all difficulties by the inanimate forces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a> and perseverance, he was capable of filling as distinguished a place as any living algebraist. The classical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIZE\">prize</a> medal, and the university scholarship, he obtained without difficulty, as matters of course. The exercise, which he exhibited upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> for the scholarship, is the well known translation of an epitaph into Greek iambics; which, although not free from some inaccuracies in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of the tenses, is still a very remarkable production, when it is considered as having been completed in less than an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>, with the help of Morrell's Thesaurus only, and never afterwards corrected.\n\nHe obtained a fellowship of Trinity College in 1781, and took his degree of Master of Arts in 1785; but not thinking it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to subscribe the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">Articles</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">Church</a> of England, he could not enter into orders, and he was therefore unavoidably de-\nprived of his fellowship in 1791, having no dependence left for his subsistence through life, but his abilities and acquirements. His friends, however, did not abandon him on this urgent occasion, and in order to keep him out of actual want, a private subscription was set on foot, to which Mr Cracherode was one of the principal contributors, and by which enough was raised to purchase him an annuity of about \u00a3100 a year for life. A small addition was made to his income, about two years after, by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a> to the Greek Professorship at Cambridge, with a salary of only \u00a340 a year. The situation, however, gave him the option of at least doubling his whole receipts, by the delivery of an annual course of lectures in the university; and it was supposed that he would have made this exertion, if he had not been discouraged by the difficulty of obtaining rooms in his college, where it would have been his wish to reside.\n\nHe married, in 1795, Mrs Lunan, a sister of the late Mr Perry, well known as the editor of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">Morning</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHRONICLE\">Chronicle</a>, but he had the misfortune to lose his wife two years afterwards. Mr Perry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to be his greatest friend through life, and was so far his best benefactor, as he knew how to oblige him essentially, without the appearance of doing him a favour. Porson had sometimes chambers in the Temple, and sometimes he lodged at the Morning Chronicle office; frequently also he was a visitor at Mr Perry's house at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MERTON\">Merton</a>, where he had the misfortune to leave several of his books, at the time of a fire, which destroyed them all, and among them some letters of Rhunkenius, with whom he had begun a correspondence in 1783, and who had communicated to him some valuable fragments of \u00c6schylus, besides his manuscript copy of the lexicon of Photius, which had cost him ten months labour. He used indeed to say that this fire had destroyed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> of twenty years of his life; but he had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> to complete a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> copy of the Photius, which is now in the library of Trinity College. His fondness for the mechanical employment of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEN\">pen</a> has been regretted by some of his biographers, as having tempted him to waste much of his most valuable time on a trifling amusement: but in fact, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> Greek was fully as much calculated for expedition as for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>; and those, who have not been in the habit of correcting mutilated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUSCRIPTS\">manuscripts</a>, can form no estimate of the immense advantage that is obtained, by the complete sifting of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a>, which the mind involuntarily performs, while the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> is occupied in tracing it: so that, if the correction of Photius was really worth the labour of two years of Porson's life, it would have been scarcely possible to employ the greater part of those years more advantageously, than by copying him twice over. Mr Weston, in speaking of \"his matchless penmanship,\" has observed, not very intelligibly, that \"here, indeed, he thought himself surpassed by\" another person \"not in the stroke, but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SWEEP\">sweep</a>, of his letters:\" what Porson really said on this subject was, that, with respect to \"command of hand,\" that person had the advantage, but he preferred the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> on which his own hand was formed.\n\nHis writing was, in fact, more like that of a scholar, while the method explained in Mr Hodgkin's Calligraphy exhibits more the appearance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of a writing master; holding, however, a middle place between the neatness of Porson, and the wonderful accuracy of the country schoolmaster who made the fac <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIMILE\">simile</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PINDAR\">Pindar</a> in the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSEUM\">Museum</a>.\n\nUpon the establishment of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">Institution</a>, his friends obtained for him the very desirable appointment of principal librarian, with a salary of \u00a3200 a year, and apartments in the house of the Institution, which was then in the Old Jewry; but although the arrangement was highly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> to all parties, the librarianship was little more than a sinecure. Porson was, however, in the habit of attending in his place when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> room was open, and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a>, very readily, all the literary information that was required, by those who consulted him respecting the object of their researches. Had the inhabitants of Finsbury <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">Square</a> and its neighbourhood been more disposed to classical studies, and had the librarian of the Institution survived, to witness its completion and prosperity, his sphere of utility would, without doubt, have been greatly extended.\n\nBut it must ever be lamented that Porson's habits of life had unfortunately been such as to lay a foundation for a multitude of diseases; he suffered much from asthma throughout the year 1808; his memory began to fail him a little; and in the autumn he had some symptoms of intermittent fever. On Monday the 19th of September he had an apoplectic attack in the street, and he was carried to a neighbouring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> house in a state of insensibility: the next day an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ADVERTISEMENT\">advertisement</a> appeared in one of the papers, relating the accident, and describing some manuscripts which were found in his pocket, consisting of Greek fragments and algebraical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a>: his friends at the London Institution immediately went in quest of him: he was afterwards well enough to appear in the library, and to receive a visit there from Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADAM\">Adam</a> Clarke: but his speech was impaired, and his faculties evidently imperfect; he survived only through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>, and died in his 49th year, on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUNDAY\">Sunday</a> the 25th of September 1808, at midnight.\n\nHe was buried at Cambridge, in Trinity College Chapel, near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a> of Bentley, and the monument of Newton. He founded by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> an annual prize, to be given to the best Greek translation from an English dramatic author: and several specimens of the successful pieces have been published from time to time in the Classical Journal. His books were sold by auction, and many of them found purchasers at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> prices, especially such as were enriched with any of his manuscript notes in their margins; but more than two hundred of these, which appeared to be the most valuable, were withheld from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a>, and were afterwards purchased, together with the whole of his manuscript papers, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> of Trinity College, for the sum of a thousand guineas. He left a sister, married to Siday Hawes, Esq. of Coltishall, Norfolk. His brother Thomas kept a boarding-school at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FAKENHAM\">Fakenham</a>, and died, without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a>, in 1792: his\nsecond brother Henry was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">farmer</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSEX\">Essex</a>, and died young, leaving three children. His father had lived to 74, his mother to 57.\n\nThe principal works of Porson are his *Letters to Travis*, his four plays of Euripides with their prefaces, and the manuscript copy of Photius; the rest, though somewhat voluminous, are chiefly miscellaneous annotations on detached passages of a multitude of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> authors. We find nothing in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a>, or of the discovery of general laws, except some canons, which he has laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>, chiefly as having been used by the Greek tragedians in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of their verses. These are chiefly contained in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-PREFACE\">preface</a> to the *Heuba*, together with its supplement. 1. The first is, that when a tragic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IAMBIC\">iambic</a> ends with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRISYLLABLE\">trisyllable</a>, or a cretic, this word must be preceded either by a short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYLLABLE\">syllable</a>, or by a monosyllable. For example, an ancient tragedian would not have written the line \"\u0395\u1f56\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f10\u03bd \u03bc\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd\" \u1f10\u03be \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03c5\u03c0\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f14\u03bc\u03c6\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2; though it might have been unexceptionable in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMEDY\">comedy</a>. It seems to have been about the year 1790 that Porson first made this observation; he certainly did not attend to it in his own serious translation of the *Epitaph* on *Aelius*: but it was mentioned, in 1791, by one of Porson's intimate friends, in a moment of conviviality, while he was somewhat characteristically attempting to fill his glass out of an empty bottle; and the author of this article observed in answer, that it would certainly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> better, on such an occasion as then occurred, to say, \u03a0\u1fb6\u03bd \u1f10\u03ba\u03c0\u03af\u03c0\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u1f45\u03bb\u03b7 \u1f10\u03bd \u1f11\u03c4\u1fc7 \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03b2\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9, than \u1f41 \u03bb\u03ac\u03b2\u03bf\u03bd\u03a4\u0391\u0399 \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03b2\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9. 2. The second canon is, that an anapaest is only admissible in a tragic iambic, as constituting the first foot, except in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> of proper names: this indeed had been cursorily hinted by Dawes. 3. The same critic had also remarked, that the Attic poets never lengthen a short vowel before a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MUTE\">mute</a> or aspirate, followed by a liquid, or a middle consonant followed by \u03b5; and Porson more amply confirmed the observation as very generally, though not universally correct. On the other hand, Dawes had cursorily observed that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOMER\">Homer</a>, and the other ancient epic poets, generally lengthened the vowel in such cases, and Porson's great rival, Hermann, has more fully established this distinction, as affording a good criterion of antiquity. 4. There are also some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> remarks of Porson on the caesura, in iambs, and trochaics, and anapaests: he showed that the scenic poets do not elide the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> iota, and that the tragedians do not employ the preposition \u1f10\u03bd before a vowel; and some other general laws, of greater importance than these, may probably be found in some of his publications, which it will now be necessary to enumerate in the order of time.\n\n1. His first attempts, as an author, consisted of some anonymous articles in Dr Maty's *Review*, beginning with a part of Sch\u00fctz's *Eschylus*, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 1783, *Tracts* ii.; *Brunck's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOPHANES\">Aristophanes</a>*, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> 1783, *Tracts* iii.; *Mus. Crit.* II. 113; written in a day. In Latin, by Sch\u00e4fer, *Class. Journ.* V. 136. Weston's *Hermesianax*, April 1784, *Tracts* iv.; Huntingford's *Apology for his Menostrophics*, August 1784, *Tracts* v.; *Account of the Learned Pig*, April 1785, *Tracts* vi.; *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">Note</a>, with letters of Le Clerc and Bentley*, April 1786, *Tracts* vii.\n\n2. He added some *Notes* to an edition of Xenophon's *Anabasis*, published by Nicholson, at Cambridge, 4to and 8vo. 1786. They are addressed *Lectori si quis erit*.\n\n3. Three *Panegyrical Epistles* to Sir John Hawkins, Gent. Mag., Aug. Sept. Oct. 1787. *Tracts* ix.\n\n4. *Notes on Toupil Emendationes in Suidam*. 8vo. Oxf. 1790. Written in 1787.\n\n5. *Letters on the Three Witnesses*, Gent. Mag., Oct. Dec. 1788. Feb. April, May, June, Aug. 1789. Feb. 1790. The last reprinted, *Tracts* xix.; most of the others in the collection of *Letters to Mr Archdeacon Travis*, in answer to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of the *Three Heavenly Witnesses*, 8vo. Lond. 1790. These letters are generally considered, by critics of all parties, as finally decisive of a question, which had often been agitated before, but never so learnedly argued, nor so satisfactorily discussed in all its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARINGS\">bearings</a>.\n\n6. In the *Monthly Review*, Robertson's *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> on the Parian Chronicle*, Jan. 1789, *Tracts* xiii.; satisfactorily answering the principal part of the objections alleged against the authenticity of that monument. Edwards's edition of the work attributed to Plutarch, on *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">Education</a>*, July 1793, *Tracts* xxii.; Payne <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNIGHT\">Knight</a>'s *Greek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-ALPHABET\">Alphabet</a>*, Jan. 1794, *Tracts* xxiii.; Pybus's *Sovereign*, Dec. 1800; an article affording a good specimen of his talent for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a>.\n\n7. He is supposed to have written some *Remarks* on an *Essay upon the Transfiguration*, but never expressly acknowledged them. *Tracts* xv.\n\n8. He added a few short *Notes* to the London edition of Heyne's Virgil, 8vo. 1793; for which he made an agreement with the bookseller to correct the press: but he complained that his corrections were disregarded; and in fact several hundred errors, of no great importance, were suffered to disfigure it.\n\n9. He corrected the Greek text of *\u00c6schylus* for the Glasgow editions, the folio of 1795, and the two volumes octavo, printed in 1794, but only published London, 1806. The folio is said to have appeared surreptitiously. There are more than two hundred original corrections, and a further number of passages pointed out as corrupt.\n\n10. In the *Morning Chronicle* he published, at different times, a variety of spirited articles of a temporary nature. One of the most amusing was the *Nursery Song* in Greek iambs, 13th April 1796; called *A Fragment of Sophocles*, and signed \"S. England,\" in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIDICULE\">ridicule</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>'s pretended discoveries.\n\n11. *Imitations of Horace*. Spirit of the Public Journals, 1797. *Class. Journ.* IV. 97.\n\n12. The first four plays of Euripides appeared separately at different periods. The *Heuba*, 8vo. London, 1797; Cambridge, 1802, with a Supplement and additional notes; which were also published separately, London, 1808. *Orestes*, London, 1798, 1811. *Phoenissae*, London, 1799, 1811. *Medea*, Cambridge, 1801; London, 1812. *The four together*, London, 1822.\n\n13. Collation of the Harleian manuscript of the\nOdyssey for the Grenville Homer, 4to. Oxford, 1800; with some short notes. Reprinted, Class. Jour. IX.\n\n14. Of the Review of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WAKEFIELD\">Wakefield</a>'s Lucretius, in the British Critic for May 1801, the principal part appears to be Porson's.\n\n15. A Letter signed J. N. Dawes, Monthly Mag. Dec. 1802; on some Greek constructions; admitting also an inaccuracy of his own with respect to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HIATUS\">hiatus</a>, pointed out by Mr C. Falconer.\n\n16. A Letter to Professor Dalzel, dated Sept. 1803; Mus. Crit. I. p. 326; in answer to some remarks published in the Professor's Collectanea Majora; with an Epigram respecting Hermann in Greek and in English.\n\n17. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERODOTUS\">Herodotus</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, 1806. Porson corrected the press for the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a>.\n\n18. Supplement to some Indices, Tracts xxxvi.\n\n19. It is well known that Porson bestowed considerable pains on the restoration of the text of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROSETTA\">Rosetta</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">Stone</a>; his Supplements were added to the plates engraved by the Society of Antiquaries; they also appear among his Tracts, xxxvii. In Dr Clarke's Greek Marbles, 8vo. Cambridge, 1809, we find a translation of this inscription, communicated to the editor by Porson, and printed from \"a corrected copy in his own beautiful handwriting;\" but we may here venture to apply Porson's favourite remark on the facility of transposition, and to read, \"a copy corrected in his own writing,\" that is, on the margin, of Mr Gough's translation, as published in Duane's Coins: for the whole is very negligently performed; and it is not a little remarkable that this translation, which was at least approved by Porson, is decidedly less accurate than the Latin translation of Heyne, as appears from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> of the enchorial inscription, published in the sixth number of the Museum Criticum.\n\n20. A variety of Porson's fugitive and miscellaneous pieces have reappeared at different times in the Classical Journal. Authors cited by the Scholiast on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a>, II. 619, Tracts xxxviii. The Epitaph, III. 233; more correctly than in the Tracts, but still with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNCTUATION\">punctuation</a> of the last line, which stands, in a manuscript copy of his own, \u1f18\u03c0\u03b9\u03c4\u03ac\u03c6\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u1f51\u03c0\u1f78 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f00\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f10\u03b3\u03ad\u03c1\u03b8\u03b7. This reading, though not very elegant, is at least more defensible, than to make \u03c3\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd alone signify to die, and a phrase to end with \u1f51\u03c0\u1f78! A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARADE\">Charade</a> in Latin, VII. 248. Some Notes on Eschylus, VII. 456, VIII. 15, 181, X. 114. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> employed in the 47th proposition of the first book of Euclid, p. 401. Notes on Apollonius Rhodius, XVIII. 370.\n\n21. Adversaria, 8vo. Cambridge, 1812. Consisting of Notes on the Greek Poets, selected from his manuscripts, and arranged by Professor Monk and C. J. Bloomfield, M.A. The first article is an interesting Lecture on Euripides, delivered upon his appointment to the Greek Professorship: it is followed by a few miscellaneous observations, and by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> collection of Notes on Athenaeus, on Euripides, on the Fragments of the Tragic and Comic Poets, on Stobaeus, and on a variety of poets of miscellaneous descriptions. The volume was reprinted at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMSTERDAM\">Amsterdam</a>, without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a>, but the sale of the foreign edition has never been permitted in Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>.\n\n22. Tracts and Miscellaneous Criticisms, collected and arranged by the Rev. T. Kidd, M.A., 8vo. London, 1815. Besides the articles already noticed as reprinted in this volume, there are a few Notes on Dawes's Miscellanea Critica, not before published, No. xli. Some supplementary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAGES\">pages</a> of Simplicius and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CEBES\">Cebes</a>, reprinted by Porson, for the use of his friends, as restored by Schweigh\u00e4user: the want of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a> of the manuscript of Simplicius had given rise to the mistaken assertion that Xenophon was proclaimed a public benefactor at the Olympic Games, on occasion of the return of the ten thousand. There are also some miscellaneous Notes on Athenaeus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MENANDER\">Menander</a>, and Philemon, Aristides, Pausanias, and the lexicographers, and some Indices of authors quoted by Scholiasts.\n\n23. Notae in Aristophanem, quibus Plutum coeum adject P.P. Dobree, 8vo. Cambridge, 1820.\n\n24. Gaisford Lectiones Platonic\u00e6. Accedunt R. Porsoni Notae <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-AD\">ad</a> Pausaniam, 8vo. Oxford, 1820.\n\n25. Photii Lexicon, 8vo. Cambridge, 1822.\n\nTo attempt to form a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> estimate of the merit of such a man as Porson, without servilely following the dictates of common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>, or blindly adopting the opinions of others, is a task of no small difficulty, even to one who had the advantage of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> acquaintance for the last twenty years of his life. But it may safely be conceded to common fame and to partial friendship, that he was one of the greatest men, and the very greatest critic, of his own or of any other age. \"Nothing came amiss,\" says Mr Weston, \"to his memory. He would set a child right in his twopenny <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FABLE\">fable</a> book, repeat the whole of the moral tale of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAN\">Dean</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BADAJOZ\">Badajoz</a>, a page of Athenaeus on cups, or of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUSTATHIUS\">Eustathius</a> on Homer, even though he did every thing to impair his mental faculties.\" It cannot, however, be denied, that the talents, and even the industry, that he possessed, might have made him a much greater man, had they been employed in some other department of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> intellect. He might probably have been as great a statesman or as great a general as he was a scholar, and in these capacities his acquirements would have affected the interests of a much greater multitude of his fellow creatures, than can ever be benefited by the fruits of his erudition; and he might possibly have gained more popularity as an orator or a poet, than his refined investigations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAMMAR\">grammar</a> and prosody could ever procure him, although it is not by any means certain that his fancy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> could have been rendered by any cultivation at all comparable to his memory and acuteness. But as far as regards the possession of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of the faculties which he did cultivate, he appears to have been decidedly the most successful of any man on record in the same department. On the other hand, it must be admitted that the subjects of his pursuits were in their nature incapable of raising a man to the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> among the permanent benefactors of the human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>; and, if we calmly consider the ultimate objects of prosody and metre, it will appear almost unfair to allow the discoverer of the prosodical rules,\nadopted by the ancient poets in their melodramas and choruses, to rank so very high among the luminaries of an age, and yet to look down, with so much contempt as we are accustomed to do, on the character of a modern *Dieu de la danse*, notwithstanding that he thought himself the third great man of his day, with Voltaire and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">King</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUSSIA\">Prussia</a>, for having given <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> and sentiment to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> and movements of the choric representations of the present times. Among the talents of Porson, however, which were so far superior to the importance of the objects on which they were employed, we ought not, perhaps, to consider his remarkable strength of memory as the most to be envied, since many persons who have been possessed of singular and almost miraculous, not to say morbid, memories, have been but little distinguished by any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a>; and it appears to be possible that a memory may in itself be even too retentive for real practical utility, as if of too microscopic a nature; and it seems to be by a wise and benevolent, though by no means an obvious arrangement of a Creative <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">Providence</a>, that a certain degree of oblivion becomes a most useful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> in the advancement of human knowledge, enabling us readily to look back on the prominent features only of various objects and occurrences, and to class them and reason upon them, by the help of this involuntary kind of abstraction and generalisation, with incomparably greater facility than we could do, if we retained the whole detail of what had been once but slightly impressed on our minds. It is thus, for example, in physic, that the experienced practitioner learns at length to despise the relation of individual symptoms, and particular cases, on which alone the empiric insists, and to feel the value of the Hippocratic system of \"attending more to the prognostic than the diagnostic features of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>;\" which, to a younger student, appears to be perfect imbecility. And it is perhaps for some similar reason that many persons, besides Barnes, \"of happy memory,\" have had to wait <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> in darkness for \"the day of judgment.\" But it must be repeated, that Porson's judgment and acuteness were really almost paramount to his memory, and with the addition of these faculties, his memory naturally rendered him capable of much that would have been impossible without it.\n\nThe respect that is justly due to classical learning has frequently been exaggerated in this country, partly, perhaps, on account of the awe which is naturally entertained, by an ingenuous mind, for its instructors in the earliest studies, by which it is advanced towards maturity: and classical learning having most wisely been placed by our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a> the foremost, in the order of a liberal education, which is most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> adopted in Great Britain, a personal as well as a general respect has been involuntarily paid to the characters of the individuals concerned, and to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> of all those who are engaged in similar occupations; besides that, the means being, by a most frequent inattention of the human mind, confounded with the end for which they are sought, the words and syllables, and the phrases and measures of the Greek and Latin authors have been often the almost frivolous occupation of a valuable life, instead of that of a few of the years of boyhood, which it was intended to devote to them, and which could not have been so well engaged in any other way. It is, however, wholly unjust to stigmatize the study of the classics, and of languages in general, as being confined to words instead of things: for it is utterly impossible that words can be learned, without the acquisition of a considerable degree of knowledge of the things to which they relate, and of the historical facts which they have been employed to express, and without an involuntary modelling of the mind to the elegance and elevation of sentiment, which pervade the works of those authors who are habitually put into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of boys in the course of their elementary studies: an acquirement which is of still greater value to the orator and the statesman, than the command of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, and facility of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>, and beauty of imagery, and power of reasoning, which he derives from a perfect familiarity with the great masters of antiquity. But granting all the respect that can possibly be claimed, for ancient literature, we cannot but lament that such a man as Porson should have lived and laboured for nearly half a century, and yet have left little or nothing to the world that was truly and originally his own.\n\nAfter the full admission of the very high rank which is due to the comparative merits of Porson's talents and acquirements, it may be thought almost idle, if not invidious, to dwell on any trifling exceptions to their magnitude. But it is, in fact, of high importance to the progress of human knowledge to be aware of the degree in which the first of mankind are liable to error. The admission of the few errors of Newton himself is at least of as much importance to his followers in science, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of the progress of his real discoveries; and it is with reason that the detection of an error in such a man is considered as almost paramount to the establishment of a new fact. The English critics have been approached, and not without some foundation, as paying too servile a deference to Porson's opinions, and it seems to have been very generally believed among them, that it was scarcely possible for him to commit an error or an oversight.\n\nAlthough Porson was in many respects <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a>, and often idle, or even intemperate, yet what he did perform as a critic may be allowed to leave a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a>, at the end of his life, in favour of his general industry, when compared with that of most of his countrymen. It has indeed been asserted, and perhaps with truth (*Classical Journal*, XXI.), that \"with things Porson appears to have possessed but a very inconsiderable acquaintance, and not a trace is to be found amidst his writings of that combination of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> encyclopaedic knowledge with language learning, which is so abundantly found in the *Dissertation on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHALARIS\">Phalaris</a>*, and the countless pages of Scaliger, Salmasius, and Casaubon.\" Certainly, however, neither Salmasius nor Casaubon, with all their learning, much less Scaliger, with all his industry and parade, nor even Bentley himself, with all his talent and acuteness, was at all comparable to Porson in his own department, that is, as a sound and accurate and refined Greek critic.\n\nBut it must be confessed, that at Cambridge, even although Porson had resolved to make the classics\nhis principal study, and although there had not yet been many instances of senior wranglers, who were also senior medallists, it was scarcely reputable for a man, with his undeniable abilities, to be only the twenty first of his year in mathematics. Among the literary objects, also, which afterwards engaged his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, he might easily have found time for the study of some of the modern languages, and he might have derived essential benefit from it on many occasions of critical research. He had, indeed, read a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of French, but very little Italian; he had studied the Anglosaxon, but he knew nothing of the kindred dialects of the North of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, in which it is preserved almost entire; and he was wholly unacquainted with Oriental literature. He might have profited materially by some of these studies, in deriving from them a clearer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> of the distinctions of the tenses than he seems to have possessed, and he might have enlightened us in no small degree, with respect to the history of languages and of nations, by such etymological investigations, as his comprehensive mind, thus employed, would have rendered him peculiarly capable of pursuing with success.\n\nIt has been candidly and very truly admitted by a rival critic in Germany, that Porson committed fewer errors than almost any other person; but it is right to be aware that he has now and then committed some errors, even where he would have been expected to be the most correct. There is, for example, a very strange oversight in one of the criticisms contained in his early review of Weston's Hermesianax, which implies a palpable blunder with respect to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENDER\">gender</a> of a participle, \u03b6\u03b1\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03ba\u03cd\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2, \"the cup of purple glass, which measured the fragrant wine;\" and even in a subsequent correction of the same passage, published in his Adversaria, he has changed the gender of an adjective in a way that is at least very unusual, if not wholly without example, \u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03a3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1. A mere omission, in a criticism on another author, would scarcely be called an error in an ordinary person; but in such a critic as Porson, it is very remarkable that he should have neglected to notice, in his catalogue of the Errors of Le Clerc, omitted by Bentley (Adv. p. 291), the grossest of all Le Clerc's blunders, which is the quotation of the word Hypophauli, or semibarbarous, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLLUX\">Pollux</a>, with the translation Sartagines, or frying pans; while the real text of Pollux simply and plainly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> that the Teganismi, or fricassations, in the Hippocamus of Menander, is a semibarbarous word. These instances, which have occurred in a very cursory perusal of some of Porson's works, would certainly not deserve to be noticed, in a general sketch of his character, any otherwise than as exceptions to his perfect infallibility.\n\nIt can scarcely be considered as an imperfection in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of Porson's mind, that he wanted that amiable vanity, which is gratified by the approbation even of the most inconsiderable; and which delights to choose for its objects the most innocent and the most helpless of those who are casually present in society. It has been observed that he would neither give nor take praise; and when he was told that somebody had called him a giant in literature, he remarked, that a man had no right to tell the height of that which he could not measure. In fact, having learned \"to know how little can be known,\" it is not surprising that he found himself \"without a second, and without a judge,\" and that he was unwilling to affect a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a> of sentiment, and an interchange of approbation with those whose acquirements and opinions he felt that he had a right to despise. It might have been wiser, in some instances, to conceal this feeling; but, on the other hand, he had perhaps occasion for something of the habit of retreating into his conscious dignity, from his deficiency in those general powers of ephemeral conversation, which are so valuable in mixed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a>: for, with all his learning and all his memory, he was by no means prominent as a talker. He had neither the inclination nor the qualifications to be a fascinating storyteller, or to become habitually a parasite at the tables of the affluent; but he was the delight of a limited circle of chosen friends, possessing talent enough to appreciate his merits, and to profit by the information that he afforded them.\n\nThere has not yet been a life of Porson that has collected all the particulars that would deserve to be recorded by a biographer, who undertook the task on an extensive scale; but of detached documents there is no deficiency. Mr Kidd has pointed out almost every work in which his name has been mentioned: the most material articles relating to him will be enumerated here.\n\nMorning Chronicle, 6th October 1808.

Its northern boundary was the river Douro, whilst eastward it extended over a large part of Leon and Castile. Its line of demarcation passed from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a> of Arzobispo to the eastward of Talavera, extended to Simancas on the Douro, and included within its bounds the cities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALAMANCA\">Salamanca</a>, Truxillo, Coria, Merida, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-AVILA\">Avila</a>, and the several intermediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> and villages. When the northern tribes penetrated to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENINSULA\">peninsula</a>, and gained the mastery of it, Lusitania still retained the same name, and a\nbranch of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUEVI\">Suevi</a>, having established themselves in it, made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRAGA\">Braga</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>. Though under the Moors, the names of many cities, towns, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>, received the nomenclature of that people, yet the whole country retained the Roman title till the more modern name of Portugal was bestowed upon it.\n\nThe present kingdom of Portugal is bounded on the north by the Spanish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GALICIA\">Galicia</a>, on the east by the several provinces of Leon, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESTREMADURA\">Estremadura</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANDALUSIA\">Andalusia</a>, and on the south and west by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATLANTIC_OCEAN\">Atlantic Ocean</a>. It has the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of a parallelogram, with its longest side from north to south; extending from $37^\\circ 3'$ to $42^\\circ 12'$ north latitude, and from $6^\\circ 15'$ to $8^\\circ 55'$ west <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a> from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREENWICH\">Greenwich</a>. Its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> is estimated, following the map of Lopez, at 3437 square leagues, or about 22,765,000 English acres. The divisions of Portugal, like those of most of the other kingdoms of Europe, have been derived rather from feudal possessions than from any other cause, and though they have produced great inequalities in their extent, in their relative and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a>, and in their fertility and wealth, there is no reason to expect any alteration in them; they are as follows, according to Antillon, viz.\n\n| Provinces          | Population | Extent in Square Leagues | Extent in English Acres | Number of Acres |\n|--------------------|------------|--------------------------|------------------------|----------------|\n| Entre Duero e Minho| 907,965    | 291                      | 1,927,040              |                |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRAS_LOS_MONTES\">Tras los Montes</a>     | 318,665    | 455                      | 3,007,760              |                |\n| La Beyra           | 1,121,595  | 758                      | 4,936,880              |                |\n| Estremadura        | 826,680    | 823                      | 5,450,880              |                |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALENTEJO\">Alentejo</a>           | 380,480    | 883                      | 5,848,320              |                |\n| Algarve            | 127,613    | 232                      | 1,536,000              |                |\n\nThe population here given is the result of the last actual census, which was taken in the year 1798, by order of the late <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a>. The enumeration then made was of the number of families, which, being multiplied by five, gives the state of the population here expressed. Notwithstanding the desolating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> which has since occurred, and which must, for a time, and within certain districts, have lessened the population, the best native authorities contend, that, during the last twenty years, the increase has been gradual, and that the number of inhabitants now is nearly equal to that census.\n\nPortugal may then be considered a well peopled country; as compared with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, the density of population is as 3 to 2, and as compared with Scotland, which is of nearly the same extent, it is almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a>. If the whole of Portugal were as thickly settled as the province of Entre Duero e Minho, the number of souls would amount to 10,700,000; whereas, if the whole had no greater density than that of Alentejo, they would not exceed 1,480,000.\n\nAn ingenious writer, in comparing the present population of the kingdom with its state in the fifteenth century, remarks that, \"in the provinces where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> flourishes the inhabitants have increased; where they subsist by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FISHERIES\">fisheries</a> they have diminished; and where both commerce and the fisheries exist, the increase has been only in proportion to the quantum of commerce.\"\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of the country is generally mountainous, divided into ridges by deep chasms, through which rapid torrents rush, in the rainy seasons; but which, in times of drought, scarcely afford sufficient supplies of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> for the wants of the inhabitants and their cattle. This irregular surface of the country is very unfavourable to intercourse between the different provinces. The expense of constructing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a> and bridges in such a country is too great to be borne by its inhabitants. Hence, there is scarcely any conveyance either for goods or passengers by wheel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARRIAGES\">carriages</a>. Although, in the northern parts of the kingdom, there are some bridges of very ancient erection, yet in the south scarcely any are to be found. The roads, too, in the north are, in some few instances, tolerably good. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPORTO\">Oporto</a> have constructed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAMEGO\">Lamego</a> for the conveyance of their wines, and are still extending it. A good road has been formed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-MAFRA\">Mafra</a>, and the Government has been occupied in making one to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COIMBRA\">Coimbra</a>. In the southern provinces no such efforts have been made; but the road from Mertola to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEJA\">Beja</a>, originally constructed by the Romans, has been recently repaired. At present none are likely to be commenced, so that the inconveniences of travelling are perhaps greater than in any other part of Europe.\n\nThe state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a> was till lately very bad; and though much of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> is naturally fertile, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> highly favourable to the production of all the necessaries of life, yet Portugal did not raise more corn than was sufficient for one third of its annual consumption; and though animal food can scarcely be deemed an article of general sustenance, its own lands did not pasture cattle sufficient for the scanty demand of the inhabitants. When cultivated with care, the soil produces abundant crops of wheat, barley, maize, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICE\">rice</a>; besides which, it yields <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEMP\">hemp</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAX\">flax</a> of excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>. Some improvements in husbandry have, however, begun to appear. The cultivation of potatoes has been introduced, and, on the more elevated parts of the country, with great success. They have extended rapidly, and form already so large a part of the sustenance of the inhabitants, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPORTATION\">exportation</a> of flour from the United States of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a> has nearly ceased; and the small quantity of corn now required is drawn from the northern parts of Europe, or from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> de Verd <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">Islands</a>.\n\nThe attention of the Portuguese husbandmen is principally directed to the production of those articles which find their most ready vent in foreign countries, or which are raised with the least labour. Of the first sort is their wine, chiefly in the\n\n*Memoiras Economicas de Academia Real das Sciencias de Lisboa, Tom. I. p. 128.*\nThe quantity usually made is about 80,000 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PIPES\">pipes</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>, and 60,000 pipes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>. Of the former about one half is sent to England, about one eighth to the other parts of northern Europe, and the remainder to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRAZIL\">Brazil</a>. Not more than one sixth part of the white wine is exported to all the countries of Europe; the rest is either sent to Brazil or is consumed at home; but, in general, the natives drink wine of a quality far inferior to any that could find a vent in foreign <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARKETS\">markets</a>. The productions that require but little labour, such as chestnuts, almonds, oranges, lemons, and citrons, are profusely raised; and, with the onions and garlic, form no small proportion of the aliment of the inhabitants. Olive trees are plentiful, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> expressed from their fruit forms an important article of sustenance; and though not of a quality or flavour that is relished for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> in foreign countries, it is a considerable article of export; being used by the woollen manufacturers of England, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, and Germany, in their respective operations.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> coasts of Portugal abound with excellent fish, especially with Tunny's and Sardinias, and they, as well as the rivers, afford both occupation and food to a great portion of the inhabitants; but the supply from them is inadequate to the wants of the population, whose consumption of that kind of diet, from their adherence to the fasts prescribed by the Catholic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, is very great; requiring an annual importation of salted fish, which is furnished by the English and Americans, from the banks of Newfoundland, and by the Swedes, Norwegians, and Dutch.\n\nThe manufactories of Portugal are in a very languid state. With the exception of the lower classes of people, who are clothed with their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a>, or with the skins of their sheep, nearly the whole of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> may be said to be furnished with their apparel from England, Holland, and Germany. The few manufactures of Portugal are those of cotton, at Alcobaca and Tomar; of linens, at Guimar\u00e3es, on the Ave; of glass, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEYRIA\">Leyria</a>; and of woollen cloths, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUARDA\">Guarda</a>. The best goods that are made in the kingdom, as compared with those of other countries, are the cambrics, shirting and table linens, and sewing threads. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LISBON\">Lisbon</a> are made some silks, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-HATS\">hats</a>, and silver and plated wares. A late most superb <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> of plate, presented to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">Duke</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-WELLINGTON\">Wellington</a>, made wholly by natives, shows that they are not deficient in taste in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOLDSMITH\">goldsmith</a>'s art.\n\nThe mineral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a> of Portugal have been much neglected. There are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> of tin which were formerly worked to considerable extent, and much profit, but are now abandoned. Besides these, there are veins of silver, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>, none of which are wrought. The country abounds with most beautiful marbles, though many of the quarries are at so great a distance from water conveyance, and the roads are so bad, that they will not repay, in the present condition of the kingdom, the expences attendant on carrying them to a market.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMIGRATION\">emigration</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">court</a> to Brazil destroyed that colonial monopoly which, till that event, was most rigidly maintained. Instead of being the point in which both the wants and the produce of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a> met, and were exchanged, the imports have been confined to what the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a> state has required for its consumption; and the exports have been restricted to the wines, oil, and fruits, which were sold to purchase the corn and other sustenance required to feed the people, and procure clothing from England and Holland. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>, cotton, and other productions of Brazil, are carried <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> to the places of consumption; and from the same places the Brazilians obtain their supplies of European commodities, without the intervention of Portugal. Next to wine and fruits the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> export from Portugal is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>, made from sea water, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a>, at St Ubes. The vessels which bring salted fish usually take a part of their returns in this article. Near five hundred vessels are annually loaded with salt, at St Ubes, and the quantity exported is about 100,000 tons. Of late years <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a> has been transported to England; in one year nearly one million pounds <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>; but a tax laid on that commodity here has operated nearly to exclude that of a coarse quality from our markets.\n\nThe government of Portugal was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONARCHY\">monarchy</a> of the most absolute kind. The several Boards or Councils, which carried on the administration, had no check or even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> in the measures that were adopted, but obeyed the orders of the King implicitly; and it is generally understood, that in no Court did corruption and favoritism abound to an equal extent. The laws were a most incoherent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>, without fixed principles or regularity; and the administration of them, whether by superior or inferior judges, was perverted by bribery, so as to favour the purposes of oppression rather than of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>.\n\nThe religion of the kingdom is the Roman Catholic, of the most rigid, not to say of the most superstitious, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>. The proportionate numbers of the clergy were greater than in any other country in Europe. There are three archbishops, thirteen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a>, and a prelate presiding over them, denominated the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRIARCH\">patriarch</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INQUISITION\">Inquisition</a> was in full force, to check, in their earliest stages, the growth of any opinions that were thought to militate against the established <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>. By some late regulations the number of the clergy has been reduced, and the Inquisition abolished.\n\nBefore the invasion by the armies of Buonaparte, the revenues of Portugal, including the sums drawn from Brazil, were calculated to amount to about 3,000,000 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">Sterling</a>. At the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> forces consisted of 30,000 men; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">marine</a> comprised 20 sail of the line, besides frigates, corvettes, and sloops. During the war, resources were called forth which the nation never had imagined it possessed. Troops, notorious for indolence, want of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a> and filthiness, when placed under the command of British officers, became active, disciplined, and brave; and bore no inconsiderable share of the dangers and successful contests which liberated their own country, Spain,\nand ultimately the whole of Europe. When the Court emigrated to Brazil, where the marine of its ally was a better protection than any she could furnish, Portugal suffered her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">navy</a> to dwindle, and she has now few large ships that are capable of warlike operations.\n\nThe inhabitants of Portugal are generally a robust, yet not an industrious people. They are enterprising and persevering; patient in adverse circumstances, excessively attached to their own religion and customs; and, though temporary circumstances may seem to indicate the contrary, they retain a high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of loyalty to their monarch, and of submission to their spiritual superiors. The Portuguese language is derived from the Latin, of which it contains a great proportion of words, though mixed with many others of Arabic origin. In the construction of its sentences, it very much resembles the Castilian; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRONUNCIATION\">pronunciation</a> of the syllables differs considerably; and there are many words introduced which are peculiar to itself, and whose derivation it is difficult to trace; though probably they are to be found among some of the tribes on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of Barbary.\n\nPortugal contains twenty-two cities. The capital, Lisbon, on the north side of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TAGUS\">Tagus</a>, distinguished by its excellent harbour, by some superb buildings, its irregular surface, and disgustingly filthy streets, contains 260,000 inhabitants; Oporto contains about 65,000; Coimbra, 15,000; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EVORA\">Evora</a>, 12,000: the other cities are small, poor, and less populous. The remainder of the inhabitants occupy 647 towns and 4262 villages. The proportion of agricultural labourers to the whole population is so small, that, scanty as are their harvests, and favourable as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> almost uniformly is for securing their fruits and corn, the labours of the field, in autumn, require numerous additional hands, which are furnished by the adjoining Spanish province of Galicia. The principal sea ports are Lisbon, Oporto, and St Ubes. Besides these, Viana, at the mouth of the river <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIMA\">Lima</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVEIRO\">Aveiro</a>, Sines, Serdao, Villa Nova, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FARO\">Faro</a>, and Tavira, have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HARBOURS\">harbours</a>, but generally accessible only to small vessels; and, except Viana and Faro, they have scarcely any other than a mere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COASTING\">coasting</a> trade.\n\nThe Encyclopaedia brings down the history of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> events in Portugal to the conclusion of the Convention of Cintra in August 1808. Towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of that year, the armies which Spain had collected to oppose the invading forces of France being dispersed, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MADRID\">Madrid</a> having surrendered, and the British troops under Sir John Moore having been compelled to a precipitate retreat from the Peninsula; the invasion of Portugal was again resolved upon by the French with the fullest confidence of success.\n\nThree armies were collected on the frontiers. One under Marshal Soult in Galicia, a second under General Lapisse at Salamanca, and a third on the banks of the Tagus under Marshal Victor. The only opposition which could be presented was to the last of these corps, by an assemblage of the fugitives of the Spanish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> which General Cuesta was attempting to reorganize. Consternation and dismay spread over the kingdom; the garrison and stores were withdrawn from the frontier fortress of Almeida; the forts and batteries on the Tagus were dismantled; and the British troops in the vicinity of Lisbon were concentrated as preparatory for instant embarkation. A war breaking out again, at this period, between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUSTRIA\">Austria</a> and France, induced Buonaparte to withdraw from Spain, and to take with him 15,000 of his best troops, which in some measure checked the rapid advance of his forces, and allowed an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a>, which was sedulously improved in Portugal. General Beresford, who had acquired the confidence of the natives, was, at the suggestion of the British Government, appointed Marshal and Commander-in-Chief of the armies of Portugal. Twenty thousand of the Portuguese were taken into the pay of England, and British officers were nominated to the superior commissions in each battalion; by which means a general system of discipline and subordination was quickly established. Reinforcements of troops from England, augmenting the army to 17,000 men, had reached Lisbon, and confidence was in a great measure restored before a blow was struck.\n\nMarshal Soult at length having dispersed the Spanish troops in Galicia, and thus secured that province, entered Portugal by the road of Chaves. He was slightly opposed by General Friere, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of a Portuguese army, who had intended to have retired, on his approach, to stronger ground nearer Oporto. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> he was interrupted by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTINY\">mutiny</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of his troops, who, insisting on defending Chaves, were shut up in that town, and in a few days compelled to surrender. As Soult advanced, Friere would have retreated, but the rest of his army being without due subordination, were impatient to fight; and as he persisted in his prudent plans a mutiny arose, when, under the suspicion of treachery, the General and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAFF\">Staff</a> were massacred by the mutinous troops. They then demanded a British officer who would lead them to attack the enemy. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARON\">Baron</a> Eben, a German in the British service, took the command, and gratified their wishes by fighting the unsuccessful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> of Carvalho da <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ESTE\">Este</a>, where, after some creditable efforts of individual bravery, the sabres of the enemy's cavalry took ample vengeance on them for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> of their late Commander. Soult then invested Oporto, which had been strongly fortified, and was defended by 200 pieces of cannon, and a garrison of 20,000 men; but the same insubordination and want of confidence prevailed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> as had produced the disasters in the field; and, after an ill conducted defence of three days, it was taken by assault on the 29th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a>. The French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a>, on entering the town, made an indiscriminate slaughter of the inhabitants, and delivered themselves up to every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of plunder and licentiousness; and, though their Commander used efforts to repress their fury, he was unable to accomplish it before the sufferings had continued a whole day and night.\n\nThe day before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> of Oporto, Victor had defeated the Spanish army commanded by Cuesta in the battle of Medellin. This event opened to the\nFrench an easy road to Lisbon. General Craddock, the British Commander, posted a corps of his army of 6000 men at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABRANTES\">Abrantes</a>, assembled the main body of his troops at Leyria, and the Portuguese army at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-THOMAR\">Thomar</a>.\n\nSuch was the situation of affairs in Portugal when, on the 22d of April, Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTHUR\">Arthur</a> Wellesley landed at Lisbon to assume the chief command of the armies of England and Portugal.\n\nThe ill consequences of independent Commanders were visible in the movements of the French. The three armies of Soult, Victor, and Lapisse, which, if directed by one Chief, would long before this period have entered Lisbon in triumph, being disunited, and fearing to be separately committed, lost the precious moments for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> in suspense, or petty movements. Soult remained nearly a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> at Oporto, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a> of intelligence from the other Commanders, without which he deemed it imprudent to move forward. In the meantime, the Portuguese troops had captured Chaves, and thus cut off his direct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> with Spain by that route. The movements of Lapisse and Victor were equally hesitating. Sir Arthur, on the other hand, being unfettered in his views, could <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> with decision and promptitude. On the tenth day from his landing, the British in Leyria, to the number of 16,000, began to move by Coimbra and Aveiro, for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a> of Oporto; whilst 6000 Portuguese under Beresford marched to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> the Douro at Lamego, and cut off the enemy's retreat by Amarante; and the forces at Abrantes were left in that city to keep in check the army of Victor. The British from Leyria first met the enemy on the 10th May, on the banks of the Vouga; and, after a slight affair, drove them over the Douro. The floating bridge across that river was destroyed, and all the boats near Oporto were secured by the French on the right <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a>; thus the British General found himself separated from his antagonist by a rapid river, nearly 300 yards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, without any means of effecting the passage across it. Sir Arthur then planned and successfully executed the boldest passage of a river that is to be found on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> records. He detached a body of troops under General Murray to Avintas, five miles higher on the river, where, if boats could not be found, a ford would admit of the troops passing; and sent General Sherbrook with the Guards to the common ferry below the city; whilst from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERRA\">Serra</a> Convent, nearly opposite the town, he directed the passage in person. The stream was excessively rapid, and the heights on the right bank considerable. By the aid of some inhabitants, two boats were brought over from the enemy's side, and in them, protected by the fire of a brigade of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> guns, three companies of the Buffs were ferried across. Soult, either despising the effort, or believing it to be merely a feint to draw his attention from the main object, did not oppose the landing, but gave time to General Paget, who commanded, to ascend the bank, and place the troops in a formidable attitude in a ruined <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> before he attacked them. He then brought up a considerable force, which was firmly resisted, and gained time for passing over several other battalions. General Paget was early wounded, and the command devolved on General Hill, who was warmly engaged in contesting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POST\">post</a>, when General Murray appeared in sight, marching on the enemy's left flank. The Guards were then pushed across, and the French precipitately retired into the city. Soult discovered that he had been out-maneuvered, and ordered the immediate retreat of his army; but the British were already in the town, and charging up the streets. The confusion and precipitancy with which the French fled was far greater than can be readily imagined, and their panic seemed to increase as they gained the open country. Never was the rout of an army more complete, when night put an end to the pursuit, and gave the enemy a few hours respite. Soult, finding the bridge at Amarante destroyed, abandoned all his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTILLERY\">artillery</a> and wheel carriages, and leaving the high road, took the mountain track to Guimar\u00e3es. Thus freed from every incumbrance, the badness of the roads favoured his flight, and he gained a narrow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> on the shore near Salamonde, before Beresford's troops had reached the spot, as was projected, to intercept him. On the 18th he reached the frontier, and the pursuit closed, as more important affairs required attention to the south. Victor had joined with Lapisse, and forced the passage of the Tagus, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ALCANTARA\">Alcantara</a>; from whence they were advancing towards Lisbon at the time that the victorious army from Oporto reached that river early in June; when the enemy retired into Spain, and abandoned Portugal for the present.\n\nWhen Buonaparte had compelled Austria to conclude a peace, he stood pledged to his people and to the world to conquer Portugal, and \"to drive the British into the sea.\" His means for effecting those objects appeared unlimited; whilst the English nation, desponding at the general ill success of the war, and dissatisfied with the waste of their military strength in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SCHELDT\">Scheldt</a>, were generally disposed to withdraw from the contest.\n\nEarly in March, however, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a> deciding with the administration to continue with vigour the defence of Portugal; the subsidiary force of that nation was increased to 30,000 men; and such of the British battalions as could be rendered effective after the effects of the climate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WALCHEREN\">Walcheren</a>, were sent out to reinforce the army. The French assembled an army of 72,000 men under Marshal Massena, in the vicinity of Salamanca, early in April; which could only be opposed by about 50,000; one-half composed of young Portuguese levies, yet untried in general action. The operations of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAMPAIGN\">campaign</a> commenced by the siege of the Spanish city of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CIUDAD_RODRIGO\">Ciudad Rodrigo</a>, which, after a stout defence, capitulated on the 10th July. The road to Portugal was thus opened to the French, who entered it, and besieged Almeida. Owing to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPLOSION\">explosion</a>, by which all the powder in the garrison was destroyed, the Commander was compelled to surrender the latter end of August. The road by which Massena intended to force his way to Lisbon, soon became evident to the rival commander, and the united British and Portuguese armies were placed in such positions as were most likely to frustrate his intentions. The British Commander, during the whole progress of the enemy, had employed the abundant means at his disposal in constructing a secure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASYLUM\">asylum</a> in which he\ncould effectually make a head against the superior forces that were employed to drive him from the Peninsula, and to possess the capital of Portugal. Lisbon is situated on the extremity of an isthmus formed by the ocean and the river Tagus. Across this peninsula nature had drawn the outline of a strong defensive position, which the military art had been secretly but sedulously employed in rendering perfect. A track of country, thirty miles in extent from the mouth of the small river Tirandra to Alhandra, on the Tagus, was modelled into a field of battle; mountains were scarped perpendicularly, rivers dammed, and inundations formed. All roads that could favour the enemy were destroyed, and others made to facilitate the communications of the defenders; formidable works were erected to strengthen and support the weak parts; whilst numerous cannon, planted on inaccessible posts, commanded the different approaches to them, and gave an equality of defence to the whole position. Behind these defences the inhabitants of a district of nearly 2000 square miles were invited to retire with what of their substance they could convey, and were directed to destroy whatever could not be removed, that might afford support to the advancing army of Massena. Though these orders were but partially obeyed, yet, as far as they were executed, they contributed to the ultimate success of the defensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> formed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Wellington.\n\nWith this secure asylum in his rear, the British Commander could safely practise all the manoeuvres which tended to retard the approach of his antagonist. Massena, after the capture of Almeida, pushed on with rapidity towards Coimbra, and meeting no opposition there, expected the British army was hastening to Lisbon to embark. He received a check at the mountains of Busaco, but having turned that position, the British slowly marched within the formidable lines so celebrated in military annals by the name of Torres Vedras. The day after the 9th of October Marquis Romanjo joined the British army with 6000 Spanish troops; and on the next day Massena first discovered the formidable works which covered his antagonists. \"To judge,\" says an eye-witness, \"from the instant halt he made, and from the retrograde movement which followed, as soon as it became dark, they struck him as much with dismay as astonishment, and three days elapsed before he again ventured to the same spot.\" After some slight efforts to ascertain the nature of the defences, the French remained a month without any movement, merely sending out strong parties to their rear to ascertain the nature and resources of the country, from which alone they could hope to draw sustenance. The irregular troops of Portugal pressed him on all sides, and contracted the limits from which supplies could be obtained; and a division of them captured the sick and wounded of the French to the number of 5000 men, which, in the haste of his progress, Massena had left at Coimbra.\n\nOn the 14th November the French army, to be nearer their supplies, retrograded towards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SANTAREM\">Santarem</a> and Thomar, where they fortified their position, and were followed by the British to Cartaxo, from whence they were ready to fall back on their lines; should the enemy receive such reinforcements as to render it necessary. In this situation the two armies remained; the English receiving from Lisbon abundant supplies, which were sent by sea, and the French exhausting the country in their rear till scarcity produced disease, and rapidly thinned their ranks. Though reinforcements were sent to them, the desolate state of the country made them a burden, rather than an assistance to their coadjutors. After thus remaining in sight of each other till the 7th March 1810, a period of five inactive months, without a prospect of decisive action, the French were compelled to commence their retreat, just at the moment when the British had received a reinforcement of 7000 fresh troops. At the commencement of their retreat the loss in the French army since it had entered Portugal amounted to more than 30,000 men. Disgusting accumulations of filth, and remains of the most unhealthy kind of food, with the wretched and squalid appearance of most of the prisoners, and the neglected and unprovided state of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOSPITALS\">hospitals</a>, sufficiently testified the miserable condition to which the invaders were reduced, and accounts for so prodigious a mortality beyond that inflicted by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>. The sufferings and losses of the French, however, were nothing in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> with those which their visitation had inflicted on Portugal and its inhabitants. A wide extent of country remained for five months with scarcely an inhabitant: every thing it contained was devoured by the enemy or destroyed by the season. In the space immediately bounding the positions of the two armies, which was not permanently occupied by either, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARVEST\">harvest</a> perished in the ground, and the fruit fell rotten from the trees; flocks of innumerable small birds, as if drawn to the spot by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-INSTINCT\">instinct</a>, fattened unmolested on the ungathered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAPES\">grapes</a>; and latterly the very wolves, conscious of security, or rendered more daring by the absence of their accustomed prey, prowled about, masters of the territory, reluctantly giving way to the cavalry patrols which occasionally crossed their track.\n\nMany of the wretched inhabitants who had neglected the warning voice that invited them within the lines, passed the whole season of winter, exposed to its inclemencies, in the neighbouring woods or mountains, subsisting merely on roots and herbs; and on the advance of the allies, returned to their ruined homes with bodies emaciated from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTINENCE\">abstinence</a>, and intellects impaired by long continued <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a>; among these were girls of 16, who, become idiots, resembled in person women of 50. At the departure of the French, in many districts neither a living animal nor an article of subsistence was to be found. The official account of the Moniteur correctly and unblushingly states, that \"the towns and villages were deserted, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MILLS\">mills</a> destroyed, the wine running in the gutters, the corn stalks burnt, the furniture broken; and not a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MULE\">mule</a>, an ass, a cow, or even a goat, to be seen.\"\n\nThe retreat conducted by Massena exhibited great military talents, and every movement was made with such skill and celerity, that his active and indefatigable opponent could <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> but few advantages over him. The rapid pursuit in a few days carried the\nallied armies farther than their supplies could reach them, and they were obliged to halt till <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> could overtake them. Massena availed himself of these circumstances to retire out of Portugal, after throwing supplies into the fortress of Almeida.\n\nThe retreat of the French was conducted with so much ability, that its loss, both by the sword and in prisoners, did not exceed 5000 men; that of the allies being under 650. Having thus freely bestowed the tribute of praise justly due to the French as soldiers, it is but proper to notice their conduct as men, and to state, on the authority of an eye-witness, that the unnecessary cruelties and wanton devastation which marked every step of their retreat, were such as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a> over their character which no military <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> can efface, and to stamp them rather as sanguinary and unprincipled banditti, than as the organized warriors of a civilized state.\n\nThe French army was reinforced and refitted at Salamanca, returned to Portugal in the beginning of May, and made several movements and attacks, some of a very important nature, to prevent the British from capturing Almeida; but having been foiled in every attempt, they retired and left that fortress to its fate; the garrison of which evacuated it, and forced their way in a most spirited manner through the British army that surrounded them.\n\nWith this operation the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of war closed in Portugal; for though, during the sieges of Cuidad Rodrigo and Badajoz, and in the attempt made by Marmon, some parts of that kingdom were included in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEATRE\">theatre</a> of hostilities, they never extended beyond the frontiers. The other events of this important war belong rather to the history of Spain and of France than to that of Portugal, though in all the operations the troops of that nation bore an active and conspicuous part.\n\nAfter the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a> of the government of Buonaparte, the troops of Portugal were marched to their own country; but before the proper measures for reducing their numbers were adopted, his return from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELBA\">Elba</a> again set them in active movement, till the decisive battle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-WATERLOO\">Waterloo</a> once more permitted them to rest. The state of the country was, however, by no means tranquil. The absence of their Court in Brazil, the little influence enjoyed by the Regency, the calls for pecuniary aid from the Provinces, and especially the large army being still kept up, and its command continued in foreign hands, with the spirit of insubordination prevailing among the native officers, gave sufficient grounds to apprehend that convulsions must ensue. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSPIRACY\">conspiracy</a>, of a very extensive nature, was timely discovered in the army, and its progress checked, but without the spirit which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> it being extirpated. This was strongly exhibited afterwards, when 10,000 men, who had been ordered to embark for Brazil, revolted, and showed such determination, that the Regency was compelled to yield to their wishes. Portugal felt that the order of nature was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERTED\">inverted</a>, and the parent state become a dependent on her own colony. Conflicting claims between the Regency and the Commander of the Forces induced Lord Beresford to repair to Rio de Janeiro, to obtain fresh instructions, and probably additional authority from the King. In his absence a revolution broke forth, which, giving to Portugal a new aspect, renders all accounts of its present condition doubtful, and leaves to conjecture what may be the result of the circumstances in which she is placed.\n\nThe first symptoms of this revolution were exhibited at Oporto, and the first movements were made on the 24th August 1820, in the 18th regiment, under the command of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DON\">Don</a> Bernardo de Castro e Sepulveda, in which he was supported by the other troops in that garrison, and, as is supposed, by the civil authorities of the city. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCIAL\">provincial</a> Junta of 13 members was chosen by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCLAMATION\">acclamation</a>, who issued a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROCLAMATION\">proclamation</a> to quiet the apprehensions of the British officers. Sepulveda was opposed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> Amarante, the commander of the troops in the province Tras os Montes; but on marching towards him, in the end of August, that officer was forsaken by his troops, who joined the insurgents, and rendered it necessary for him to take refuge in Spain.\n\nSepulveda then advanced with his army towards Lisbon, and reached Coimbra, where the Junta of Oporto followed him and held their sittings. The Regency of the kingdom in Lisbon acted with indecision, or perhaps with treachery. On the 29th August, they issued a proclamation denouncing the transactions that had taken place at Oporto, and calling on the inhabitants and military to oppose their progress; and, on the 1st September, issued another, by which they directed the assembling of the Cortes of the kingdom according to its ancient institution. Before the period had arrived for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVOCATION\">convocation</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a>, an event occurred which wholly frustrated the plan projected by the Junta of Regency. It had been usual to celebrate, on the 15th September, the deliverance of Portugal from the French invaders. The Junta fearing to assemble, in the agitated state of the public mind, such a concourse of people as usually met on that day, resolved to omit the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a>; but the troops, at the instigation of the native officers, paraded without orders, and, before they separated, deposed the Government, and installed a temporary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNCIL\">Council</a> to rule. The Junta of Oporto, who were at Coimbra, soon received intelligence of the occurrences in Lisbon, and reached the capital on the 1st October. Before any agreement between the two Juntas had been made, the arrival of Lord Beresford, from Brazil, in an English ship of the line, caused great consternation. The soldiers were known to be attached to him, his powers were presumed to be extensive, and the acclamations which the native officers had drawn forth from the troops could not be depended on. The two Juntas, agreeing in nothing else, united, however, to prevent his landing; and after some ineffectual efforts to open an intercourse, he departed for England. When left to themselves, divisions of the most embittered kind arose among the insurgents. The partizans of the Junta of Oporto were the most furious; and having placed at the head of the troops one of their own partizans, the Junta of Lisbon was surrounded on the 11th November, the meeting dissolved, and a proclamation issued declaring the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADOPTION\">adoption</a> of the Spanish constitution. The ascendancy of this violent party was but short. Teixeira, who had com-\nmanded the troops, changed his views; and through his means the more moderate party were put in possession of power. By them the Cortes was convoked, and the Spanish constitution voted as far only as it should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> the circumstances of Portugal. The mode of election of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEPUTY\">deputy</a> to 30,000 inhabitants, as prescribed by the Spanish plan, was adopted; and when the assembly met, it was found that few men of wealth or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> were chosen. The assembly assumed all power, uniting the executive, judicial, and legislative authority, in their own body. The King was induced to return from Brazil, but on his arrival found himself a mere cypher; every one in whom he had any confidence being carefully kept from his presence, and some of the ministers, who had accompanied him, being committed to prison. The Cortes have since occupied themselves in framing a constitution and a code of laws; but have made no such progress in either as can enable any certain judgment to be formed of what may be the result of their deliberations. In the meantime, the inhabitants of Brazil have established a government, in effect independent of Portugal, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">Prince</a> Regent at its head. The troops that have been sent to that country have revolted to the Brazilians, and their officers being dismissed, have been sent back to Europe. The state of the finances has so much deteriorated, that Portugal there is not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> sufficient to pay even the troops, who are six months in arrear; and the civil officers and creditors of the state are in a still more lamentable situation. There is no power to put in execution the decrees that issue from the Cortes; and that body has not sufficient unity of mind to enact a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of laws consistent with themselves.\n\nWhether it was wise to attempt the establishment of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEMOCRACY\">democracy</a>, in a country where the priests of various kinds, the military, and the officers of the state, comprise one-fifth of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> population, it is not for us to determine; but so wretched was the previous condition of the Portuguese government, that it is scarcely possible the revolution can leave the country in a worse state than that which preceded it.\n\nSee Elementos de la Geografia Natural y Politica de Espana y Portugal, por Don Isidoro de Antillon.

This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> of punishment is exceptional, only because it is a bad instrument.\n\nThe whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> evidently comes to this. If more wretchedness is desired than what is implied in confinement under the worst <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a> which the preservation of health admits, it must be meted out, either at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> of the jailor, or the pleasure of the judge. The writer in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> Review, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMITTEE\">Committee</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> for the Improvement of Prison <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">Discipline</a>, speak as if they had never reflected upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a>.\n\nWe do not mean to bestow a word upon that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a>, which, for the prevention of offences, would make prisons scenes of wretchedness at the pleasure of the jailor.\n\nThe only question which can deserve a solution is, what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of inflicting evil in a gaol can the judge make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of for best attaining the ends of punishment? The answer is not difficult. Unless, where that course of reformatory discipline, which we shall delineate under the next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, suffices; and we allow, that, though it may be made to involve no small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of punishment, there are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> in which it would not suffice; it will certainly appear, that prisons are not the best instruments of punishment.\n\nA single consideration suffices for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of this proposition. Punishment in a prison loses the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> requisite of a punishment, that of engendering the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of terror in others, by the smallest quantity of suffering in the victim. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a>, perhaps the sole end of punishment, is to restrain by the example; because, with respect to the individual whom you have got, if you think society in any danger from him, you can keep him in sight, and no more is required. Yet, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> we hear about the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-TREAD\">tread</a>-mill, and hear from the mouths of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> persons, implies, that hardly anything more is in their minds, than the effect upon the individual sufferers, \"Nothing finer than the tread-mill; a fellow who has been in the tread-mill never comes back again.\" Be it so; but by your leave, this is a very insignificant part of the question.\n\nThe choice of expedients, for obtaining the punishment best adapted to the several cases for which a course of reformatory discipline does not suffice, belongs to another head of inquiry, and must, for the present purpose, be regarded as determined. All that Prisons and it is necessary for us to show here is, that a prison is not the proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> for it, nor the instruments of a prison the proper instruments. To render a punishment the most efficacious in accomplishing the great end of punishment, it must be a punishment calculated to make the strongest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> upon the senses, and, through the senses, upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>, of the public at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>; more especially of that part of the public who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> under the strongest temptations to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> of similar crimes. But the punishments inflicted in a prison are withdrawn from the senses of the public, and seem as if they were intended to make the smallest possible, not the greatest possible, impression upon the imaginations of those who are to be deterred from crime. They are defective, therefore, in the most essential <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of a punishment, and can always be supplied by better means of attaining the same end.\n\nThe proper idea of a prison is that of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of custody, and that alone. This idea ought to be clearly, and distinctly, and steadily preserved in the mind, in all disquisitions respecting prison discipline. Punishment and reformatory discipline may be annexed to safe custody; and in as far as they consist of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of operations, requiring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> for their performance, it is essential to them. As reformatory discipline consists wholly in such a series, imprisonment is a necessary condition of it. Since many, also, of the best kinds of punishment are not such as can be executed all at once, but require a period of time, imprisonment is equally necessary for these punishments. But though you must have safe custody to enable you to execute certain punishments, and also to enable you to carry into effect a course of reformatory discipline, safe custody is not the same thing with punishment, nor the same thing with reformatory discipline; and no conclusions can be depended upon, in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> so distinct are confounded.\n\nIII. Having thus considered prisons, as instruments of safe custody, and as instruments of punishment; two of the purposes to which they have been applied as means; it remains, that we consider them, as instruments of reformatory discipline, the third of the purposes to which they have been applied.\n\nIt is necessary, first of all, to state a clear idea of reformatory discipline.\n\nWhen offences, against which it is necessary that society should have protection, are committed, it is desirable that the punishment of the offender should have three properties; 1st, That it should deter all other persons from committing a similar offence, which is its most important <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>. 2dly, That it should have the effect of deterring the man himself from a repetition of the offence. 3dly, That it should have the effect of removing his former bad habits, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTING\">planting</a> useful habits in their stead. It is this last property which is sought to be communicated to his punishment by reformatory discipline.\n\nAs the creating and destroying of habits is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of time, and as the restraint of safe custody, and restraint from all indulgences, except under certain conditions, are necessary to reformatory discipline, whatever punishment is involved in such protracted\nPrisons and coercion, is a necessary part of reformatory discipline.\n\nWhat is desired is, to create a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of doing useful acts, in order to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> the habit of doing hurtful acts. To accomplish this, means must be obtained of making the individual in question perform certain acts, and abstain from the performance of certain other acts.\n\nThe means to be employed for producing performance cannot be of more than two sorts; the pleasurable, and the painful. A man may be induced to perform certain acts, either by punishment, or reward. He may be made to abstain from performing certain acts by an additional means, by withholding the power of performing them.","sp":436,"ep":438},{"h":"PRISONS AND PRISON DISCIPLINE","t":"The arrangements necessary to adapt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-PRISONS\">prisons</a> to the ends for which they are designed, seem to require little more than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of practical good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>; and yet the manner in which the practice of the world blunders on from one absurdity, and very often from one atrocity, to another, shows pretty distinctly, how little the public affairs of mankind have hitherto had the benefit of that practical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> of any thing that resembles it.\n\nPrisons have been applied to three purposes: 1stly, That of safe custody; 2dly, That of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>; 3dly, That of reformation.\n\nIt is very evident, that each of these purposes requires an arrangement of means peculiar to itself.\n\nThough each requires a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of means peculiar to itself, it does not follow that, of the means required for each, a portion may not be the same in all. Every body <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> acknowledge that this is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>.\n\nThe means of safe custody, for instance, are equally required for those who are imprisoned in order to be punished and those who are imprisoned in order that they may be reformed, as for those who are imprisoned to the sole end of being made present at a particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>.\n\nThe arrangements, then, for safe custody, form a basis, on which every combination of means for attaining any of the other ends of imprisonment must always be erected. Other means for the attainment of these ends are to be considered as accessions to those required for the first.\n\nIt is a corollary from this position, that the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> may, at one and the same time, be employed for all the three purposes. Those properties in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> which make it fittest, at the least expense, for safe custody, make it fittest also for the purposes either of punishment or of reformation. This will be rendered abundantly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> in the sequel; and from the single circumstance, that the means of punishment and reformation are only additions to those of safe custody, it wants not much of its demonstration already. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> the arrangements needed, for those who are to be punished, and those who are to be reformed, interfere not with one another, or with those needed on account of the persons in safe custody merely, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of the corollary is indisputable; for nobody will deny that, in point of economy, there must be very great advantage.\n\nI. We shall consider, first of all, what is the best combination of means for safe custody. Dungeons and fetters are the expedient of a barbarous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>. And in respect of prisons, as of every thing which comes within the precincts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, the expedients of a barbarous age are, with great industry, retained in those which are civilized; they are, indeed, not only retained with great industry, but preserved with a success which, if it were not experienced, would be altogether incredible. As the expedients of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a>-\n\nbarous age are still preserved in many more of the arrangements for the purposes of law, so it is but of yesterday that the prisons of our forefathers have been regarded as fit for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REFORM\">reform</a>, or the means which in their ancestral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> those sages devised for attaining the ends of imprisonment were supposed capable of being altered for the better, by their less instructed sons.\n\nIt is at last, however, allowed, that inspection is a means for safe custody, which renders unnecessary all but very ordinary means of any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>. Thus, so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> is, and knows that he is, under the eyes of persons able and willing to prevent him, there is very little danger of his making an attempt, which he sees would be vain, to effect a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREACH\">breach</a> in the wall, or force open the door, of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CELL\">cell</a>. Any great strength, therefore, in such wall or door, as well as fetters upon any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his body, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of which is to make provision against such attempts, are wholly unnecessary; since the attempts are sure of not being made, or of being instantly frustrated.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of a prison, in which the power of inspection is rendered so complete, that the prisoner may be, and cannot know but that he is, under the eyes of his keepers, every moment of his time, and which we owe to General Bentham, so universally known for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> genius, is described by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> entitled Panopticon, or Inspection House; where also a system of management is delineated, and its principles are so perfectly expounded, and proved, that they who proceed in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a>, with the principle of utility before them, can do little else than travel in his steps.\n\nAn idea of the contrivance may be conveyed in a few words. It is a circular building, of the width of a cell, and of any height; carried round a space, which remains vacant in the middle. The cells are all open inwards, having an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> grating instead of a wall, and, of course, are visible in every part to an eye properly placed in the vacant space. A narrow tower rises in the middle of that space, called the inspection tower, which serves for the residence of the keepers, and in which, by means of windows and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-BLINDS\">blinds</a>, they can see without being seen; the cells, by lights properly disposed, being capable of being rendered as visible by night as by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>.\n\nWe have thus provision for safe custody; and along with it, five other important purposes are gained. First of all, there is great economy; the vast expense of thick, impenetrable walls, being rendered unnecessary. Secondly, All pretence for subjecting prisoners to the torture and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEGRADATION\">degradation</a> of irons is taken away. Thirdly, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a> misbehaviour of the prisoners can elude observation, and instant correction. Fourthly, No negligence, or corruption, or cruelty, on the part of the subordinate agents in the prison, can escape the view of their principals. And, Fifthly, No misconduct towards the prisoners, on the part\nof their principals, can remain unknown to the public, who may obtain a regulated admittance into the inspection tower, and regulated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> with the prisoners.\n\nThe persons who are liable to be in prison, for sure custody merely, are of three classes. First, Persons apprehended, and about to be put on their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>, for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> of a crime. Secondly, Persons convicted of a crime, and about to receive their punishment; and, Thirdly, Debtors.\n\nUnder a good system of law, very little provision would need to be made for these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>. It is one of the essential properties of a good system of law to permit as little time as possible to intervene between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> and trial, and between the conviction and punishment, of a person for a crime. There would never, therefore, be many such persons in any prison at a time. And under a good system of law, there never would be any body in a prison on account of debt.* This is mentioned merely to show how little, under a good system of law, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> and expense of a separate prison, for this set of cases, would be wanted.\n\nThese persons being inmates of a prison, for insuring their presence merely, the question is, What treatment they ought to receive?\n\nPersons in prison before trial, and debtors, are persons of whom nothing is certainly known, but that they are unfortunate. They are, therefore, entitled to all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a> which is due to the unfortunate.\n\nWhat is done for them in a prison must, however, be done at the expense of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a>, that is, by sacrifices demanded of those who are not in prison; and those sacrifices ought, undoubtedly, to be the smallest possible. The question is, therefore, to be settled by a compromise between the principle of benevolence, and the principle of economy.\n\nThe principle of benevolence undoubtedly requires that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> of the prisoners should not be impaired; for this, imputing the premature loss of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, is in reality the punishment of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, inflicted upon those to whom no punishment is due.\n\nThat health may not be impaired, three things are indispensable:\u20141. A wholesome apartment; 2. A sufficiency of wholesome food; 3. Sufficient clothing.\n\nThe principle of economy, with equal certainty, exacts, that all those should be of the cheapest possible kind.\n\nAll this is abundantly clear. It is equally clear that, with respect to those who are in prison for safe custody merely, the principle of benevolence requires, and the principle of economy does not forbid, that they should be free to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a>, which costs nothing, or which they provide for themselves; and that no farther restraint should be placed upon their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> than the custody of their persons, and the rule of economy, which prescribes the limits and accommodations of the place, may demand.\n\nFew words will be necessary to show what is appropriate to the case of the man, who is in prison during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> between his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> and his punishment.\n\nBy the supposition, in this case, his punishment is something distinct from his imprisonment; because, if not, it is a case which comes under another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, namely, that of persons who are in prison for the sake of punishment; and will be fully considered in another part of this discourse.\n\nIf he is in prison for detention merely, his punishment, as meted out and fixed by the judge, being something wholly separate; every particle of hardship, imposed upon him, not necessary for his detention, is something without law, and contrary to law; is as much injustice and a crime, when inflicted upon him, as if inflicted upon any other member of the community. The same considerations, which, as we found above, ought to regulate the imprisonment of debtors, and persons in custody before trial, namely, the compromise between the principles of benevolence and the principle of economy; apply, without the smallest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a>, to the case of persons who, during the interval between their sentence and its execution, are in prison for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> purpose of preventing their escape.\n\nWe foresee a difficulty, or rather an objection, for there is really no difficulty in the case.\n\nPersons come into prisons, who have been accustomed, in the preceding part of their lives, to all degrees of delicate and indulgent living; to whom, therefore, the hard fare prescribed by the principle of economy will occasion very different degrees of uneasiness.\n\nSuch persons, when in prison for safe custody merely (what is required when persons are in prison for punishment, or for reformation, will be seen hereafter), may be allowed to make use of any funds which they may possess for procuring to themselves all unexceptionable indulgences. They may be also allowed the exercise of any lucrative art, consistent with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the prison, for procuring to themselves the means of such indulgences. This the principle of benevolence dictates, and there is nothing in the principle of economy which forbids it.\n\nWe shall be told, however, that there are persons, who have been accustomed to a delicate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of living, and who come into prison without the command of any funds, or the knowledge of any art, by which they may soften the hardship of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOT\">lot</a>: and we shall be asked what is the course which our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> recommends for the treatment of them? The course which it recommends is very clear. Such persons are paupers, and whatsoever treatment is fit for paupers of the description to which they belong, is fit also for them. If there are\n\n* If evident fraud were committed in contracting the debt, or if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of others obtained by loan, had evidently been dishonestly spent, or dishonestly risked, such fraud, or dishonesty, being crimes, not a debt, might justly subject a man to imprisonment, or any other sort of due punishment.\nII. Having stated what appears to us necessary for illustrating the principles which ought to regulate the imprisonment of those, in respect to whom safe custody is the end in view, we come, in the next place, to the case of those, in respect to whom, in addition to safe custody, punishment is to be effected through the same medium.\n\nThis subject we shall unfortunately be under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of treating superficially; because, in order to explain it fully, we ought to have before us the whole doctrine of punishment; and, for this purpose, a development too extensive for the present purpose, would be required.\n\nThis we may assume as an indisputable principle; that whatever punishment is to be inflicted, should be determined by the judge, and by him alone; that it should be determined by its adaptation to the crime; and that it should not be competent to those to whom the execution of the sentence of the judge is entrusted, either to go beyond the line which he has drawn, or to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> short of it.\n\nWe have already established, on what seemed sufficient reasons, that for persons confined, on account of safe custody merely, the cheapest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a>, not importing injury to health, in respect to apartment, food, and clothing, should alone be provided at the public expense.\n\nUnless in the case of those whom the judge might condemn to lose a portion of their health, as the punishment due to them, by the sufferings of an unwholesome prison, unwholesome food, or improper clothing, this accommodation ought to be afforded even to those who are placed in prisons for the sake of punishment. And if it should be thought that the loss of health never can be a proper punishment, if it has never been regarded as such even by savages, and is repudiated by every principle of reason, then it follows, that the accommodations which we have described in the former part of this discourse, as required in the case of prisoners detained for safe custody, are required in the case of prisoners of every description.\n\nThis is a basis, therefore, upon which every thing is to rest. In every rational system of prison management, this is an essential condition. We are now to see in what manner, upon this footing, punishment, by means of imprisonment, is to be effected.\n\nOne mode is sufficiently obvious and sufficiently known. The punishment may be rendered more or less severe by its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>. Want of liberty is, in almost all cases, a source of uneasiness; want of liberty, added to the denial of all pleasures of sense, can hardly ever fail to be a source of great uneasiness. A long imprisonment therefore, with the cheapest accommodation not importing injury to health, must be a severe punishment. This, it is evident, may be graduated to more or less of severity, not only by degrees of time, but the use of such means as the prisoner might command for procuring accommodations and indulgences.\n\nTo this imprisonment may be added solitude. But though we mention this, as a practicable addition to simple imprisonment, it is well known how little, unless for short periods, and on very particular occasions, it is to be recommended.\n\nThe modes, which lately have been most in repute, of adding to the severity of simple imprisonment for the purpose of punishment, have been two; 1st, Hard labour; and, 2dly, Bad prisons, and bad management in those prisons.\n\n1. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of labour which appears to have obtained the preference is that of treading in a wheel.\n\nIf a criminal in a prison is ever to be let out again, and to mix in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>, it is desirable that nothing should be done, and least of all done on purpose, to make him a worse member of society than when he went in. There cannot be a worse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of a punishment, than that it has a tendency to corrupt and deteriorate the individual on whom it is inflicted; unless, indeed, he is a prisoner for life; in that case, people of a certain temper might say, that making worse his disposition is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of little importance; and to them we have no time to make any reply.\n\nMost of those persons who come into prison as criminals, are bad, because they have hated labour, and have had recourse to other means than their industry of attaining the supply of their wants and the gratification of their desires. People of industry, people who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> labour, seldom become the criminal inmates of a prison.\n\nOne thing, however, is pretty certain, that men seldom become in love with their punishments. If the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> cause of the crimes which have brought a man to punishment is his not having a love but hatred of labour; to make labour his punishment, is only to make him hate it the more. If the more a man hates labour, the more he is likely to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> as a bad member of society; to punish a man with labour, and then to turn him out upon society, is a course of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEGISLATION\">legislation</a> which savours not of the highest wisdom.\n\nBesides, in treating labour as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> of punishment, call it hard labour, if you will, what sort of a lesson do you teach to the industrious and laborious class, who form the great body of your people? To those whose lot is labour, whose lot is hard labour, harder than any which it is in your power to impose? What compulsory labour is so hard as many species of voluntary labour?\n\nAs an instrument of reformation, labour, as we shall presently see, is invaluable. As an instrument of punishment, hardly anything can be conceived more exceptionable. That which is the source of all that mankind enjoy, that which is the foundation of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> in the most numerous class of the community, would you stamp with ignominy and dishonour, by inflicting it as a punishment upon the worst and basest of your people? Is this your expedient for rendering it, what every wise <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEGISLATOR\">legislator</a> would wish to render it, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a>, and thence desirable?\nThere are other objections, perfectly decisive, against labour as a punishment. It operates with more inequality than almost any other instrument of punishment that ever has been invented. The same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of labour would kill one man, that another would be only a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASTIME\">pastime</a>. From this source we may apprehend the most horrid abuses, in the continuance of those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-TREAD\">tread</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MILLS\">mills</a>. We may be very sure, that the most atrocious cruelty will often be inflicted upon those who, with strength below the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> standard, are placed in those penal engines; while, in the case of those whose strength is much above that standard, they will hardly operate as a punishment at all.\n\nIt is impossible that the judge can <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> out this punishment; because the judge has not the means of ascertaining the relative strength of the parties who come before him. It must, therefore, be left to the jailor. The jailor, not the judge, will mete out and determine the degree of suffering which each individual is to undergo. The jailor, not the judge, is the man who adapts the punishment to the crime. Hence one of the stains which mark a careless and stupid legislation.\n\nIt is a far inferior, though still no inconsiderable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of a blundering legislation, that the labour, if labour it must be, is not of such a sort as to be useful. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> of a wheel, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> labour, when so many better means of turning it are possessed in abundance, is destitute of even this recommendation. It stands upon a similar footing with the contrivance of the jailor, whom Mr Bentham celebrates: \"We are told somewhere,\" he says, \"towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of Sully's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a>, that for some time after the decease of that great and honest minister, certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> mounts were to be seen at no great distance from his house. These mounts were so many monuments of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CHARITY\">charity</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> in his neighbourhood happened to have industry to spare, and the best employment he would find for it was, to remove dirt from the place where it lay to another where it was of no use. By the mere force of innate genius, and without having ever put himself to school to learn economy of a French minister, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> English jailor, whom Howard met with, was seen practising this revived species of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYRAMID\">pyramid</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINIATURE\">miniature</a>. He had got a parcel of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> together at one end of his yard, and set the prisoners to bring them to the other: the task achieved, Now, says he, you may fetch them back again. Being asked what was the object of this industry, his answer was, 'To <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAGUE\">plague</a> the prisoners.'\"\u2014In a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> on this passage, Mr Bentham says, \"I beg the jailor's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARDON\">pardon</a>; what is above was from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>; his contrivance was the setting them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> wood with a blunt saw, made blunt on purpose. The removers of mounts were a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMITTEE\">committee</a> of justices.\"\n\n2. Bad prisons, and bad management in these prisons, is a mode of punishment, the recommendation of which has lately been revived, after we might have hoped that, in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> at least, it was exploded for ever. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of such recommendation has, on several recent occasions, been heard in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a>; and an article on Prison <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">Discipline</a>, which lately appeared in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> Review, cannot be interpreted in any other sense. Even the Committee of the Society for the Improvement of Prison Discipline have not been able to withstand the force of what they may have supposed to be fashionable doctrine. In their Fourth Report, lately published, which we are sorry to say evinces more of good intention, than of enlightened views for its guidance, they say: \"No <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> can be more mistaken and unfounded, than that the plans recommended by this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> are calculated to introduce comfort into gaols. The committee are of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, and have always contended, that severe punishment must form the basis of an effective system of prison discipline;\" thereby confounding two things, punishment, and prison discipline; which are totally distinct; and between which, it is of so much importance to preserve the distinction, that without it not a rational idea can be entertained about either.\n\nNo doubt crimes must be punished. Who needs instruction upon that head? But when the judge has prescribed, that, in a particular way, which he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> out, a particular measure of pain shall be inflicted upon an individual; and when the individual is taken, and made to sustain the operations through which the pain is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a>; what has this to do with the discipline of the prison? It is an act or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of acts, sui generis; acts not forming any part of the ordinary course of prison management; acts which would not have taken place, which ought not to have taken place, if the judge had not commanded them, and which were performed solely and exclusively in obedience to his commandment. This is the nature of punishment,\u2014other punishment than this there ought to be none.\n\nThe Committee would make severe punishment the basis of prison discipline! What business have the Committee with punishment? The assigning of punishment the legislature have given to other and fitter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>; to those who take cognizance of the offence, and alone ought to measure the punishment. Saying they would make punishment the basis of prison discipline, what do they intend by this ill-contrived <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>? Do they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a>, that their jailor shall hold the scales, and weigh out the proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a>? If not, how are they to be understood? for if not the jailor but the judge is to weigh, and the jailor is to do nothing but punctually carry the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRESCRIPTION\">prescription</a> of the judge into execution, then is punishment, in no proper sense of the word, any part of prison discipline. It is a separate operation, performed on a particular occasion, because prescribed by the judge, and in the exact manner in which the judge has prescribed it. If it is, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, a part of prison discipline, then all the horrid consequences, inseparable from making the jailor the judge and meter of punishment, present themselves to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>; and he who can endure to look at them may dwell upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> of a prison, wherein the poor will not be more comfortable than at home, nor by the charms of imprisonment enticed to the commission of crimes.\n\nNothing can more clearly indicate that state of mind, which consists in confusion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a>, than","sp":424,"ep":436},{"h":"QUEEN'S COUNTY","t":"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEINSTER\">Leinster</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>, bounded by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KILDARE\">Kildare</a> on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>, Carlow on the east, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KILKENNY\">Kilkenny</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIPPERARY\">Tipperary</a> on the south, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">King</a>'s County on the west; about 32 English miles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, and 25 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, and containing about 600 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> miles, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> 384,000 English acres. It is divided into eight baronies and 50 parishes, the latter belonging to the Sees of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEIGHLIN\">Leighlin</a>, Ossory, Kildare, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KILLALOE\">Killaloe</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PORTARLINGTON\">Portarlington</a>, its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> town, on the northern side of the county, is situated in north latitude 53\u00b0 9' 30\", and west <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a> 7\u00b0 13'.\n\nExcepting on the boundary with King's County, where the Sliabh-bloom <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> rise to a considerable height, this district is generally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a>; so much so, that notwithstanding considerable tracts of bog, about three-fourths of the whole are said to be cultivated. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, though various, is for the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> fit for producing all the usual crops; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">limestone</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANURE\">manure</a> abounds in every townland. In the south-eastern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>, near Carlow, coal, similar to that of Kilkenny, is wrought to a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> ore, sandstone, marble, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARL\">marl</a>, and a variety of clays, have been found in various parts. Besides a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of small streams, it has two considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARROW\">Barrow</a> and the Nore, which, having their source among the mountains on the west, flow, the former north-east and then south, and the latter south-east, until they meet at New Ross, in the county of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEXFORD\">Wexford</a>, after which they are joined by the Suir from the west, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATERFORD\">Waterford</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">Bay</a>. Next to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHANNON\">Shannon</a> these are the most considerable rivers in Ireland. The Barrow is navigable from New Ross upwards to Carlow and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATHY\">Athy</a>, from which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> by a canal to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUBLIN\">Dublin</a>. The Nore is also navigable for a few miles, but not in this county. After their junction at New Ross, there is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> sufficient for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> ships downwards to the sea. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a>'s County, therefore, though an inland district, has the advantage of ready access by water both to the east and south coasts of Ireland.\n\nMuch of this county is divided into large estates, worth from \u00a35000 to \u00a315,000 a-year and upwards. Some of the most valuable, having been let on perpetual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LEASES\">leases</a>, afford a large income to the lessees. It is these lessees who form the middle class of gentry, with clear incomes of from \u00a3100 to \u00a3800 per annum, obtained from tenants to whom their lands are sublet at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACK\">rack</a>-rent, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> in very small farms. These leases are usually for 21 years and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. The principal proprietors are the Marquis of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DROGHEDA\">Drogheda</a>; Lords De Vesci, Ossory, Ashbrooke, Stanhope, Castlecote, and Portarlington; Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> Coote, Mr Parnell, Mr Strange, and Mr Wellesley Pole, now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARYBOROUGH\">Maryborough</a>. Here and in King's County, Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WAKEFIELD\">Wakefield</a> observed some of the best farming in Ireland, with much more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to a systematic course of cropping, and to keeping the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> in good heart. Oxen and horses are used for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLOUGH\">plough</a>, the former generally preceding the latter. A good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of cheese is made here for the Dublin market. In other respects the rural economy of this district does not differ materially from that of the Irish counties already described.\n\nThere is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> large town in Queen's County. Maryborough, the county town, though pleasantly situated near the Barrow, is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of no consideration. Portarlington, partly in King's County, noted for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a>, and for its being the residence of the smaller gentry, is the most extensive and populous. Mountmellick, Mountrath, Ballynakill, and Stradbally, are only villages. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a> are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> and coarse woollens, to no great extent; and its exports chiefly corn and other kinds of land produce.\n\nIn 1813 the number of inhabitants was 113,857; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a>, in 1821 the number was 129,391, making an increase of 15,534. The county sends two members to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a>, and the town of Portarlington a third.

But though placed in such unfavourable circumstances, young Quesnay was imbued with an ardent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of knowledge, and with a strong desire to emerge from the painful and obscure life in which he had been brought up. The Maison Rustique of Liebaut was the first book that came into his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>; and he is said to have learned to read it by the assistance of a few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LESSONS\">lessons</a> he received from a gardener of the village! The perusal of this book, which seems to have had a material influence on his future studies, awakened his latent powers, and stimulated him to make further efforts to extend his information. Having acquired a competent knowledge of his vernacular tongue, by the eager <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> of such French books as came within his reach, he next applied himself to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of the dead languages; and speedily attained, partly by the slender assistance of a self-dubbed surgeon of the village, but chiefly by his own extraordinary industry and sagacity, to a tolerable proficiency in Latin and Greek.\n\nQuesnay now resolved, in opposition to the wishes of his parents, and especially of his mother, to devote himself to the profession of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SURGERY\">surgery</a>, and received the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> of his instruction in that art from the village <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a> who had assisted him in his philological studies. But the pupil very soon surpassed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>; and when the latter applied to be admitted into the Ma\u00eetrise, or Corporation of Surgeons, he presented, as testimonials of his skill in his profession, and of his capacity to practise it with advantage, some Essays which Quesnay had written, and which were received with very great applause. Quesnay was not privy to this rise; but soon after its occurrence he left his paternal village, and set out to prosecute his studies at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>. We are not informed by what means he supported himself in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, nor how <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> he remained there: while, however, his indefatigable industry and zeal enabled him to make great progress in his studies, his merit and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a> procured him several friends. Besides attending the lectures on the various branches of surgery, and the different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOSPITALS\">hospitals</a>, he found leisure to devote some portion of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> to metaphysical researches, and the study of philosophy, for which the perusal of the Recherche de la V\u00e9rit\u00e9 of Malebranche had given him a very decided <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>. Nay, such was the almost unparalleled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> and vigour of his mind, that having accidentally met, during his stay in Paris, with the celebrated M. Cochin, of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> Academy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAINTING\">Painting</a>, he put himself under his tuition; and we are told, that he profited so well by the few lessons he received as to be able not only to take remarkably good likenesses, but to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> and engrave, with his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, the various <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> skeleton, in a manner which would not have disgraced the most skilful artists!\n\nOn finishing his studies at Paris, Quesnay formed the design of establishing himself as a surgeon in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANTES\">Mantes</a>, a considerable town in his native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a>, and presented himself to the surgeons of its Ma\u00eetrise for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>. But they refused, from jealousy of his talents, to admit him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>. He was thus laid under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of returning to Paris, where he passed his examinations with eclat; and received letters ordering him to be admitted into the Ma\u00eetrise of Mantes in 1718.\n\nHaving established himself at Mantes, his reputation soon extended itself. He was employed by some of the first families in the neighbourhood, and, among others, by that of the Marshall de Noailles, Duc de Villeroi, who persuaded him to leave his residence in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, and to accompany him to Paris as his surgeon, as nearly as we can collect in 1729 or 1730. An incident not long after occurred, which had the most material influence on his future prospects and life. Having accompanied the Duc de Villeroi to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of the Comtesse d'Estrades, Quesnay remained behind in the carriage while the Duc went in to visit that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">Lady</a>, who, during the interview, was suddenly seized with an epileptic fit. The Duc called in Quesnay, who, on perceiving the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the attack, with singular presence of mind instantly ordered the Duc and the other attendants out of the room, and managed so well as to succeed in concealing the malady. The Comtesse was so much pleased with the dexterity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> of Quesnay, that she lost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> time in recommending him to her all-powerful friend, Madame d'Estr\u00e9es, afterwards Marquise de Pompadour, who made him her physician: and, besides obtaining for him apartments at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSAILLES\">Versailles</a>, procured him, in 1737, the place of Surgeon in Ordinary to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">King</a>.\u2020\n\n* It is stated in the Eloge Historique of Quesnay, in the Memoires de l'Academie des Sciences for 1774, that he was the son of an advocat en Parlement, who practised at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MONTFORT\">Montfort</a>, and that he was born at Mercey. But it is difficult to suppose, had his father been in such a station, that his education would have been so entirely neglected. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIEF\">brief</a> but interesting notice of Quesnay, given by Mr Crawfurd, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> to the Journal of Madame du Hausset, femme-de-chambre de Madame de Pompadour, et l'amie de Quesnay, in the Melanges d'Histoire et de Literature (p. 276), he is stated to have been the son of a labourer. This is also the statement in the Encyclopedie Methodique. According to the notice prefixed by Dupont to the Eloge of M. Gournay in the third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the Oeuvres de Turgot, Quesnay was the son d'un propri\u00e9taire cultivateur.\n\n\u2020 This incident is related by Mr Crawfurd, Melanges, p. 276, and is referred to by Marmontel.\nQuesnay was shortly after appointed Secretary to the Royal Academy of Surgery, established in 1731; and besides several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> on particular branches of surgery, he contributed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-PREFACE\">preface</a> to the first volume of its Memoires; which has always been reckoned peculiarly valuable for its profound and discriminating observations on the respective uses of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> and observation in the physical sciences, and on the assistance which they reciprocally lend to each other.\n\nHaving from an early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> been much subject to the gout, and becoming, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, less able to discharge his duties as a surgeon, Quesnay took the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of Doctor of Medicine in 1744; and was soon after appointed, through the influence of his patroness, to the important place of consulting physician to his Majesty. In this capacity he attended <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> in the campaigns of 1744 and 1745; and amid the distractions of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAMP\">camp</a>, collected and prepared the greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the materials for his Trait\u00e9 de Fievres, published in 1753.\n\nHis appointment to the situation of Physician to the King was preceded by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> of letters of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a>, issued on occasion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a> of the Dauphin from the small-pox. Louis, who was much struck with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> and solidity of Quesnay's remarks, and who familiarly called him son penseur, gave him, in allusion to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a>, three pansey <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a> (in French pens\u00e9es), for his arms, with the motto Propert cognitio nem mentis.\n\nThe leisure Quesnay now enjoyed, enabled him to prosecute his studies with greater assiduity. In 1747, he republished an enlarged edition, in 3 tomes, 12mo, of his Essai Physique sur l'Economie Animale, originally published in 1736; in 1748, he published an Examen impartial des Contestations des Medecins et des Chirurgiens de Paris; in 1749, he published a Memoire sur la Sagesse de l'Ancienne <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEGISLATION\">Legislation</a> de la Chirurgie en France, and two separate treatises, in 12mo, the one on Suppuration, and the other, De la Gangrene; in 1750, he republished his Trait\u00e9 des Effets et de l'Usage de la Saign\u00e9e, written during his residence at Mantes, and originally published in 1730; and in 1753, he published his Trait\u00e9 des Fievres Continues, in 2 tomes 12mo.\n\nThese works have been all held in very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> estimation; and an excellent judge has lately given it as his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that \"the Trait\u00e9 de la Gangrene is by far the most valuable publication which we yet possess upon this subject.\" Every page of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, he adds, \"is distinguished by the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a> for accurate observation, and perspicuous arrangement, which are so remarkable in all the other writings of Quesnay, this celebrated author.\" (Dr Thomson's Lectures on Inflammation, p. 502.)\n\nThe Trait\u00e9 des Fievres was the last of Quesnay's professional works. He appears to have henceforth comparatively abandoned his medical studies. At no period, indeed, had he allowed them exclusively to occupy his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, and he now devoted himself, in preference, to other and, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> possible, still more interesting inquiries. He had always entertained a strong predilection for agricultural pursuits, the effect, perhaps, of his situation in early life; and this, combined with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a> and metaphysical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> of his mind, seems to have led him to those peculiar notions respecting the paramount importance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a> as a source of wealth, and the constitution of society, which have rendered his name so justly celebrated in the history of economical science. The articles \"Fermier\" and \"Grains\" in the Encyclop\u00e9die, published in 1756 and 1757, contain the earliest development of his views on this subject. Both articles are written with great ability, and display an intimate acquaintance with the subject, considerable reading, and great powers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a>. In the article \"Grains\" the distinction between the produit total and the produit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">net</a>, between the productiveness of agriculture, and the unproductiveness of all other employments, the doctrine of the unrestricted freedom of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>, and most of the other leading principles in the theory of the economists, are distinctly stated and illustrated with much ingenuity and talent. The Tableau \u00c9conomique, and the Maximes G\u00e9n\u00e9rales du Gouvernement \u00c9conomique, annexed to it, under the title of Extraits des \u00c9conomies Royales, de M. de Sully, were printed, by the express command of the King, at Versailles in 1758, with the following very remarkable epigraph for a work brought forth under such auspices, Pauvres paysans, pauvres royaume; pauvres royaume, pauvre Souverain! The maxims, which contain a short but comprehensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> of Quesnay's system, were reprinted, together with an analysis of the Tableau, and a selection from various articles contributed by Quesnay, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of his peculiar doctrines, to the Journal d'Agriculture, and the Ephemerides du Citoyen,* in the collection of Quesnay's economical works, entitled Physiocratie, ou Constitution Naturelle du Gouvernement le plus Avantageux au Genre Humain, edited by his friend and scholar, Dupont, in 1767.\n\nWe have elsewhere entered at considerable length into an examination of the speculations of Quesnay and his followers, with respect to the constitution of po-\n\n---\n\n* The Ephemerides du Citoyen was begun in 1767, and was, for a few months, conducted by the Abb\u00e9 Baudeau, and then by Dupont. It was published monthly, and two numbers make a considerable duodecimo volume. The authors were all disciples of Quesnay, and zealous economists. Their discussions embraced only the moral and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> sciences; many branches of which they have treated with much ability and acuteness. There is a valuable Eloge of Quesnay in one of the numbers for 1775, written by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTE\">Conte</a> d'Albon. The following extract from the approbation given by the Censeur to the third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> for 1770 is curious: \"J'exhorte,\" says he, \"de nouveau les auteurs de ce Journal, \u00e0 r\u00e9sister \u00e0 la tentation de critiquer\u2014Le bonheur du citoyen tient \u00e0 sa confiance\u2014On peut et l'on doit quelquefois avertir en secret ceux qui sont pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s \u00e0 l'administration.

PART I.\nitical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a>, and the sources of public wealth. (See the articles Economists and Political Economy.) That there is a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> in them must be allowed; but this is far more than compensated by the many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a>, discriminating, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> views, and important discoveries, which they contain. Perhaps, however, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> merit of Quesnay, and the sect of which he was the founder, does not consist so much in the discoveries they made, as in their having been the earliest philosophers who perceived that the institutions of society ought always to harmonize with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> principles on which it is founded, or, as they termed it, with the *Ordre naturel et essentiel des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Politiques*. Economical science is defined by them to be, \"L'\u00e9tude et la d\u00e9monstration des loix de la nature, relatives \u00e0 la subsistance, et la multiplication du genre humain.\" L'observation universelle de ces loix est l'int\u00e9r\u00eat commun et g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de tous les hommes. La connaissance universelle de ces loix est donc le pr\u00e9alable indispensable, et le moyen n\u00e9cessaire du bonheur de tous.\" (*\u00c9phemerides du Citoyen*, 1769, No. II. p. 13.) It is to be regretted that, in investigating these laws, they proceeded almost entirely on abstract and speculative principles, without sufficiently attending to the effects of particular institutions, and to the various phenomena manifested in the progress of society. But notwithstanding the defective <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> in which the economists conducted their researches, they succeeded in establishing and elucidating many important principles; and there is certainly much more reason to wonder at the general correctness of their conclusions, than to feel surprised at the errors into which they fell. Quesnay and his disciples established, that society was formed for the purpose of securing the greatest possible advantage to its members; that the security of property and the freedom of industry were its essential bases; and that the proper business of the politician was not to interfere to regulate the pursuits of individuals, but to protect the equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> and liberties of all, and to secure the utmost freedom of competition in all the departments of industry. And though it is undoubtedly true, that most of these principles had been pointed out by previous writers, Quesnay and his school have the unquestionable merit of being the first who showed their dependence on each other, who presented them in a systematic and consistent form, and who were thus enabled to give a scientific demonstration of the injustice and impolicy of such institutions as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> or mistaken views of national <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> had established in opposition to them.\n\nIn our article on Political Economy we have shown the fallacy of Quesnay's opinion with respect to agriculture being the only source of wealth; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> of all ages sufficiently proves that the *despotisme l\u00e9gal*, in the hands of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> monarch, without *contrefores* of any kind, which he strangely supposed was the best of all possible governments, is about the very worst.*\n\nNotwithstanding his great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, and the sufferings he experienced from the almost incessant attacks of the gout, the activity of Quesnay's mind <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> unimpaired. *Il a*, said one of his friends, *une t\u00eate de trente ans sur un corps de quatre-vingts.* He contributed, subsequently, to the publication of the *Physiocratie*, many acute and able articles to the *\u00c9phemerides du Citoyen*; and continued wholly occupied with these studies and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a>, to which he had latterly begun to pay considerable attention, till his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, which took place at Versailles, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> 1774, in the 80th year of his age.\n\nQuesnay was a man of the most inflexible integrity; the nicest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a>; and the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-DISCRETION\">discretion</a>. Though highly esteemed by the King, and long resident at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">Court</a>, he never intermixed in the intrigues of which it was the constant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEATRE\">theatre</a>. No one ever scrupled to express himself freely in his presence, nor was the confidence placed in him ever betrayed. \"*Il recevoit chez lui des personnes de tous les partis, mais en petit nombre, et qui toutes avoient une grande confiance en lui. On y parlait tres hardiment de tout; et ce qui fait leur \u00e9loge et le sien, jamais on ne rien rep\u00eache.*\"\u2020\n\nTo the utmost frankness and sincerity, he added the easy address and polished manners of a courtier and the intelligence of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>. No man was ever less solicitous of distinguishing himself, or more careful to offend the self-esteem of others. His conversation was animated, without the least effort at brilliancy. So much, indeed, was he averse to every appearance of pretension, that he was in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of veiling the most profound remarks and observations, under the form of apologies, which generally referred to some subject connected with rural affairs, to which he was always particularly attached. He was most indulgent to the faults and errors of others, provided they were unalloyed by any taint of artifice or baseness, for which he never hesitated, whatever might be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of the party, to express the utmost contempt. Quesnay was truly a patriot and a philosopher. And we doubt much whether another instance can be produced of one who had lived so long in a profligate and luxurious Court, unsullied by its vices, and aloof from its contentions; and who preserved, to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> old age, all those generous and kindly feelings, with that unobtrusive but ardent zeal in the cause of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>, and that love of speculation and profound inquiry, which distinguished his earlier years.\n\nQuesnay, says Madame du Hausset, \"*\u00e9toit un <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> g\u00e9nie, suivant l'opinion de tous ceux qui\n\n---\n\n* We are at a loss to conjecture the grounds on which Mr Chalmers has presumed to affirm (*Biographical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DICTIONARY\">Dictionary</a>*, Vol. XXV.

Il \u00e9tait bien plus occup\u00e9 \u00e0 la cour de la meilleure mani\u00e8re de cultiver la terre que de tout ce que s'y passait.\" (Melanges, p. 313.)\n\n\"Tandis,\" says Marmontel, \"que les orages se formaient et se dissipent au-dessous de l'entresol de Quesnay, il griffonnait ses axiomes et ses calculs d'\u00e9conomie rustique, aussi tranquille, aussi indiff\u00e9rent \u00e0 ces mouvements de la cour, que s'il en e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 cent lieues de distance. L\u00e0-bas, on d\u00e9cidait de la paix, de la guerre, du choix des g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, du renvoi des ministres; et nous, dans l'entresol, nous raisonnions d'agriculture; nous calculions le produit net, ou quelquefois nous divisons galement avec Diderot, d'Alembert, Duclos, Helv\u00e9tius, Turgot, Buffon; et Mme de Pompadour, ne pouvant pas engager <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CETTE\">cette</a> troupe de philosophes \u00e0 descendre dans son salon, venait elle-m\u00eame les voir \u00e0 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> et causer avec eux.\"\n\nDr Smith was well acquainted with Quesnay. He frequently met with him during his residence at Paris in 1766; and while he bears the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> testimony to the \"modesty and simplicity\" of his character, he has pronounced his system to be, \"with all its imperfections, the nearest approximation to the truth that has yet been published on the subject of Political Economy.\" (Wealth of Nations, Vol. III. p. 28.) So highly, indeed, was Dr Smith impressed with a sense of his merits, as a man and a philosopher, that it was his intention, had he not been prevented by Quesnay's death, to have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSCRIBED\">inscribed</a> to him the Wealth of Nations. (Mr Stewart's Account of the Life and Writings of Dr Smith.)\n\nQuesnay had a son by his wife, to whom he was united when at Mantes. He gave him an excellent education; and exhibited a striking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of his disinterestedness, by constantly refusing to solicit for him any place or situation under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>.\n\nThis son ultimately settled in the country on an estate near Beauvoir. One of Quesnay's grandsons was appointed by Turgot to a place in the administration; and another entered the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, and acted as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">captain</a> of infantry at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> of Jemappes.\n\nNo man was ever more esteemed by his friends than Quesnay, and none ever existed who was more ready to do all in his power to advance their interests. Mercier de la Riviere, the author of the work Sur l'ordre Naturel et Essentiel des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Politiques, and who had been Intendant at Martinique, seems to have occupied the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> place in his esteem, and was regarded by him as the only person in France who was qualified to conduct the administration of the Finances. He was also much attached to the Marquis de Mirabeau, Turgot, Dupont, the Abb\u00e9 Baudeau, and the other leading economists, who willingly acknowledged him for their master, and enthusiastically exerted themselves to defend and propagate his doctrines. \"The economists were in reality, and not merely in appearance, a sect of philosophers.\n\nSecta fuit servare modum, finemque tuiri Naturaeque sequi, ritumque imprenderi vero, Nec sibi sed tibi genitum se credere mundo.\n\nThey acted from honest zeal for the truth, and not from fashion, eccentric tastes, or the love of singularity; their sole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> was to enlighten and improve mankind; and to them, among political inquirers, belongs the rare praise of having first pointed out the natural order of things, or the observed course of nature in the conduct of the world, as the example and guide of human policy.\"\n\n(s. s.)","sp":455,"ep":459},{"h":"RAILWAY","t":"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> carriage-way, in which the track of the carriage-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHEELS\">wheels</a> being laid with bars, or rails, of wood, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, or metal, the carriage is more easily drawn along this smooth surface than over an ordinary road.\n\nWooden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RAILWAYS\">railways</a> are said to have been introduced at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEWCASTLE\">Newcastle</a> coal-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> so early as the year 1680, for transporting the coals from the mouth of the pits to the ships in the river Tyne. Even at that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, many of these mines employed each of them 400 or 500 carts in this traffic; it became, therefore, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of manifest importance to reduce the great expense thereby incurred in the keeping up of horses, drivers, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a>; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of wooden rails was the best, and, indeed, the only effectual method which could at that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> have been devised for the purpose; for which also the situation was in other respects favourable, presenting in most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> an easy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> towards the river. These railways then were very generally introduced, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> period in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>. Slips of ground of the requisite breadth for the railway were marked out between the coal-pits and the river, and were either leased by the coal owners, or purchased of the different proprietors whose ground the proposed line of road intersected in its course. To obtain the most easy and regular descent, this line was varied in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> to meet the inequalities of the ground; or, where these inequalities were inconsiderable, it was carried straight forward, and the regular slope made up by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-EMBANKMENTS\">embankments</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a>. The ground being then smoothed and levelled as for an ordinary road, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> logs of wood, termed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SLEEPERS\">sleepers</a>, cut in lengths equal to the breadth of the road, were laid across it, and firmly bedded into it at short distances, to sustain and hold fast the rails, or slips of wood, on which the waggon-wheels were intended to run. These rails were made of beech, and were laid end to end, so as to form two continued <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> of rail or wooden ridges, running <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to each other, along each side of the road, crossing the large logs at each of their extremities, on which they rested as on so many foundations; and were also nailed, or otherwise secured, to keep each piece in its proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>. The waggons were of the usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a>, but of a large size, so as to contain several tons of coals, and set upon low wheels; the smoothness of the way rendering wheels of the ordinary size unnecessary. On these rails a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> could readily draw three tons of coals from the pits to the river. Where any steep declivity occurred on the road, this was termed a run, or an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-INCLINED_PLANE\">inclined <a cl</a>ass=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a>; and on it the descent of the waggons was retarded, and regulated by a species of brake, or crooked <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEVER\">lever</a>, termed a convey, attached to the waggon and managed by the driver. The banks of the Tyne, near Newcastle, are remarkably steep on each side; but instead of forming inclined planes on them, the railway was here continued on a wooden stage, raised to the same height as the top <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a> of the river, and carried forward until it came perpendicularly over the river side, where a wooden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATFORM\">platform</a>, termed a staith, was erected for the convenience of delivering the coals; the waggons being emptied into a trough, or spout, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> which the coals descended either directly into the ships, or into the store below.\n\nSuch was the construction of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> railways, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> railways in which we evidently perceive all the parts and members of the railway as it is formed at the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>; viz. the regular-formed road, the rails, the sleepers, the low waggons, and the inclined plane. Their only defect consisted in the soft and decaying <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the wood, the wear and tear of which caused such expense for repairs, as greatly limited their application; so that it was only the shortness of the distance, and the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of the traffic, which rendered their application at all beneficial. It was only about the year 1738 that they were attempted in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COLLIERIES\">collieries</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITEHAVEN\">Whitehaven</a>; and it does not appear that they were adopted in any other part of the kingdom. The use of iron, therefore, in place of wood, was an essential improvement in the construction of railways, and caused, indeed, a complete change in this, as it has done in every other branch of practical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a> into which it has been introduced. Flat bars of iron were at first fastened on the top of the wooden rails; but after various unsuccessful attempts, the rails themselves were at last wholly composed of iron, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> in short bars, united at their extremities, and resting on sleepers, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> blocks of stone, disposed at short distances along each side of the road; and this construction having been once fairly reduced to practice, was not only adopted universally in place of wood, but soon led to new and more extensive applications. Iron railways were quickly introduced into all the coal and mining districts of the kingdom. They were employed on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CANALS\">canals</a>, in place of locks, to raise the barges on an inclined plane from a lower to a higher <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a>; in some instances they were adopted in preference to the canal itself; and, on the whole, they now form an important auxiliary to inland <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a>, pushing the channels of trade and intercourse into districts otherwise inaccessible, and even into the interior of the mines.\n\nThe railways in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> are so numerous, that Railways in England and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a> would exceed our limits to specify the particular lines. In the Newcastle coal district, on the river Wear, in the coal and mining districts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORKSHIRE\">Yorkshire</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-LANCASHIRE\">Lancashire</a>, as well as of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DERBYSHIRE\">Derbyshire</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAFFORDSHIRE\">Staffordshire</a>, there are numerous railways branching off from the navigable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> and canals to the different mines. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHROPSHIRE\">Shropshire</a> also, and in the great mining districts along the vale of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEVERN\">Severn</a>, the use of railways is very general, and it was here that the inclined plane was first brought in aid of inland navigation. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SURREY\">Surrey</a>, there is a railway of a considerable extent, termed the Surrey Railway, and this presents one of the few attempts that have been made to form public railways for general use. In the great mining districts on the west of the Severn, including South Wales, the rail or tram roads are very numerous; and here, owing to the steepness and impracticable nature of the ground, they have been of essential utility in supplying the place of canals. In the year 1791, there was scarcely a single railway in all South Wales, and in 1811, the completed railroads connected with canals, collieries, iron, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>-works in the counties of Monmouth, Glamorgan, and Caer-\nRailway, marthen, amounted to nearly 150 miles in length, exclusive of a great extent within the mines themselves; of which one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> in Merthyr-Tydvil possessed 30 miles under ground. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-MONMOUTHSHIRE\">Monmouthshire</a>, the Sirhoway railway forms one of the first in point of magnitude which has hitherto been constructed. It extends from Pilgelly, near Newport, to the Sirhoway and Tredagar lime-works, distant 23 miles, whence it is continued five miles farther to the Trevil lime-works, in Brecknockshire, along with a branch to the west, to the Rumney and Union Iron-works. This railway was made by the Monmouthshire Canal Company, under the authority of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a>. From Sirhoway, a branch proceeds eastwards to the Ebbwy works, and from thence down the course of the Ebbwy to Crumlin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIDGE\">Bridge</a>, whence it joins the canal from Newport; and from Sirhoway again, the Brinare railway is continued over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">Black</a> Mountain to the vale of the Uske at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-BRECON\">Brecon</a>, and from thence to Hay on the river <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WYE\">Wye</a>. In Glamorganshire, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> railways are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARDIFF\">Cardiff</a> and Merthyr-Tydvil, the Aberdare, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SWANSEA\">Swansea</a> railways. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CAERNARVONSHIRE\">Caernarvonshire</a>, the principal railway is that which extends from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CAERNARVON\">Caernarvon</a> to the lime-works near Llandebie, a distance of 15 miles.\n\nFrom this account of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> railways in England and Wales, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> appear that this species of inland carriage is principally applicable where trade is considerable and the length of conveyance short; and is chiefly useful, therefore, in transporting the mineral produce of the kingdom from the mines to the nearest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a>, whether <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, river, or canal. Attempts have been made to bring it into more general use, but without success; and it is only in particular circumstances that navigation, with the aid either of locks or inclined planes to surmount the elevations, will not present a more convenient medium for an extended trade. South Wales, however, presents an example, where the trade being great, and also chiefly descending, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> rugged, and the supply of water scanty, railways have been adopted with complete success; and have been found in some cases at least equal to canals in point of economy and dispatch. The Surrey railway, not having these advantages, has scarcely answered the expectations of its projectors, more especially the southern line from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CROYDON\">Croydon</a> to Gadstone. It was at one time proposed to continue this railway to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PORTSMOUTH\">Portsmouth</a>, but the plan was abandoned.\n\nIn Scotland there are various railways proceeding from the different mines throughout the kingdom. The principal one in point of magnitude is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">Duke</a> of Portland's railway, extending from the town of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KILMARNOCK\">Kilmarnock</a> to the harbour of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TROON\">Troon</a>, a distance of nearly ten miles. Its chief object is the export of coal and lime, in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> a great trade is carried on by means of the railway. In the coal and mining districts round Glasgow, there are numerous smaller railways, and also in the coal fields of Mid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOTHIAN\">Lothian</a> and Fife. Plans have been proposed for a public railway from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> to the different coal-works in the neighbourhood. An extensive railway was also at one time projected from Glasgow to Berwick-upon-Tweed, but none of those schemes have been carried into effect.\n\nThe original wooden railways already mentioned are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> on which all the succeeding ones have been formed, and of which we shall now describe shortly the construction. In regard to the road itself, this should, in the first place, be formed in such a direction, and with such a declivity as may best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> the nature of the ground through which it passes, and of the trade to be carried upon it. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> the trade, for example, be all or chiefly in one direction, the road should obviously decline that way, so that the waggons, with their contents, may descend on this inclined plane as much as possible by their own gravity. The inclination should also be proportioned to the extent of the trade up the railway, so that the draught each way may be equal. If the exports and imports, therefore, be equal, the road should be on a level; and where the ground will not permit that declivity or level best suited to the trade, the line should be varied, and the inequalities made up, if it can be done at a moderate expense, so as to bring it as near as possible to the proper standard. If the inequalities are such as to render this impracticable, the only resource lies in inclined planes. Where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of level, for example, between the two extremities of the road is such as would render an equal declivity too steep, the road must then be carried, either on a level or with the due <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of slope, as far as practicable, and then lowered by an inclined plane; on which the waggons are let gently down by means of a brake, are dragged up by means of an additional power to that which draws them along the road, or at once let down and drawn up by means of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROLLER\">roller</a> or pulley, the heavier preponderating over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a>. In laying out a line of railway, therefore, as every situation presents peculiar circumstances, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> general rule can be laid down, and the plan must be left to the skill and judgment of the engineer.\n\nThe line of railway being fixed on, the road is then properly formed, and of such a width as will be sufficient for containing the opposite rails, and for forming a foot-path on one side. The distance between the opposite rails varies from three feet to four and one half feet; some preferring a long and narrow waggon, and others a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> short one. Hence a breadth of from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> to twelve feet will be sufficient for a single road, and from fifteen to twenty for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> one. The next operation is the setting and firm bedding of the stone sleepers. These consist of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> blocks of stone, each of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of one or two cwt. Their shape is immaterial, provided their base be broad, and their upper surface present an even and solid basis for the rail. They are placed along each side of the road, about three feet distant from each other from centre to centre; the opposite ones being separated by the width between the opposite rails. The ground under them is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> down to form a firm foundation, or, if it be of a soft nature, is first laid with a coat of gravel or small metal, and this beaten under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>; the situation of each stone being properly gauged both as to its distance from the adjoining ones, and as to the level or declivity of its upper surface, on which the rails are in-\ntended to rest. The space between the sleepers is then filled up with gravel, metal, or other road materials, such as may consolidate into a hard and firm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>.\n\nThe next object is the construction of the iron rails; and on this point two very different plans have been adopted, each of which has its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a>, and is practised to a great extent. The one is termed the flat rail, or tram plate; the rails being laid on their side, and the waggon-wheels travelling over their broad and flat surface. The other is termed the edge rail; the rails being laid edgewise, and the wheels rolling on their upper surfaces. The flat rail, or tram plate, consists of a plate of cast-iron, about three feet long, from three to five inches broad, and from half an inch to an inch thick; extending from sleeper to sleeper, and having a flanache turn up or crest on the inside, from two and a half to four inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>. This rail bears on the sleepers at each end at least three inches, where the rails are cast about half an inch thicker than in the middle. As there is no intermediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> for the rail between the sleepers, except the surface of the road, the use of the flanache is not merely to prevent the waggon from being drawn off the road; it resists the transverse strain arising from the weight of the waggon; on this account it is often, and with great propriety, raised higher in the middle than at the sides, forming an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> of a circle; and, to strengthen the rail still farther, a similar flanache, arched inversely, is added below, as represented in Plate CXV., figs. 1, 2, 3. The weight of each rail is from forty to fifty pounds. To unite these rails into one continued line, they are merely laid to each other, end to end, all along each side of the road; being kept in their places, and at the same time made fast to the sleepers, by an iron spike driven through the extremity of each rail into a plug of oak fitted into a hole in the centre of each sleeper. This spike is about six inches long; it has no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, but the upper end of it forms an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a> square, about one inch broad, half an inch thick; and the hole in the rails, through which it passes, is formed by a rectangular notch, half an inch square, in the middle of the extremity of each rail; the opposite notches of each rail forming, when laid together, the complete oblong square of one inch by half an inch, and slightly dovetailed from top to bottom, so as to fit exactly the tapering head of the spike, which is driven clear below the upper surface of the rail. Plate CXV., fig. 4, represents a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> of a rail, with its sleeper and fastening.\n\nWherever the rails <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> any road, the space between them and on each side must be paved or causewayed to the level of the top of the flanaches, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARRIAGES\">carriages</a> on the road may be enabled to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> clear over the rails. In single railways it is necessary to have places at certain intervals where the empty waggons, in returning, may get off the road to allow the loaded ones to pass. A place of this kind is termed a turn-out; and the waggons are directed into it by a moveable rail termed a pointer, fixed at the intersection between the principal rail and the turn-out, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> on its extremity, so as to open the way into the turn-out, and shut that along the road. This contrivance is also used whenever one line of railway crosses another. It is represented at Plate CXV., fig. 5, where, also, fig. 6 is a plan of the railway and of the turn-out.\n\nThe tram roads have been universally adopted in Wales, where they are preferred to any other species. They are also used in most parts of England. The Surrey railway is of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>, and was designed by Mr Jessop. In Scotland the Duke of Portland's railway, which, we believe, was planned by the same engineer, is of the same kind, and the rails nearly of the same dimensions. These flat railways have one advantage, in admitting waggons or carts of the ordinary construction, and this is particularly exemplified in the Troon railway. According to an account with which we have been favoured by Mr Wilson of Troon, \"there are several kinds of waggons used upon the railway under certain restrictions; such as four-wheeled waggons with flat bottom and low shelmets for carrying stone, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">limestone</a>, grain, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a>, slates, &c. from the harbour to Kilmarnock, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MILLS\">mills</a>,\" &c. \"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> make of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CART\">cart</a> is allowed to use the railway if the wheels are cylindrical, and there be no greater load on each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> than 28 cwt. A great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> is done with these carts in carrying timber, barks, grain, &c., as, with the same cart, they can carry these articles into and through the streets of the town.\"\n\nThe other railways in Scotland, however, are chiefly of the edge kind. In the principal collieries of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> of England, also, the flat rail has been almost entirely superseded by the edge rails, and the latter are now generally admitted to be decidedly superior in the ease of draught which they occasion; the edge of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> presenting less friction, and being less liable to clog up with dust and mud, or to be obstructed with stones driven off the road upon the surface of the rails. The edge rail consists merely of a rectangular bar of cast-iron, three feet long, three or four inches broad, and from one-half inch to one inch thick; set in its edge between sleeper and sleeper, and bearing on the sleepers at its extremities. The upper side of the rail is flanached out to present a broader bearing surface for the wheels, and the under side is also cast thicker than the middle, for the sake of strength. But the greatest strength is evidently attained by casting the rail not rectangular, but deeper in the middle than at the ends, to resist better the transverse strain. The ends may be safely reduced nearly to one-third of the depth in the middle, and still be equally strong. To unite the rails together, and at the same time preserve them in their places, and in their upright position, and to bind them also to the sleepers, they are set in a cast-iron socket or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a>, which is attached firmly to the sleeper. This socket embracing the extremities of the adjacent rails, which are here made to overlap a little; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PIN\">pin</a> is driven at once through the rails and through the socket, and binds the whole together. This is the general method of uniting the edge rails, but the shape and dimensions of the metal chair and of the overlap of the rails are varied according to the judgment and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> of the engineer. Plate CXV., fig. 7, represents a section of an edge railway with the sleepers and waggons, &c.;\nand figs. 8, 9, 10, is an enlarged section of a rail and sleepers with a plan. Since edge railways have come into more general use, an essential improvement has been made in their construction by the use of malleable iron, in place of cast-iron, in forming the rails. The advantage of malleable iron rails is, that they are less subject to breakage than cast-iron; a circumstance of importance in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, where it is not easy to avoid those jolts and sudden shocks which cast-iron is least of all capable of withstanding; and though they should happen to give way, they are easily repaired. They can also be laid in greater lengths, and requiring therefore fewer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a>; they can be bent with ease to the curvature of the road; when worn out they are of greater value; and lastly, their first cost is very little, if at all, greater than that of cast-iron rails. Malleable iron is, no doubt, less able to withstand exposure, decaying more readily under the influence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> and moisture; but hitherto this inconvenience has not been felt, and, on the whole, the malleable iron is now decidedly preferred. These rails are laid and joined in the same manner as the cast-iron, only in greater lengths. Malleable iron, we believe, was first introduced in railways by Mr George Grieve, at Sir John Hope's collieries, near Edinburgh, where it was first tried on the lighter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> which is done underground. The rails consisted of square bars one inch or one and one-fourth inch square, nine feet long, resting on one or two sleepers in the middle, and resting and made fast to sleepers at the extremities; a simple knee being formed on each end of the bar, and the two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-KNEES\">knees</a> of each two adjacent rails jammed into one socket in the sleeper. The use of these rails was found so beneficial, that they have since entirely superseded the flat cast-iron rail in general use at the time of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>. For heavier loads the rails are made deeper. We have been favoured with the following account of their construction by an engineer (Mr Neilson of Glasgow) who has formed several of the kind.\n\n\"One of them is on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARL\">Earl</a> of Glasgow, commencing at the Hurlet extensive coal and lime-works, and extending to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAISLEY\">Paisley</a> canal, a distance of about two miles. It is formed of flat bar iron two and one-fourth inches deep, by nearly three-fourths of an inch thick, and the rail in lengths of nine feet, each rail being supported at every three feet by a sleeper and cast-iron chair. The joinings are formed by a cast-iron dovetailed socket suited to receive the jointed ends of the bar, and a dovetailed glut or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KEY\">key</a>, by which means the several rails are joined as if into one continued bar.\"\n\nAn improvement has lately been made in the construction of malleable iron rails, which promises to be of essential utility. It consists in the use of bars, not rectangular, but of a wedge form, or swelled out on the upper edge. In the rectangular bar there is evidently a waste of metal on the under surface, which, not requiring to be of the same thickness as where the waggon-wheel is to roll, may be evidently reduced with advantage, if it can be done easily. The bar may then be made deeper, and broader at the top than before, so as with the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of metal to be equally strong, and present a much broader bearing surface for the wheel. This has been accomplished by Mr Birkinshaw of the Bedlington Iron-works, who has obtained a patent for these broad topped rails. The peculiar shape is given them in the rolling of the metal, by means of grooves cut in the rollers, corresponding with the requisite breadth, and depth, and curvature of the proposed rail. Mr B. recommends his rails to be of 18 feet in length. We have seen one of these patent rails at Sir John Hope's colliery; and it certainly forms the most perfect iron rail which has hitherto been contrived; combining very simply and ingeniously its form the qualities of lightness, strength, and durability. It is twelve feet long, two inches broad along the top, about half an inch along the bottom, and still thinner between. It rests on sleepers at every three feet, and at those places the rail is two inches deep, while in the middle point between the sleepers it is three inches deep. Fig. 11 is a longitudinal section of this rail, and figs. 12 and 13 are transverse sections at the sleepers, and at the middle point between each sleeper. All these inequalities, we believe, are produced on the metal by means of the rollers; and this circumstance is well deserving of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, as it may obviously be applied not merely to the formation of railways, but to a variety of other purposes in the arts. The moulding and shaping of the metal in this manner is quite a new attempt in the iron manufacture, and it is not easy to say how far such an invention may yet be carried by the skill of British artists.\n\nThe waggons used on railways are of various sizes, but of nearly the same general shape, and all set on four wheels from two to three feet diameter. They are made to carry from 20 to 50 cwt. exclusive of the waggon itself, which weighs from 12 to 15 cwt. The axles of the fore and hind wheels are fixed three feet asunder or more, so that the rail is never loaded with more than one-fourth of the waggon at once. According to Mr Wilson, \"The size of the coal waggons of Kilmarnock colliery are, on an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> length 80 inches, mean breadth 45 inches, and depth 30 inches. Each contains 40 bushels, equal to 32 cwt. of fine coal, and 35 cwt. of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MALLING\">malling</a> coal. The weight of the waggon, exclusive of the coal, is 13 cwt. Each waggon, including two pair of wheels and axles, costs from about L.13 to L.15, and are mostly lined with sheet iron.\" In Sir John Hope's railway the waggons are also nearly of the above dimensions. In the Sirhoway railway each waggon carries two and one-half tons.\n\nIn regard to the expense of constructing a railway, this will depend greatly on the ease or difficulties to be met with in forming the road; and making up the inequalities to the required slope. The above railway described by Mr Neilson cost only L.660 per <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILE\">mile</a>; but where there are considerable embankments to form, bridges to build, and deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTINGS\">cuttings</a>, the expense may rise to L.4000 and L.5000 per mile. The usual rate of tonnage on coals, &c. conveyed on railways is 2d. per ton per mile.\n\nAn important consideration regards the work done, or capable of being performed on a railway. On this point, however, the accounts from different railways are various; the performance depending on\nmany circumstances little attended to in the general estimate of work; such as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of the horses, the state of the road, the greater or less declivity of the rails, and various other circumstances. More exact observations or experiments are therefore wanting to form correct notions on this subject; but in the mean time, we shall state such facts as have been noticed by different observers. The most exact experiments were made by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a> Wilkes, Esq. of Measham in Derbyshire. The result is, that one horse, value L20, on a railway declining at the rate of one foot perpendicular to 115 in the length of the road, \"drew 21 carriages or waggons, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LADEN\">laden</a> with coals and timber, amounting in the whole to 35 tons, overcoming the vis inertiae repeatedly with great ease.\" This performance appears, no doubt, enormous; but was evidently owing not so much to the diminution of friction by the railway as to the great declivity; circumstances whose effect must be distinguished in order to obtain any general rule for future works. It is well known that, on any inclined road or plane, every carriage has a tendency to descend of itself, and with a force in proportion to its own weight, exactly as the height of the plane is to its length. In the above example, therefore, the carriages, independent of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> force of traction, would have been urged by their own gravity with a force of 115th of their weight, and equal, therefore, to 680 lbs. But as it will not be too low an estimate to assume 150 lbs. as the working draught of a horse, hence the waggons would descend by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> weight as if they had been dragged on a level way by at least four horses. If, then, to this 680 lbs. we add 150 for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the horse, the sum, or 830 lbs. will be equal to the power necessary to overcome the friction and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INERTIA\">inertia</a> of these waggons, and which appears by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> to amount to 3/4th of their whole weight; so that, if the railway had been level, the horse would only have drawn 61/4th tons. Carriages on an ordinary road require 1/3th or 1/5th of their actual weight to draw them along; so that, on a railway, the ease of draught is six times greater than on a common road. The same horse, Mr Wilkes observes, drew up the acclivity five tons with ease. Here the weight of the waggons, or its 115th part, would act against the horse, which would not only have to overcome their friction and inertia, but to drag also this additional load upwards. But 1/4 + 1/15 of 5 tons = 216 lbs., the force of traction, which was evidently a strained effort. The same horse drew three tons up an acclivity of 1 in 20. Here 1/4 + 1/15 of 3 tons = 407 lbs., a power of traction which few horses could exert, and none could sustain for any length of time. The other experiments of Mr Wilkes agree nearly with the above. Mr Outram, Engineer, observes, that, with a declivity of 1 in 108, the waggons will almost descend of themselves, so that the horse has only to pull a little at his load. This would make the friction and inertia nearly 1/105th of the weight, and the draught of a horse nearly 6/5th tons. Mr Telford observes, that in a railway, with a declivity of 1 in 98, a horse will readily take down waggons containing from 12 to 15 tons, and bring back the same with four tons in them. The total load, in the first case, would be about 18 tons, and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> 8 tons. Here the waggons being urged with 1/5th of their weight; this makes the friction and inertia equal to 1/70th of the weight, and the draught of a horse on a level way only 4/7th tons. In the Troon railway, the declivity is about 1 in 660; and, according to Mr Wilson's account, some horses take down two and some three waggons each, containing 33 cwt. of coal, and weighing itself 13 cwt., travelling at the rate of three miles an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>. The total load here may be averaged at 115 cwt.; and, the waggons being used with 1/60th of their weight, this makes the friction and inertia 1/3th of the weight, very nearly equal to the last. We have been favoured by Mr Grieve with the following particulars regarding Sir John Hope's railway, which is of the edge kind. It is on a level; and one horse draws five loaded waggons, each containing 30 cwt. of coals, and weighing, unloaded, 12 cwt. equal in all to 210 cwt. or 10\u00bd tons; travelling at the rate of four miles an hour, deducting stoppages. This makes the friction 1/50th of the load. This performance is beyond any that we have yet stated, and shows decidedly the ease of draught of the edge rail. Previous to the formation of this railway, it required eight horses for the work which is now done with one. On the whole, then, it may be concluded, that on a level tram road, making allowance for the weight of the waggons, one horse will be required for every four tons of coals, or other articles conveyed; and on an edge railway, one horse will be required for every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> tons. On an ordinary canal, one horse, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a>, will be sufficient for every 30 tons. But the first cost of a canal is three or four times greater than that of a railway; so that, in some cases, it may become a question, whether a railway might not be adopted with advantage.\n\nOn some of the railways near Newcastle, the waggons are drawn by means of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEAM_ENGINE\"><a class=\"xr</a>ef\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEAM\">steam</a>-engine working in a waggons by itself, the wheels of which are driven by the engine, and acting on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACK\">rack</a> laid along the railway, impel forward both the engine and the attached waggons: in some cases the wheels of the waggons operate without rail work, by the mere friction between them and the railway. The steam-engines employed for this purpose are of the high pressure kind; these requiring no condensing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a>. But this application of steam has not yet arrived at such perfection as to have brought it into general use.\n\nREFRACTION (Double).

The first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> were acquired at the village school; and as it frequently happens, that some trifling circumstance in early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> gives a bent to the pursuits, and fixes the destinies, of the future <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, so it fared with young Rennie. The school was situated on the opposite side of a brook, over which it was necessary to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> by means of a rustic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a> of stepping-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>; but when the freshes were out, the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ALTERNATIVE\">alternative</a> of crossing the stream was by means of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a>, which was kept at the workshop of Mr. Andrew Meikle, an ingenious mechanic, well known in Scotland as the inventor of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THRESHING\">threshing</a>-machine, and many improvements in agricultural implements. In passing through this workshop, which stood on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>, young Rennie's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> was forcibly drawn to the various operations that were in progress; and a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his leisure and holiday-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> was passed therein. The sons of Mr Meikle, and the workmen, seeing the delight which he appeared to take in examining their labours, were in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of indulging him with their tools, and showing him their various uses. His evenings were chiefly employed in imitating those models which had particularly attracted his attention in the workshop; and it is known in the family, that, at little more than ten years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, he had constructed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> of a windmill, a pile-engine, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEAM_ENGINE\"><a class=\"xr</a>ef\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEAM\">steam</a>-engine. That of the pile-engine is still in existence, and is said to be remarkably well made.\n\nHaving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> at Preston school till twelve years of age, he had a quarrel about that time with his schoolmaster, whom he deemed incompetent to give him further instruction, and therefore entreated that he might be permitted to leave the school. But his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> mind became restless; for the first time he felt the hours hang heavily on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>; and having expressed a wish to be placed under his friend Mr Meikle, he employed himself with this ingenious mechanic for about two years: but his mind expanding with his growth, he began to feel that the progress of his intellectual faculties was likely to be retarded by a constant application to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANUAL\">manual</a> labour. He therefore at length determined to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> himself under the tuition of Mr. Gibson, an able teacher of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUNBAR\">Dunbar</a>; where he soon distinguished himself in so particular a manner, that Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAVID\">David</a> Loch, General Inspector of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FISHERIES\">Fisheries</a> in Scotland, in describing a visit which he paid to the school at Dunbar in 1778, notices the great proficiency displayed by young Rennie; prophesying that at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> distant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> he would prove an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>.* From this school, in less than two years, he returned to Mr Meikle, with a mind well stored with every branch of mathematical and physical science which Mr Gibson could teach him. About this time, Mr Gibson being appointed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> to the public academy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERTH\">Perth</a>, he earnestly recommended young Rennie to succeed him at Dunbar. But his views were of a more aspiring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a>. As a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of favour, he undertook the management of the school for about six weeks, when he returned to his family, occasionally visiting and assisting his friend Mr Meikle, but mostly improving himself in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> and making models of machinery. His first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSAY\">essay</a> in practical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a> was the repairing of a corn-mill in his native village; and he erected two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> three others, before he was eighteen years of age.\n\nResolved, however, that these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> occupations should not interfere with his studies, he laid his plans so that he should be able to proceed occasionally to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, with a view of improving himself in physical science. He there attended the lectures of Professors Robison and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">Black</a>, and formed that acquaintance with the former of these gentlemen, which was gradually raised into friendship, and which, perhaps, may be said to have laid the foundation of his future fortune; for by him he was introduced to Messrs Bolton and Watt of Soho near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BIRMINGHAM\">Birmingham</a>. With these gentlemen he remained but a few months, for the purpose of receiving explanations respecting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ALBION\">Albion</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MILLS\">Mills</a>, then erecting, the machinery of which he superintended. This exactly suited his views, for, conscious of his own powers, he deemed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">Capital</a> the proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEATRE\">theatre</a> to try their strength, and in this he was not mistaken.\n\nIn proceeding from Edinburgh to Soho, he had taken the route by Carlisle, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANCASTER\">Lancaster</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIVERPOOL\">Liverpool</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANCHESTER\">Manchester</a>, for the purpose of visiting the different mills and public works in those great commercial and manufacturing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>; and the remarks which he made on the bridge then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> over the Lune at Lancaster, on the docks at Liverpool, and more particularly on the Bridgewater canal, are distinguished by great sagacity, and were of essential <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> to him afterwards. On leaving Soho, he again made a tour through the manufacturing districts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEEDS\">Leeds</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SHEFFIELD\">Sheffield</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROTHERHAM\">Rotherham</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEWCASTLE\">Newcastle</a>.\n\nFor some time after he was settled in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, the Albion Mills, of which Bolton and Watt and Mr Wyatt were the projectors and leading proprietors, and who engaged him to superintend the execution of the mill-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, occupied a great share of his attention. Mr Watt, in his Notes to Professor Robison's Account of the Steam-Engine, says, That, \"in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of the mill-work and machinery, they derived most valuable assistance from that able mechanician and engineer Mr John Rennie, then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> entering into\n\n* Loch's Essays on the Trade, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">Commerce</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">Manufactures</a>, and Fisheries of Scotland, Vol. III. p. 211.\nbusiness, who assisted in placing them, and under whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> they were executed.\" He also says, that the machinery, which used to be made of wood, was here made of cast-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, in improved forms, and thinks that this was the commencement of that system of mill-work which has proved so beneficial to this country. In fact, Rennie's mills are the most perfect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of mechanism in that way that exist, distinguished by a precision of movement, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a> and proportion of parts that now serve as models throughout the empire. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>-mills are so accurately calculated, that every particle of water is effectively employed, and none of it lost, as in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of constructing water-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHEELS\">wheels</a>.\n\nThere is reason to believe that the difficulties which occurred at the Albion Mills with regard to the ebb and flow of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-TIDES\">tides</a>, and which required all the ingenuity of that extraordinary genius Mr Watt, first led Mr Rennie to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of that branch of civil engineering connected with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HYDRAULICS\">hydraulics</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HYDRODYNAMICS\">hydrodynamics</a>, and in which he soon became so celebrated, as to have no rival after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Smeaton, in whose steps, he always used to say, he was proud to follow.\n\nOur limited space <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not permit us to enter upon even an enumeration of all his great works, much less to give any detailed account of them; we must therefore content ourselves by mentioning some of the most important designs and undertakings in his threefold capacity of mechanist, architect, and civil engineer; three branches of art so intimately blended, as scarcely to admit of a separation.\n\nFirst, as a Mechanist.\u2014Immediately after the completion of the Albion Mills, in 1786 or 1787, Mr Rennie's reputation was so firmly established in every thing connected with mill-work, that he found himself in a very extensive line of business. To him the planters of Jamaica and of the other West <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a> applied for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>-mills, which he constructed in a manner so superior to the old ones, that he soon obtained almost a monopoly of these expensive works. The powder-mill at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TUNBRIDGE\">Tunbridge</a>, the great flour-mill at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WANDSWORTH\">Wandsworth</a>, several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-SAW_MILLS\"><a class=</a>\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a>-mills, the machinery for various breweries and distilleries, were mostly of his manufacture; and wherever his machinery was required to be impelled by steam, the incomparable engines of his friends Messrs Bolton and Watt supplied the moving power; but, contrary to what has been stated in some of the public journals, he never had the least concern in directing, contriving, or advising any one part or movement of the steam-engine. He also constructed those beautiful specimens of machinery, the rolling and triturating mills at the Mint on Tower-Hill, to which Bolton and Watt's engines give <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>; and, at the time of his death, he was engaged in the construction of a rolling-mill, and similar machinery, for the intended mint at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CALCUTTA\">Calcutta</a>.\n\nAs a bold and ingenious piece of mechanism, which may be considered as distinct from positive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a>, there is nothing in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> that can bear a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> with the Southwark Bridge. The three immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a>, the centre one of 240, and each side <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> of 210 feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAN\">span</a>, consist entirely of masses of cast-iron, of various forms and dimensions, put together, on the same principle as a similar fabric of hewn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>; a method of employing iron, which may be considered to form a new epoch in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of bridge building. Various sinister predictions were entertained against this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> and beautiful bridge, which was to be rent in pieces by the expansive power of the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, or, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> it escaped that, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a> of the first winter's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>; but it has stood the test of many winters and summers, and appears not to feel either.\n\nMr Rennie was applied to by the East India <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">Company</a> for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of a cast-iron bridge to be thrown over the river <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GOOMTY\">Goomty</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LUCKNOW\">Lucknow</a>, at the desire of the Nabob Vizier of Oude. It consisted of three arches of cast-iron, the centre arch ninety, and each of the other arches eighty feet span. The arches were cast, and a superintending engineer sent out with them, but on their arrival the Nabob, in one of those moments of caprice to which eastern despots, even in their impotency, are so liable, changed his mind, and would not allow it to be put up.\n\nSecondly, as an Architect.\u2014As there are few parts of civil engineering that do not occasionally require the aid of architecture, Rennie, at a very early stage of his progress, was called upon for a display of his skill in this line. Among his first undertakings in either line was that of the Lancaster Canal, which presented many difficulties, and, among others, that of carrying it by an aqueduct over the Lune, so as not to interrupt the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a> of the river. Being one of the largest fabrics of its kind in Europe, and of a pleasing design, it is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> that arrests the attention of strangers, and is very generally admired. The bridges of Leeds, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MUSSELBURGH\">Musselburgh</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KELSO\">Kelso</a>, Newton-Stewart, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOSTON\">Boston</a>, New Gallo-way, and a multitude of others, attest the architectural skill, the solidity, and, we may add, the good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> of Rennie; whilst a thousand smaller ones, with the various locks, wharf-walls, quays, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-EMBANKMENTS\">embankments</a> appertaining to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CANALS\">canals</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HARBOURS\">harbours</a> in every part of the United <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">Kingdom</a>, are so many proofs of his diversified <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a>, and his skill in adapting the means to the end. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAKWATER\">Breakwater</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLYMOUTH\">Plymouth</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUND\">Sound</a> can scarcely be called an architectural work, but it is constructed on true hydrodynamic principles, and so gigantic in its dimensions, and cyclopean in its structure, as equally to defy the force of the waves and the ravages of time. To Mr Whidby, who has zealously superintended the execution of this immortal work, now near its completion, the highest praise is also due; nor was the plan finally determined on without his advice and assistance.\n\nBut the architectural work which, above all others, will immortalize the name of Rennie, is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-WATERLOO\">Waterloo</a> Bridge, a structure which even foreigners admit has no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> in Europe (and if not in Europe, certainly not in the whole world) for its magnitude, its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>, and its solidity. That a fabric of this immensity, presenting a straight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> line, stretching over nine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> arches, should not have altered more than a few inches, not five, in any one part, from that straight line, is an instance of firmness and\nsolidity utterly unknown, and almost incredible; but all Rennie's works have been constructed for posterity; he made nothing slight; nor would he engage in any undertaking where, from an ill-judging economy, a sufficiency of funds was not forthcoming to meet his views.\n\nAnother work, from a design of his, is now likely to be carried into execution, to which for some years past he had given his attention. It is that of a new stone bridge over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THAMES\">Thames</a>, to replace that disgrace to the present age, the existing London Bridge. His design, which has been selected by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMITTEE\">Committee</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">House</a> of Commons out of at least thirty that were offered, consists of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANITE\">granite</a> bridge of five arches, the centre one of 150 feet span, which will be the largest stone arch in the world constructed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> times. The execution of this work will form a remarkable feature in the future history of the capital, for, of the five bridges which straddle the Thames within the precincts of London, three of them, and those beyond comparison the most magnificent, will have been built from the designs of one man\u2014a record which will throw a lustre on the name of Rennie, and be read with a feeling of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a> by every, even the most distant, branch of the family.\n\nThirdly, as a Civil Engineer.\u2014The first great attempt in this line of his profession was the survey and execution of the Crinan Canal, a work remarkable for the multitude of practical difficulties that occurred throughout the whole of this bold undertaking; it being necessary in many places to cut <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> rock, to the depth of sixty feet; and it is rather remarkable, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> undertaking, the Lancaster Canal, was also replete with difficulties, and called for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of his skill as an architect, as we have seen in noticing the aqueduct over the Lune. But these two works established his reputation as a civil engineer, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> and assistance were required from all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>. His faculties were now called into full play, and they expanded with the demands made upon them. The rage for canals had pervaded every part of the kingdom, and scarcely any of these useful means of conveyance and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> was thought of without a previous consultation with Rennie; so that in a few years the surveys he was called upon to make were so numerous, that he knew the surface of England as it were by heart, and could tell at once, when a canal was projected, whereabouts the line of it ought to be carried. The following are some of the most important of those whose execution he personally attended: Aberdeen, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRECHIN\">Brechin</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">Grand</a> Western, Kennet and Avon, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PORTSMOUTH\">Portsmouth</a>, Birmingham, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORCESTER\">Worcester</a>, besides many others.\n\nBut the resources of his mind were displayed in all their vigour in the plans and construction of those magnificent docks, which are at once an ornament to the capital, and of the utmost utility to commerce and navigation. Nor are these splendid and useful works confined to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a>. The docks at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HULL\">Hull</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GREENOCK\">Greenock</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEITH\">Leith</a>, Liverpool, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUBLIN\">Dublin</a>, attest his skill; and the harbours of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEENSFERRY\">Queensferry</a>, Berwick, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOWTH\">Howth</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLYHEAD\">Holyhead</a>, Dunleary (now called Kingstown Harbour), Newhaven, and several others, owe their security and convenience to his labours.\n\nBut even those works, splendid as they are, must yield to what he has planned and executed in his Majesty's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOCK\">dock</a>-yards at Portsmouth, Plymouth, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHATHAM\">Chatham</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SHEERNESS\">Sheerness</a>. The latter was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> quicksand of forty feet deep, mixed with mud and the wrecks of old ships; the whole of which was excavated, and a magnificent basin constructed, with a beautiful surrounding wall of granite, with which three of the finest dry-docks in the universe communicate; and that important dock-yard, which may be said to command the mouths of the Thames and the Medway, from being an unhealthy and detestable place, and wholly inefficient for its purpose, is now, by being raised many feet, and laid out with skill and judgment, one of the most convenient in the kingdom. He also planned the new naval arsenal at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEMBROKE\">Pembroke</a>, which is considered as a perfect model for a building-yard. But his plan for the projected naval arsenal at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NORTHFLEET\">Northfleet</a> on the Thames was far superior to all in design; and on a scale so grand as to be capable of containing afloat two-thirds of the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">navy</a>, with dry-docks and slips for repairing and building ships of all classes to the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>; with all manner of storehouses, workshops, and manufactories of all such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> as were required for consumption in the navy. But the estimated sum of eight millions, which would probably have amounted to ten, induced the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">Government</a> to pause, and it was finally deemed prudent to abandon the design altogether.\n\nThe late excellent architect and civil engineer, Mr Smeaton, was the first who used the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol8.html#article-DIVING_BELL\"><a class=\"x</a>ref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVING\">diving</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELL\">bell</a> effectually for building with stone under water; but the machine he employed for that purpose was very defective, and could be used only in certain situations. But Rennie, by improvements in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> itself, and in the machinery by which its movements could be regulated, was enabled to carry on the finest masonry, and the foundations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>-walls, piers, and quays, as well under water as above it. The repairing of the pier-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAMSGATE\">Ramsgate</a> Harbour was a remarkable instance of this kind. The violence of the waves, acting upon the bad <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of the stone, had so completely undermined it, that the stability of the whole pier began to be endangered. It was from ten to thirteen feet below the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> of low-water, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>-tides; yet, by means of the improved diving-bell, and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a>, the pier-head was not only effectually secured, but rendered more solid and durable than it originally had been. In the harbour of Howth, the diving-bell was of the utmost use; and it is remarkable enough, that the masons who have been for a little while accustomed to work under water prefer it, at least the Irish masons do,\n\n* The Bridge of Neuilly, which the vanity of the French has ranked as superior to that of Waterloo, actually sunk 23 inches.\nto working in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>; it being cooler in summer, and warmer in winter; though an increase of pay for submarine work is probably the real cause of preference.\n\nThe last effort of Rennie's genius, to which we shall advert, was the drainage of that vast tract of marsh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> bordering upon the rivers <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRENT\">Trent</a>, Witham, New Welland, and Ouse, which for centuries past had baffled the skill of some of the ablest men in that department of civil engineering. Upon the same principles, he laid down a grand scheme for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-DRAINING\">draining</a> the whole of that immense district known by the name of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEDFORD\">Bedford</a> Level, which has in part been carried into execution by the completion of the Eau-brink Cut, near Lynn. The estimate he made for draining the whole amounted to \u00a31,200,000.\n\nSuch are some of the grand undertakings which Rennie, during the last thirty years of his life, was either employed to project or to carry into execution, and which, on a rough estimate, collected from his valuable Reports, did not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> far short of forty millions <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">Sterling</a>; about twenty millions of which were expended under his own immediate superintendence. Indeed, few great works were carried on, either by the public or individuals, on which he was not either employed or consulted. His industry was very extraordinary. Fond of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> of his select friends, and of rational conversation, he never suffered amusement of any kind to interfere with his business, which seldom engaged less than twelve hours, and frequently fifteen in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>. His conversation was always amusing and instructive. He possessed a rich <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUND\">fund</a> of anecdote, and, like his old friend James Watt, told a Scotch story admirably. As a travelling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a>, he was highly entertaining; he knew every body on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a>, and everybody knew John Rennie. Of an ardent and anxious mind, and naturally impetuous, he was gifted with the most perfect self-control; and the irritation of the moment was seen but as a light summer's cloud, passing across his finely marked features, which were so large a scale, though blended with much mildness as well as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>, as to obtain for his noble bust by Chantrey, when exhibited in Somerset House, the name of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a> Tonans.\n\nWere we to seek for a parallel to Rennie, the name of Smeaton would at once suggest itself. Their boyhood was employed precisely in the same manner, in making models of pumps and windmills, while their school-fellows were at play; their pursuits in manhood were similar, and their paramount success pretty nearly the same: but the spirit of speculation and improvement was but just springing up, when Smeaton finished his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAREER\">career</a>, and when Rennie began his. He was, in fact, the successor of Smeaton. There was a strong characteristic likeness between Rennie and the late Mr Ramsden. The pursuits of the former embraced a wider sphere of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, but they both arrived at their proposed objects by the most simple and obvious, and, at the same time, most effectual means. They were both equally clear in their mode of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> information to others; and it is sufficiently remarkable that, in their illustrations, both of them had recourse rarely to any other instrument than a two-feet rule, which each always carried in his pocket. Many a time has the writer of this article derived instruction from the two-feet rules of John Rennie and Jesse Ramsden. They were both equally communicative, when they saw that information was desired; and nothing like professional jealousy, or selfish feelings, actuated either of these ingenious men, who, on the contrary, were always kind and condescending to the more humble artists of their respective <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROFESSIONS\">professions</a>. To foreigners, in particular, the loss of Rennie will be severely felt; for to those who visited England with the view of inspecting her arts and manufactures, he was always ready to afford every information, and all the facilities in his power.\n\nMr Rennie possessed considerable skill in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIBLIOGRAPHY\">bibliography</a>, and being a zealous and liberal collector, he succeeded in forming a very valuable library; consisting of the best and rarest books in all the branches of science and art, of voyages and travels, and many curious books in the black-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a>; while in his own department, it contained every work of the least merit, in whatever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> it might be written. He had, besides, a good collection of mathematical and astronomical instruments, and frequently spoke of erecting an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATORY\">observatory</a>, but did not live to carry his intention into execution. He had for some years laboured under a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIVER\">liver</a>, which had apparently yielded to the usual treatment, but a relapse took place; and on the 16th October 1821, after a few days illness, he expired without a struggle, in the 60th year of his age.\n\nMr Rennie, in 1789, married Miss Mackintosh, who died in 1806, leaving a family of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> young children, six of whom are now living. The two eldest, George and John, are successfully following the profession, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-TREAD\">tread</a> in the footsteps of their late father.\n\nSixteen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOURNING\">mourning</a> coaches, filled with his friends, mostly men of eminence in the arts, sciences, or literature, followed his hearse to St Paul's, where his remains were interred near those of Sir Christopher Wren. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> granite slab covers his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a>, on which is the following appropriate inscription:\n\nHere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> the mortal remains of","sp":469,"ep":473},{"h":"RNFREWSHIRE","t":"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> in Scotland, lying between 55\u00b0 41' and 55\u00b0 48' <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> latitude, and between 4\u00b0 15' and 4\u00b0 53' west <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a>; is bounded on the west and north by the Frith of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLYDE\">Clyde</a> (excepting that a small tract opposite the town of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RENFREW\">Renfrew</a> is situated on the north <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a> of the Clyde), and it has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-LANARKSHIRE\">Lanarkshire</a> on the east and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AYRSHIRE\">Ayrshire</a> on the south. From east to west it extends about 26 miles, and from north to south from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> to 13; and has an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a> of nearly 241 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> miles, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> 154,182 English acres. It comprehends 21 parishes, besides a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">Division</a>.\nportion of some others, the churches of which are situated in the adjoining counties. Two of the parishes, Eaglesham and Cathcart, belong to the presbytery of Glasgow, and the other nineteen compose the presbytery of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAISLEY\">Paisley</a>. Notwithstanding its moderate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> render it one of the most important in Scotland.\n\nAbout two-thirds of this district, comprising the western and south-eastern sides, are hilly, the medium elevation being from 500 to 600 feet; Misty-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, the highest hill, is about 1240 feet, and two others may be about 1000. This division is, in general, kept in pasture, for which it is better adapted, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of its surface, than for tillage; though, as it has a free <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, which readily absorbs <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, it is seldom injured by moisture. The cultivated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> lies on the north and north-east, and in the centre of the county, on both sides of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">Black</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CART\">Cart</a>. Of this, however, the greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> is not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a>, but consists of low detached hills, among which there is a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> wood in the state of coppice, and many winding rivulets, which give variety to the landscape. Much of this tract has a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> subsoil of small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> and coarse clay, almost impenetrable to water, though there are here many flat holms of great fertility. It is only between Paisley and the Clyde that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> sinks <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, the extent of which does not exceed 12,000 acres. Here the soil is generally a deep rich loam, of a dark <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, sometimes of the nature of what is called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARSE\">carse</a> clay; and much of it seems to have been formed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEPOSITION\">deposition</a> of vegetable mould from the higher grounds. Moss prevails in the first and last divisions, but is not found in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> or middle one, where the soil is pretty uniform.\n\nLike the other western counties of Scotland, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RENFREWSHIRE\">Renfrewshire</a> has a moist <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, with frequent rains; and the prevailing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> is from the south-west. At <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGS\">Largs</a>, a village in Ayrshire, near the western extremity of this county, the yearly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a>, in 1809 and 1810, was 38\u00bd inches; at Glasgow, near the eastern extremity, for 30 years, from 1761 to 1790, it was 29\u00bd inches.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> are the Clyde, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">White</a> Cart, the Black Cart, and the Gryfe. The first, which only flows along the boundaries of this county, is by far the most considerable and important. The White Cart, which rises in Lanarkshire, enters Renfrewshire from the south; and, flowing west towards Paisley, and then north, receives the united streams of the Black Cart and the Gryfe at Inchinnan, and joins the Clyde about six miles below Glasgow. By means of a short cut, a little above Inchinnan, the White Cart has been rendered navigable from Paisley to the Clyde. The Black Cart from the south-west, and the Gryfe from the west, meet at Walkinshaw, about two miles above their confluence with the White Cart. These streams are chiefly deserving of notice for their being employed in giving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> to the cotton and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MILLS\">mills</a> seated along their course. Several other and smaller ones have been applied in the same manner in various parts of the county; a steady supply of water being secured by means of reservoirs, some of which are of the size and appearance of considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>; or by enlarging the natural lakes themselves, of which there are many. Of these last, Castlesemple loch, in the middle of the southern boundary, from whence the Black Cart takes its rise, extending over about 200 acres, is the most considerable. These streams and lakes abound in the usual kinds of fish; but the salmon fishery on the Clyde, so far as it belongs to this county, is not of great value, seldom affording a rent of more than \u00a3200 a-year.\n\nThe minerals of this county are of great importance, constituting the main source of its manufactures and commerce; but we can only advert to them very generally. Coal, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">limestone</a>, and sandstone, are wrought at Neilston, one of the parishes of the hilly district; and both coal and lime have been found in the flat district near Renfrew; but it is in the middle division that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> are wrought to the greatest extent. Of coal there are generally about 12 different works carried on; of which the most extensive and valuable are at Polmadie, on the north-east boundary, at Hurlet, three miles south-east from Paisley, and at Quareltown, south-east from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIDGE\">Bridge</a> of Johnston, on the Black Cart, near the centre of the county. The coal at this latter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> consists of five contiguous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRATA\">strata</a>; the thickness of the whole, measured at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> to their surface, is upwards of 50 feet; but as, in some places, the seam forms a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> with the horizon, the thickness of the whole in these places, measured vertically, is about 15 fathoms. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of this great depth, it is wrought in floors or storeys. Limestone abounds in various parts, and is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> wrought at eight different quarries. Ironstone in beds and balls is very generally diffused throughout this middle division of the county. Considerable quantities of pyrites are found in the stratum of coal at Hurlet and Househill, and manufactured into sulphate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> or green vitriol. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALUM\">Alum</a> is obtained at Hurlet, from the decomposed schistus, which forms one of the strata of its coal mines. Excellent freestone, lying near the surface, is wrought near Paisley and at other places.\n\nThe valuation of the lands of Renfrewshire is Valuation L. 69,172, 1s. Scots; but in 1811 the real rent of the lands was L. 127,068, 15s. 9d. and of the houses, L. 106,238, 7s. 2d. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">Sterling</a>. In 1795 the land rent was only about L. 67,000, so that it must have nearly doubled in fifteen or sixteen years. The landed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> in 1811 was divided into 328 estates; of which 300 were under the valuation of L. 500 Scots, and only six above L. 2000 Scots. Nearly half the valuation belonged to estates held under entail, and by corporations, which were not, therefore, allowed to be brought to market. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of freeholders entitled to vote in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a> of a member for the county was 77; but it appears that more than half this number voted on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> of superiority only, and not as owners of estates. There are about 30 seats of noblemen and gentlemen, besides villas belonging to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> and tradesmen. The county is well covered with woods and plantations. The\nRenfrewshire does not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> as an agricultural district. Farms are generally small, seldom exceeding 100 acres on the arable land, and 400 or 500 acres on the hills; and the houses and other accommodations of the farmers are proportionally inferior to those of their brethren in most other parts of the lowlands of Scotland. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> rent per English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACRE\">acre</a>, in 1811, would be about \u00a31.5s., varying from 2s. or 3s. to \u00a31.4 or \u00a31.5; partly owing to situation, but still more to the different degrees of the natural fertility of the soil. Garden grounds let at from \u00a31.8 to \u00a31.10, and, in one instance near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GREENOCK\">Greenock</a>, as high as \u00a31.40 the English acre. The University of Glasgow have right to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITHES\">tithes</a> of several parishes near that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, for which they receive, in some instances, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> more than 4s. per Scots acre, and in no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> more than \u00a31.5s. The most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LEASES\">leases</a> here, as in other parts of Scotland, is 19 years; but many are now shorter, though, in that case, it is the practice to enter into a new lease, two or three years before the old one expires. About two-thirds of the arable land is almost always in grass, on which the stock chiefly kept is cows, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILK\">milk</a> is made into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a>. There are few cheese dairies. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROTATION\">rotation</a> of crops is in many instances objectionable; two or more corn crops being taken successively; clover and rye-grass are sown only for hay; and turnips, even upon the most suitable soils, are in very limited cultivation. A flock of Merino sheep, consisting of about 1000 or 1200, of the pure Paular breed, was sent into this county in 1810, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLONEL\">Colonel</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWNIE\">Downie</a> of Paisley, who was then in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, some of which are still to be found on the farms of the proprietors. In other respects, the rural economy of Renfrewshire presents nothing particularly worthy of notice.\n\nIt is by its manufactures and commerce that this district has been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> distinguished. Among its manufactures are cordage and sail-cloth, ship-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a>, at Greenock and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PORT_GLASGOW\">Port-Glasgow</a>, with a variety of others subordinate to these; but Paisley and its environs have long been the seat of its principal establishments. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> manufacture, in various forms, was carried on here more than a century ago, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to extend till superseded by that of cotton, about the year 1780. This last is now by far the most extensive manufacture in the county; and is conducted in all its various branches, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPINNING\">spinning</a> of the yarn to the finishing of the finest fancy goods. In 1810, the cotton yarn sold was said to amount to \u00a3630,000; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> employed in the buildings and machinery of the mills was estimated at \u00a3300,000. About 7000 looms were then employed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEAVING\">weaving</a> of muslins, besides 500 which were wrought by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEAM\">steam</a>, and produced coarse cottons to the value of \u00a3125,000 yearly. Paisley was long distinguished for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a> manufacture, which is now inconsiderable; and that of thread, though still extensive, is said to be on the decline. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOAP\">Soap</a>-making, tanneries, distilleries, breweries, and foundries, with a great many bleachfields and print-fields, furnish employment to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> portion of the inhabitants.\n\nThe principal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> are Paisley, Greenock, and Port-Glasgow. (See these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">Articles</a> in the Encyclopaedia.) It is at these towns, or rather at the two last, that the foreign and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COASTING\">coasting</a> trade of the country, and the principal foreign trade of Scotland, is carried on. Greenock and Port-Glasgow have an extensive trade with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a> and the West Indies, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>, and the west of England; and coastwise, and, by means of the Forth and Clyde Canal, with every part of Scotland. The canal proposed to be carried from Glasgow to Ardrossan, through Paisley and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JOHNSTONE\">Johnstone</a>, has been executed as far as Johnstone, eleven miles from Glasgow; and passing through several populous parts of Renfrewshire, affords great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a> to the trade between Paisley and Glasgow. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERRING\">herring</a> and whale <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FISHERIES\">fisheries</a> were once prosecuted to a greater extent than at present, though the former is still considerable; and the merchants of Greenock are extensively engaged in the Newfoundland and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-NOVA_SCOTIA\">Nova Scotia</a> fisheries. As Renfrewshire does not raise enough of grain for its consumption, a good deal of corn is usually imported from Ireland and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CANADA\">Canada</a>, as well as coastwise. The other imports are the raw materials of its manufactures, and the commodities required for the consumption of its inhabitants; and its exports, the produce of its manufactures, mines, and fisheries, and of its import trade from America and the West Indies.\n\nNotwithstanding the extensive manufactures of this county, the great fluctuation in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WAGES\">wages</a> of labour, and its dense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a>, which, in 1811, was at the rate of 384 per square <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILE\">mile</a>, there are regular assessments for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> only in two or three parishes. In the rest of the county, the poor are supplied by voluntary contributions, aided by assessments imposed when circumstances require them.\n\nThe county sends one member to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a>; and represents its only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> burgh, Renfrew, a place containing about 1600 inhabitants, joins with Glasgow, Rutherglen, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUMBARTON\">Dumbarton</a>, in the election of another for the Scottish burghs. Paisley and Greenock, notwithstanding their wealth and population, have no vote. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SHERIFF\">Sheriff</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">Court</a> is now held at Paisley; yet Renfrew is still considered the county town, where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> sessions are held, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> courts, and the meetings of the freeholders for the election of members of Parliament.\n\nThe population in 1754 was only 26,645; in 1801 it amounted to 78,056; in 1811 it was 92,596; to which, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> there be added the number of registered seamen, about 5000, and of men serving in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">navy</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITIA\">militia</a> at the latter period, it would appear that it had quadrupled within 57 years, a rate of increase unexampled in any other county of Scotland. In 1821 it was 119,175; of which 51,178 were males, and 60,997 were females. The families employed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a> were 2725; in trade and manufactures, 15,780; in other occupations of various kinds, 5172. The increase of the population from 1811 to 1821 was 19,579.\n\nSee the general works quoted under the former Scottish counties, and Wilson's General View of the Agriculture, &c. of Renfrewshire.","sp":467,"ep":469},{"h":"ROBISON","t":"a distinguished Professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\"><a class=\"xref\" hr</a>ef=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">Natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">Philosophy</a>, born, in 1739, at Boghall, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> of Bal dernock, and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> of Stirling, was a younger son of John Robison, Esq. who-\n\n* Derrien, Notice Historique et Descriptive sur la Route de Montcenis.\nhad formerly been a merchant at Glasgow, and had retired to live in considerable affluence on his estate at Boghall, not far from that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a>.\n\nHe was of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> sufficiently respectable to enable his son at a subsequent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> to prove himself, to the satisfaction of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">Court</a> of St Petersburg, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> born. As a younger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>, that son was originally intended for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, and went at an early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> of Scotland, in 1750, to enter as a student of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a> in the University of Glasgow; so that he was initiated almost in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> of Latin and Greek literature under the able instruction of Dr Moore, the well known professor of Greek; and he acquired such a knowledge of these languages as served to constitute him a correct classical scholar through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. He pursued his studies with so much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, as to obtain the approbation of his teachers, and the admiration of his contemporaries, who were delighted with the originality and ingenuity of his conversation, though he did not himself reflect with perfect satisfaction upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of application which he had exerted in his academical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>. He took a degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">Master</a> of Arts in 1756, having studied <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a> under Dr Robert Simson, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORAL_PHILOSOPHY\">moral philosophy</a> under Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADAM\">Adam</a> Smith. The example of so correct and rigid a follower of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> methods of demonstration, as Dr Simson, must unquestionably have exercised considerable influence on his yet unformed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> in mathematics; but he seems to have had a natural preference, either from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of his mind, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> from some previously acquired habits of thinking, for the geometrical method; for we are informed that \"he first attracted the regard of Dr Simson by owning his dislike of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALGEBRA\">algebra</a>, and by returning a neat geometrical solution of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a> which had been given out to the class in an algebraical form; with this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of solution the professor was delighted, though the pupil candidly acknowledged that it had been adopted only because he could not solve the problem in the manner required of the class.\"\n\nHe had imbibed, in the course of his studies, an insuperable aversion to the pursuit of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> objects in the church; not certainly from any want of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> feeling, or from a dislike to the kind of life that was intended for him, but probably from some difficulties that had occurred to him respecting particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of doctrine or of practice. He was therefore compelled to provide himself with some other occupation; and he readily accepted the offers of some of his friends in 1758, to recommend him to Dr Blair, a prebendary of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WESTMINSTER\">Westminster</a>, who had formed a scheme for sending <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">Prince</a> Edward, the young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">Duke</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a>, to complete his professional education at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> with a son of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ADMIRAL\">Admiral</a> Knowles; and Mr Robison was to have instructed his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HIGHNESS\">Highness</a> in mathematics and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a>. He was much disappointed, on his arrival in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, to find that the expedition had never been seriously intended; and he readily accepted an engagement to attend young Knowles as a private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TUTOR\">tutor</a>, when he went as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MIDSHIPMAN\">midshipman</a> on board of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEPTUNE\">Neptune</a> of 90 guns, with Admiral Saunders, who had the command of a force intended to co-operate with General Wolfe in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> of Quebec; and upon the appointment of his friend as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">lieutenant</a> on board of the Royal William, Robison was himself rated as a midshipman in that ship.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a> arrived on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a> in April 1759; in May they got up the river, and Mr Robison was one of a party of 100 seamen draughted from the Royal William into the Admiral's ship, under the command of Lieutenant Knowles: in this capacity he had an opportunity of seeing considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>, and of making some surveys of the river and of the neighbouring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, an employment for which he was perfectly qualified, both as a geometrician and as a draughtsman. He also remarked the effect of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AURORA_BOREALIS\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol3.html#article-AURORA\">Aurora</a> Borealis on the compass, which had been noticed by Mairan and Wargentin some years before, but which was then not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> known. After the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a>, which was signalised by the victory and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of the gallant Wolfe, the Royal William sailed with his body to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, and arrived at Spithead in November. The next year she was sent to cruise off <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINISTERRE\">Finisterre</a>, but in six months she was obliged to return home, from having the greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the men disabled by the scurvy.\n\nHe used to consider the two years that he spent on board of the Royal William as the happiest of his life; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> inconsiderable part of his gratification was derived from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEAMANSHIP\">seamanship</a> as he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> it practised under the auspices of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> Hugh Pigot. He did not, however, acquire any firm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to the mode of life which he had temporarily adopted; he was rather disposed to resume his academical pursuits, and he had overcome his earlier objections to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> profession. He could not, however, refuse the friendly invitation of Admiral Knowles to come and live with him in the country, and to assist him in some important experiments which he was making upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> and nautical subjects.\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of February 1762, Lieutenant Knowles was appointed to the Peregrine sloop, of 20 guns, and Mr Robison accompanied him with the hope of becoming a purser. He visited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LISBON\">Lisbon</a> and several other parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PORTUGAL\">Portugal</a>; but he found a cruise in a small ship much less convenient and agreeable than in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> one, and, fortunately for himself and for mankind, he finally quitted the Peregrine and the naval service in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a>, and returned to live with Admiral Knowles; who soon after recommended him as a proper person to take <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of Harrison's timekeeper, which had been completed by the labour of 35 years, after many unsuccessful experiments, and which was now sent out by desire of the Board of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONGITUDE\">Longitude</a> to the West Indies, under the care of young Harrison and of Mr Robison. The rate of the chronometer was ascertained at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PORTSMOUTH\">Portsmouth</a> the 6th November 1762, and it indicated, at Port Royal in Jamaica, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> amounting to $5^\\circ 2^\\prime 47''$, which is only four seconds less than the true longitude. After a few days, the observers had a prompt opportunity of returning home by the Merlin sloop, which was sent to Europe with despatches. The voyage was most disastrous with respect to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, and at last the ship took fire; but she arrived safe at Portsmouth in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a>, and on the 2d of April the watch gave\n11\u00b0 58' 6\" instead of 12\u00b0, for the time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> noon, so that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>, after six months, was only 1\u00b0 53', amounting to no more than about 20 miles of distance.\n\nMr Robison received, upon his return, the afflicting intelligence of the total loss of the Peregrine, which had foundered at sea with her commander and the whole of the ship's company. He was also greatly disappointed in the failure of some hopes which had been held out to him from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMIRALTY\">Admiralty</a> and the Board of Longitude; though in fact there is little reason for the public to regret that he was not gratified with the pursership, which he claimed as the reward of his services. He was indeed afterwards actually made a pursuer by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDWICH\">Sandwich</a>, in 1763; but he then declined accepting the appointment. His biographers very naturally complain of the neglect of those Boards which ought to have recompensed him; but certainly the Board of Longitude had no power whatever, and probably not much influence, in the appointment of a pursuer; and after all, the delay of a year or two was nothing very uncommon in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">navy</a>.\n\nHe had now no other resource than to return to Glasgow, and to resume his academical pursuits with renewed energy. It was from this time that he dated his serious application to his studies; he became extremely intimate with Dr Reid and Dr Alexander Wilson, and he had the advantage of being a witness of two of the greatest steps in the improvement of physical science that have been made in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> times, Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">Black</a>'s experimental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, and Mr Watt's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEAM_ENGINE\"><a class=\"xr</a>ef\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEAM\">steam</a>-engine. Dr Black was the first that determined the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of heat required for the conversion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ICE\">ice</a> into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>; Mr Watt, who was settled as a mathematical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a>-maker at Glasgow, had been employed in repairing a working <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> of Newcomen's engine for one of the professors of the university, and it was the difficulty of supplying this model with steam that suggested to Mr Watt the eligibility of having a separate condenser, and that led him, in conjunction with Dr Black, to a knowledge of the quantity of heat consumed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a>.\n\nAmid the enthusiasm which is always inspired by the progress of scientific discovery, and of practical improvement, Mr Robison found every encouragement and every facility for the pursuit of his favourite objects. He was recommended by Dr Black, upon his removal to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> in 1766, as his successor in the lectureship of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">chemistry</a>, though without the appointment of a professor. He took charge, also, of the education of Mr Macdowal of Garthland, and of Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> Knowles, afterwards Sir Charles. Admiral Knowles was soon after recommended by the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> to the Empress of Russia, in order to effect a reformation in her navy, having been employed on a similar service in Portugal almost fifty years before; he had always been a firm friend to Mr Robison, and now engaged him on this mission, with a salary of L.250 a year; and they proceeded together to St Petersburg in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> 1770. Being hospitably entertained on their way by the Prince Bishop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIEGE\">Liege</a>, whom they found to constitute, with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> and all his servants, a lodge of freemasons, Mr Robison was easily persuaded to become one of that fraternity; in a few days he was made an apprentice, and by degrees attained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of Scotch master, as he has himself related in his publication upon the subject. He <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> nearly two years at St Petersburg, still acting in the capacity of private secretary to Sir Charles, who was appointed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">president</a> of the Board of Admiralty, much to the advantage of the Russian navy, though his improvements were frequently retarded by the prejudices of the native officers. Mr Robison was then appointed inspector general of the corps of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">marine</a> cadets at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CRONSTADT\">Cronstadt</a>, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> salary, and with the rank of Lieutenant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLONEL\">Colonel</a>. His duty was to receive the report of about forty teachers and professors, respecting the studies of 400 young noblemen, who were their pupils, and to class them according to his judgment of their merits; but he had himself nothing to teach, nor could he have had much occasion for \"lecturing fluently in the Russian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>,\" though he was introduced by his friend Kutussoff to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">Grand</a> Duke Paul as a proficient in that language; but to the Empress he was not personally known. At Petersburg he could have lived without regretting his country, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> of such men as Euler and Alpinus, admired by the Russians, and beloved by the British; but Cronstadt in winter was deplorably melancholy; and he was induced, without much difficulty, in 1773, to make some little pecuniary sacrifice in accepting the professorship of Natural Philosophy at Edinburgh, which had become vacant by the death of Dr Russell, and to which he had been recommended by Dr Robertson, then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">Principal</a> of the University. His determination was not disapproved by the Russian government, who granted him a pension of about L.80 a year for life; but it was only paid as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> as three or four young men, who had accompanied him as pupils, continued to reside at Edinburgh; some discontent having been expressed because he did not keep up a correspondence with the Academy on the improvement of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARITIME\">maritime</a> education.\n\nHe arrived at Edinburgh in September 1774; he married soon after, and continued to reside in that city for the remaining thirty years of his life, paying only an annual visit to his native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, where he possessed a part of his paternal estate; not being solicitous to extend it, although \"he did not diminish it otherwise than as it had been diminished before,\" that is, in making provision for younger children. His predecessor had been very judicious and successful as a lecturer, though not a mathematician of the highest order; he had himself more practical knowledge and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a>, and was better acquainted with the foreign mathematicians, who had naturally fallen under his notice during his residence on the Continent. His lectures were considered by most of his pupils as somewhat too difficult to be followed; a complaint which, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> it did not depend on their own want of preparatory information, arose perhaps rather more from the hasty manner of his enunciation, than from the abstruseness of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>. \"The singular facility of his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a>,\" says Professor Playfair, \"made him judge too favourably of the same power in others.\"\nTo understand his lectures completely was, on account of the rapidity, and the uniform flow of his discourse, not a very easy task, even for men tolerably familiar with the subject. On this account, his lectures were less popular than might have been expected from such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of talents as the author of them possessed.\" This inconvenience was increased \"by the small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of experiments he introduced, and a view that he took of Natural Philosophy, which left but a very subordinate place for them to occupy. An experiment, he would very truly observe, does not establish a general proposition, and never can do more than prove a particular fact:\" but he seems to have carried this principle to some little excess: it is, in fact, the illustration, and not the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a>, of general principles that is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of a public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXHIBITION\">exhibition</a> of experiments; and it is very doubtful whether <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHIMEDES\">Archimedes</a>, or Newton, or Leibnitz, or Euler, would have been very successful as shownmen. With respect, however, to \"accuracy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a>, to clearness, brevity, and elegance of demonstration, and even to neatness and precision in experiments,\" Professor Robison was very successful; his course extended \"to every branch of physics and of mixed mathematics,\" and entered so fully into the detail of each particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of the subjects, that \"a more perfect system of academical instruction is not easily to be imagined:\" nothing, in short, was wanting, but so much previous knowledge of mathematics in his pupils as he thought he had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to expect, though his expectations were too rarely fulfilled.\n\nThe Philosophical Society of Edinburgh had been almost suffered to sink into oblivion after the publication of the third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of its Essays, in 1756. Professor Robison became a member of it soon after his return from Russia, and was chosen Secretary of the new Society upon its formation by Royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARTER\">charter</a>, in 1783, when it incorporated with itself the whole of the surviving members of the former Society. In 1798, he received the compliment of a degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">Doctor</a> of Laws from the University of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-NEW_JERSEY\">New <a cla</a>ss=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERSEY\">Jersey</a>; and a similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> was paid him at Glasgow the year after. In 1800 he was elected, as successor to Dr Black, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of the Foreign Members of the Royal Academy of Sciences of St Petersburg.\n\nHe was attacked, in 1785, by a severe disorder, from which he was never afterwards wholly free, though it produced little inconvenience besides pain, with some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPRESSION\">depression</a> of spirits, which was, however, attributed rather to the closeness of his application than to the immediate effect of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>, which was a glandular induration. For many years he was obliged to obtain the assistance of substitutes in the delivery of his lectures; but towards the end of his life he was able again to perform the duties of the professorship in person. He continued his literary labours with little intermission, and was most happy in the care and attention of his wife and children, whose virtues he found the best alleviation of his sufferings. He took a slight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, after giving a lecture, on the 28th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1805, and died on the 30th.\n\n1. It was comparatively late in life that Professor Robison assumed the character of an author, having communicated to the Royal Society of Edinburgh, in 1785, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> on the Determination of the Orbit and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">Motion</a> of the Georgium Sidus, which was published in the Edinburgh Transactions, Vol. I. He had observed the opposition of the planet, in 1786, with an equatorial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TELESCOPE\">telescope</a> only, and he had computed the elements of its orbit with greater accuracy than any other astronomer had then done; although his suspicion of the effect of such a planet on the motions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SATURN\">Saturn</a> has not been confirmed by later investigations, the irregularities of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANETS\">planets</a>, on the contrary, having been otherwise explained.\n\n2. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> paper, published in the same collection, Vol. II. p. 82, relates to The Motion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">Light</a>, as affected by refracting or reflecting substances which are themselves in motion: the author corrects some errors of Boscovich, who had miscalculated the effect of a water telescope; but he seems to agree with Dr Wilson in the suggestion of another experiment of a similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, which, to say the least, is wholly superfluous.\n\n3. The most important, beyond all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a>, of Professor Robison's scientific publications, are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> which he communicated from time to time to the third edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, and to its Supplement. It was under the care of Mr Colin Macfarquhar that the twelve first volumes of that edition of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> were published;* and upon his death, in 1793, the task of continuing it was committed to Dr Gleig, to whom Professor Robison became a most essential co-operator, and from that time \"the work ceased to be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> compilation.\" The first of his contributions, according to Professor Playfair, was the Article <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPTICS\">Optics</a>, but he probably only revised and enlarged that article; it was followed by Philosophy, which he wrote jointly with Dr Gleig; by Physics, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PNEUMATICS\">Pneumatics</a>, Precession, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROJECTILES\">Projectiles</a>, Pumps, Resistance, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">Rivers</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROOF\">Roof</a>, Rope-making, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROTATION\">Rotation</a>, Seamanship, Signal, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUND\">Sound</a>, Specific Gravity, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATICS\">Statics</a>, Steam, Steam Engine, Steelyard, Strength, Telescope, Tide, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRUMPET\">Trumpet</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">Variation</a>, and Waterworks; and in the Supplement, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">Arch</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">Astronomy</a>, Boscovich, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARPENTRY\">Carpentry</a>, Centre, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DYNAMICS\">Dynamics</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTRICITY\">Electricity</a>, Impulsion, Involution, Machinery, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNETISM\">Magnetism</a>, Mechanics, Percussion, Pianoforte, Position, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEMPERAMENT\">Temperament</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">Thunder</a>, Trumpet, Tschirnhaus, and Watchwork. Notwithstanding some degree of prolixity and want of arrangement, which could scarcely be avoided in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> of original articles for such a mode of publication, the whole of them, taken together, undeniably exhibit a more complete view of the modern improvements of physical science than had ever before\n\n---\n\n* The third edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica consisted of eighteen volumes; the Supplement to it of two volumes.\nbeen in the possession of the British public; and display such a combination of acquired knowledge with original power of reasoning, as has fallen to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOT\">lot</a> of a few only of the most favoured of mankind.\n\n4. It is not altogether with so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> approbation that his friends and his biographers have mentioned a work, of a nature rather <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> than philosophical, entitled *Proofs of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSPIRACY\">Conspiracy</a> against all the Religious and Governments of Europe*, 8vo. Ed. 1797; though it went through several editions. The principal part of the book consists of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ILLUMINATI\">Illuminati</a> and the German Union, whom he considers as having become the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> agents in a plot first formed by the Freemasons, at the suggestion of some ex-jesuit, who proposed for their model the internal economy of the order which he had quitted; and whatever fagadation this outline may have had in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, there is no doubt that the manner, in which Professor Robison has filled it up, betrays a degree of credulity, extremely remarkable in a person used to calm reasoning and philosophical demonstration. For example, in the admission of a story told by an anonymous German author, that the minister Turgot was the protector of a society that met at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARON\">Baron</a> d'Holbach's, for the purpose of examining the brains of living children, in order to discover the principle of vitality. He does not accuse the English Freemasons of having participated in the conspiracy; but he considers the Continental lodges as having been universally implicated in it.\n\n5. After the death of Dr Black in 1799, he undertook to superintend the publication of his *Lectures on Chemistry*, which appeared in 1803. 2 vols. 4. And he executed this task, which was rather laborious than difficult, with equal zeal and ability. He endeavoured to reduce to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> estimate the comparative pretensions of the French and British chemists, though he is somewhat puritanically severe in criticizing the literal meaning of the compliments paid to Black by Lavoisier, on which he founds a charge of insincerity.\n\n6. His last publication was the first volume of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> which was to form a complete system, entitled *Elements of Mechanical Philosophy*, 8. Ed. 1804. It comprehended only Dynamics and Astronomy; and it never became very popular: it was too difficult for the many, who wished for general and philosophical notions only, and not sufficiently precise and demonstrative for the few, who wanted practical and numerical results. In attempting to combine the separate merits of the *Exposition du Systeme du Monde*, and of the *M\u00e9canique C\u00e9leste*, the author sacrificed both the popular simplicity of the former, and the mathematical perfection of the latter. A few inaccuracies, which ought not to escape the attention of the reader of the work, have been pointed out in the *Imperial Review* for March 1805; a journal long since discontinued.\n\n7. The contents of the volume last mentioned, together with some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUSCRIPTS\">manuscripts</a> intended to have formed part of a second, and the greater part of the articles furnished by Professor Robison to the *Encyclop\u00e6dia*, were collected into a *System of Mechanical Philosophy*, with Notes, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAVID\">David</a> Brewster, LL.D. 4 vols. 8. Ed. 1822; a spirited book-seller in London having undertaken the risk of the publication. 1. The first volume begins with the articles *Dynamics, Projectiles, Corpucular Forces, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CAPILLARY\">Capillary</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">Attraction</a>, Bosovich's Theory*, and Rotation, all as remodelled for the *Elements*: then follow *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRENGTH_OF_MATERIALS\">Strength of Materials</a>, Carpentry, Roof, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">Construction</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARCHES\">Arches</a>, Construction of Centres*. 2. The article *Steam-Engine* is enriched with notes and an appendix, by the late Mr Watt; the next is Machinery; then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESISTANCE_OF_FLUIDS\">Resistance of <a cla</a>ss=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">Fluids</a>, Rivers, Waterworks, Pumps. 3. Astronomy, Telescopc, Pneumatics. 4. Electricity, Magnetism, Variation, Temperament, Trumpet, Watchwork, and Seamanship. The notes are not numerous, and the editor's principal labour has been to retrench some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> that appeared to him superfluous, when the papers were to stand as parts of such a collection.\n\n\"Although Dr Robison's name,\" says Dr Brewster in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-PREFACE\">preface</a>, \"cannot be associated with the great discoveries of the century which he adorned, yet the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of his talents and his virtues <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be long cherished by his country. Imbued with the genuine spirit of the philosophy which he taught, he was one of the warmest patrons of genius wherever it was found. His mind was nobly elevated above the mean jealousies of rival ambition, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of science and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> was too ardent to allow him either to depreciate the labours of others, or to transfer them to himself. To these great qualities as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>, Dr Robison added all the more estimable endowments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> and of social life. His friendship was at all times generous and sincere. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a> was ardent and unostentatious. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRIOTISM\">patriotism</a> was of the most pure and exalted character; and, like the immortal Newton, whose memory he cherished with a peculiar reverence, he was pre-eminently entitled to the high distinction of a Christian, patriot, and philosopher.\" His person was handsome, and his physiognomy prepossessing; and he appears to have been endowed with an extraordinary combination of talents, even exclusively of those which were called into immediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> in his professional pursuits; for he was a good linguist, an excellent draughtsman, and an accomplished musician: his conversation was always energetic and interesting, and sometimes even poetical; and his liberality of sentiment was only limited by his regard for what he considered as the best interests of mankind.\n\nA short account of his life was published in 1802, by a contributor to the *Philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGAZINE\">Magazine</a>*, who, among other inaccuracies, thought himself at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> to assert that he was an admirer of the algebraical form of representation, in preference to the geometrical. His friend, Dr Gleig, stepped forwards soon after to correct these mistakes, in the *Antijacobin Review* for 1802, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> was copied into the *Philosophical Magazine*. He asserts, from his own knowledge, that even yet Professor Robison \"delights much more in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">geometry</a> than in any of the modes of algebra, assigning, as the reason of his preference, that in the longest demonstration, the geometrician has al-\nways clear and adequate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a>, which the most expert algebraist can very seldom have.\" It may perhaps be asserted, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, that the same reasoning would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> us always to employ actual multiplication or division, in preference to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOGARITHMS\">logarithms</a> or of a sliding rule; and that the whole of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGIC\">magic</a> of calculation depends on the abstraction of the results from the numerous and separately unimportant steps by which they are obtained: but the having once seen those steps clearly is certainly of great importance to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of reasoning, even when the memory no longer retains them; and no mathematician of correct taste can study the ancient geometricians without admiring the elegance and precision of their method, even amidst the pedantry which too frequently envelopes their expressions, and without being grateful for their punctuality in collecting their results into the very convenient form of distinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a>, and in making such references from each proposition to the foundations on which it depends, as to enable him readily to trace back their steps to the most elementary principles; which is scarcely possible in any of the works of the most modern school of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a>. Professor Robison, however, seems rarely to have cultivated the higher mathematics for their own sake only, or any further than as they could be applied to the study of the phenomena of nature, or to the practice of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a> of art; in fact, without some such limitation, there would be no track to guide us in the pathless regions of quantity and number, and their endless relations and functions. But besides the utility of the pure mathematics, as a branch of early education, in exercising and fortifying the powers of the mind, it is impossible to foresee with certainty how much of mathematics may be wanted by the natural philosopher in any given <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>; and Professor Robison, as well as many others of his countrymen, would certainly have been the better for the possession of a little more, as the author of the criticisms in the Imperial Review has already had occasion to remark.\n\n[Phil.

On the east are the Firths of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-DORNOCH\">Dornoch</a>, Cromarty, and Moray, arms of the sea which run up into the interior; the latter, the most considerable, washing its south-eastern extremity. The west <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> is still more indented with similar, though smaller, inlets, here called lochs; of which the largest are the Great and Little Loch <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROOM\">Broom</a>, Loch Groinard, Loch Ewe, Garloch, where there has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> been a regularly productive cod-fishery, Loch Terridon, Lochs Kisserne and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARRON\">Carron</a>, and Loch Duich. From north to south Ross-shire extends about 56 miles, and from east to west somewhat more than 70; having an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a>, according to the latest authorities, of 2129 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> miles, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> 1,362,560 English acres, without including the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEWIS\">Lewis</a>, one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEBRIDES\">Hebrides</a> belonging to this county, or the space occupied by the county of Cromarty. In the Agricultural Survey by Sir George Mackenzie, its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> is computed to be greater by about half a million of acres. Ross and Cromarty contain 33 parishes, of which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> are on the west coast, and four in the island of Lewis. One <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> lies within the bounds of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYNOD\">synod</a> of Glenelg, and all the rest in that of Ross. Many of these parishes are very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>, but the ministers are assisted in their duties by missionaries maintained by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> bounty, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> for Propagating Christian Knowledge.\n\nIn the Encyclopaedia <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be found a pretty full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of this extensive district, to which we must refer, and shall notice here only such circumstances as may be necessary to give a general view of its present condition. Excepting a narrow tract on the sea-coast on the east, where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> are not unfavourable to cultivation, the general character of Ross-shire is that of a rugged mountainous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, interspersed with narrow glens, fresh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>, and mountain streams, with here and there fringes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> wood, and plantations of some extent, and a few gentlemen's seats; but, upon the whole, it is a wild and desolate region, upon which a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> falls in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, and snow in winter, the latter lying among the recesses of some of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> all the year. Including the woodlands, only about 9 acres in 100 are supposed to be susceptible of cultivation.\n\nThe landed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of Ross-shire, valued in the cess-books at L75,043, 10s. 3d. Scots, consisted, in 1811, of 85 estates, of which 50 were under the valuation of L500 Scots each, 25 above L500, and below L2000, and 10 above L2000; from which it would appear that they are generally of great extent; the medium size being upwards of 16,000 English acres. But their value is far from being in proportion; the real rent of the lands in that year having been L91,089, 18s. 8d., and of the houses L2798, 1s. 4d. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">Sterling</a>; the former affording a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> rental for each estate of not quite L1072, or about 1s. 4d. per <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACRE\">acre</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> seats are Brahan Castle, Stewart Mackenzie; Tulloch Castle, Davidson; Fowlis Castle, Monro, Bart.; Coul, Mackenzie, Bart.; Novar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">House</a>, Munro, Bart.; Invergordon Castle, Macleod; Balnagowan, Ross, Bart.; Tarbat House, Hay Mackenzie; Geanies House, Macleod; Conan House, Hector Mackenzie, Bart.; Rosehaugh, Roderick Mackenzie, Bart.; Cromarty House, Ross; and Lochalsh, Innes, Bart.\n\nThe occupation of this district in an agricultural Rural Review, and the system of management which prevails among the tenantry, do not differ materially from what we have already described under Inverness-shire and the other Highland counties of Scotland. The native farmers hold a few acres of arable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, with grazings <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> contiguous, but in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> at a distance\u2014raise oats, bear or big, and potatoes; and keep a great many cattle and horses, which are always stunted in their growth for want of food, and in severe winters many of them perish. Except in seed-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARVEST\">harvest</a>, and while they are preparing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEAT\">peat</a> for their winter's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a>, the tenants spend much of their time in idleness, or in the practice of illicit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTILLATION\">distillation</a> among their hills, though in some parts, particularly on the west coast, also in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISHING\">fishing</a>; and their labour, and that of their cattle, is, generally speaking, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> and unproductive. Several of the proprietors, however, and some farmers brought hither from other counties, conduct their farming operations upon the most approved system; and upon the east coast all the crops grown in Scotland may be seen under excellent cultivation. Sheep-farming, too, notwithstanding the opposition of the small tenants, has been introduced into this as well as most of the other Highland counties. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LEASES\">Leases</a> for nineteen years have become <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> here as in other parts of Scotland.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DINGWALL\">Dingwall</a>, at the bottom of the Frith Towns of Cromarty, Fortrose, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TAIN\">Tain</a>, on the south coast of Dornoch Frith; all royal burghs, but very small places, and situated on the east side of the county. On the west, the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of any consideration is the village of Ullapool, on the banks of Loch Broom, built within these thirty years by the British Society for extending the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FISHERIES\">Fisheries</a>, &c. at an expense of upwards of L20,000. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERRING\">herring</a>-fishery on this coast, always precarious, having failed for several years in succession, the inhabitants have been often reduced to great distress, and notwithstanding every encouragement, many have abandoned it. It remains to be seen whether the recent repeal of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> duties may not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> to a more spirited and successful prosecution of the fisheries, so much to be desired for the employment and subsistence of the people of this and other parts of the Highlands, who are by far too numerous to be employed beneficially in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>. Even the loch-fishings, hitherto much neglected, might be rendered a valuable resource in this respect.\n\nThere is scarcely any thing in Ross-shire that deserves the name of a manufacture, except one of a somewhat peculiar description, and which may be worth notice for that reason. We allude to the practice of obtaining tar, so necessary for the sheep-stocks of the county, and other purposes, from the roots and trunks of the fir-trees found in the mosses. These mosses, which are of great extent here, as\nRoss-shire, which has about 90 freeholders, sends one member to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a>; and in the elections for the Scottish burghs, Dingwall and Tain are associated with Dornoch, Wick, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KIRKWALL\">Kirkwall</a>, and Fortrose with Forres, Nairn, and Inverness. The jurisdiction of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SHERIFF\">sheriff</a> extends over this and the shire of Cromarty; and his substitutes hold their courts at Tain, Dingwall, and Fortrose, for the mainland of the county, and at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STORNOWAY\">Stornoway</a>, in Lewis, for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a> politically attached to it. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> of the two counties of Ross and Cromarty, according to the census of 1801, was 52,291; in 1811 it amounted to 60,853; and in 1821 to 68,828, of which 32,324 were males, and 36,504 were females. The families employed in agriculture were 7947; in trade and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a> 3356; in other occupations of various kinds 3203. The increase of population from 1811 to 1821 was 13,485.\n\nSee the general works quoted under the former Scottish counties, and Sir George Mackenzie's General View of the Agriculture of the Counties of Ross and Cromarty.

It is sometimes called Teviotdale, from its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> river the Teviot, but improperly, as it also includes a tract called Liddesdale on the south-west, which is unconnected with the Teviot. Its boundaries are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol4.html#article-BERWICKSHIRE\">Berwickshire</a>, from which it is separated in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> by the river Tweed, on the north; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SELKIRKSHIRE\">Selkirkshire</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUMFRIES\">Dumfries</a>-shire on the west, and south-west; and the English counties of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUMBERLAND\">Cumberland</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTHUMBERLAND\">Northumberland</a> on the south-east and east. Between Berwickshire and Selkirkshire, a small tract touches the county of Mid-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOTHIAN\">Lothian</a>; on the south, between Dumfries-shire and Cumberland, the county terminates almost in a point; on the west it surrounds small portions of Selkirkshire in some places, and in others projects into that county; and it has the Cheviot hills on the east; the outline being exceedingly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> on all sides. According to the latest authorities, its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a> is 715 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> miles, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> 457,600 English acres; containing 30 entire parishes, and part of other four, which properly belong to the counties adjoining. For the purposes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-POLICE\">police</a>, it is divided into the four districts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KELSO\">Kelso</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JEDBURGH\">Jedburgh</a> on the east, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MELROSE\">Melrose</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAWICK\">Hawick</a> on the west. In an agricultural view, it may be considered as divided into arable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> and hilly pasture; the pasture land, estimated at about 3/4ths of the whole, occupying the eastern, southern, and western <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>, and surrounding, in a circular form, the arable, which lies on the north and north-east sides of the county.\n\nExcept upon the banks of the streams, which are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> great width, there is very little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> or flat land in this district; and, compared with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> grounds in other parts of Scotland, hardly any part of it can be said to be mountainous. The cultivated districts are beautifully diversified with narrow valleys, each traversed by its own rivulet, often fringed with wood, and bounded by gentle acclivities; and the hills in pasture are, with few exceptions, clothed in verdure to their very summits. On the confines of Northumberland, the most elevated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>, the hills seldom reach the height of 2000 feet, but there are many from that height <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to 800 or 1000 feet. The most considerable are Minto and the Eildon hills, both in the arable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a>; and Dunion, Ruberslaw, Wisp, Hownam <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">Law</a>, Milwood-Fell, Carter-Fell, and Chilhill, in the pastoral districts. Most of them having a conical form, insulated at their base by streamlets, and not rising in a continuous range, present very conspicuous objects, and at a distance seem higher than they are found to be when approached. The beauties of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> scenery have, over all the lower grounds, been heightened and improved by the wealth and industry of its inhabitants; all this division abounding in gentlemen's seats, comfortable, and sometimes elegant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARM\">farm</a>-houses; the fields inclosed with hedges of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THORN\">thorn</a>, and belts of wood, and many spots covered with young trees. On the skirts of the hills, too, cultivation has made considerable progress of late, as much, perhaps, as could be expected in the natural circumstances of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>; but the interior of the pastoral district is in general naked, without trees or fences, and very thinly inhabited.\n\nThe prevailing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> of the arable land, and over most of the hills, is what is called a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a> loam, though of different qualities, excellently adapted to the turnip culture. Tracts of a clayey or more heavy soil, however, occupy a considerable space, especially on the north-west. Clay is also found on the north, near the Tweed, where it is rich and fertile. Moss, marsh, and heath, occur in the southwest, and occasionally in other quarters; but altogether they cover but a small proportion of the surface.\n\nNo district in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> is better supplied with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> and streams, though it has only two that deserve the name of rivers, the Tweed and the Teviot. The Tweed, which crosses the north part of the county, and for part of its course forms the boundary with Berwickshire, enters it from Selkirkshire, on the north-west, and leaves it below Redden on the north-east; carrying with it nearly all the waters that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> through, or have their source in, this district. Its banks, especially near Kelso, where it is crossed by an elegant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a>, built about 20 years ago, are perhaps equal in richness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> to those of any river of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> in Britain. The Teviot more properly belongs to this county; rising and terminating within its bounds. It has its source in the southwest extremity, near the confines of Dumfries-shire, and flowing north-east almost through the middle of the district, joins the Tweed, in which its name is lost, a little above the town of Kelso. From Hawick downwards it is a considerable stream, and,\nlike the Tweed, flows through a very fertile and well cultivated country. The principal rivulets that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> into the Teviot from the south are Allen, Slitrick, Rule, Jed, Oxnam, and Kale; and from the north and west, Borthwick and Ale. The Liddel and Hermitage, which run on the south-west, and whose united streams retain the name of Liddel, from which this tract is called Liddesdale, soon leave Roxburghshire; and after forming the boundary between Dumfriesshire and Cumberland, fall into the Esk above Longtown. The other streams are the Etterick, which joins the Tweed from the south-west as it enters this county; another Allen and the Leader, which fall into the same river from the north; and the Eden, which, after an easterly course, partly on the boundary with Berwickshire, enters the Tweed on the north-east, a little before it leaves the county. The Beaumont also rises here among the Cheviot hills on the east, but after a short course, passes by Kirkbyetholm, and enters Northumberland. Of the smaller streams, the Ale, Jed, Rule, and Hermitage, are distinguished for their natural scenery; to which we may add the Liddel, celebrated by the late Dr Armstrong, a native of Liddesdale. Tweed is the only river frequented by salmon, except at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of spawning, when they are found in most of the other streams. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TROUT\">Trout</a> abounds in the Ale, Rule, Jed, and Kale, and there are a few small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a> which contain perch and pike.\n\nRoxburghshire is not rich in minerals. Coal has been found on the Carter Hill, near the borders of Northumberland, and in the southern extremity of Liddesdale. It is worked at the latter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, but this is too remote to render it of much value to the inhabitants of this county, who are chiefly supplied with coal from Northumberland. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">Limestone</a>, which abounds in various parts, is not wrought to any extent, owing to the want of coal. There are excellent sandstone quarries at Sprouston on the Tweed, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARL\">marl</a> in several parishes, particularly at Eckford, on the Teviot, and Ednam, near the Tweed. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of marl as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANURE\">manure</a> is confined to a narrow circle around the places where it is found; lime, of which a much smaller <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> answers the purpose, being most in request; and the lime is almost all like the coal brought from Northumberland, from 20 to 30 miles distant from many parts of the arable district.\n\nThe valued rent of Roxburghshire is \u00a3314,663, 6s. 4d. Scots, being next to Fife and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERTH\">Perth</a>, the highest in Scotland; and the real rent of the lands, in 1811, was \u00a3230,663, 9s. 9d. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">Sterling</a>, and of the houses \u00a311,508, 6s. 3d. It is one of the few counties where the rent in Sterling falls below the valuation in Scots <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>; a circumstance which is certainly not owing to the want of improvements to sustain rent, nor to the present rents being too low; but to the mistaken vanity of its land owners, whose rent rolls at the time of the valuation are understood to have been stated too high. Of this valuation, which in 1811 was divided among 349 estates, about one-third belongs to lands held under entail, and more than two-thirds to families of the name of Kerr, Scott, Elliot, and Douglas. The principal proprietors are the Dukes of Roxburgh and Buccleuch, and the Marquises of Lothian and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TWEEDDALE\">Tweeddale</a>; but there are 33 estates in all that have a valued rent of upwards of \u00a32,000 Scots each; and 55 more are from \u00a3500 to \u00a32,000. Yet moderate and small properties are very numerous; the remaining 261 estates being under \u00a3500 Scots. Several of these exceeding a valuation of \u00a3400 Scots, and held of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CROWN\">Crown</a>, have been acquired by professional farmers, who have thus become freeholders, and enjoy a share of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> influence. Among the seats in the county, which are too numerous to be mentioned here, the most splendid is Fleurs, the mansion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">Duke</a> of Roxburgh, beautifully seated at the confluence of the Tweed and Teviot, near Kelso.\n\nRoxburghshire is divided, for the most part, into larger farms, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> we except a few sheep farms in the Highlands, than any other county in Scotland; many of them, consisting of land partly arable and partly pasture, being from 1000 to 3000 acres; and several of these, in some instances, are in the occupation of one tenant. Farms altogether arable, containing from 500 to 1000 acres, are not uncommon. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> and knowledge required for conducting concerns so extensive entitle such men to suitable accommodations in their houses and farm-offices, many of which are accordingly laid out and constructed in a superior style. Most of the farm servants are married and live in houses apart, set down together in some convenient quarter of the farm, each having a small garden attached. It is the practice here, as in other parts of the lowlands of Scotland, to pay most of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WAGES\">wages</a> in the produce of the farm, and not in money; every married ploughman, or hind, getting a certain quantity of corn, a cow kept, and some land allowed for potatoes, and often also for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAX\">flax</a>: he is also commonly allowed to keep a pig and a few hens. Whatever may be the fluctuation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARKETS\">markets</a>, these labourers are thus always provided with the necessaries of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a> made from their cow, with its calf, and the eggs of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POULTRY\">poultry</a>, and, if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> be not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>, a part of their corn, supplies them with the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> they need; while they fatten their pigs, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> up the flax for the use of their families. No class of men of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> are to be compared with these hinds for propriety of conduct and frugality; and few of the labouring classes anywhere are so comfortable and contented with their condition. The practice of paying wages in kind is not, it must be admitted, free from objections; a little pilfering is sometimes detected on the one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, and a hard <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>, on the other, may be willing to pay in produce of an inferior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>; but after all, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> that has been had of this system over five or six of the principal agricultural counties of Scotland, and the north of England, warrants us in asserting that it works well for both parties, and might have some effect in keeping down <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATES\">rates</a> if it prevailed more generally among our southern neighbours.\n\nOn the best soils, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROTATION\">rotation</a> of crops is very simple, corn being taken every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> year with a green crop intervening; but, in general, the land does not admit of such constant tillage, and two-fifths, or a half, is commonly in pasture from seeds. Un-\nder a six years' course, the most profitable on rather weak soils, and in a district where there are no large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> to furnish manure, the rotation from pasture is oats, turnips, barley or wheat, clover and rye-grass, partly cut for hay the first year, but chiefly pastured with sheep, and then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> in pasture two years longer. Under this system the crops are almost always good, and the land, instead of being exhausted, is kept in a state of progressive improvement. Though little of the soil be naturally adapted to wheat, yet this grain is now raised to a great extent on all the better descriptions of sandy loam; generally after turnips eaten on the ground by sheep, which, by their treading, give consistency to the soil, as well as leave it greatly enriched by their manure.\n\nOnly a small part is under beans, somewhat more under peas; barley has in many instances been superseded by wheat; so that wheat and oats are the principal crops of grain; while, whatever be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of acres in corn, nearly half the quantity is allotted to turnips, and the other half to clover and rye-grass. Potatoes occupy but a very small part of every farm; and flax, where raised at all, is only in small patches for the use of the farm servants. The turnip crop, however, has been lately attacked with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> which has already begun to make some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> in the system, leading to the more extensive culture of potatoes, and also of cabbages. This disease, which has been long known in England, but which was a stranger in this and other parts of Scotland 10 or 12 years ago, popularly known by the name of fingers and toes, converts the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BULB\">bulb</a> of the turnip, when one has been allowed to form, into a shapeless and morbid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> which no animal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> eat, and becomes putrid, and disappears altogether on the first approach of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FROST\">frost</a>. It often prevails over extensive fields, while others adjoining escape; and it seems to make no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> whether the land be fresh from pasture or has been long in tillage.\n\nThe pastoral district of this county is occupied with an excellent breed of sheep called the Cheviot, from the general name of the hills on which they feed; for an account of which breed we must refer to the Article <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">AGRICULTURE</a> in this Supplement. On the arable farms, the short-horned cattle and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEICESTER\">Leicester</a> sheep, neither of them, however, always in a pure state, form the principal stock; and, as so large a proportion of even the arable land is always in grass, the number of both is very great. By means of turnips, most of the disposable stock, whether of cattle or sheep, are carried forward till they are ready for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUTCHER\">butcher</a>; when the far greater part is sent to the weekly market of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MORPETH\">Morpeth</a> in Northumberland, for the consumption of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEWCASTLE\">Newcastle</a> and other towns in the north of England.\n\nThe progress which agriculture has made in this district has not been favoured by its situation in respect to markets. It has no large towns, and comparatively a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a>. Most of the corn, as well as live stock, must, therefore, be carried out of the county; and Berwick-upon-Tweed, the nearest seaport, is upwards of 30 miles from much of its corn lands.\n\nThe towns are Kelso, Jedburgh, Hawick, and Melrose; and of the villages the most considerable are Roxburghshire, Yetholm and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KIRKCUDBRIGHT\">Kirkcudbright</a>, near its eastern boundary. Kelso, pleasantly situated on the north <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a> of the Tweed, is a well built, cleanly, and cheerful place, containing near 5000 inhabitants, the capital of this and the adjoining county of Berwick. Some branches of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a> and woollen manufacture, and that of thread, have been long carried on here, with a considerable brewery. Jedburgh, the county town, situated on the rivulet Jed, in the interior, though a place of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> formerly, has been long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a>, if not declining. Hawick, which stands on the Teviot, at the point where it is joined by the Slitrick, is a more thriving place, and has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a> of carpeting, stockings, and other sorts of woollen goods. Melrose, near the south bank of the Tweed, about 10 miles west from Kelso, is no otherwise distinguished than for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABBEY\">abbey</a>. (See MELROSE in the Encyclopaedia.) The two Yetholms are worthy of notice for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-FAIRS\">fairs</a>, at which a great part of the cattle, sheep, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a>, of the county are sold; and Kirkcudbright for being the residence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GYPSIES\">gypsies</a>, and their principal colony in Scotland. Roxburgh, which gives its name to the county, and whose castle was of such importance in the wars between England and Scotland, has long since ceased to exist, and has left no trace of its former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>. At Jedburgh, Kelso, Melrose, and the village of Gattonside, there are some valuable orchards, particularly at Jedburgh and Melrose, where some very old trees which belonged to their abbeys are still remarkably prolific.\n\nThis county, placed on the borders of the two Antiquities kingdoms, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of frequent warfare and depredation, presents the ruins of a great many castles and towers, and other remains of an early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>. It was also distinguished for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> buildings, of which there are still magnificent remains at Kelso and Jedburgh, as well as at Melrose.\n\nRoxburghshire, which has about 140 freeholders, represents one member to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a>; and Jedburgh, its only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> burgh, joins with Lauder, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HADDINGTON\">Haddington</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUNBAR\">Dunbar</a>, and North Berwick, in electing another for the Scottish burghs. This is one of the few Scottish counties in which there are regular assessments for the poor; and, not many years ago, it presented the still greater anomaly of a Scottish clergyman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITHES\">tithes</a> in kind. Among the eminent men to whom this district has given birth are Thomson, Armstrong, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Kames, Elliot, the brave defender of Gibraltar, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEYDEN\">Leyden</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARK\">Park</a>, the African traveller, and William Dawson, the father of the improved agriculture of Scotland.\n\nThe population, according to the census of 1801, was 33,682; in 1811 it amounted to 37,230; and in 1821 to 40,892, of which 19,408 were males, and 21,484 were females. The families employed in agriculture were 3613; in trade and manufactures 2822; in all other occupations 2204. The increase of population from 1811 to 1821 was 7210.\n\nSee the general works quoted under the former Scottish counties, and Douglas' General View of the Agriculture of Roxburghshire.\n\nRUMFORD (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a>). See THOMPSON (Sir Benjamin).","sp":508,"ep":510},{"h":"RUSH","t":"a celebrated American physician, born, 5th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1745, near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRISTOL\">Bristol</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PENNSYLVANIA\">Pennsylvania</a>, was descended from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> who were originally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUAKERS\">Quakers</a>, and who had accompanied Penn, in 1683, to his infant colony.\n\nHe lost his father at an early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, and having been first placed by his mother at a school kept by the Rev. S. Finley, he proceeded to finish his classical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">College</a> of Princeton, and there took a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of Bachelor of Arts before he was sixteen. He then determined to make the profession of physic the pursuit of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, and went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> it, first under the care of Dr Redman of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILADELPHIA\">Philadelphia</a>, and then at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, where he was created a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">Doctor</a> of Physic in 1768. At the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of his return from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, a new school of medicine was about to be founded in Philadelphia, and he became Professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">chemistry</a> immediately upon his arrival. In 1776, he began to take an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a>, with the rest of his countrymen, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> struggle of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, and he was chosen a member of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONGRESS\">Congress</a> for the state of Pennsylvania; in 1777 he was appointed Surgeon General to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, and not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> after became Physician General: he also contributed his best efforts to the improvement of the internal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of the state which he represented. But he soon withdrew his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> from political affairs, in order to devote it exclusively to medical and literary subjects, and he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to be actively engaged in the practice of physic for the remainder of his life.\n\nIn 1776 he married Miss Julia <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STOCKTON\">Stockton</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-NEW_JERSEY\">New <a cla</a>ss=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERSEY\">Jersey</a>. He had by her thirteen children, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> of whom survived him in respectability and prosperity. In 1791, when the two medical colleges of Philadelphia were incorporated into a single university, he was appointed Professor of the Institutes of Medicine, and of Clinical Practice. In 1793, he greatly distinguished himself by the new and apparently successful modes of practice that he introduced in the epidemic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> fever, which was then causing great mortality throughout the United <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">States</a>; and which, shortly before his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, he was induced to believe not contagious, but derived from some general causes independent of the previous existence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>. He died on the 13th of April 1813, after an illness of five days, of a typhous fever, with some pulmonary symptoms. He had for a considerable part of his life been threatened with consumption, but had combated its attacks with unusual success. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of his writings is considerable in proportion to their bulk; the times and the state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> in which he lived being such as to produce rather hasty and spirited than highly finished compositions.\n\n1.

The subject is continued in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the Inquiries, published in 1793; and bleeding is very strongly recommended in the earlier and only curable stages. Consumption, he observes, is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> in America, though scrofula scarcely ever occurs; and it has sometimes been known to be clearly communicated by infection to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NEGROES\">negroes</a> belonging to a family, who had, of course, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSANGUINITY\">consanguinity</a> that could account for a similarity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>.

A Letter on Hydrophobia. 1813; addressed to Dr Hosack, and containing additional reasons for believing the seat of the disease to be chiefly in the blood vessels; an opinion which, in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>, has at least tended to shorten the sufferings of several individuals on whom the experiment of profuse depletion has been tried.\n\nDr Rush's numerous publications obtained him many marks of respect from his contemporaries, and procured him admission, as an honorary member, into the most distinguished literary and philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a> of Europe. His name was familiar to the medical world as the Sydenham of America; his accurate observations and correct discrimination of epidemic diseases well entitled him to this distinction; while, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> energy of his reasoning, he far excelled his prototype. His literary and professional character, indeed, appears to have been greatly influenced by the moral and political sentiments which were prevalent in his day. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of innovation led him to that proud defiance of established authority which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> as likely to be pernicious as to be salutary. The study of the learned languages he deprecated, in one of his early essays, as unfit for a republican education; and this was the first step to the true Jacobin doctrine, that it was unrepulican and aristocratical to have received any education whatever. In physic, his rejection of the prejudices of antiquity was somewhat more consistent with moderation, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REFORM\">reform</a> that he attempted was occasionally more successful than his literary speculations; nor can it be denied that there are a multitude of original suggestions in his works, which may very probably be found capable of affording valuable hints to the lovers of medical experiments.\n\nHosack and Francis in the Amer.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> changes in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> have arisen from the possession of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINLAND\">Finland</a>, and the erection of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLAND\">Poland</a> into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> under the control of Russia. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>, some additions of territory have been gained from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TARTARY\">Tartary</a>. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>, settlements have been established on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>-west <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of that continent, and claims have been made to some extensive tracts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> which are supposed to conflict with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> of Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, of the United <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">States</a> of America, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>.\n\nGeneral View of the Russian Empire.\n\nThe Russian dominions, including Poland, form a connected territory, extending from the frontiers of Germany and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUSSIA\">Prussia</a> eastward to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> which divides America from Asia, and beyond that, on the continent of America, to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> hitherto undefined, and which is likely to become the subject of discussion with the other powers established in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of the globe. Its most western point is in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a> 18\u00b0 6', and its most eastern in 202\u00b0 26' east from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>.

The extent of this empire has been calculated by different writers with considerable variations. Some have included the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAUCASUS\">Caucasus</a>, others the whole of the Caspian Sea; whilst some, again, have omitted the\none and not the other. The comparative results of the several calculations, and the modes by which they have been conducted, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> to the conclusion, that an extent of 7,350,000 English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> miles, or 4,704,000,000 acres, is the nearest approximation to accuracy. The whole of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHINA\">China</a> is not equal to two-thirds of Russia; and the Roman Empire, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of its greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a>, did not comprehend more than one-fourth of the territory now subject to that power.* The extent of the European portion of her dominions is only calculated at about one-fifth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the whole.\n\nThe increase of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> in Russia appears to have been equal to that of any other European country. The accounts were very imperfectly kept before the year 1796, as neither the females nor the privileged classes were noticed. By estimates, founded upon the return of taxable males, the inhabitants were calculated to have been, in 1723, 11,736,676; in 1743, 13,653,191; in 1763, 17,886,139; and in 1783, 25,482,214.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> of the Academy of Petersburg give the population of the following years till 1805, thus:\n\n| Year | Population |\n|------|------------|\n| 1800 | 33,159,860 |\n| 1801 | 34,043,357 |\n| 1802 | 34,802,828 |\n| 1803 | 35,134,177 |\n| 1804 | 36,043,483 |\n\nIn these accounts, the inhabitants of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOSCOW\">Moscow</a> and Petersburg, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> and their families, and the wandering tribes, amounting to 2,900,000 persons, were not included. With the addition of these classes, the result of the calculation gave, as the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of inhabitants, 41,253,483.\n\nThe following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">Table</a> is formed from the reports published by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYNOD\">Synod</a> (which, however, includes only the members of the Orthodox Greek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>), and shows the rate of the progressive increase of the population, as far as relates to that most numerous proportion of the people.\n\n|       | 1806   | 1810   | 1816   | 1820   |\n|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Marriages | 299,057 | 320,389 | 329,683 | 317,805 |\n| Births  | 1,361,286 | 1,374,926 | 1,457,606 | 1,570,399 |\n| Deaths  | 818,585 | 903,380 | 820,383 | 917,680 |\n| Deaths of Persons above 100 years old | 293 | 350 | 689 | 807 |\n\nTaking the account of the population, as stated before, to have been in the year 1806 - 41,253,483 And inferring an annual increase by excess of births over deaths at 500,000 from 1806 to 1822, being 16 years, or\n\nAnd for acquired territory, viz.\n\n| Year | Population |\n|------|------------|\n| 1807, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BIALYSTOCK\">Bialystock</a> | 219,050 |\n| 1809, Finland | 1,101,898 |\n| 1812, Caucasus provinces | 120,000 |\n| Moldaw and Bessarabia | 310,000 |\n| 1815, The portion of Poland | 3,472,500 |\n\nWe estimate the inhabitants of this empire\n\nThis vast population consists of several distinct races, which have been classed and calculated by several different writers under the following heads:\n\n1st, Slavonians. These, comprehending the inhabitants of Russia, Poland, Lithuania, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURLAND\">Courland</a>, are estimated at 44,930,000.\n\n2d, Finns. These consist of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> residents of Finland, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIVONIA\">Livonia</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAPLAND\">Lapland</a>, and some other tribes, which together amount to about 2,360,000.\n\n3d, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TARTARS\">Tartars</a>. They comprehend several tribes, and a great number of subdivisions of tribes. The Tartars proper are divided into fourteen different branches; the Noggers into six; besides which are the Kirgusiens, the Aralians, the Chewensens, the Bucharens, the Bashirs, the Teleutes, and the Jakutes, who are taken together at 1,800,000.\n\n4th, The Caucasians, which comprehend the Ischerekessens, the Awcheses, the Lesghies, the Ossetts, and Kistesses, estimated at 1,300,000.\n\n5th, Monguls. Under this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> are comprehended the Monguls proper, the Calmucks, the Buritens, and the Kuriles, supposed to amount to 350,000 only.\n\n6th. The Mandshurs, in two branches, viz. Tungusens and Lamutes, whose numbers do not exceed 80,000.\n\n7th, Polar People, comprehending Samoiedes, Korjacks, Ostjacks, Kamschats, and some smaller tribes, whose whole numbers are not more than 300,000.\n\n8th. The Colonists. These include the various foreigners established in the empire with peculiar rights. The Jews amount to about 500,000; the Germans to 250,000; and the other Europeans and Asiatics to about 750,000; making together, under this head, 1,500,000.\n\nThe comparative <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> classes in the Russian dominions have been recently stated as follow:\n\n* See Kraft, Sur la Surface Geometrique de la Russie. Novis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">Act</a>. Petersb. T. I. p. 389\u2014400.\n\u2020 It appears that the marriages in 1820 were fewer by 22,470 than in the year 1819.\n\u2021 The births of 1820 exceeded those of 1819 by 48,265.\n\u00a7 The deaths of 1820 were fewer than those of 1819 by 1,429.\n|| J. B. Georgi Beschreibung aller Nationen des Russischen Reichs. Hempel's and Geisler's Abbildung und Beschreibung der V\u00f6lker unter Alexander. Le Peuples de la Russie, par le Comte Ch. de Rechberg.\nThe people of Great and Little Russia, the Cossacks, the Greeks, Arnauts, Walachians, Moldavians, and Bulgarians, adhere to the Greek church. The Catholics are chiefly in Poland and Lithuania, and among the colonists. The Lutherans are to be found mostly in Finland, Courland, and Esthonia, and among the German colonists. The Armenians are mostly in the southern part of the Asiatic division of Russia, in the vicinity of Astrachan. The Calvinists, Hermuthers, Mennonites, are all colonists, except a few in Poland. Tartary contains chiefly Mahomedans. Schamanism or idolatry is practised by the Samoiedes and other Polar tribes.\n\nAll religious sects, whether <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> or others, enjoy equal civil rights; and the same protection in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of their various modes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a>. The predominant party, the Greek church, possess about 70,000 places of worship, which are served by about 160,000 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SECULAR\">secular</a> clergy. There are 480 monasteries, and 156 nunneries, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of the regular clergy. The whole are governed by a Consistory, of which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">Emperor</a> is perpetual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">president</a>, and which is divided into three departments; and these again into thirty-six sections or dioceses. The learning of the inferior clergy is very considerable; many of them can merely repeat by rote a few established prayers, can scarcely read, and much less write. They are allowed to marry once, but not after becoming widowers. Their sons must all be devoted to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> profession. They are generally paid small stipends by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>; but some few of them enjoy landed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> attached to their benefices. A few men of learning are to be found among the higher ranks of the clergy; but their number and acquirements have never been very distinguished.\n\nThe Catholic church, governed by a Consistory, comprehends one archbishopric, six bishoprics, and about forty religious establishments belonging to the several orders of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENEDICTINES\">Benedictines</a>, Franciscans, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CARMELITES\">Carmelites</a>, Bernardines, and Trinitarians.\n\nThe Lutherans, established in Finland, in Courland, and Livonia, are under the superintendence of their respective Consistories, each of which has a bishop as their president.\n\nThe other religious Christian denominations are rather voluntary associations, recognized by the state, than, properly speaking, established ecclesiastical communities.\n\nFew of the Mahomedans are very rigid in their adherence to the regulations of their prophet. They have colleges for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>; several mullahs, and two muftis. The mufti of Ufa enjoys a stipend of 1500 roubles from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>, and has two mullahs in Casan. The mufti of Taurus has joined with him a cadi, an effendi, and five ulemas, who regulate religious affairs, and administer the laws in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a>.\n\nThe worshippers of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">Grand</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAMA\">Lama</a> have their principal religious establishment at Darsan, in the province of Udinsk. Their priests are numerous, and, in the province of Irkurtz alone, are said to be near 300, where they are very successful in making converts among the wandering tribes.\n\nThe inhabitants of Russia are divided into the following classes or ranks; for though all offices are equally open to every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of subjects, yet exclusive privileges are enjoyed by some numerous bodies.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBLES\">Nobles</a> in Russia, though distinguished by the several titles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNT\">count</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARON\">baron</a>, are all upon an equal footing, and enjoy equal privileges. Their persons and lands are freed from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-TAXATION\">taxation</a>; they are exempted from the recruiting ballot; and are not subject to bodily penalties. These exemptions are, however, more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> than real; for though their lands and persons are not taxable, yet a capitation tax, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> of the government, may be imposed on their slaves, who form the most valuable part of their possessions. Though not in person compelled to serve in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, yet they are bound to furnish from their slaves a number of recruits in proportion to the demands of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>. In some of the more recently acquired provinces, such as Livonia, Esthonia, and in Poland, the nobles have, or rather exercise other privileges, extending even to the power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, over their vassals; but these powers arise from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> and general acquiescence much more than from the existing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a>.\n\nThe Clergy are exempt from taxation, and from corporal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>; which privileges are extended to each eldest son, who must, however, though his father is excused, take the risk of being called upon for military service.\n\nThe Citizens are divided into three guilds or classes, according to the amount of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> they possess; and have some most whimsical privileges proportioned to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>. Those of the first rank, with a capital of from 10,000 to 50,000 roubles, may carry on home or foreign trade; may be owners of ships; may drive a carriage with two horses; and are exempt from corporal punishment. The members of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> guild, possessing a capital of from 5000 to 10,000 roubles, can only carry on home trade, but enjoy all the other rights of the first guild. The members of the third guild must enjoy a capital between 1000 and 5000 roubles; they may carry on retail trades, be proprietors of barges and boats, keep taverns, and drive one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>, though not in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COACH\">coach</a>; but are not exempt from corporal punishments. Besides these there are the foreign and designated citizens. In this class is comprehended each person who has twice served any civic office; learned men and artists who can produce\nacademic testimonials; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BANKERS\">bankers</a> who possess capitals from 100,000 to 200,000 roubles; wholesale dealers, that keep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> shops, and shipowners, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> the sea. These may harness two or four horses to a coach; may possess country houses and gardens; may own ships; and are exempt from bodily penalties. None of the trading classes are exempt from the military conscription; but they are allowed to procure substitutes.\n\nThe next class is that of the Peasants or free inhabitants of the country. In this rank are included, 1st, The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of proprietors who cultivate their own lands, but do not enjoy the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> of possessing slaves. The males of this description amount to about 1,150,000. 2d, The Tartars, the Bashirs, and several other races, less numerous, to the south of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIBERIA\">Siberia</a>, who are all proprietors of the lands they cultivate. 3d, The peasants of Finland. Since the acquisition of New Finland, the privileges enjoyed by the peasants of that country, under the Swedish government, have been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> and confirmed to them; and the same rights granted to those of Old Finland, where all are now either proprietors or renters. 4th, The colonists, consisting of foreign families of agriculturists, who are proprietors of the lands they cultivate, and whose number is about 65,000. 5th, The military colonists. These are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> who, after having served a prescribed period, have had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> given to them, and a capital sufficient to cultivate it, in the southern provinces. And lastly, The free cultivators, a new class, founded by the present Emperor in 1803. They comprehend several villages, which have been liberated as an experiment. The number of individuals in 1810 was 19,757, since which period they have rapidly increased, and are said now to be near 20,000.\n\nThe class next below these is that of the Serfs. They are chiefly peasants on the Crown lands, or of the province of Livonia. The first of these, the Crown peasants, amount to near 12,000,000, some of whom labour in the fields, the others in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> and manufactories. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOT\">lot</a> of this class seems to be placed on the confines betwixt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SLAVERY\">slavery</a>. They may rise to the rank of citizens, they may acquire property, they enjoy the protection of the laws; and, under some restrictions, may quit their residences to obtain employment for a limited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>; but they are liable to be hired to the service of the mines, or to be sold. Although the Empress Catherine rarely gave these peasants away as presents to favourites, and the present Emperor has never done so, yet there is no legal security against the practice; and consequently their condition is scarcely less precarious than it was formerly. The peasants of Livonia, amounting to about 560,000, were slaves until the year 1804, when they first obtained the rights of serfs. They are now subject to some peculiar claims, but those claims are fixed, and they cannot be removed from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> without their own consent.\n\nThe last and most numerous class is that of the Slaves. Slaves. These amounted, in 1782, to 6,678,000 males, and at present are estimated to include 23,000,000 persons. They are in law considered as things, not as persons; may be bought, sold, or exchanged, with no more restrictions than are enacted in dealing for cattle; and have no other protection against their masters than what is created by a regard to their pecuniary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>. They belong to the nobles, or to such civil or military officers as have acquired the right of possessing them. They are divided into agricultural, mining, manufacturing, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> slaves, and have their condition only improved when drawn for military service.\n\nThe accounts of the agricultural and manufacturing productions of Russia are fully detailed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">Commerce</a> article of the Encyclopaedia already mentioned. They &c. have undergone very few alterations in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> since that article was written; and, consequently, only that their amount has increased with the increase of population and the extension of territory, no other notice seems here to be required beyond the value of the imports and exports at different periods.\n\nThe following Table exhibits a view of the Imports into, and Exports from, the whole of the Russian dominions, by sea and by land, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a> assignation roubles, estimated at four francs each, at several periods:\n\n| Year | Imports | Exports | Together | Value in Pounds <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">Sterling</a> |\n|------|---------|---------|----------|-------------------------|\n| 1797 | 36,980,111 | 54,601,368 | 91,581,479 | 15,263,570 |\n| 1802 | 56,330,094 | 63,277,759 | 119,607,853 | 19,934,642 |\n| 1803 | 55,557,075 | 67,148,643 | 122,706,318 | 20,451,053 |\n| 1805 | 55,529,118 | 72,434,095 | 127,968,213 | 21,277,152 |\n| 1819 | 167,599,003 | 219,589,310 | 378,188,310 | 66,531,235 |\n\nThe chief exports are corn, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEMP\">hemp</a>, tallow, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAX\">flax</a>, flax-seed, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, furs, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> goods, live cattle, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POTASH\">potash</a>. The principal imports are cotton and woollen goods, wines, dyers' drugs, raw <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a>, cotton <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEA\">tea</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>, coffee, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>, silk goods, fruit, and foreign silver <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COIN\">coin</a>.\n\nThe Government of Russia is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONARCHY\">monarchy</a>, in which the Emperor is the sole framer of the laws; but, as in other absolute monarchies, the exercise of power is tempered and somewhat moderated by the rights and privileges to which many bodies in different provinces have, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> established usage, such claims as would be dangerous to the monarch to infringe. In the administration of the government, there is an uniformity preserved throughout all the several provinces, and in the different branches into which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-EXECUTIVE_POWER\">executive power</a> is divided. The Emperor, through\nthe directing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a>, issues his ukases or laws to the Governors of the several provinces; which laws are executed by a Board, divided into sections, of which they are presidents. Besides the civil, there is a military governor in each department, to whom alone the affairs of the army are intrusted. There are deviations from this regularity of system among some tribes of Cossacks, who are ruled by their hereditary chiefs, and among the ruder classes. The ministers are appointed to different branches, denominated Foreign Affairs, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">War</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">Marine</a>, Interior, Instruction, Finance, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">Justice</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-POLICE\">Police</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">Agriculture</a>, and Ecclesiastical.\n\nThe Civil and Criminal codes of Russia are very imperfect, notwithstanding the efforts directed towards its improvement by the Empress Catherine, and the more practical, but unfinished attempt of the present Emperor. In the cities, two burgomasters and four counsellors; and in the country, one justice, with two noble and two plebeian proprietors, form tribunals of the first instance. From these, appeals may be made to higher courts in the several provinces; and from them again to the supreme tribunals at St Petersburg or Moscow. Among the less civilized people, great deviations from this system are still indulged; and their chiefs exercise an hereditary power in civil as well as in criminal matters, over their several tribes. A kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">Court</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">Conscience</a> exists in most places, which hears verbal complaints; acts as arbiters in differences about smaller matters; and exercises power in behalf of minors and imbeciles.\n\nThe Finances of the Russian empire are not submitted to general inspection with the same freedom, nor with the same accuracy, as is now practised by most other governments. The great depreciation experienced in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> currency creates some difficulty in ascertaining the amount of the income, expenditure, and national debt. Besides the payments in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, so many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> services and other benefits are derived to the crown, that the bare produce of the taxes falls considerably short of the effective revenue which is extracted by the government. The chief taxes are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITULATION\">capitulation</a>-tax of two roubles from each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEASANT\">peasant</a>, and five from each burgher; the property-tax of $\\frac{1}{2}$ per cent. on the capital of the traders; and the duties on the importation of foreign goods. The other material sources of revenue are, the monopoly of distilled corn spirits; the profits of the coining, of postage, and of stamped paper; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a> of wood from the annual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTINGS\">cuttings</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> forests. These several branches have been estimated to have afforded, in the year 1820, about thirteen or fourteen millions Sterling, including the kingdom of Poland. The expenses of the state, for many years, exceeded the income; and thus the public debt has been constantly increasing; but, it is said, the revenue now equals, or rather exceeds the expenditure. The national debt is supposed to amount to 1,000,000,000 roubles, or about L.160,000,000 Sterling. One-half of this is believed to consist in the government paper roubles, which have been issued at a gradually increasing depreciation. The other half, or funded debt, is principally owing to foreigners, and the interest is paid to them in silver money. This state of debt, for so extensive and so numerously peopled a country, may not appear very heavy; but in Russia, there is only paper money in circulation, and the constant drain to pay the interest of the debt in the precious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a>, makes the difficulty of returning to a metallic currency almost insurmountable. The project of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SINKING_FUND\">sinking <a c</a>lass=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUND\">fund</a> was adopted in 1817; but it has hitherto made but a slight progress in redeeming the debt, or in diminishing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of circulating paper; which is not at the present period worth one-fourth of its nominal value.\n\nThe increase of the Russian army has far exceeded what has been experienced in either the territory, the population, or the revenue of the empire.\n\n| Period                  | Troops |\n|-------------------------|--------|\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CZAR\">Czar</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a> I. in 1687   | 10,000 |\n| Emperor Peter I. in 1724 | 108,350|\n| Empress <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a> in 1747| 162,750|\n| Empress Catherine in 1771| 198,107|\n| in 1786                 | 263,662|\n| Emperor Paul in 1800    | 368,715|\n| Emperor Alexander in 1805| 428,287|\n| in 1820                | 989,117|\n\nAt the last of these periods the land force was composed of the following descriptions of troops:\n\n- 189 regiments and 565 battalions infantry: 618,722\n- 76 regiments and 563 squadrons cavalry: 118,141\n- 30 battalions <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTILLERY\">artillery</a>: 47,088\n- Extra corps: 27,632\n- <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">Irregular</a> troops (horse and foot): 105,534\n- Garrison troops: 77,000\n\nBesides this prodigious force, a national <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITIA\">militia</a>, is organised in all parts of the empire, except in Siberia and the two northern European provinces. The expense of this vast force is very small; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> for their equipment, provisioning, and arming, being of the cheapest and coarsest kind; and as the recruits are procured by ballot, and the pay of officers and men is low, the whole expense of the establishment is only 20,000,000 roubles, or about L.3,000,000 Sterling. The institutions for military education are fully commensurate to the extent of the force. In the Cadets-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> at Petersburg are 1000 youths; and the whole number in the empire, under appropriate instruction for the military profession, amount to nearly 3000.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">navy</a> of Russia has been neglected; and although the present force is equal to what existed in 1813, yet its character is much inferior, as many of the ships are become old. Very little timber of the best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> is to be found in the Russian territory; but every other article, required for a navy, is abundantly and cheaply supplied from domestic sources.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a> consists of 32 ships of the line, 18 frigates, 6 cutters, 7 brigs, 25 floating batteries, 121 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUN\">gun</a>-boats, and numerous armed small craft. This force is divided between the Baltic, the Caspian, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">Black</a> Seas. The whole number of officers,\nseamen, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINES\">marines</a>, with which the fleet is manned, is about 32,000, who are obtained by ballot from the seafaring people of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARITIME\">maritime</a> provinces. The naval ports are at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CRONSTADT\">Cronstadt</a>, Revel, Sweaborg, and Rotschensalm, on the Baltic; at Archangel, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">White</a> Sea; at Nikolajew, Sewastopol, Taganrog, and Cherson, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLACK_SEA\">Black Sea</a>; and at Astrachan, on the Caspian.\n\nHaving thus given a view of the general condition and circumstances of the Russian empire, in those respects in which alterations have taken place since the article in the Encyclopaedia was written; we may now proceed to a more particular description of its members and divisions.\n\n**European Russia, including the Dependent Kingdom of Poland.**\n\nThe grand division of European Russia is into six provinces, viz.\n\n| Names               | Extent in Square Miles | Population |\n|---------------------|------------------------|------------|\n| East Sea Province   | 192,064                | 3,857,107  |\n| Great Russia        | 938,929                | 21,330,279 |\n| Little Russia       | 88,256                 | 6,124,585  |\n| South or New Russia | 192,862                | 2,550,700  |\n| West Russia         | 139,712                | 8,480,022  |\n| Poland              | 46,741                 | 2,732,524  |\n\nIt thus appears, that in the whole of European Russia, the density of the population is somewhat less than 2\u00bd persons to each square <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILE\">mile</a>, or nearly one person to 282 English statute acres.\n\nThe East Sea province is divided into the following governments, viz.\n\n| Names    | Extent in Square Miles | Population |\n|----------|------------------------|------------|\n| Petersburg | 18,090                | 808,512    |\n| Finland  | 134,444                | 1,346,139  |\n| Esthonia | 6,890                  | 396,032    |\n| Livonia  | 20,110                 | 737,734    |\n| Courland | 9,544                  | 568,690    |\n\nThe inhabitants in this province are nearly one to twenty acres of land.

The chief cities in the government of Moscow are, first, Moscow, one of the capitals of the empire, nearly the whole of which was destroyed by the fire in 1812, when the French troops were in possession of it. It has been since rebuilt in a great part, as far as regards the dwellings of individuals, but many of the public edifices are yet unfinished. There are now rebuilt upwards of 200 churches, more than 9000 houses, and between 6000 and 7000 booths. The number of inhabitants in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> of 1820 was about 200,000; and in the following winter, when the nobles, with their numerous establishments of domestics and slaves, took up their residence in the city, they are said to have been increased to about 50,000. The city of Kolomna contains 5809 inhabitants, Serpuchov 5540, Vereja 5941, and Moshaish 3944; all the others have less than 3000 inhabitants.

In Podolia are the cities of Kamenetz, with 5650 inhabitants, and Mohileu with 7000. The city of Bialystock contains 3350 inhabitants; and no other place of that government 2000.\n\nThe ancient kingdom of Poland has, by successive divisions, been reduced to a small territory, when compared with its former extent. A description of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUCHY\">Duchy</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POSEN\">Posen</a>, a part of it, is to be found in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, under the head of Prussia. Galititia is united to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUSTRIA\">Austria</a>; part is included in the present province of West Russia; and a very small portion, con-\ntaining the city of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CRACOW\">Cracow</a>, and the surrounding district, is formed into an independent republic. The part now called the kingdom of Poland is, properly speaking, a Russian viceroyalty. It has, indeed, been permitted to retain some of its ancient forms and institutions; but it is effectively, at present, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> province of the Russian empire, and in that view we must now consider it.\n\nThe grand divisions are into eight Waywodeships, and these are again subdivided into Obwodeships.\n\n| Name of Waywodeship | Extent in Square Miles | Population in 1819 | Capitals and their Inhabitants |\n|---------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Massovia            | 6858                  | 481,000           | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARSAW\">Warsaw</a> 98,000                 |\n| Kalitch             | 6862                  | 512,000           | Kalitch 7,310                 |\n| Cracow              | 4500                  | 445,000           | Kielce 5,000                  |\n| Sandomir            | 5982                  | 432,000           | Radom 1,500                   |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUBLIN\">Lublin</a>              | 6657                  | 490,000           | Lublin 10,300                 |\n| Polachia            | 4864                  | 286,000           | Siedlec 2,145                 |\n| Augustow            | 6870                  | 335,000           | Suwalki 3,000                 |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLOCK\">Plock</a>               | 6635                  | 364,000           | Plock 6,000                   |\n\nThe inhabitants are one to about nine acres of land.\n\nPoland is generally a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> country, but towards the south is more undulating, and some of the hills rise to the height of 2000 feet above the level of the sea. It is well supplied with running streams. To the north of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VISTULA\">Vistula</a> and the Bug, the soil is for the most part <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a>, but generally fertile. In the south, the soil is a rich vegetable mould, intermixed with marshes and morasses. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> is colder in the winter than in the same latitude in Germany and France. The productions are, corn of all kinds, hemp, flax, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-HOPS\">hops</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOBACCO\">tobacco</a>, wood, fruit, cattle, abundance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAME\">game</a>, river fish, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a>, and wax. The minerals are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>, lead, iron, and calamine. There is much marble, alabaster, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">limestone</a>; and in some parts salt, sulphur, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALTPETRE\">saltpetre</a>, and coal. The manufacturing labour is chiefly destined to provide clothing, and the most homely articles for domestic use. The Jews are the chief traders, manufacturers, and innkeepers; and their dwellings, in the towns and villages, are far better than those of the clergy, or even the lower <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a>.\n\nThe inhabitants have increased at an extraordinary rate since the return of tranquillity. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between the year 1815 and 1819 appears to be 708,400 individuals, many of whom are German colonists. The number of Jews in 1819 was 212,944. All religious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROFESSIONS\">professions</a> enjoy equal rights. The Roman Catholic is the predominant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">sect</a>; their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HIERARCHY\">hierarchy</a> consists of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> and five <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a>. There is a Unitarian bishop of the Greek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RITUAL\">ritual</a>, who presides over 200 churches. The Lutherans are about 150,000, who have a consistory and superintendent. The Calvinists are about 6000. Besides these are several smaller Christian sects, and more than 100 families of Mahomedans. The nobility are very numerous, comprehending more than 60,000 families. They are distinguished by different titles, but have none of the privileges of rank, unless they possess property. Many of them are very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>, but about 100 enjoy very extensive estates. Some restrictions in the use of titles have been recently introduced, which prevent those from assuming them who do not possess a graduated specific amount of income according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a>. Professors of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">universities</a> of ten years standing, civil and military officers of the same length of service, and such burghers as make useful discoveries, may be now admitted into the ranks of nobility. The burghers have some civil rights granted in addition to those formerly enjoyed. The peasants have, however, been most benefited by the divisions that have been made of Poland. Under the ancient system, this numerous class of persons had neither property nor rights; and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> proverb, \"We have nothing but what we drink,\" is sufficiently descriptive of their low condition, and their habitual intemperance. They have now acquired personal freedom, and the right of holding landed property. To this extension of freedom may, in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, be attributed the recent increase of inhabitants; as many of the German emigrants would not have availed themselves of the greater fertility of the Polish soil, whilst the old slavish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEGRADATION\">degradation</a> of the peasants was continued.\n\nThe present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of Poland is a limited monarchy. The Emperor nominates the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">King</a>, who has the sole executive power. The legislature is divided into two chambers. The upper, or senate, consists of thirty members, nominated for life by the king; of whom ten are bishops, or clergy (approved by the Pope), ten are Waywodes, and the other ten Castellans, or Magnates. The lower house consists of sixty members, who must have attained 40 years. They are chosen for nine years, but every third year the retirement of one-third of them is determined by lot. They are elected by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCIAL\">provincial</a> assemblies of the nobles, where there are at least 600 qualified electors. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSIONER\">commissioner</a> is appointed for civil affairs, another for criminal matters, and a third for finances. These three persons, with the ministers who sit in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a>, not by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a>, but of right, are the only members permitted to speak, and all the others give their votes in silence. The assemblies are convened every other year, and sit only fourteen days to dispatch such business as is laid before them. They have no power to initiate a law, nor the right to exercise any inquisitorial functions. The assent of the upper chamber is not indispensable for promulgating a new law, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> it be approved by the lower chamber, on the recommendation of the king.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-POLES\">Poles</a> had formerly few or no written laws; but in the year 1257, Boleslau the Fifth introduced the use of the law-book of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGDEBURG\">Magdeburg</a>, which has been continued ever since as the compendium of civil and criminal law. The local courts consist of the landowners; the next higher court extends over each Waywodeship, and from them there is a court of general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a>. A new code of laws has been drawn up, but is not yet in practice.\n\nThe income of Poland is about L.850,000 Sterling, derived from a hearth and capitation-tax; from stamps, customs, lotteries, and posting. The civil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIST\">list</a> is about L.170,000; one-half of which arises from the\nnational domains, the other is taken from the public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURY\">treasury</a>. The debts of the state, including old and new, amount to 200,000 Polish gulden. The expenses are not accurately known, as no budget has yet been made public since the introduction of the new constitution, and the accession of the Russian Imperial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>.\n\nThe army consists of 30,000 infantry and 20,000 cavalry, of whom the royal guards form a body of 12,000; but the military organization is not yet completed. Every Pole, without exception of rank or religion, is, by the law, a soldier from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of twenty to thirty; but, in practice, numerous exceptions to the general rule are allowed. The muskets are supplied from a manufactory at Kouskie, but the cannon, as well as cloths for uniforms, must be drawn from other countries. There is a scarcity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a>, although saltpetre is abundant.\n\n**Asiatic Russia.**\n\nThe dominion of Russia comprehends the whole of Northern Asia, and extends from longitude 37\u00b0 14' to 190\u00b0 22' east from London; and from latitude 38\u00b0 58' to 78\u00b0 2' north. This vast dominion is calculated to be spread over 2/6ths of the land of the globe, and to be rather more than one-third of the surface of the whole of the continental portions of it.\n\nThe eastern division of the Asiatic Russian territory, from the river Jenisy, or Yenesii, has, on its southern and eastern parts, vast mountain ranges; and on its interior there are several chains that run to the Arctic Ocean in vast masses. It is covered with woods, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>, or extensive elevated plains, and terminates towards the shores of the Frozen Ocean, in vast fields of eternal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ICE\">ice</a>. The division to the westward has, indeed, some ranges of mountains, especially the Altai chain on the south, the Ural range on the west, and the ridge of Caucasus on the south-west, with their various projecting branches; but taken as a whole, it may be described as a vast level <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, partially watered, but by its climate and soil, ill adapted for the increase or the comfort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> beings. The soil to the westward of the Ural mountains is generally very fertile, and produces abundant returns of corn, but to the eastward it is barren, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, and scarcely exhibits any symptoms of vegetation.\n\nAlthough Russia in Asia is in part surrounded by, and in some parts covered with mountains, yet there are several barren plains of great extent, usually denominated Steppes. The most remarkable of these are, the Kirgissch Steppe, between the Irtish and the Orenburg boundary line. It is a very dry and barren district, with some lakes, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> is saline. The few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> have copious streams in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> from the melted snows, but in summer become dried up. The Wolgau Kalmuck Steppe, between the Ural and the Wolga, extending from the Caspian Sea to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAMARA\">Samara</a>, is of the same description. The Kuman Steppe, extending from the Caspian Sea to the Don and the Wolga, resembles a lake recently dried up; being formed of a mixture of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> and clay with an undulating surface, intermixed with salt lakes, and utterly destitute of vegetation. The other steppes, with slight varieties of character, are that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TEREK\">Terek</a>, between the rivers Terek and Kuma, touching on the Caspian Sea; of Kuban, extending from Kuban to the Manitsch and the lake of Bolschei; of Jettish to the eastward of the Ural; of Ischim on both sides the river of that name, between Tobol and the Irtish; and the Baraba, between the Irtish and the Ob. To these may be added the Arctic plain, between the 67th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of latitude and the Frozen Ocean, whose whole surface is little more than morasses, mixed with rocks, and bound up by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FROST\">frost</a> betwixt ten and eleven months in the year. These extensive plains are sometimes passed by the wandering tribes, who find subsistence on the less sterile spots which are to be met with on the banks of the rivers that bound them.\n\nThe rivers of Asiatic Russia that empty themselves into the Arctic Sea, are among the most considerable of the ancient world. The most remarkable of these are, 1st, The Ob, whose course is 2800 miles in length, during which it receives the great rivers, the Tom, the Kek, the Irtish (which, before the junction, runs 2500 miles, and takes into its stream the waters of the Ischim, the Tobal, and many other rivers), the Tyda, and all their tributary streams. 2d, The Yenesii, or Jenisy, which has a course of 2000 miles, with fewer sinuosities than are usually observed in other great rivers. It receives the waters of fourteen large streams and all their tributary collections. 3d, The Piasana, whose course is 300 miles. 4th, The Taimurskoe, a short stream issuing from a lake of the same name, in latitude 70\u00b0. 5th, The Khatanga, which empties itself into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a> of Khatangaskoi, on the Frozen Ocean. 6th, The Anabara, an Arctic stream. 7th, The Olenk, whose waters only become considerable after entering the Arctic circle. 8th, The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENA\">Lena</a>, one of the largest of the Asiatic Russian rivers. It rises in the Backal mountains to the north of China, in latitude 52\u00b0 30', and empties itself into the ocean in latitude 70\u00b0 40', and longitude 164\u00b0 26', after receiving the waters of fourteen large rivers and their numerous tributary streams. 9th, The Omoloi. 10th, The Jana. 11th, The Indigirka. 12th, The Alazeja. 13th, Kolyma. 14th, The Tchauna; and, 15th, The Amgonia. The streams whose courses have been traced to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> into the sea of Kauntschatka, between Asia and America, are the Anadyr, the Katirka, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KAMTSCHATKA\">Kamtschatka</a>, the Penshena, the Tilcha, the Ischiga, the Tauna, the Okhota, the Uda, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARGUN\">Argun</a>, and the Shilka. The Black Sea receives from Russian Asia the great rivers Kooban and Rioni, with their tributary waters, and several smaller streams which arise on the western sides of the mountains of Caucasus. The rivers which discharge themselves into the Caspian Sea are, 1st, The Wolga, which comes\n\n---\n\n* The best recent works on Poland are, Guide du Voyageur en Pologne, Varsovie, 1820; Polen Staatsver\u00e4nderungen und Letztere Verwaltung, von F. J\u00e4kel, Wien, 1819.\nout of the centre of European Russia, and forms the principal means of internal water <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> between the European and Asiatic portions of the empire. Its course is upwards of 2500 miles in length, during the progress of which it receives the streams of fourteen large, and of a vast number of smaller rivers.\n\n2d, The Kuma, rising in the northern Caucasus.\n3d, The Teret, a mountain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TORRENT\">torrent</a>, nearly dry in summer.\n4th, The Akharaan.\n5th, The Sulach, both rivers only abundant in the spring, and nearly dry in summer.\n6th, The Kur, a stream formed by a union of several others in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMENIA\">Armenia</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEORGIA\">Georgia</a>, and navigable from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEFLIS\">Teflis</a>.\n7th, The Ural, rising in the Uralian range of mountains, and forming a course of nearly 1400 miles, during which it receives the waters of six large, and numerous smaller rivers.\n8th, The Jemba, a river coming from the north, and running about 450 miles.\n\nThe lakes in Russian Asia are very numerous, and some of them very extensive. One of the largest is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAIKAL\">Baikal</a> in Siberia, between latitude 52\u00b0 and 55\u00b0, and longitude 104\u00b0 26', and 109\u00b0 56', extending over 11,180 square miles. Its water is clear and bright, the depth varies from 18 to 480 feet. It is covered with ice from the middle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> till April. The river <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGARA\">Angara</a>, which runs to the Jenisy, issues from it. It receives the waters of several streams which come either from the Chinese territory or its vicinity. The lakes next in extent are the Tchani and the Piasenskoe, both in the government of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TOMSK\">Tomsk</a>. Almost every province has one or more lakes, several of which are of salt water, on whose banks a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CRYSTALLIZATION\">crystallization</a> prepares culinary salt for the use of the inhabitants.\n\nThe agriculture necessarily varies both in its practices and its productions in countries so extensive as those we are sketching. By an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARVEST\">harvest</a> table before us, it appears that the winter corn (wheat and rye) does not yield, on an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a>, more than three and a half for one grain that is sowed; and the summer corn (barley and oats) not much more than two and a half for one. The increase of production seems to be about as progressive as the increase of population. By a return of the whole produce of the harvest of 1808, it appears that the whole quantity raised was 43,424,966 tschewerts on 29,854,622 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>; from which, if two-sevenths be allowed for seed, there will remain for subsistence 21,324,760 quarters. Taking the whole population at 10,164,000, and allowing for 1,164,000 who eat no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>, there will have been about 18 bushels of corn for each individual. In many parts the goats and sheep, and in some the oxen, furnish food for the inhabitants; whilst aid for the subsistence of others is afforded from the fish of the seas, lakes, and rivers.\n\nThe mines of Russian Asia are by far more productive than those of any other portion of the empire; as from them is extracted the whole of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>, silver, and lead, nine-tenths of the copper, and eleven-twelfths of the iron which is brought into use. By the latest returns the whole produce was as follows:\n\n| Product     | Quantity       |\n|-------------|---------------|\n| Gold        | 17,940 ounces |\n| Silver      | 540,000 ounces|\n| Copper      | 3,360 tons    |\n| Lead        | 900 tons      |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">Bar</a>-iron    | 1,680,000 tons|\n| Vitriol     | 5,184 tons    |\n| Rock Salt   | 14,675 quintals|\n\nAccording to the work from which these statements are taken,\u2020 the culinary salt, annually prepared in Asiatic Russia, is 830,000 quintals.\n\nThe fishery is a considerable branch of industry, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FISHERIES\">Fisheries</a>, and furnishes articles for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPORTATION\">exportation</a>. The crown &c. lets to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARM\">farm</a> its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISHING\">fishing</a> on the Caspian Sea to some companies in Astrachan. The produce consists chiefly of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> and the roe of the sturgeon, and of the skins of seals. In 1815 there were employed 1847 boats, and 6688 men in this fishing. The Wolga and some other rivers yield prodigious quantities of excellent fish. The whole value of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> is estimated at 8,000,000 silver roubles, or more than L 1,500,000 Sterling. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHASE\">chase</a> is a business of much importance, both on account of the food which it supplies for subsistence, of the peltry which furnishes for winter garments, as well as articles for an export trade. The productions of the forests not only supply the article of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a> which the severe climate requires, but furnish large quantities both for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> and firing to other nations. Most of the forests belong to the crown: those of Asia, exclusive of Siberia, are calculated to cover 43,500,000 desjatines, or nearly 100,000,000 English statute acres.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a> are very few, and very homely. The best article produced is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a>. Some linen Commerce and silk goods, and for various kinds of hardware and glass. The breweries, but especially the distilleries, are more numerous than any other manufacturing objects. Making corn spirits is a royal monopoly, but in some of the Asiatic cities it is let to farm by the government. The chief commerce is internal between the several provinces whose productions are most different from each other. There is an increasing transit trade between China, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>, and Europe, and custom-houses are established on the frontiers, at which the tolls are collected. We have no statements of the extent of this trade that are sufficiently accurate to create much confidence. The value of the goods, which in 1809 were manifested in the governments of Irtusk and Kiachta, on the Chinese\n\n* It appears from a recent intelligent work (Tooke On <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">High</a> and Low Prices, Part II.), that the exportation of copper from Russia, which before 1818 was trifling, in that year amounted to 155 tons; in 1819 1419; in 1820 4466; in 1821 5023; and in 1822 3545 tons.\n\n\u2020 Die Wichtigkeit des Russischen Bergbaus, von Herman.\nfrontier, was 5,049,138 silver roubles, or about L.840,000 Sterling, including both exports and imports.\n\nThe names and divisions, both military and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a>, of Russian Asia, are at present the following:\n\n**Kingdom of Casan.**\n\n| Governments | Extent | Population | Capitals |\n|-------------|--------|------------|----------|\n| Casan       | 22,272 | 1,138,804  | Casan    |\n| Wiatka      | 47,381 | 1,265,900  | Wiatka   |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERM\">Perm</a>        | 127,017| 1,232,474  | Perm     |\n| Simbirsk    | 29,910 | 1,095,145  | Simbirsk |\n| Pensa       | 16,597 | 1,044,824  | Pensa    |\n\nThe city of Casan, about five miles from the Wolga, in north latitude 55\u00b0 47' 51\", and east longitude 49\u00b0 26' 41\", is an increasing place, with 25,000 inhabitants. In it the governor and Archbishop have palaces, and there are some few other good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> buildings. A very wide-spreading conflagration destroyed many hundred houses in 1815, and the new buildings since erected on their site have much improved the appearance of the city, which is now half European and half Asiatic. The city of Wiatka, in latitude 58\u00b0 24', and longitude 50\u00b0 48', contains 12,000 inhabitants, employed in the trades of corn, tallow, and hemp, and in the manufacture of leather, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOAP\">soap</a>, and some hardware. Most of its productions are conveyed by the Dwina to Archangel. Stobosk, in latitude 58\u00b0 50', and longitude 50\u00b0 20', has 6000 inhabitants, occupied as those of Wiatka. Perm, in latitude 58\u00b0 1' 13\", erected into a city in 1790, is built almost wholly of wood, and contains 6000 inhabitants, employed chiefly in trade arising from the copper mines. Soltikumsk, in latitude 59\u00b0 39', and longitude 56\u00b0 50', supports about 6000 people, chiefly by copper, tin, and gold manufactures. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IRBIT\">Irbit</a>, in latitude 57\u00b0 35', and longitude 65\u00b0 26', contains 3600 inhabitants, who depend mainly on the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-FAIRS\">fairs</a> which are held there, in which the productions of Europe and Asia are exchanged for each other. The sales in the fair have amounted to 6,287,000 roubles; of which 800,000 consisted of cloth, 1,400,000 of Chinese goods, 850,000 of peltary, 9000 of spices, 350,000 of sugar, and 350,000 of linen. Jekaterinburg, in latitude 56\u00b0 50' 15\", and longitude 60\u00b0 56', contains 6000 inhabitants, who subsist on trades dependant on the mines, and arising also from its being on the high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> to Siberia. Simbirsk, in latitude 54\u00b0 24', and longitude 49\u00b0 55', contains 15,000 persons, who find subsistence from several manufactures, from the fishery, and carrying trades on the Wolga, and from the corn, tallow, and hemp of the surrounding districts. Samara, in latitude 53\u00b0 53', and longitude 49\u00b0 57', contains 3500 inhabitants, who are employed in the fishery on the Wolga, and export by it large quantities of fresh and salted fish, and of caviare, or the roes of the sturgeon. The city of Pensa, in latitude 53\u00b0 30', and longitude 45\u00b0 46', contains 1697 private dwellings, of which only three are built of stone, and 10,000 inhabitants. There is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHEDRAL\">cathedral</a>, five stone, and eight wooden churches, and several other public buildings. Its principal trade consists in leather, linen, soap, and corn; part of which is conveyed to the different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARKETS\">markets</a> by land carriage, and part is sent by the small river Sura to the Wolga. Saransk, in latitude 54\u00b0 23', and longitude 44\u00b0 41', contains 6200 inhabitants.\n\n**Kingdom of Astrachan.**\n\n| Governments | Extent in Square Miles | Population | Capitals |\n|-------------|-----------------------|------------|----------|\n| Saratow     | 91,563                | 1,305,170  | Saratow  |\n| Astrachan   | 83,178                | 200,000    | Astrachan|\n| Caucasus    | 33,813                | 180,000    | Georgiewsk|\n| Orenburg    | 120,021               | 1,044,000  | Orenburg |\n\nThe city of Saratow, in latitude 51\u00b0 31' 28\", and longitude 46\u00b0 6', contains 6500 inhabitants, whose chief dependence is on the produce of the fisheries on the Wolga, and the transit commerce between Eastern and Western Russia, carried on by means of that river. Molsk, in latitude 52\u00b0 4', and longitude 47\u00b0 37', on the right bank of the Wolga, has 5000 inhabitants; and trades on the river. Kusnezk, in latitude 53\u00b0 7', and longitude 46\u00b0 42', has about 5000 inhabitants. Astrachan, in latitude 46\u00b0 21' 12\", and longitude 48\u00b0 8' 17\", is situated at the spot where the Wolga begins to form that delta by which, in various branches, it enters the Caspian Sea. It contains several public edifices for government, and for the various religious forms of worship which its Christian, Mahomedan, and Hindoo inhabitants follow. There is a naval arsenal, a seminary for Greek priests, several inferior seminaries for the different classes of the people, and an imperial botanic garden. The inhabitants are about 30,000, who manufacture silks, cottons, leather, soap, linen, and some other articles. The fisheries are considerable, and in 1815 employed 1847 vessels, with 6688 men. The gardens and vineyards are important objects, and produce much fruit, and tolerable wine and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VINEGAR\">vinegar</a>; which are conveyed by the Wolga to the interior of European Russia. Georgiewsk, or St George's, a fortified city, in latitude 44\u00b0 4', and longitude 42\u00b0 47'; contains about 3000 inhabitants, some few of whom are citizens or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a>, but the greater part are Cossacks. Mosdok on the Terek, in latitude 48\u00b0 43' 46\", and longitude 27\u00b0 52' 51\", contains 4000 people, who trade by that river with the Caspian Sea. Kislan Cowar, on the same river, in latitude 48\u00b0 51' 15\", and longitude 46\u00b0 20', is a rapidly rising place, chiefly from the industry of the Armenians, with 10,000 inhabitants. The city of Orenburg is situated on the river Ural, in latitude 51\u00b0 46' 5\", and longitude 55\u00b0 10' 17\", and is the head quarters of the military power, and the seat of the provincial government; it is fortified, the streets paved, and has a good market-place in its centre. It contained in 1820 about 2900 houses, and rather more than 20,000 inhabitants. There are manufactures of cloth, linen, soap, and leather. The chief support of the population is derived from commerce. About half a mile from the city stands the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a>, a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of square building, containing 392 shops, in which the productions of Europe and Asia\nare exchanged. The building has two gates, by one of which the Europeans enter, and by the other the Asiatics. The sales effected in this place amount to upwards of 1,000,000 roubles annually. The country round it is a complete waste. Ufa, in latitude $54^\\circ 42' 45''$, and longitude $55^\\circ 59' 17''$, has a population of 6000 inhabitants, of whom one-half are Tartars, who carry on considerable trade, and are employed in agriculture and breeding cattle. Troizk, in latitude $54^\\circ 10'$, and longitude $55^\\circ 10' 17''$, is next to Orenburg, the most considerable trading place, and has like it an exchange, in which are 300 shops.\n\n**Kingdom of Siberia.**\n\n| Government | Extent in Square Miles | Population | Capitals |\n|------------|------------------------|------------|----------|\n| Tobolsk    | 532,501                | 887,186    | Tobolsk  |\n| Tomsk      | 1,289,056              | 500,000    | Tomsk    |\n| Irkwzk     | 2,655,660              | 575,000    | Irkwzk   |\n\nIn this statement of the population, the numbers of the wandering tribes, who are very numerous, and some very small, is necessarily an estimate, and not the result of that census which has been taken of the settled inhabitants. The extent of land is thus near 1900 acres to each individual of the population. Each of the governments is divided into circles, in which the capital is denominated a city, though the number of its inhabitants, in many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, scarcely equal those of the villages in more civilized countries.\n\nThe city of Tobolsk, in latitude $58^\\circ 12' 30''$, and longitude $68^\\circ 31'$, was founded, in 1587, at the junction of the rivers Tobolsk and Irtish; and contained, in 1820, 25,000 inhabitants, who are employed in the trade for domestic consumption, as well as in the transit trade between China and Europe. Since a great fire in 1784, which destroyed most of the houses, then built of wood, the buildings have been constructed of stone, and on much better plans than formerly. Tomsk, in latitude $56^\\circ 29' 39''$, and longitude $85^\\circ 36' 23''$, is situated on the navigable river of the same name, at its junction with the Uschaika, on the great road to China. It has few manufactures, but depends principally on transit trade, and on some great fairs, where much business is transacted. Kainsk, in latitude $55^\\circ 33'$, and longitude $78^\\circ 40'$, has 3500 inhabitants, and is the place of a great annual fair. Barnaul, in latitude $53^\\circ 20'$, and longitude $83^\\circ 32' 32''$, has 6000 inhabitants, who chiefly derive their subsistence from the mines in the surrounding district. Koryakow, on the Irtish, has 3500 inhabitants, chiefly employed in mining. Kusnezek contains 3400, and Krasnojarsk 3500 inhabitants, employed in mining, and in the transit trade with China. Irkuzk is the seat of the governor of the province, in latitude $52^\\circ 16' 41''$, and longitude $104^\\circ 39' 17''$. It contains 30,000 inhabitants, many of whom are Tartars or Chinese, and others, in their dress and manners, approach nearly to those people. It is the chief seat of the trade with China, and for that of furs, which are brought from the north-east coasts of Asia, and the north-west shores of America. Okhozk, in latitude $59^\\circ 20' 10''$, and longitude $143^\\circ 18' 17''$, is the easternmost city of the Russian dominion. It is the chief seat of the American <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">Company</a>, and there are many vessels built here for their trade. The inhabitants are between 2000 and 3000, mostly military men, agents of the company, or ship carpenters. The fishery is productive; but the attempts to grow corn have been hitherto unsuccessful. The other places, though many of them are denominated cities, are of small population. In the circle of Kamtschatka, one of the divisions of the government of Irkuzk, there are two places denominated cities, Mishnil and Werchnoi; the former only with 300, and the latter with 200 inhabitants.\n\n**<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">Islands</a> in the Polar and Eastern Oceans.**\n\nIn the Polar Ocean are the groups of New Siberia and of the Bear's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">Island</a>. The first consists of four large and many smaller islands. They are covered with snow the greater part of the year; their surface is generally rocky, and on some of them are marks of volcanoes. They are chiefly remarkable for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a> of the mammoth, rhinoceros, buffalo, and other animals, which are found upon and beneath the surface of the ground. The search for this ivory first induced the Russians to visit these islands; and an expedition for exploring them was equipped in 1820, which had not returned when the last dispatches to the government were forwarded. These islands do not appear to be inhabited, though marks of human beings have been discovered by the Russians engaged in the fisheries. The Bear's Island <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUP\">group</a> consists of six small islands, with several kinds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHRUBS\">shrubs</a> on them, but no trees; although their shores are found to be covered with large drift wood. The southernmost point of these islands is in latitude $69^\\circ 5'$, and they extend to latitude $76^\\circ 20'$. Their longitude is between $154^\\circ$ and $183^\\circ 50'$ east.\n\nIn the Eastern Ocean the islands are thus classed:\n\n1st, The islands of Gevosbewy and Nelken, in Behring's Straits, in latitude $65^\\circ 4'$, with about 400 people.\n\n2d, St Lawrence, latitude $63^\\circ 40'$, and longitude $190^\\circ 26'$, and three smaller islands on the south-east of it.\n\n3d, St Mathew's, in latitude $60^\\circ$, in the sea of Kamtschatka, consisting of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-THREE_ISLANDS\">three islands</a>, one of which was named by some early British navigators <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PINNACLE\">Pinnacle</a> Island.\n\n4th, The Prebelow Islands, in latitude $57^\\circ$. Two of them have been named St Paul and St George. The former is about 28 miles long, and 20 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, and both are well stocked with animals whose furs are valuable.\n\n5th, The Aleutian Islands. This is a chain of islands extending from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENINSULA\">peninsula</a> of Kamtschatka to the American peninsula of Alaschka, between $51^\\circ$ and $55^\\circ 10'$ north latitude, and $167^\\circ$ and $197^\\circ$ east longitude. (See Aleutian Islands in this Supplement.)\n\n6th, The Kurile Islands. This chain extends from north latitude $43^\\circ 48'$ to $50^\\circ 56'$, and from longitude $145^\\circ 5'$ to $156^\\circ 30'$ east. They are evidently of vol-\ncanic origin. In some of them good water is found, but others are utterly destitute of it. The few inhabitants are of Japanese origin. Many of these islands have hitherto obtained no European names; but nineteen of the most considerable have been named by the Russians.\n\nProvinces of Caucasus.\n\n| Government | Extent in Square Miles | Population | Capitals |\n|------------|------------------------|------------|----------|\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol0.html#article-GRUSIA\">Grusia</a>     | 26,645                 | 600,000    | Teflis   |\n| Awchasa    | 5,077                  | 56,000     | Anakria  |\n| Tscherkessia | 32,547               | 800,000    | Waldikawkas |\n| Daghestan  | 9,249                  | 184,000    | Derbent  |\n| Schirwan  | 9,493                  | 120,000    | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAKU\">Baku</a>     |\n\nThus it appears there is one human being to 645 acres of land.\n\nGrusia is recently so denominated by the Russians from the river of that name, but is better known by the Asiatic name Curdistan, or the European name Georgia. It is subdivided into the provinces of Imeretus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINGRELIA\">Mingrelia</a>, and Guria, and further divided into circles, or districts. The greater part of these provinces were wrested from Persia in the war which terminated in 1813; or the authority over the native princes was acquired at different periods. From having been long the seat of bloody and wasting hostilities, the country has become almost depopulated; but, under a settled government, such as it has now acquired, as much of the land is fertile, it has rapidly increased in population and cultivation, and many of the wandering tribes are gradually becoming <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a>. The city of Teflis, in latitude 41\u00b0 28' 30\", and longitude 44\u00b0 23', is the capital, containing 18,000 inhabitants, besides the Russian garrison. It is a place of considerable commerce with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TURKEY\">Turkey</a>, and with Persia, and by the navigable river Kur, is connected with the Caspian Sea. Anakaria, though called a city by the Russians, is rather a military <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POST\">post</a> than a civil or trading place. Waldikawkus is also a military station, considered as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KEY\">key</a> to the Caucasian provinces, and rapidly increasing. Derbent, in latitude 42\u00b0 5' 45\", and longitude 47\u00b0 45', on the Caspian Sea, contains a population of 4000 persons, mostly Mahomedans, who are employed in manufactures of cotton, silk, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CARPETS\">carpets</a>, and leather. The vineyards around the city produce excellent wine. Taxki, the capital of one of the ancient princes, or khans, in latitude 42\u00b0 59', and longitude 46\u00b0 58', contains 10,000 inhabitants, employed in making silk goods, and in agriculture. Baku is a Russian fortress of the first class. In it is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> built by Shah Abbas.

On the western side it has the wild appearance of the adjoining principality of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a>. Throughout the rest of the county the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> is rather undulating, tolerably wooded, and with many beautiful rivulets meandering along the different valleys. The whole tract of country, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-WELLINGTON\">Wellington</a> to the termination of the county between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OSWESTRY\">Oswestry</a> and Chirk, exhibits the mild beauties of a fertile and cultivated district, inclosed by well formed hedges into fields, of dimensions well calculated for advantageous husbandry; and ornamented with several domains of noblemen and gentlemen, which present a most pleasing succession of pictures to the traveller.\n\nThat singular insulated mountain, the Wrekin, rising from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> to the height of 1100 feet, exhibits its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>-loaf form over the tops of the smaller elevations in its vicinity, and increases the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> of the scenery.

On the eastern side, the valleys are flat and warm, and the soil generally of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>. In the middle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a>, the soil is more tenacious, and the bottoms of the wider valleys have frequently a stiff but rich clay. On the most western parts, the soil is very shallow, resting upon rocks of varied descriptions; and is better calculated for sheep pasture than for producing grain. There are some moor lands, but inclosures and drainage have considerably diminished their extent. A very great portion of the soil rests on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">limestone</a> subsoil; and almost the whole of the plains are easy to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> ploughs, and two or three horses. The easterly winds generally prevail in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>, and the westerly in autumn; the former are more remarkable for their regularity than the latter. The whole of the county enjoys a salubrious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>; but on the hills, on the western side, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> of winter is most intensely felt.\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> river is the Severn, which runs through the whole extent of the county from north-west to south-east. It is navigable at all seasons to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRISTOL_CHANNEL\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol4.html#article-BRISTOL\">Bristol</a> Channel downwards, and in wet seasons upwards to Welshpool, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTGOMERYSHIRE\">Montgomeryshire</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a> is, however, at all times, impeded by many obstructions. In dry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, the fords are only passable with difficulty, and in very wet weather the floods cover the banks, and extend so far over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> land on both sides, that the barges cannot be drawn up, from wanting a path on which the men who draw them can securely walk. It is one of the singularities of this navigation, that men are employed instead of horses, as on other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>, to draw the vessels against the stream. Imperfect as this navigation is, it is, however, the chief source of the wealth of the country, as affording the means of conveying to good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARKETS\">markets</a> the various heavy productions which it yields. The fish found in the Severn, in its course through Shropshire, are salmon, pike, flounders, grayling, and eels. There are also some lampreys in the Shropshire part of the Severn, but they are less abundant than in the lower parts of the river.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> tributary rivers are the Camlet, the Vyrnwy, the Tern, the Clun, the Ony, and the Teme. There are, besides, innumerable rivulets and streams, which adorn and fertilize the country. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a> of Shropshire, though neither numerous nor extensive, form a variety in its landscapes rarely to be seen in the midland counties of England. Adjoining the town of Ellesmere is a beautiful lake of 116 acres, with some others smaller near it. On the western side of the county is Marton Pool, of 45 acres. On the north of the Severn are Fennymere, Llynclyspool, and Ancot; and at Shrawardine is a fine lake of 40 acres. That side of the county which most abounds in running streams has few or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> lakes. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CANALS\">canals</a> of this county, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> not equal in extent to those in some others, yield to none in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a>, or the obstacles they have surmounted, or in the beneficial consequences by which they have been followed. The first canal was a private undertaking by a Mr Reynolds, completed in 1788, for the conveyance of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> and coals. It was a short canal, but a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> of seventy-three feet was conducted by a well contrived <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-INCLINED_PLANE\">inclined <a cl</a>ass=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> railroad, by means of which the loaded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a> passing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> drew up another with a load, nearly equal to one-third of its own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>. This contrivance was found to be applicable to similar purposes, upon a larger scale, and was speedily adopted by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> who, under the power of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a>, soon constructed the Shropshire Canal, which passes through the most considerable iron and coal works, till it reaches the Severn. The Ellesmere Canal is a most important undertaking, as by it a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> is opened between the Severn and all the great canals and rivers in the north of England. Bristol and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIVERPOOL\">Liverpool</a> are thus become connected by inland navigation, and the rivers Severn, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEE\">Dee</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERSEY\">Mersey</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRENT\">Trent</a>, and Humber, are united for the purposes of conveyance. In districts where the inequalities of the surface would not admit of canals, iron <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RAILWAYS\">railways</a> have been constructed, on which heavy goods are conveyed, in appropriate waggons, with a great saving in the expense of carriage.\n\nThere are few counties in which the agricultural business is, on the whole, better conducted than Shropshire. The land is very well adapted for the turnip cultivation, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> flocks of sheep which are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> fed on that valuable root a great part of the year, supply abundance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANURE\">manure</a> for the due cultivation of the different kinds of grain. The most prevailing breed of sheep are the Southdown, but many of the New Leicesters are to be seen, and in the hilly parts of the county are many of the fine-woolled Welsh sheep. The meadows on the banks of the Severn, and on the flat lands contiguous to the smaller streams, afford pasture for numerous cows, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>, when converted into cheese, is commonly sold under the denomination of Cheshire. The corn generally cultivated is either wheat, barley, oats, or pease, and the crops, on an average, equal in productiveness those of the best districts of the kingdom. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-HOPS\">Hops</a> are grown in small quantities on that part of the county which adjoins to Herefordshire. Some small portions of land are appropriated to the growth of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEMP\">hemp</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAX\">flax</a>. The cultivation of potatoes has been very much extended of late years, and now furnishes a large proportion of the aliment of the labouring part of the population. The growth of hay, and the cultivation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> grasses, are more neglected than any other branch of rural economy. On the flat lands, the deposits from the overflowing of the streams sufficiently enriches them without any artificial manure; but from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-EMBANKMENTS\">embankments</a> being neglected, the hay produced on such situations is liable to be much injured by the floods that frequently occur in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>.\n\nA great portion of the wealth of this county consists in the mineral productions, which are most profusely found beneath its surface. The chief of these are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>, iron, limestone, freestone, pipe-clay, and coals. The lead is procured in considerable quantities chiefly from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> of the Hope and Snailbeach. The matrix of the ore is crystallized <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTZ\">quartz</a>, sulphate and carbonate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARYTES\">barytes</a>, and carbonate of lime. The iron ore is found contiguous to the coal, and frequently <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> to it. This is especially the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> about Colebrook Dale, a division peculiarly rich in those minerals. This district is about eight miles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> and two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, on the banks of the Severn, on the western side of the Wrekin, and running <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> with it, from north-east to south-west. The whole, but especially the southern part of the coal district, is considerably above the plain of Shropshire, so that at one part the height is 500 feet above the Severn. The works of the Dale supply both ore and coal, as well as limestone, in great quantities; and every part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a>, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGGING\">digging</a> the ore to the completion of the manufacture, including the conversion of the coal into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COKE\">coke</a>, is performed on the spot. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTHUR\">Arthur</a> Young, describing this part of the county, says, \"Colebrook Dale is a winding glen, between two immense hills, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> into various forms, being all thickly covered, and forming most beautiful sheets of hanging woods. The noise of the forges, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MILLS\">mills</a>, furnaces, &c., with all their vast machinery; the flames bursting from the furnaces, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> coal, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a> of the limekilns, are altogether horribly...\"\nsublime.\" A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> iron, the first, we believe, constructed in this kingdom, thrown over the Severn, gives to the whole scenery a most romantic appearance. Soon after it was ascertained that iron might be made with coals, reduced to the state of coke, as well as from wood, the operation of coking was begun here by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Dundonald, with a view to obtain the fossil tar in the course of the process. This operation led to the discovery of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAS\">gas</a>, extracted from coal, whose brilliant light now serves to illuminate so many of our streets and public buildings. In this dale was discovered, in opening a coal mine, a copious spring of fossil tar. It yielded, at first, very plenteously, but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> diminished in a few years, and though it still runs, its produce is but of small amount. Though the iron-works in this dale were the first begun, on a large scale, they are by no means confined to it; for in many other parts of the county, they are carried on to an extent that is unequalled in any other country but Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>.\n\nBesides the process of separating the iron from its ore, and bringing it into the state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a>-iron and pig-iron, the other steps in the application of that mineral to general purposes are made within this county. The larger kind of iron goods, whether cast or wrought, are prepared, and most of the iron bridges which have been erected in different parts of the kingdom have been formed here into such a state as only to require to be put together in the places where they were destined to be ultimately fixed. Some of the largest establishments for making <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PORCELAIN\">porcelain</a> have been formed here, especially that for iron-stone <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHINA\">china</a> in Colebrook Dale, which has lowered the price of that beautiful commodity so as to bring it within the reach of a greater number of consumers than could formerly afford it. Manufactures of a coarser kind of earthenware, and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOBACCO\">tobacco</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PIPES\">pipes</a>, are carried on at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROSELEY\">Broseley</a> and other places. The raw materials of which these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> are formed are almost all found near the spots where they are converted to those useful and profitable purposes. The manufacture of cotton has been recently introduced into this county, and establishments formed at Coleham and some other places, which rival the largest factories in the county of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANCASTER\">Lancaster</a>. Many branches of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> trade have been long, though not extensively, carried on in the northern part of the county. Some of the coarser kinds of woollens are made in different districts; but none of the establishments for their fabrication are upon an extensive scale. The trade in Welsh flannels centres in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> in Shrewsbury. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> of that town repair to the markets of Welshpool and Oswestry, and make their purchases of the small country weavers, who bring their goods in an unfinished state; and the pieces are rendered fit for the markets to which they are destined by the Shrewsbury traders. A coarser kind of woollens, called Welsh webs, are prepared in the same manner, and are exported to the West Indies for clothing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NEGROES\">negroes</a>.\n\nShrewsbury, the county town of Shropshire, from its vicinity to Wales, in which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> are few, and from its distance from any other large town, has ever been considered as a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCIAL\">provincial</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a>. It is situated on a circular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENINSULA\">peninsula</a>, of considerable elevation, formed by the curvatures of the Severn. It presents, at every approach, a pleasing variety of views; and the noble <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SWEEP\">sweep</a> of the river, which seems to embrace it, heightens at every turn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARM\">charm</a> of the scenery. The exterior ranges of houses command the rich and beautiful landscapes of the surrounding country. The stately spires of two venerable churches, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASSIVE\">massive</a> towers of the castle, give that imposing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a> to the whole which is commonly felt in contemplating the works of antiquity. The walks between the river and the town are finely shaded by an avenue of lofty trees, and furnish an agreeable promenade to the inhabitants. The interior of the town by no means corresponds with its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>. The streets are intricately dispersed, many of them steep and narrow, and all badly paved. They exhibit a strange <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTRAST\">contrast</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> buildings, and are as uncouth in their names as in their appearance. This town, as well as many other parts of the county, exhibits now many interesting remains of antiquity. Among these is the castle, placed on the narrow neck of land, by which the only entrance to the town can be gained without passing a bridge. The remains consist of the keep, a square building of 100 feet, connected with two towers; the walls of the inner <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">court</a>; and the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> of the interior gate. The keep is the most perfect of the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of building. The walls of this building are ten feet in thickness, and its beams of very large dimensions. It is stated to have been built by Roger de Montgomery, the Norman, as a feudal hold; but being forfeited to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> in the reign of Henry I., was used as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> fortress in subsequent periods, to check the incursions of the less civilized Welsh. The remains of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABBEY\">abbey</a>, erected by the same founder as the castle, rewards the lover of antiquities for the inspection of them. The most perfect of the remains of this edifice is an octagonal structure six feet in diameter, usually called the Stone Pulpit, standing upon a portion of the ruined wall. It is crowned by an obtuse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOME\">dome</a> of stone-work at about eight feet from the base, supported on six narrow pointed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a> rising on pillars. The ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">Church</a> of St Chad, which fell down in 1788, presents an interesting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUP\">group</a> of ruins. That of St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>, founded by Edgar, as well as St Alkmunds, founded by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> Eifleda, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of Offa, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">King</a> of Mercia, have received such alterations in more recent periods, that they exhibit the architectural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> of several successive ages. The charitable institutions of Shrewsbury, consisting of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOSPITALS\">hospitals</a>, infirmary, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a>, and other establishments, rather exceed the proportion to be found in other places of equal population, and do much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> to the liberality of the natives.\n\nOur limits do not admit of lengthened descriptions of the numerous remains of ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a> which are still existing in this county. The most remarkable are Haugmond Abbey, about four miles from Shrewsbury; the walls of Wroxeter, of British and Roman construction; the Abbey of Buildwas, founded in 1135 by Roger, Bishop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHESTER\">Chester</a>, for monks of the Cistercian order;\nthe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONASTERY\">Monastery</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WENLOCK\">Wenlock</a>, founded in 680, destroyed by the Danes, and afterwards re-established; the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAMP\">Camp</a> called the Walls at Quatford; the Castle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUDLOW\">Ludlow</a>, celebrated for its splendour in the reigns of Henry VIII. and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a>;\u2014during the latter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> the residence of the Sidneys, and in the reign of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> I. immortalized as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILTON\">Milton</a> composed some of his works; Wannington Castle, near Oswestry, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of strength before the Norman Conquest; Lilleshall Abbey, near Newport, with one of the most highly adorned Norman arches in the kingdom; and Boscobel House, with the oak in the grounds near it which served as a shelter to Charles II. when, after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> of Worcester, he was closely pursued by the victorious party.\n\nShropshire returns to Parliament two members for the county, and two each for the boroughs of Shrewsbury, Ludlow, Wenlock, Bridgenorth, and Bishop's Castle.\n\nThe titles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PEERS\">peers</a> derived from the county are\u2014<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARL\">Earl</a> of Shrewsbury, and Barons Hill and Forrester. As there are fewer titles derived from this county, so the seats of peers are much fewer than in any other of the same extent. The most remarkable residences of noblemen and gentlemen are the following: Walcot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HALL\">Hall</a>, Earl Powis; Hardwicke, Lord Hill; Ross Hall and Willey <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARK\">Park</a>, Lord Forrester; Apley Park, Thomas Whitmore, M.P.; Dudmaston, William Whitmore, M.P.; Pitchford, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONOURABLE\">Honourable</a> C.C.C. Jenkinson, M.P.; Hodnett, Reginald <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEBER\">Heber</a>, M.P.; Hawkstone, Sir Richard Hill, Bart., M.P.; Kinlet Hall, W.C. Childe, Esq., M.P.; Stanley Hall, Sir T. Tyrwhit Jones, Bart.; Altingham, Lord Berwick; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANOR\">Manor</a> House, Sir G. Jerningham, Bart.; Pradoe, Honourable Thomas Kenyon; Pentrepan Hall, Honourable F. West; Oriaton Hall, William Cludde, Esq.; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWNTON\">Downton</a> Castle, Richard Payne <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNIGHT\">Knight</a>, Esq.; Oakley Park, Honourable Robert Clive; Plowden Hall, Edward Plowden, Esq.; Audlim, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">Lady</a> Cotton.\n\nBy the census of 1821, the population of the towns was as follows: Shrewsbury, 21,695; Wenlock, 17,265; Wellington, 8390; Haies Owen, 8187; Ellesmere, 6056; Bridgenorth, 4845; Ludlow, 4820; Oswestry, 3910; Newport, 2343; Bishop's Castle, 1880.\n\nSee Plymley's Survey of Shropshire; Aikin's Tour; Telford's Account of the Inland Navigation of Shropshire; Antiquities of Shrewsbury, by the Rev. Hugh Owen; and Beauties of England and Wales.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAXONY\">SAXONY</a>. The kingdom of Saxony has been formed out of the principality of the same name. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUCHY\">duchy</a> from which the sovereign <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> arose was no part of the ancient duchy, but a Vandal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a>, which Albert, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MARGRAVE\">Margrave</a> of Saltzwedel, seized and transmitted as an inheritance to his son Bernard. This Bernard received the ducal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">Emperor</a> Frederick, usually distinguished by the name of Rothbar, or Redbeard; and his territories were spread out from the Weser to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHINE\">Rhine</a>, and from Westphalia to the borders of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOHEMIA\">Bohemia</a>. In these turbulent times power was necessary to preserve the dominion possessed by the petty sovereigns; and divisions arising between different branches of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, the other Saxon duchies were formed into independent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, leaving to the descendants of Bernard the sovereignty over the Margravate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEISSEN\">Meissen</a>, and that of Saxony in a contracted state; whilst the houses of Gotha, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WEIMAR\">Weimar</a>, of Coburg, and some others, inherited the whole of the western parts, which Albert had seized. Meissen and the remaining part of Saxony was then formed into one independent state, on which the electoral dignity was conferred by the Emperor Charles V. because of the adverse conduct of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTOR\">Elector</a> of the house of Weimar, the oldest branch of the family, in the wars which arose from the reformation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUTHER\">Luther</a>.\n\nFrom that period till the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> of the French Revolution, though its territories had been occupied, and its capital taken by Frederick of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUSSIA\">Prussia</a>, Saxony had experienced but little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a>. When France attacked Prussia in 1806, the Elector of Saxony took part with the latter power, but the reverse occasioned by the battle of Jena compelled him to join the conqueror. An <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> was formed between Buonaparte and the Elector, who, as the Empire of Germany was dissolved, and the electoral dignity annihilated, assumed, under the sanction of the Ruler of France, the rank and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of King. The newly created King maintained with good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> the alliance, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> had compelled him to form, till the overthrow of the French armies, in the decisive battle of Leipsic, occasioned in part by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFECTION\">defection</a> of his troops; on which event he was taken prisoner by the allied sovereigns in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, and his dominions placed under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEQUESTRATION\">sequestration</a>. When, at length, he was reinstated on his throne, nearly one-half of his subjects were forced to transfer their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALLEGIANCE\">allegiance</a> to the Prussian monarch, to whose kingdom was added the duchy of Saxony itself, comprising the most fertile part of his dominions.\n\nThe kingdom of Saxony, in its present state, is a vast, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a> and connected territory. It extends from Boundaries, 28\u00b0 5' to 31\u00b0 13' east <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a>, and from 50\u00b0 10' to 51\u00b0 31' north latitude. It is bounded on the north and north-east by Prussia; on the south-east and south by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUSTRIA\">Austria</a>; on the south-west by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAVARIA\">Bavaria</a>; on the west by the principality of Reus and the duchy of Saxe Gotha, and on the north-west by Prussia. Its square extent is about 7150 miles, or 4,625,000 English acres.\n\nIt is divided into five circles or provinces, and these are subdivided into Amts or Baliwichs.\n\n| Circles or Provinces | Number of Inhabitants | Extent in English Acres | Capitals |\n|----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|----------|\n| Meissen              | 297,945               | 1,006,080              | Dresden & Meissen |\n| Leipsic              | 216,355               | 743,080                | Leipsic   |\n| Erzgebirge           | 459,264               | 1,403,520              | Freiburg  |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-VOIGHTLAND\">Voightland</a>           | 88,639                | 440,320                | Planen    |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUSATIA\">Lusatia</a>              | 169,879               | 1,031,680              | Bautzen   |\n| **Total**            | **1,232,082**         | **4,624,680**          |          |\nThe inhabitants are divided into those who live in two large cities, 85,167 souls; in six cities, between 5000 and 15,000 souls, 51,319 souls; in thirty-four cities, between 2500 and 5000, 112,660 souls; in ninety-three towns, between 1000 and 2500, 130,428 souls; in towns of less than 1000, and in villages, 852,508 souls.\n\nThis state of the population is drawn from a census taken in 1817.\n\nThe northern part of the kingdom of Saxony is, for the most part, a level, or an undulating country; but on the south it is very mountainous. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> rise in three successive ridges, denominated the Vorgeberg, Mithelgeberg, and Hochgeberg; the southernmost of these, bordering on Bohemia, is the loftiest. The highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of these mountains are those of the Fichtelberg, 3730 feet; Auersberg, 2931 feet; the Lausche, 2400 feet; and Hochwald, 2299 feet.\n\nA part of this mountainous district, betwixt Dresden and Bohemia, usually denominated Saxon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWITZERLAND\">Switzerland</a>, has peculiar charms for the lovers of picturesque scenery. It is about 28 miles in length, and 23 in breadth, displaying deep chasms bordered by perpendicular rocks, some naked, and others clothed with every variety of trees. Rapid streams pour from declivities, forming cascades in some parts, and in others, in deep vales, meander through verdant meadows, without their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> or their egress being discoverable by the observer from the precipices which enclose such recesses, and from whence he can see no path by which the vales can be reached. Through this mass of mountains the river <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELBE\">Elbe</a> has worn itself a passage, by a most tortuous course, and washes the bases of rocks, in some parts of near one thousand feet perpendicular height, from whose summit that stream appears to the beholder as an insignificant rivulet. From the surface of this mountain plain rise the pinnacles of rocks, on which castles, in the feudal times, were erected, some of whose ruins add to the romantic grandeur of the prospect; whilst others, such as Koenigstein and Litherstein, have had applied to them all the arts of modern fortification, and are the most impregnable fortresses in the Saxon dominions. Koenigstein especially, though, from its great height, it appears to terminate in a point, has on its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APEX\">apex</a> strong walls, surrounding buildings in which the treasures of the crown are secured in times of danger, with ground to yield potatoes enough to feed the garrison, as that vegetable grows there to perfection; though, from being 1400 feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>, the rigid cold of winter is most severely felt. This fortress, and that of Lillienstein on the opposite side of the Elbe, are considered to be the keys to Bohemia. Few spots in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> create greater interest in the geologist, the botanist, or the lover of picturesque scenery, than this portion of the country so appropriately denominated Saxon Switzerland.\n\nThe principal river of Saxony, and that to which almost all the others contribute their streams, though not till it has left this kingdom, is the Elbe. It enters from Bohemia, and is navigable for barges through the whole of its Saxon course. The other rivers are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">Black</a> Elster, which rises in Lusatia, and soon enters the Prussian territory; the Spree, which comes out of Bohemia, divides itself into two branches near Bautzen, and then passes into Prussia. These rivers <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> into the Elbe on its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a>. On the left bank it receives the Moldau, which has two sources in Bohemia, and in Saxony unites with the Zwichau, and runs parallel to the Elbe till it joins that stream at Dessau. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">White</a> Elster rises in Voightland, with many curvatures, reaches the suburbs of the city of Leipsic, and, receiving there the small river Pleisse, falls into the Saale, and ultimately is lost in the Elbe, above <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGDEBURG\">Magdeburg</a>. The only river that does not run to the Elbe is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEISSE\">Neisse</a>, which rises in the eastern corner of the kingdom, and, passing into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SILESIA\">Silesia</a>, at length is emptied into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ODER\">Oder</a>. There are no lakes in Saxony, nor any canals, except such as are used in the mining districts for conveying the ore to the mills.\n\nAs compared with most parts of Germany, the Agriculture of Saxony is much advanced. Wherever the soil is capable of cultivation, it is worked with diligence; and the more hilly and poorer soils have a good herbage, and yield pasture to numerous flocks and herds. The sides of the mountains towards the Elbe, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PIRNA\">Pirna</a> to Meissen, are covered with vines which yield both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> and white wine; the former from the vicinity of Pilnitz and Loschwitz, and the latter from Hoflasnitz, are the most valued; but the great portion of the Saxon wine is of a very indifferent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>. The best of them are produced from the vineyards belonging to the king; and though they are sold at the highest prices, it is very doubtful if the expenses of cultivation, and the rent which might be obtained for the land, does not exceed what is produced by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a> of the wine.\n\nThe whole of Saxony is highly productive of fruit, and the care and skill exercised in its cultivation is amply rewarded. Great destruction to the fruit trees took place during the tremendous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> conflicts of which the country was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEATRE\">theatre</a>; but still the orchards and gardens are very extensive, and new trees, planted since the wasting warfare of 1813, are beginning to yield their products. The calamities which were injurious to the fruit trees have lessened the number of cattle of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>; in the year 1817, in many districts of the circle of Meissen, not a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of cattle was to be found. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEE\">bee</a>-hives were destroyed by the same events; and it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> yet require some years before Saxony can, as in past periods, supply the neighbouring countries with meat, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HIDES\">hides</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a>, and wax. The sheep were better preserved than the other kinds of animals, being mostly driven to the mountainous districts. These have increased, and great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> having been paid to breeding them so as to produce the finest wools, they have succeeded to such an extent, that their fleeces are now superior to those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, and furnish the chief agricultural article which is exported.\n\nThe arable land is chiefly cultivated on a three course system, consisting of a fallow, winter sown grain, and spring sown grain. In some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> there is a fallow crop of flax, hemp, or potatoes. The\nwinter corn that succeeds is generally rye, and sometimes, though less extensively, wheat; the summer corn which follows is chiefly oats and sometimes barley. The greater part of the arable land is in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> fields, held under a feudal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TENURE\">tenure</a>, over which the lord of the manor has the right of depasturing his flocks between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARVEST\">harvest</a> and the next seed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>. The farming occupations are generally very small, and the increase of grain through the whole kingdom is said not to average more than five for one. The culture of potatoes has been very much extended of late years, and forms almost exclusively the food of the labouring classes in the mountainous districts. Tobacco, hemp, flax, wood, hops, and chicory, are grown in some parts of the kingdom, but neither of them to the extent which the consumption of the country requires. The woods of the kingdom, since the separation of its best portions, are insufficient to furnish the inhabitants with the necessary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a>; and though abundance of coal is found near Dresden, it is of so sulphureous a nature as to be deemed unwholesome, and is used only by those who are unable to pay the high price for wood which its scarcity has created.\n\nSaxony abounds in minerals, and though the veins, in general, are far from being of great thickness, the ore is tolerably rich; which, added to superior skill and economy in working the mines, and separating the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a>, makes them very beneficial to the crown, to whom the greater portion of them belong. The mineralogical school of Freyberg has had a wonderful influence, not only in Saxony, but in all parts of the world, in increasing the knowledge and improving the practice of the operative labourers in the mining art. The annual produce of the silver mines is about 400,000 ounces; besides this, they yield <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>, lead, tin, iron, sulphur, quicksilver, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BISMUTH\">bismuth</a>, arsenic, and coal. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">Gold</a> is found in very small quantities.\n\nIn no part of the continent has manufacturing industry been carried to so great an extent, or occupied so large a proportion of the population, as in Saxony. Before the separation from it of the most productive agricultural provinces, it was calculated that two-fifths of the inhabitants were employed in manufactures; but since that unfortunate event, it is estimated that three-fifths are occupied in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> and manufactures, and only two-fifths in agriculture. It is only by the extent of its manufactures that the country can be furnished with the means of paying for those articles of the first necessity, of which a sufficiency is not now produced within it. The provinces which supplied corn, fuel, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>, have been ceded to Prussia, and those articles must be paid for by the sales of the minerals and manufactures. During the continuance of Buonaparte's continental system, the Saxon manufacturers enjoyed a most extensive trade, and the encouragement thus obtained gave an impulse which directed the efforts and the capital of the country towards their perfection; but the division of labour was not carried to such an extent, nor was the application of machinery so generally adopted, as to enable them to withstand the competition with the British goods, which peace introduced into many of those markets which they had before almost exclusively supplied. It would include almost the whole catalogue of European manufactures to enumerate all the respective kinds of goods made in Saxony. Woollens, linens, cottons, and silks for clothing; iron, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a>, and copper wares; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a>, earthenware, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-HATS\">hats</a>, musical instruments, and turnery-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARE\">ware</a>; various chemical and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DYEING\">dyeing</a> preparations; clocks, watches, swords, guns, and pistols, are all comprehended in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of Saxony manufactures.\n\nThe commerce of a country, whose inhabitants are chiefly occupied in manufactures, and produce an insufficiency of food for their own consumption, must be extensive. The trade of Saxony chiefly centres in the city of Leipsic, from whence, at the time of the two annual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-FAIRS\">fairs</a>, the greater part of the manufactures are disposed of, and contracts are made for such foreign commodities as the supply of the country demands. As the fairs of Frankfort on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAINE\">Maine</a> precede, and those of Frankfort on the Oder follow, the fairs of Leipsic, some portion of the trade is carried on by those channels. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a> leading to Leipsic are generally good, and trains of waggons, loaded with goods, are to be seen proceeding to and from that place at all times; many of which come from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLANDERS\">Flanders</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAMBURG\">Hamburg</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRUNSWICK\">Brunswick</a>, on one side, and from Russia, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLAND\">Poland</a>, and even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TURKEY\">Turkey</a>, on the other. At the fairs of Leipsic, the new books printed in most parts of Germany are brought for publication. There the publishers meet and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a> the works of one part of the country, where the German <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> is spoken, with those of another. So extensive is this trade, that it is said the commissions on it to the brokers and merchants of Leipsic amount to more than 40,000 rix-dollars a year. The whole sales at the fairs in that city are estimated, including exports and imports, at about 20,000,000 rix-dollars, or more than L.3,000,000 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">Sterling</a>. Saxony disposes, in this way, of sheep's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a>, fine woollen goods, linen and thread <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LACE\">lace</a>, yarn and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-WORSTED\">worsted</a>, ironmongery, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTLERY\">cutlery</a> and braziers, and books. It receives in return, corn, wine, salt, wood, and colonial wares. Although the river Elbe is navigable from the ocean to the interior of Saxony, it is only used for the conveyance of the heaviest goods, and for them but partially. It is found that the tolls on that river, with the risk of damage and of robbery, make it more advantageous to convey commodities by land than by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONARCHY\">monarchy</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> in the Ernestine, or Saxe Weimar branch of the family. The monarchy may be called limited; but the limitations are of such a nature that the liberties of the people have been more secured by the mildness of the reigning family than by any restrictions that the states have or could <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a>. The king enjoys the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-EXECUTIVE_POWER\">executive power</a>, confirms pardons, bestows commissions, nominates the supreme judges, and enjoys the power of making peace and war, and of concluding all treaties. In making new laws, and in imposing new taxes, the states have the right to be consulted. According to the ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>, which is still adhered to, the states are constituted of various ele-\nments; and, in fact, are an amalgama of various corporations, each of which thinks only of its own peculiar interests, and contrives to cast the weight of all public burdens from the cities and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBLES\">nobles</a>, who are represented, to the country people who have no voices. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a> consists, 1st, Of members chosen by the provincial representatives of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a>; 2dly, Of the representatives of the prelates, who, before the Reformation, had seats; but who have since been chosen by the higher class of nobles in right of their possessing certain estates of which the prelates were deprived; and, 3dly, The university of Leipsic. These states represent only the circles of Meissen, Leipsic, Erzgebirge, and Voigtsland; for that of Lusatia has its own peculiar assembly of states, which differs but little from those of the other four, except that the members from the land possessors must have at least sixteen quarterings in their coats of arms. When the king pleases these states are convoked; but, as it has not been found necessary to impose new taxes, or to make great alterations in the laws, they have seldom been assembled, and their session has usually been very short. The administration is conducted by a Cabinet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNCIL\">Council</a>, under which, through the medium of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-PRIVY_COUNCIL\">privy council</a>, orders are communicated to the departments of Finance, War, Domains, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-POLICE\">Police</a>, and Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe revenue at present amounts to about \u00a31,250,000 Sterling annually. This revenue is derived in a great degree from royal domains, possessed by the government by ancient grants from the imperial court, or obtained by having been mortgaged and foreclosed for non-payment, or purchased by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a> of the present monarch. The royalties belonging to the crown furnish also a considerable share of this revenue; they consist of the mines, the forests, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FISHERIES\">fisheries</a>, and of interest on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENT\">lent</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> taxes are on land, on trades, various <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXCISE\">excise</a> duties, stamp taxes, and tolls on roads, rivers, and bridges; the greater part of which fall exclusively on those who have no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> in the states. The whole public debt, including the cash notes (Kassenbillets), which did amount to \u00a3550,000, but are now reduced to \u00a3450,000, and circulate as freely as cash, is somewhat less than \u00a34,000,000; the interest on which is regularly paid, and a portion of the principal is annually discharged. The credit of no government stands higher than that of Saxony, and nearly the whole debt is due to its own subjects.\n\nThe regular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> of Saxony at present is reduced to 10,000 men, including cavalry, infantry, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTILLERY\">artillery</a>. Since the year 1817, when the regulars were thus reduced, there has been a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGISTER\">register</a> kept of the single men between 18 and 31 years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, who form a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITIA\">militia</a>, and from among whom the troops of the line are chosen; from this conscription, however, the privileged orders are exempt. There are military <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ACADEMIES\">academies</a> in Dresden for instructing both the cadets of the line and those of the artillery.\n\nAlthough the royal family profess the Catholic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, and are zealous in discharging its injunctions, the established faith is the Lutheran, and, until the year 1811, no person of any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">sect</a> was eligible to seats in the several corporations in the provincial or general assembly of the states. At that period all sects were placed on the same footing. The whole number of Catholics is about 40,000, some of whom are attached to the royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSEHOLD\">household</a>; but most of them are found among the inhabitants of the province of Lusatia. The number of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROTESTANTS\">Protestants</a> dissenting from the established church, including Moravians and Calvinists, is not supposed to exceed two thousand. The Lutheran church is regulated by four Consistories or Assemblies of divines; differing in the number of superintendents, but comprising together twenty-four of that order. The Catholics in Lusatia are regulated by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABBOT\">Abbot</a> of Bautzen, on whom the Pope generally bestows the title of Bishop in partibus infidelium.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">Education</a> is well conducted in the university of Leipsic, and in the endowed classical schools of Meissen, Wurzen, and Grimma, as well as in several gymnasiaums. The popular education is not so well managed as in the other Protestant German states; and some recent efforts to improve the system have not been attended with good practical results. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-FINE_ARTS\">fine arts</a> have been cultivated with considerable success; and both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATUARY\">statuary</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a> receive valuable assistance from the fine productions of both which the collections of Dresden contain.\n\nSee Leonhardi Erdbeschreibung der Kurf\u00fcrstliche und Herzogliche S\u00e4chischen L\u00e4nder.

There are several statements to this effect, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">Evidence</a> annexed to the Report of the Select <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMITTEE\">Committee</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">House</a> of Lords relative to the Trade with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> and China, printed, by order of the House of Commons, in May 1821.\n\nThe establishment of a British settlement in Singapore is said to have excited some feelings of jealousy in the older one of Penang, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">Prince</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a>' Island; but the Evidence <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> referred to shows, that if such a feeling exists, it ought to be discouraged and disregarded; for it there appears that a settlement situate farther within the Archipelago than Penang was highly expedient, and that Singapore presented the most eligible situation for founding such a settlement as was wanted. The rapidity of its progress affords, of itself, sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> that the situation was well chosen. \"The rapid rise of this important station,\" says its intelligent founder, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> written in 1820, annexed to the above-mentioned Report, \"is, perhaps, without a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a>.

No less than 173 sail of vessels of different descriptions, principally native, arrived and sailed in the course of the first two months; and it already has become a commercial port of importance.\"\n\nThe latest accounts seem to contain additional proofs of the growing importance of this settlement.

The accumulated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of these mountains presents, towards the peninsula, the convex side of a spherical segment, which, like a shield with its boss to the south, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROUNDS\">rounds</a> its edges near the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, and rears the highest part of its curve on the Spanish territory, between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> Cinca and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARA\">Ara</a>. This eminence, called Mont Perdu by the French, is known, in Aragon, by the appellation of Tres Sorores, alluding to its three peaks, distinctly seen from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-ZARAGOZA\">Zaragoza</a>, of which the highest, according to the French naturalist, Ramond, who examined it in 1802, rises 4114 Spanish yards above the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>. The line of perpetual congelation is there at the height of 2924 yards. Till this measurement by Ramond, the peak of Canigu\u00e9, on the French confines of Catalonia, had been deemed the highest point of the Pyrenees. It is, however, only 3564 feet above the sea.\u2020\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINOR\">minor</a> branches which strike off from the Pyrenees in a south direction, without forming a part of the great secondary chains, which we shall presently describe, there are some mountains too remarkable to be left unnoticed. Such are, the Monsein, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of Catalonia, near the town of Arens, and the well known Monserrat, which rises, on the same coast, to the height of 1479 yards above the sea:\u2014such the Sierras of Ribagorza, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARBASTRO\">Barbastro</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUESCA\">Huesca</a>, and Jaca, which take their names from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> cities in their neighbourhood:\u2014such, finally, those numerous spurs of the great ridge which run into Navarre, whose various appellations would only tend to confuse the reader. The most remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>, among these hills, is the Higa de Monreal, probably so called from the fancied resemblance of its highest rock to a fig (Higo, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Higa). It stands about three leagues to the east of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PAMPLONA\">Pamplona</a>, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> which divides the waters of the rivers Arga and Aragon.\n\nOf the main ridges which run across the peninsula, that which rises to the west of the source of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EBRO\">Ebro</a> was called Idubeda by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, and formed the limits of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Celtiberia. In its course towards the Mediterranean, the natives, according to a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>, distinguish the various portions, or great links of the chain, by the appellation of Sierras, adding the name of some town or notable height in their vicinity. Such are the Sierra de Oca, of Urbi\u00f3n (the Distertiae of the middle ages), of Moncayo (Mons Caunus), of Molina, Albarracin, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUENCA\">Cuenca</a>. Part of this chain forms the limits of Aragon and Castille; it then penetrates into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VALENCIA\">Valencia</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURCIA\">Murcia</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANADA\">Granada</a>, and ends in the Capes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OROPESA\">Oropesa</a> (Tenebrium), Mart\u00edn, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PALOS\">Palos</a>,\u2021 and Gata. The small town of Alcol\u00e9a, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SORIA\">Soria</a>, stands on this chain at the height of 1486 yards above the sea. Its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> elevation, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> between Molina and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TERUEL\">Teruel</a>, in Aragon, is 1580 yards.\n\nIt is this chain, which Antillon calls the Iberian, that, by its direction from its origin to the heights of Moncayo, drives the Ebro to the east, and feeds the Duero towards the west. The Duero proceeds, however, to the south till it comes to Almaz\u00e1n, where the great ridge, forming an elbow to the south-west, forces the stream into its westerly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a>. Farther south, near the sources of the small rivers Xal\u00f3n and Taju\u00f1a, the Iberian ridge, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> the name of Sierra Ministra, divides the waters between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TAGUS\">Tagus</a> and the Ebro.\n\n* Elementos de la Geograf\u00eda Astron\u00f3mica, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">Natural</a> y Pol\u00edtica de Espa\u00f1a, por <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DON\">Don</a> Isidoro de Antillon. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MADRID\">Madrid</a>, 1808. This is a book of great merit. Its author, whose premature <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, while representing his native kingdom of Aragon in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> Cortes at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CADIZ\">Cadiz</a>, is lamented by his numerous friends, as well as by all who, knowing his worth and talents, can appreciate the loss which his country sustained by that event, spared himself <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> trouble in the collection of materials for this elementary book, which he wrote for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of his pupils at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">College</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBLES\">Nobles</a>, at Madrid. Besides the extensive local knowledge he had acquired in his travels through Spain, these Geographical Elements contain a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of information derived from the unpublished works of other scientific Spaniards. Such is the Ensayo de una descripci\u00f3n f\u00edsica de Espa\u00f1a, por Don Josef Cornide, printed in 1803, but which had not come into circulation in 1808. Antillon professes himself indebted to Cornide for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of the Spanish mountains, as we are to him for our geographical account of that country, and some valuable facts relating to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATISTICS\">statistics</a>.\n\n\u2020 The divisory line, between Spain and France, formed by the Pyrenees, extends from Cape Higuer, on the Atlantic near Fuenterribia, to Cape Cervera, north of Cape Creus, on the Mediterranean, through a space of 92 leagues.\n\n\u2021 Cape Palos derives its name from the sea lagoon (Palus) called Albufera, from which one of the French Marshals derived, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a>. It communicates with the sea by an opening, which is easily closed. The Albufera is valuable for the great quantities of fish, especially mullets and john-dories, that abound in it. The Cape itself was called Scobrarius, from the abundance of the fish Scombrus, a kind of mackerel, on that coast.\nThe first point where this great ridge splits into the minor chains which lose themselves in the Mediterranean, is to the north of Albarrac\u00edn, in Aragon. Of these branches the most remarkable is that which, entering the province of Valencia, is again subdivided into the smaller ridges which terminate at Pe\u00f1\u00edscola and Cape Oropesa. The waters that descend from these heights, to the north, mix finally with the Ebro, while the T\u00faria and the Mijares are swelled by those which flow from the southern declivities. On the branch stretching towards Pe\u00f1\u00edscola, and in the limits of Aragon, rises the Muela de Ares, a conical mountain, deprived of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APEX\">apex</a>; whose top is an extensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> covered with luxuriant pasture, and surrounded by fearful precipices, at the elevation of 1562 Spanish yards above the sea. This is one of the highest spots in the peninsula; the Tagus, the Xucar, and the Gabriel, take their rise among these mountains, and divide the waters which flow from their sides, between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. Numerous flocks of sheep, both itinerant and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a>, find, in the valleys formed by this chain, the most abundant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> pastures.\n\nFrom Albarrac\u00edn, this chain strikes into the territory of Cuenca in a direction nearly north and south. It then sends off a branch to the east-south-east, on which the Collado de la Plata, or Silver Hill, rises 1598 yards above the sea. It contains a quicksilver mine, which was worked a few years ago, at the distance of four leagues west of Teruel. From the neighbourhood of this town the Sierra de Espad\u00e1n runs, like an unbroken bulwark, to the sea near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MURVIEDRO\">Murviedro</a>, in a direction between south-east and north-west. The ruggedness of the hills, the terrific depth of the precipices, and the intricacy of the mountain passes, overhung with perpendicular rocks of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> marble, are described in glowing colours by the great Spanish botanist, Cavanilles, whose account of a scientific tour in these highlands of his native province, Valencia, is quoted by Antillon. The Pico, which is considered the most elevated point in these mountains, rises 1303 yards above the sea. Its latitude has been determined by accurate observations to be $39^\\circ 31' 38''$. Its longitude $3^\\circ 0' 36''$ east of the meridian of Madrid.\n\nNear the source of the Tagus, the Iberian ridge sends off another branch which, stretching in almost a southern direction, separates La Mancha from the province of Murcia, to the west of the town of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALBACETE\">Albacete</a>, and rises into the lofty mountains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALCARAZ\">Alcaraz</a> and Segura (the ancient Orospeda), dividing the waters between the Guadalquivir and the Segura, the two main streams which severally and finally convey them to the ocean and the Mediterranean. One of the two great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a> which terminate the Iberian ridge runs into the sea at the Cape Cerv\u00e9ra; the other, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENDING\">bending</a> to the south, skirts the kingdom of Granada, and disappears at the Cape Gata. To the latter belongs the mountain called Cabezo de Mar\u00eda, between Cartagena and Cape Gata, one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a> west of the town of Vera on the coast of Valencia. It rises 2287 yards above the sea, and has its summit covered with snow during one-half of the year.\n\nSmaller branches of this chain project between the T\u00faria and the Gabriel, which loses itself in the Xucar at Cofrentes. A ridge runs between the last mentioned river and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALCOY\">Alcoy</a>, another stream, which flows into the sea near Gandia. A minor chain separates the Alcoy and the mouth of the Segura. The province of Valencia is, in fact, divided by mountains into most fertile stripes, watered by numerous streams, and enjoying every blessing which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> grants to the most favoured climates. The mountains on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> of the Xucar, from Cofrentes to the sea, bear the two appellations of Cortes de Pall\u00e1s and Millares, each applying to a different portion of the ridge. To the left of the same river, the mountains are known by the names of Torres and Dos Aguas, which they change for that of Monte Caball\u00f3n when they penetrate into Valencia from the province of Cuenca. The rock on which the castle of Monserrate stands, near the sea-shore, five leagues west of the lake Albufera, may be considered as belonging to this ridge. The castle is 313 yards above the sea. From the mountains of Millares, to the right of the Xucar, another ramification projects between the provinces of Murcia and Valencia. Before reaching <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-VILLENA\">Villena</a> it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENDS\">bends</a> towards the sea, on the left of the Alcoy, where it is known by the name of Sierra de Mariola. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, purity, and copiousness of the streams, which are fed by these hills, render them the main source of wealth and comfort to the neighbouring country. The highest summit of this ridge is called Moncabr\u00e9r. Another arm stretches from Villena, in which we find the Sierra de Viar, the rock of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-XIXONA\">Xixona</a>, the mountain of Aytana, and the pyramidal mountain of Mongo, near the Capes San Antonio and Martin. The longer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> of snow on its top makes Cavanilles believe that it surpasses Moncabr\u00e9r in height, especially as the latter is at a greater distance from the sea. The southernmost part of the chain, which strikes off at Villena, sends out its waters to swell the stream of the Segura.\n\nBefore we proceed to the next main branch of the\n\n---\n\n* The insulated rocks which, rising above the ridges, terminate in a plain, are distinguished in Aragon and Valencia, where they abound, by the appellation of muelas (grinders).\n\n\u2020 The T\u00faria, though a considerable river during part of its course, is so drained by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CANALS\">canals</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IRRIGATION\">irrigation</a>, that it is reduced to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> stream when it enters the sea. Cavanilles gives a very interesting description of that river, the constant theme of the Valencian poets. The Spanish naturalist represents the T\u00faria, in its strength, as opening a way between the two ridges which decide the course of its waters, and presently engaging into such fearful chasms, that, near the village of Chulilla, it rushes through a channel 600 feet deep, and not more than 50 in breadth, winding, in intricate curves, over a bed harder than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> marble.\n\n\u2021 The masculine termination in o is sometimes used in Spanish as an augmentative. Mountain heads are generally called Cabezos, instead of Cabezas. One of the beauties of the Proven\u00e7al consisted in this power of varying the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENDER\">gender</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOUNS\">nouns</a> according to the colouring which the writer wished to give to his pictures.\n\nVide Sismondi Literature du Midi, Vol. I.\nSpanish mountains, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be proper to exhibit a general view of the Iberian chain, which we have hitherto pursued in detail. This would hardly be necessary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> we possessed more accurate maps of Spain than are to be found even in that country. In the absence, however, of a graphic representation, the course of the rivers will sufficiently indicate the great valley formed by this chain, and which might be named the valley of the Ebro. Its skirts may be traced by a line passing over the sources of the smaller streams to the south of the Ebro, first, as far as Albarrac\u00edn; then, in a direction nearly west and east, to the Cape Oropesa. This latter part of the chain bears the names of Sierras de Guadarrama and Pe\u00f1agolosa. All the rivers to the north of this ridge flow into the Ebro. From Albarrac\u00edn to Cape Gata the waters are sent off, by the other branch, to the Mediterranean from the east declivity; and from the western, to the Tagus, the Guadiana, and the Guadalquivir, which convey them to the ocean.\n\nA map of Spain must be imperfect indeed which does not mark the great ridge whose summits divide the waters between the Duero and the Tagus. It grows out of the Iberian chain, not far from the sources of the Xal\u00f3n and the Tajuna, to the south of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Soria, and the site of the ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMANTIA\">Numantia</a>. Where it divides the province of Guadalaxara from that of Soria, it is called Sierra de Par\u00e9des, and Altos de Barona. On one of the hills, north of Sig\u00fcenza, rises the Henares, which gives its name to the ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COMPLUTUM\">Complutum</a>, now the seat of a Spanish University. Near the source of the Lozoya, a rivulet which runs into the Xarasma, these mountains are called Somosierra, till, more to the west, they bear the name of Guadarrama; an appellation which they preserve throughout the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> course in which they skirt the provinces of Segovia, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-AVILA\">Avila</a>, Guadalaxara, and Madrid. The Puerto de Navacerrada, the highest point on the road from Madrid to the summer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> of San <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ILDEFONSO\">Ildefonso</a>, is 2204 yards above the sea. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> to the royal residence is excessively rapid, the difference of elevation between these two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> being 816 yards in the space of about three leagues.\n\nThe mountains of Guadarrama are a very striking object when seen from the neighbourhood of Madrid, on the road to Old Castile. They principally consist, according to Mr Townsend, of naked, fractured <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANITE\">granite</a> rocks, heaped up together, and adorned only towards their bases with single evergreen oaks, while the upper parts are bleak, dreary, and barren, presenting fantastic prominences, and in many places covered with perpetual snow.\n\nThis chain, in its course towards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PORTUGAL\">Portugal</a>, where it ends in the Rock of Lisbon, rises into some remarkable elevations. We shall notice that of Pe\u00f1alabra, between the sources of the Eresma and the Lozoya, 2834 yards above the sea; the Puerto del Pico, in the province of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALAMANCA\">Salamanca</a>; the Pe\u00f1a de Francia, and Sierra de Gata, on the northern limits of Spanish Extremadura. In Portugal, this chain takes the name of Sierra de Estelha (Mons Herminius), and terminates under the well known appellation of Cintra. The Sierra de Estelha runs between the Mondego and Cerece for a space of twelve leagues, where its summit expands into a plain three leagues in length, and one in breadth, containing three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>, fed by the snow which covers that elevated spot from October till <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a>. From one of these lakes the Mondego takes its source.\n\nOur limits compel us to omit Antillon's accurate and interesting description of the minor branches which run nearly north and south from the main ridge, which that writer conceives to end in Cape Finisterre. They may be traced from the opposite course of the rivers which flow either into the Duero and the Mi\u00f1o, or into the ocean, on the western coast of Galicia.\n\nAlmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to the mountains of Guadarrama, we find the ridge which divides the waters between the Tagus and the Guadiana. The rise of this branch out of the Iberian chain would hardly be perceptible, but for the separation of the waters, which begins in the vicinity of Huete, south of Cuenca. The gradual elevation of the ground from Tranc\u00f3n to Tembleque, in the province of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOLEDO\">Toledo</a>, raises the latter town 740 yards above the sea. Bolder hills appear at Madrilejos; and the town of Consuegra has an elevation of 769 yards. Proceeding a short distance to the south-west, the Sierra de Y\u00e9venes clearly shows the direction of the ridge, which is soon after known by the name of Gundalupi (Montes Carpetani); it then runs between Truxillo and M\u00e9rida, under the name of Sierra de Marchal, penetrates into Portugal by Castel de Vide and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PORTALEGRE\">Portalegre</a>, is seen to the west of Elvas and Estremoz, and descends to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANE\">Cane</a> Espich\u00e9l, having <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEJA\">Beja</a> and Set\u00fabal to the south, \u00c9vora and the mouth of the Tagus to the north.\n\nThe third great branch of the Iberian ridge is the Ridge of the Sierra Morena (Montes Marianii), which divides the Guadiana waters between the Guadiana and the Guadalquivir. It begins in the vicinity of Alcaraz, near the eastern limits of the province of La Mancha, issuing from that spur of the Iberian chain which terminates in Cape Palos, and, trending in a direction north-east and south-west, with La Mancha, Spanish Extremadura, to the north, and Ja\u00e9n, Cordoba, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEVILLE\">Seville</a>, and Algarve (Portugal), to the south, ends in the ocean at Cape St Vincent. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> named Puerto del\n\n---\n\n* The map which Antillon constructed for his work, though upon a very small scale, is the most accurate in existence; and we would strongly recommend it to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of those who devote their industry and talents to the important department of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">geography</a>.\n\n\u2020 The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of the waters occasioned by this ridge begins at these two rivers, the Xal\u00f3n flowing into the Ebro, the Tajuna, through the Xarasma, into the Tagus.\n\n\u2021 We have preferred the Spanish appellations of these rivers in a description of Spain. They, in fact, differ very little from the Portuguese names. Mi\u00f1o and Minho express the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a>, the Portuguese r being exactly similar to the Spanish \u00f1. Both are signs of the gn of the Italians.\nRey, where the road from Madrid to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANDALUSIA\">Andalusia</a> crosses these mountains, is 821 yards above the sea. Near Cordoba, where the bold skirts of the Montes Marianos are seen, within a short distance to the north, like a screen raised to protect the rich and extensive plains watered by the Guadalquivir, the ridge borrows the name of the neighbouring city. On the southern limits of Extremadura, and to the north of Seville, it is called Sierra de Guadalcana. The chain now bends to the south-west, forms the northern boundary of the Portuguese province of Algarve, and, through the Sierras of Caldeiraon and Monchique, connects itself with Cape St Vincent.\n\nThe brink of the last mountain plain towards the south of Spain is skirted by the ridge of Granada and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RONDA\">Ronda</a>; which, striking off at the extremity of the Iberian chain, is successively called Sierra de Gad\u00f3r, Sierra Nevada, Bermeja, and de Ronda; till it ends in various points of the coast, but most conspicuously in the Rock of Gibraltar.\n\nPart of Sierra Nevada rises above the highest Pyrenees. According to the geometric <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVELLING\">levelling</a> performed in 1804 by Don Ramon de Roxas Clemente, the Cumbre de Mulhac\u00e9n is 4254 yards above the sea; the Picacho de Vel\u00e9a 4153.* The line of perpetual congelation is found in these mountains at the height of 3305 yards.\n\nIn describing the principal chains of the Spanish mountains, we have already mentioned the five great streams which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> the intermediate plains, the Mi\u00f1o, the Ebro, the Duero, the Tagus, the Guadiana, and the Guadalquivir. We will now select a few particulars relating to each.\n\nThe Mi\u00f1o. The Mi\u00f1o, or Minho (Minius or Baenis), rises in Galicia, in the district of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LUGO\">Lugo</a>, from a beautiful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> called Fuente Mi\u00f1a. This river is navigable only to Salvatierra, two leagues above Tuy.\n\nThe Ebro. The Ebro rises near Reynosa, out of so copious a spring, that it works a corn-mill a few steps from its source. After a course of 110 leagues, it flows into the Mediterranean at Alf\u00e1ques. From the boundaries of Navarre to the sea, the Ebro makes a progress of 1\u00b0 12' 42\" towards the south. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> on this stream are Logro\u00f1o and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CALAHORRA\">Calahorra</a>, in the province of Rioja; Tudela, in Navarre; Zaragoza, in Aragon; and Tortosa, in Catalonia. It is a misfortune for Spain that this great river presents strong obstacles to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a>, both in its course and where it joins the sea. Of the plans which have been conceived, and partly executed, to obviate these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-IMPEDIMENTS\">impediments</a>, we shall presently have an occasion to speak.\n\nThe Duero. The Duero, or Douro, has its source to the north of the city of Osma, in a deep lake, at the summit of that portion of the neighbouring chain of mountains which has been mentioned by the name of Sierras de Urbi\u00f3n. Its course is at first towards the south, passing by Garay and Soria, where it turns to the west, continuing in that direction till it reaches Miranda. From this town to Moncorvo the river falls again into a south direction. It lastly takes a decided course to the ocean, where it ends near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPORTO\">Oporto</a>, having traversed a distance of 150 leagues. The Duero advances 10' to the south from Aranda to Tordejones; from hence to Miranda it inclines 40' to the north. Its mouth lies 33\u00b0 45' south of Miranda. This river is navigable up to the tower of Moncorvo, a space of thirty leagues. The navigation, which was formerly obstructed by rapids, has been expedited through the exertions of the Portuguese <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">Company</a> of Alto Douro. Some of the smaller streams flowing into the Duero, rise at remarkable heights. The Adaja, which descends from the northern slope of the great chain between the Duero and the Tagus, is, at Avila, 1271 yards above the sea; the Eresma, when it flows by the castle of Segovia, is 1107 yards above the same level.\n\nWe have mentioned that elevated part of the chain between the Tagus and the Guadiana, which takes the name of Albaracin, and the truncated mountain called Mu\u00e9la de San Juan. An inconsiderable spring, denominated Pi\u00e9 Izquierdo, is the source of the majestic Tagus. In its course through the province of Cuenca it is considerably augmented by the contributions of several streams. Before its waters reach <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARANJUEZ\">Aranjuez</a>, they surmount the rocky edge of its native mountain, and, dashing upon the plain beneath, sink into a pool of great depth, called Olla de Borlague. The Tagus, now running placidly through the plains of Zorita and the royal gardens of Aranjuez, at the elevation of 621\u00bd yards above the sea, directs its course to Toledo, passes by Talavera, Alc\u00e1ntara, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABRANTES\">Abrantes</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SANTAREM\">Santarem</a>, losing itself finally in the sea, near Lisbon. The latitudes of several towns on the banks of the Tagus show the gradual inclination of its stream toward the south. It amounts to 49\u00b0 6' from Trillo to Toledo, to 6\u00b0 24\" from the latter city to Alc\u00e1ntara, and no less than 1\u00b0 1' 40\" from thence to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of Portugal.\n\nThe river Guadiana is, according to Antillon, very inaccurately represented in the Spanish maps of Lopez, both as to the point where it disappears, and that where, emerging from the ground, through which its waters are filtered, it resumes its sluggish course to the ocean.\n\nThe sources of the Guadiana have been rendered classical ground by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEN\">pen</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CERVANTES\">Cervantes</a>. They are found north of Alcaraz, in La Mancha, at the pools of Ruidera, well known to the admirers of Don Quixote. The course of the river is first to the north-west, for eight leagues. It is then absorbed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, and disappears for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> leagues. The first gathering of its waters, after their subterraneous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISPERSION\">dispersion</a>, takes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> near Daymiel. The spot is called Ojos (Eyes) de Guadiana. The stream now proceeds to Ciudad Real, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> town of the pro-\n\n* The result of this, and several other measurements executed by Mr Clemente, was communicated to Mr Antillon, who has given them in his work, with the initials R. C. Those relating to Sierra Nevada have latterly been published in the Annales de Chimie, Vol. XX. p. 99.\n\n\u2020 His barometric measurement was taken by Humboldt in 1799.\nThe abundance of pasture which betrays the hidden course of Guadiana is the origin of a boast often repeated in La Mancha, that their river has so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a> as to allow thousands of cattle to feed upon it. That bridge affords, however, but a dangerous pastoral station; for the country being subject to sudden inundations, both flocks and shepherds are not unfrequently in the most imminent danger of being swept away by the waters. The stream of Guadiana, near Villarta, is only at the height of 710 yards above the sea. It is not navigable higher than M\u00e9rtola in Portugal.\n\nThe Guadalquivir occupies the centre of the plain which lies between the Sierra Morena and the chain of Granada, where it takes its source to the northeast of Ja\u00e9n. The chief towns on its banks are And\u00fajar, C\u00f3rdoba, Seville, and San L\u00facar (Templum Lucifert). At the ferry near Meng\u00edbar, on the road from Madrid to Granada, the Guadalquivir is 203 yards above the sea. The Guadalquivir is navigable for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> vessels up to Seville; but its bed being constantly raised and obstructed by growing shallows, the navigation is extremely tedious.\n\nII. On the subject of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATA\">data</a> which the Spanish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> possessed before the French invasion must have been greatly deficient in accuracy. The suspicions of the inhabitants, constantly alive against every public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, were roused into full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> by the domiciliary inquiries which took place in 1798, when a general census was made. It is, therefore, more than probable, that the number of inhabitants considerably exceeded what we find in the official reports. We subjoin the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">Table</a> published by Anillion from documents in the possession of the Commissioners for the Encouragement of Trade (Balanza Mercantil y Fomento de Comercio), in 1803.\n\n| Provinces                  | Total of Inhabitants | Surface in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> leagues, 20 to a <a

delighted in this kind of startling metaphors about their country. In the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, they would say that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">King</a> of Spain had three noble subjects, who brought into the field six thousand knights, wearing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> spurs, meaning the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">Grand</a> Masters of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SANTIAGO\">Santiago</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ALCANTARA\">Alcantara</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CALATRAVA\">Calatrava</a>; that he had a lion (L\u00e9on), and a bull (Toro), that fed daily on twelve beeves, in reference to the towns bearing these names; that he had three dogs (Canes), who served him with two hundred Castillian lances, such being the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> due by the three towns Can de Roa, Can de Muna, and Canes de Zurita. Can is the Castilian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRONUNCIATION\">pronunciation</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> Spanish word <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAMP\">Camp</a>, which afterwards became Campo, a field, or district.\n\n\u2020 The following barometric measurements show the rising of the ground from that point to Alcal\u00e1 la Real, where the waters are divided between the Guadalquivir and the Genil. Meng\u00edbar is 350 yards above the sea; Torre-Campo, at the distance of four leagues, 705; Alcaudete, five leagues, 835; Alcal\u00e1, three leagues, 1023.\n\n\u2021 The Guadalquivir was navigable up to Cordoba in 1360, as appears by a petition of the Seville bargemen to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a> the Cruel, complaining that the openings required by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a> across the mill-dams had been narrowed, and, in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, closed against them. The king ordered the obstructions to be removed, and fixed for the breadth of the channel that of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHEDRAL\">cathedral</a> of Cordoba, called the Arch of Blessing.

If Valencia, with less coast to its area than Biscay or Asturias, is more peopled than either, the extraordinary fertility of its soil, and the unrivalled salubrity of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, will easily account for the anomaly. The province of Granada, which possesses a greater proportion of coast than Galicia, is also more thickly inhabited. The same may be observed in comparing Galicia with Catalonia, Burgos with Murcia. Antillon attributes the excess of population in the province of Seville over Granada to the confluence occasioned by the two great towns of Seville and Cadiz, both enjoying peculiar advantages; the former from its sea-port, the latter from the navigation of the Guadalquivir.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of Portugal with Spain affords a further <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a>. The latter kingdom has 468 leagues of sea coast, Portugal 172. The ratios of their areas to their line of coast are 100:3.24\u2014and 100:5. Now, in the first place, the mean population of Portugal exceeds that of Spain by 381 inhabitants to the square league; 2dly, the most populous province of Spain falls short of the most populous in Portugal by 1106 souls to the same portion of territory; 3dly, in the respective provinces where population is thinnest, the Portuguese exceed the Spaniards at the rate of 120 persons to the square league.\n\nIf we compare the population of the Portuguese provinces with the ratio of their areas to their line\n\n---\n\n* These Tables are inserted here for the convenience of the reader, who would otherwise be obliged to keep the article Portugal constantly under his eye, in order to judge of the observations we shall presently make on the comparative population of the two peninsular countries. The Portuguese returns reckon by fogos (hearths), which Mr Antillon has calculated at the rate of five persons to each.\nof coast, we shall find that Alentejo, the lowest in that scale, is also the least populous. Entre Douro e Minho, which has a greater proportion of coast than Beyra and Extremadoura, is more inhabited than either.* If the relative population of these two appears to be an exception, the fact may be easily explained by the consideration, that Beyra, besides the Mond\u00e9go, and some other copious streams, enjoys the navigation of the Douro and the Tagus from the farthest limits of its territory, while Extremadoura has only a share in the benefits of the latter river. Entre Douro e Minho, possessing the Douro, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIMA\">Lima</a>, and the Minho, which are navigable a great way up the interior, may be reckoned to exceed Algarve in the advantages arising from a seacoast, though the sea washes a smaller portion of its territory. The difference, too, of the soils affords an additional answer to the objection, since that of Entre Douro e Minho is confessedly the richest in Portugal, while the inhabitants of Algarve have the most sterile portion of the kingdom for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOT\">lot</a>.\n\nWhatever may be thought of the accuracy of the preceding theory, it cannot be denied, that, besides the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of food afforded by the sea, the facility of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> and conveyance, which a neighbouring coast presents, must have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> tendency to increase the wealth of the inhabitants, and consequently to multiply their numbers. The territory of Spain has been quaintly, though accurately, compared to an embroidered waistcoat; the edges full and ornamented, the centre a blank, with a few scattered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a>. Were it all as fully inhabited as Guipuzcoa, it would contain 80,146,050 souls, nearly three times the number in 1803. Even at the moderate rate of the Catalonian population, or 856 souls to the square league, Spain would have 12,844,708 inhabitants, about two millions and a half above the last returns. That this comparative dearth of population does not, either exclusively or chiefly, arise from the national system of government, is proved by the state of population in Portugal, a country which, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> immemorial, has been no less than Spain, under the influence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> despotism. Capmany,\u2020 one of the most able and well informed Spaniards of our own times, has satisfactorily shown, that the accounts of some old writers, who make the population of Spain, in the sixteenth century, ascend to twenty or twenty-one millions, are groundless and exaggerated. We are, therefore, inclined to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> more influence on this point to the physical or geographical circumstances of Spain than has been hitherto allowed by writers on Spanish statistics, and shall give it the first place in the consideration of the chief obstacles which have hitherto opposed the prosperity of that country.\n\nIII. No depth of observation is required to perceive that, whatever opposes the internal trade and interchange of commodities, must, by checking the progress of wealth, check also the increase of population; while a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> glance at a good map of Spain will suffice to perceive how unfavourable the structure of that country must be to the purposes of national <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>. The enormous chains of mountains which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRAVERSE\">traverse</a> the peninsula in a direction almost parallel to the equator, and the consequent want of navigable rivers from north to south, the distance from the central provinces to the coast, the difficulty of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a> and canals through high ridges of mountains and extensive plains at very different levels, are obstacles which would require all the activity of a rich and well governed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> to smooth or to subdue.\n\nLittle, however, could be expected from the enfeebled and corrupt despotism into which the government of the Spanish Bourbons had settled after some fitful aims at improvement, which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">court</a> intrigue or the death of a minister was sure to defeat. Yet, it is but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> to say, that the only progress which Spain has made, since the time when the foreign influence of her monarchs, and the discovery of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>, gave her a false appearance of internal vigour, has taken place under the present dynasty.\u2021 How much was done for the encouragement of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>, in the reign of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> III., may be deduced from the fact that, whereas that monarch found Spain under the annual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of importing corn \u00a7 to the value of one hundred millions of francs, the deficiency was found so far reduced under his successor as to be supplied, in the more favourable years, at the expense of only fifteen millions of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>.\u2016\n\nHow truly the necessity of importing corn arises from the want of easy communications between the provinces, appears from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> crops which, as we learn from the demi-official authority <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> quoted, amount to more than seventy millions of quintals by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>.\u00b6 In the kingdom of Aragon, there is an annual surplus of 388,000 quintals (2,910,000 bushels) of corn.** The incorrectness of Spanish statistical documents is, however, so evi-\n\n* In the comparison of the Portuguese provinces it must be remembered, that Extremadoura includes the adventitious population of Lisbon.\n\n\u2020 Capmany, Questiones Criticas.\n\n\u2021 See a Memoir of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> of Floridablanca, published by Archdeacon Coxe as an Appendix to the 1st <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of his History of the Spanish Bourbons.\n\n\u00a7 The quantity of corn supposed to be imported yearly into Spain is sixty millions of fanegas, or one thirteenth of the whole consumption. Upon a rough calculation, two fanegas are equal to three bushels.\n\n\u2016 Histoire de la Guerre d'Espagne <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CONTRE\">contre</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NAPOLEON\">Napoleon</a> Buonaparte, par une <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> d'officiers de toutes armes \u00e9tablie \u00e0 Madrid aupr\u00e8s de S.

Geografia de Espana, p. 151, 2d edit.\ndent, that it would be rash to admit any inferences from them implicitly, or to their full extent. Yet, it cannot be doubted, that, in years of abundance, the produce of the interior is often allowed to waste, while corn is imported from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a> and Russia at a cheaper rate than the native produce could be sold for on the coast.\n\nThe benefits of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPORTATION\">exportation</a> of wine, which are now limited to some of the provinces bordering on the sea, might be extended to more than one-half of the country if, by means of canals or navigable rivers, that article could be transported to the coast at a cheap rate. But the luxuriant vineyards of Andalusia, not in the immediate vicinity of the water, are of little advantage to the owners; and the juice, which might ferment into a variety of exquisite wines, is often thrown away, when the small quantity, which will supply the demand of a very limited district, has been collected in the cellars.\n\nThe water carriage in Spain is reduced to the inconsiderable portions of the intended canals of Aragon and Castille, which have been constructed; to the slow and laborious navigation of the Ebro from Zaragoza to Tortosa, performed, almost exclusively, for the conveyance of wheat; and to the floating of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a> down that river, the Tagus, the X\u00facar, the Segura, and the Guadalquivir. This last river, on which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEAM\">steam</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a>, built and worked under the direction of a British engineer, affords, of late, an easy and speedy communication between Seville and San L\u00facar, is the only one from which Spain derives any considerable advantage in point of trade.\n\nIt may be reckoned among the unfortunate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of circumstances which have hitherto checked the internal prosperity of Spain, that the navigable part of its finest rivers belongs to another kingdom. The Tagus and the Douro may be said to exist for the exclusive advantage of Portugal.\n\nDuring the short and ill-fated union of the two peninsular crowns, the engineer Antonelli undertook to open the navigation of the Tagus as far as Toledo, and completed that useful work in 1558. After the separation of Portugal from Spain, several plans have been presented to the Spanish government for removing the obstacles which obstruct the bed of that river from Alc\u00e1ntara to Toledo, and even from the latter town to Aranjuez, which, by means of canals, was to be joined with Alcal\u00e1. Surveys were made by order of the government, from which, as Antillon observes, no benefit accrued to the country except an accession of topographical knowledge, and the fruitless conviction that the communication of La Mancha with the ocean was opposed, chiefly, by moral and political obstacles.*\n\nThe Ebro, under the Roman dominion, is said to have been navigable up to Logro\u00f1o, a distance of 65 leagues inland. In the twelfth century, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">Emperor</a> Don Alonso ordered galleys to be sunk near Zaragoza, as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> against the Moorish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">navy</a>. Zurita relates, that, in the fifteenth century, King Don Juan sailed down the Ebro from Navarre into Aragon. We find, however, the Cortes of the latter kingdom, under Charles II., of Spain, towards the end of the seventeenth century, deliberating upon plans for expediting the navigation of the Ebro near the sea. A survey was made for the same purpose in 1738, but with no practical result. The grand canal of Aragon was at length begun under Charles III., the grandfather of the present king; and were it completed, it would stand a splendid monument of the spirit of the nation.\u2020 It is, however, much against the practical utility of the public works undertaken in Spain, that, by a natural disposition of the people, they are all begun upon a scale which would require the wealth and power of imperial Rome for their completion. The little that exists of the canal of Aragon might, if we believe Antillon, compete with the works of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>; but, instead of reaching the sea through the Ebro, and terminating in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> harbour, as was intended, it has been carried on for the space of eighteen leagues only, and contributes but little to the internal navigation of the country. Whether it is more favourable to agriculture, by the copious irrigation which it affords in its course, is, we find, a point in dispute among the Spaniards. Jovellanos, in his excellent Informe sobre la Ley Agraria, mentions the farmers' complaints against the canals for irrigation. It is hard, indeed, upon all land owners within a certain distance to be forced to pay a tax for irrigation, whether they have or not the means, the skill, or the inclination, to avail themselves of the promised benefit.\u2021 The farms, for instance, near the canal of Aragon, from Zaragoza to S\u00e1stago, pay one-fifth of their corn, and one-seventh of all other produce, for irrigation. Lands newly brought into tillage pay only one-sixth of the corn, and one-eighth of the other produce.\n\nSuch complaints, it seems, were louder in the vicinity of the canal of Castille, where the Spanish practice of allowing the fields to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> fallow every other year was still adhered to, notwithstanding the abundance of water.\u00a7 This canal begins at Al\u00e1r del Rey, in the province of Burgos. It is fed by the Pisuerga, whose right <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a> it follows till it joins that stream on the limits of the kingdom of Le\u00f3n. It then runs to the south and south-west, crossing the river Cierza, and proceeds on its right bank till, passing through the Carrion, it turns to the west of Palencia, and terminates in the same river. The small canal of Campos, running more to the west, joins that of Castille to the north of Palencia.\n\nAccording to one of these gigantic plans with which the Spanish government have often amused their vanity, providing, as it were, in the magnitude of the enterprise, a ready excuse for their inactivity,\n\n---\n\n* Antillon, Geogr. de Espa\u00f1a, p. 162.\n\u2020 The canal of the Ebro was begun under the Emperor Charles V., but being soon discontinued, the present canal is, properly speaking, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> work.\n\u2021 Jovellanos, Ley Agraria, p. 29.\n\u00a7 Ibid. p. 39.\nthe canal of Castille was to reach the sea at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SANTANDER\">Santander</a>, through the river Cam\u00e9sa, through the Ebro, near Reynosa, and finally through the Besaya and the Pas. From its present termination near Palencia, it was, on the other side, to reach Valladolid, to strike off from the Duero, in order to join the Adaja, and then to follow the Eresma as far as Segovia. From thence it was to be directed to the canal of Aragon, and thus to unite the ocean with the Mediterranean, across the kingdom. Don Ramon de Pignatelli, the engineer who superintended the works of the canal of Aragon, laid the plans of this immense work before Charles III., whose sanction they received. We must, however, remind the reader, that the only traces which exist of this mighty dream attract but faintly the notice of the traveller, near Burgos, and in the vicinity of Madrid, where the head of one of the intended branches extends for four or five miles almost undisturbed by barge or boat.\n\nSuch are the effects of a despotic government, even in its kindest moods, and when it, fairly and honestly, means to promote the good of its subjects. Unwilling to consult, and unable to ascertain the real <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of those immediately concerned in the result of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a>, it moves with ponderous haste towards the object which dazzles its eyes, often crushing in its way those it meant to relieve. Complaints are heard at length; which, joined to the exhaustion attending all unnatural exertions, never fail to put the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESPOT\">despot</a> in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> with his subjects, and make him repent that he ever was so good and gracious as to try to improve their condition.\n\nHad the Spanish farmers of the different provinces been fairly heard before their lands were indiscriminately drenched, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of a royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECREE\">decree</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURE\">treasure</a> which was thus mispent might have been employed in opening roads across the provinces, by means of which the value of their crops would have risen at once. But the purblind projectors of these schemes forgot every circumstance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, except that, in the provinces bordering on the Mediterranean, irrigation increased agricultural produce. This was enough to convince them that it would have the same effect in the centre of Castille. The farmers declared, however, that the abundance of water deteriorated their lands; and, though much abused for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a>, they probably were in the right. Yet, supposing that irrigation could <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> their crops, they still had good reason to complain that, under the burden of an additional tax, the abundance of corn only lowered the price in the small district which formed their market; and that living, as they do, at the distance of many miles from their fields, they could not bestow that constant labour and attention, which alone might enable them to raise a yearly crop on the same soil.\n\nWe have just adverted to another of the great obstacles which oppose the agricultural wealth of Spain. The want of rural population, and the great distance of the farmers' dwellings from their farms. Independently of the loss of time and strength arising from a walk of four or six miles before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>'s work is begun, there are long periods in the year when the fields are scarcely visited by the owners, generally gentlemen farmers, and but seldom by the rustic, who acts as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEWARD\">steward</a>. Field work, in fact, is not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> throughout the year, but hastily and slovenly performed, at the sowing and the reaping season, by large parties of labourers, for whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a>, in farms at considerable distance from any town, there is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> not unlike a large barn, which affords a promiscuous shelter to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAST\">beast</a>. Bands of ploughmen, with thirty or forty team of oxen, are seen at the beginning of winter, slightly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> up the sods in the fields which have lain fallow the preceding year. The sowers walk slowly behind them, scattering the seed by handfuls, of which, part is picked up by the large flocks of birds which hover over those extensive solitudes, and part prevented from taking root by being improperly lodged in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARROW\">harrow</a> is hardly known in Andalusia, and weeding is an operation seldom resorted to. The corn-fields, thus abandoned to the influences of the climate, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> luxuriance of the soil, present, at the approach of summer, the colours of the rainbow to the eye of the traveller, who, but for the absence of all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> habitation, might easily mistake them for flower gardens. We are, it is true, describing the Andalusian method of farming, with which we are best acquainted; but, with the exception of Murcia, Valencia, and Catalonia, on the coast, and part of Aragon, in the interior, we have reason to believe that agriculture is neither better understood nor practised than in Andalusia; the mismanagement of whose extensive and fertile plains has, by far, the greatest share in the agricultural disadvantages of Spain. Indeed, Andalusia and Aragon, alone, might, under an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> and enlightened system of tillage, supply the whole country with corn.\n\nIt was once proposed to the Spanish government Projects for to distribute the uncultivated land, amounting to a large proportion of the whole country, among such of the natives as were disposed to bring their lots into tillage. This measure, it was hoped by Jovelanos, would tend to a wider and more equal distribution of the Spanish population, now crowded in towns at great distances from each other. But it is hardly less difficult to alter the original and confirmed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of the body politic than of the animal frame. The constant state of warfare against the Moors obliged the Spaniards, from the earliest period of that protracted struggle, to live in large towns, where they might find security against the surrounding enemy. The necessity also of arming the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> population saved Spain, it is true, from that degraded state of vassalage, which so long oppressed the greatest portion of the people of Europe; but the want of a class of men bound to the soil, and forming part of the agricultural stock of their masters, prevented the existence of a numerous peasantry, which, being spread over the country, might, in the course of time, obtain their emancipation, and become the fathers of a free and happy agricultural population.\n\nUnder these circumstances, all schemes to alter the form and character which the growth of centuries has given to civil society in Spain, must prove,\nwe fear, vain and visionary. It is not in the power of man suddenly to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> the idle and degraded inhabitants of large cities into sober and industrious farmers; nor, even if that were possible, could such a nation find means to furnish the home colonist with stock and implements, as well as support, till the new broken land should yield enough for their maintenance. Men will soon find their way to every spot, where either nature or the aggregate industry of the people that inhabit the country, affords them the means of living by moderate exertion. Whenever the Spanish government shall have opened an easy communication between the central provinces and the coast, and joined every important town in the peninsula by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> roads\u2014when the means of internal traffic shall have opened a market for the produce of the soil\u2014when the laws which fetter the industry of the Spaniards shall have been repealed long enough to allow them to perceive their real interests, and to exert themselves with the steadiness and confidence of habitual freedom, then, and not before, will the productive power of their land be called into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>. Cultivation will gradually spread from the insulated spots which it always presents in its first stages; towns will join <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> across deserts, and men will start up as it were from the furrows\u2014a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, we believe, recorded in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FABLE\">fable</a> by primitive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, and placed in the light of demonstration by that which is the boast of our own times.\n\nBefore we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> this part of our article, we cannot omit to mention an obstacle to the prosperity of Spanish agriculture, which, limited as we are for space, we would pass over in silence, were it not a curious instance of the influence of national circumstances upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> and sentiments which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> often represents as natural and invariable.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> in land, wherever the feudal system has existed in full vigour, are so exclusive and peremptory, that it must surprise an Englishman to learn, that there are but very few spots in Spain which the landlord can call his own, from the moment he has housed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARVEST\">harvest</a>. The right of driving cattle into the stubble-fields is claimed and maintained with great obstinacy, not only by the powerful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">association</a> of owners of Merino flocks, called La Mesta, but even by the poorest individuals. The arable land of Spain becomes, in fact, a vast common, every year, to which the lord has no more right than any one else. The privilege enjoyed by the Andalusian farmers of inclosing one-ninth of their fields from Michaelmas to May-day is, according to Jovellanos, who was for some years a judge in the Supreme Court of that province, the source of perpetual law-suits\u2014a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the impatience with which it is borne by the mass of the people.\n\nIf we seek the origin of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> so injurious to agriculture, so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a> with every improvement in husbandry, we shall find it in the peculiar state of the country to which we have attributed the want of a rural population. The Spaniards, while recovering their country from the Moorish usurpers, could hardly consider any land as properly their own but what they had inclosed within the strong walls of their towns. All that the farmers could wish for was to escape an inroad of the enemy while the crops were on the ground. As they could not think of inclosing or improving any particular spot, they cared not whose cattle picked up a scanty feed upon their stubble-fields. When, by the gradual retreat of the Moors, the rights of exclusive property upon land might have been asserted by the owners, their very limited knowledge of agriculture did not allow them to see the advantages which might be derived from inclosures. Thus, in the course of centuries, the general right of pasture was established, which, from the immediate, though paltry, advantages it confers on the multitude, will, we fear, be found among the most intractable prejudices of the Spaniards.\n\nConnected with the ignorance of the advantages arising from the exclusive rights of property in land, Sheep are the exorbitant privileges which the Spanish laws have granted to the owners of migratory or Merino flocks. From the mountains of Leon to the farthest limits of Extremadura, the members of the Mesta, an association composed of the wealthiest Grandees, gentlemen, and religious bodies, have a right to graze their sheep on a broad belt of land called Ca\u00f1ada, gradually and slowly changing their stations, as the mild winters of the south clothe the earth with grass, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of summer thaws the snows of the Leonese mountains. The privileges of this body are defended and enforced by a court of judges created for that purpose, and in the appointment and pay of the Mesta, who, with a numerous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOST\">host</a> of dependants, are the terror of the agriculturist wherever their jurisdiction extends. Lands upon this pastoral road are scarcely the property of any but these formidable shepherds, who fix the price of pasture, obtain it by compulsion wherever it is found, and look upon farmers and their labours as the natural rivals and impediments to their gains. The total of Merino sheep was calculated in 1808 at six millions. A great part of that number were stationary in the different provinces, the fineness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a> depending entirely upon the breed, and not on the change of soil.\n\nSince Spain, however, seems to have no chance of becoming a manufacturing country, and must depend for wealth on her natural productions, we readily agree with Jovellanos* as to the necessity of encouraging the growth of wool, an article which, for centuries, has constituted one of the main resources of that kingdom.\u2020 To <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> the contending\n\n---\n\n* Jovellanos, Ley Agraria, p. 47.\n\u2020 The importation of the Merino sheep from England into Spain is a fact recorded both by Spanish and English authorities. It appears to have taken place at three different periods. The Bachelor Fornan Gomez de Ciudad Real, physician to John II. of Spain, says, that \"the office of Judge of the Mesta had always been conferred on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> Hidalgos.\"\u2014The first (he continues) was I\u00f1igo Lopez de Oroso,\nclaims of the pastoral and the agricultural interests in Spain, must be the work of time under a wise legislature.\n\nIV. We have, in vain, tried to procure a satisfactory account of the state of commerce and industry in Spain. All we can find in the books which we have consulted amounts to little more than general complaints upon this topic. The only substantial fact contained in the first volume of the History of the late <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">War</a>, published by the government of Ferdinand VII., is that, in 1808, the annual exports of Spain were to the imports as three to seven; the value of the former amounting to seventy-five millions of francs (we leave the denomination unaltered), while the latter rose to one hundred and twenty-five millions of the same money. \"In 1802 (say these official historians),\" the produce of our industry was calculated at three hundred and fifty millions of francs; but it was soon reduced to much less in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the maritime war (with England), and the malversations of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">Prince</a> of the Peace. The effects of these checks were the more felt, as the remittances from the American colonies were inadequate to cover the deficit. Our industry in 1808, represented by the amount of its produce, was to that of France nearly as seven to forty.\"\n\n\"Our commerce in 1802, soon after the peace of Amiens, was to that of France as two to three\u2014such, at least, is the result of the statistical documents published by the continental powers at that period. But according to the more accurate estimate presented to government by Mr Canga Arguelles, in 1803, the proportion was that of twenty-eight to one hundred and eighty-two, which, in fact, differs but little from the preceding.\"\n\n\"When Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> declared against us, in the following year, our commerce, which was just beginning to recover from the losses of the past war, may be said to have received its death wound. Our mercantile companies, then the most powerful in Europe,\u2020 were ruined by the general stagnation of trade, by the large and frequent loans made to a government, who never paid either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> or principal. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILIPPINE_ISLANDS\">Philippine <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">Islands</a> Company, whose funds were immense, failed to the amount of six millions (of francs). The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEPUTATION\">Deputation</a> of the five Gremios of Madrid, well known to all Europe for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> and wealth, was ruined, partly by the inactive state of our industry, partly by the financial operations\n\nwhom King Don Alonso (XI.) appointed to that office when the sheep were first brought from England in the Carracks.\" (Cento Epistolario, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">Letter</a> 73d, dated 1437.) The appointment of Inigo Lopez was made in 1329. (See a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHRONICLE\">Chronicle</a> of Peter the Cruel, p. 60. Madrid, 1779.) The second importation was in the reign of Henry III. of Castille, and formed part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> portion of his wife, Catharine Plantagenet, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of John of Gaunt. (See Historia de la Vida y Hechos del Rey Don Enrique Tercero de Castilla, por Gil Gonzalez Davila, p. 11.) This marriage was celebrated in 1388. (Ib. p. 4.) The third importation is mentioned by Holinshed (Vol. II, p. 668), who relates that, in 1466, Edward IV. of England \"concluded an amitie and league with Henric King of Castle, and John King of Aragon, at the concluding whereof he granted licence for certaine Cottesholde sheepe to be transported into the countrie of Spaine (as people report), which have there so multiplied and increased, that it hath turned the commoditie of England much to the Spanish profit.\" Stowe (p. 419) repeats the account of Holinshed; but adds, that \"long ere this were sheep in Spaine, as may appeare by a pattent of King Henry the Second, the 31 of his raigne, granted to the weavers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, that if any cloth were found to be made of Spanish wool mixed with English wool, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJOR\">Major</a> of London should see it brent.\"\n\nFrom this regulation of Henry II., it may be inferred that Spanish wool was, at that time, inferior in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> to English wool, and this conclusion is confirmed by Capmany, who remarks, that, till the middle of the fifteenth century, the Spanish wool could not be brought into competition with that of England, for the fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLORENCE\">Florence</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLANDERS\">Flanders</a> (Questiones Criticas, p. 9); which again agrees with the complaints of Stowe, Harrison, Speed, and Sir Richard Baker, that Spanish wool was so much improved in their days as to rival that of England.\n\nIt cannot, however, be doubted that the travelling flocks, called Trasumantes, were known in Spain long before the importation of sheep from England; as the Concejo de la Mesta, which was created for the preservation of their privileges, possess a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARTER\">charter</a> dated 2d of September 1273. (See Quaderno de la Mesta.*)\n\nThe custom of changing the stations of the flocks according to the seasons, the Spaniards must have derived from the Romans, whose practice on this point of rural economy is thus described by Varro: \"Illae (oves) in saltibus quae pascuntur\u2014et a tectis abeunt long\u00e8, portant secum <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CRATES\">crates</a> aut retia quibus cohortes in solitudine faciant, ceteraque utensilia; longe enim et late in diversis locis pasce solent, ut multa millia absint saep hyberne pastiones <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">ab</a> astivis. Ego vero scio, inquam, nam mihi greges in Appulis hybernabant qui in Reatinis montibus aestivabant.\" De Re Rust. Lib. II. c. 2.\n\n* For the most valuable part of this historical information we acknowledge ourselves indebted to the friendship of John Allen, Esq. of Dulwich College.\n\n\u2020 The military historians seem not to have recollected the existence of the East <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> Company, in England. It is certainly to be regretted that habits of inaccuracy and exaggeration still prevail too much among the Spanish writers, especially upon subjects connected with national feeling.\nof our ministers. Neither the National Bank of San Carlos, which opened with a capital of seventy-five millions (of reals, about seven millions and a half <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">Sterling</a>), nor the Royal Maritime Company, created in 1789, could realize their objects, or even preserve their funds, which were soon drained, to fill the strong chests of the Favourite, or spent in France for the support of armies which were, at no distant period, to be employed against us.\"\n\n\"The failure of remittances from Spanish America, the enormous subsidies which we paid to France, and the ruinous measures by which the annual deficits were met, exhausted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURY\">treasury</a>, and put an end to public credit. No funds were safe from the hands of the Favourite. The capital of the bank, that of the Monte de Piedad, the judiciary deposits, the panper's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUND\">fund</a>,\u2014all was seized by servile ambition, that it might support injustice and prodigality. The plans of internal navigation were forgotten; the public works then in progress were suspended; and those that had been concluded were left to decay for want of means to repair them.\"\n\n\"The government, wholly intent on guilty schemes of momentary advantage, not only neglected the country whose interests it was their duty to promote, but actually increased the obstacles which were opposed to her industry. Customhouses were found in every direction, the roads were crowded with revenue officers, and tolls were levied, at every step, upon travellers. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> were compelled to make declarations injurious to their interests; and, when they had gone through ten thousand vexatious forms, they could not yet feel secure, or beyond the reach of the fiscal vultures.\"\n\nV. Such was the state of Spain in 1808, when the ambition of France, and the dissensions of the royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, brought her to that dangerous crisis, of which the extraordinary events of the last fifteen years are not sufficient to point out the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a>. We must, however, refer the reader for a sketch of that part of Spanish history to the Article GREAT BRITAIN in this Supplement; and attempt a more detailed view of the period beginning with the return of Ferdinand VII. from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTIVITY\">captivity</a> in France, and ending in the invasion of the French army in 1823.\n\nThe hopes which had induced some of the most enlightened Spaniards to join in the popular struggle against the establishment of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a> Buonaparte on the throne of their country, had been crowned with success on the publication of the New Constitution, at Cadiz, on the 19th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 1812.\n\nBy one of the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> in that code, the sovereignty is declared to reside essentially in the nation, which, being free and independent, neither is, nor can be, the patrimony of any person or family.\n\n\u2014All Spaniards, without distinction, are subject to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-TAXATION\">taxation</a>.\u2014\"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> of the Spanish nation is, and shall be for ever, the Catholic, Apostolic, and Roman, which is the only true religion.\"\u2014\"The nation,\" it is added, \"protects it by wise and just laws, and forbids the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of any other whatever.\"\u2014The government of the Spanish nation is stated to be \"a limited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONARCHY\">monarchy</a>.\"\n\nThe power of making laws is vested \"in the Cortes, jointly with the King.\"\u2014In describing the class of Spaniards who enjoy the privileges of citizenship, persons \"reputed of African origin, either by the father or the mother's side,\" are excluded. A similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCLUSION\">exclusion</a> is given to Spaniards who obtain naturalization in another country, or who, without leave, absent themselves five years from Spain. The only basis for the number of representatives in the Cortes is Population, to be taken from the census of 1797, till one more correct can be made. For every seventy thousand souls there is to be one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEPUTY\">deputy</a> in the Cortes. The returns of the members are made by three successive elections. Every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> appoints electors for the district to which it belongs. These repair to the chief town of the district to choose another set of electors, who, lastly, meeting in the capital of the province, make the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> appointment to the Cortes. The Cortes is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIENNIAL\">triennial</a>. No member can be elected for two successive representations. No debate can be carried on in the presence of the king; his ministers may attend and speak, but are not allowed to vote. There is a permanent deputation, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMITTEE\">committee</a> of the Cortes, composed of seven members, appointed by the whole body, before a prorogation or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a>, whose duty is to watch over the executive, and report any infringement of the constitution to the next Cortes. It also belongs to them to convolve an extraordinary Cortes in the cases prescribed by the constitution.\n\nThe powers of the Cortes are chiefly these: 1st, To move and pass the laws; and to interpret and alter them when necessary. 2d, To administer the constitutional <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OATHS\">oaths</a> to the King, the Prince of Asturias, &c. 3d, To determine any doubt or fact relative to the succession. 4th, To elect a regency, and define its powers. 5th, To make the public recognition of the Prince of Asturias. 6th, To appoint guardians to the king while a minor. 7th, To approve or reject treaties previous to ratification. 8th, To allow or refuse the admission of foreign troops into the kingdom. 9th, To decree the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a> or suppression of offices in the tribunals established by the constitution, as well as of places of public trust. 10th, To fix, every year, by the king's proposal, the land and sea forces. 11th, To regulate the military code in all its branches. 12th, To fix the expenses of the government. 13th, To impose taxes, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> loans, and direct every thing relating to the revenue. 14th, To establish a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of public instruction, and direct the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> of the Prince of Asturias. 15th, To protect the political <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> of the press. 16th, To enforce the responsibility of the secretaries of state, and other persons in office.\n\nLaws may be proposed, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>, by any one of the deputies. Two days after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BILL\">bill</a> is to be read a second time. It is then determined whether the subject is to be debated, or to be referred to a committee. Four days after the bill has been voted worthy of discussion, it is read a third time, and a day is appointed for the debate. A majority of votes decides the fate of the bill; the members\npresent on these occasions must exceed the half of their total number by one.\n\nThe powers of the king are, 1st, To suspend the passing of a law by withholding his sanction. He can exercise this power against any decree of the Cortes, for two consecutive sessions; but is compelled to give his assent if the same law is passed by three Cortes successively. 2d, The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-EXECUTIVE_POWER\">executive power</a> resides exclusively in the king, and extends to whatever relates to the preservation of public order in the interior, and to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> security of the state, according to the constitution and the laws. The privileges and duties of the executive are thus detailed in the constitution: the King may issue decrees, regulations, and instructions, for the more effectually enforcing of the laws;\u2014it is his duty to watch over the administration of justice;\u2014he declares war, and makes peace, under the control of the Cortes;\u2014he appoints judges to all the civil and criminal courts, on the presentation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> of state;\u2014all civil and military employments are of the king's appointment;\u2014he presents to all bishoprics, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> dignities and benefices which may be in the gift of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>; all by the advice of the council of state;\u2014the king is the fountain of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a>; the army and the navy are at his command, and he has the appointment of generals and admirals;\u2014he has the right of coining, and the privilege of impressing his bust on the metallic currency of the realm;\u2014the king can propose new laws, or amendments to those in existence. It belongs also to him to circulate or withhold the Pope's rescripts and bulls;\u2014he can choose and dismiss his own ministers.\n\nThe following checks are laid on the king's authority by the constitution:\n\n1st, The king cannot prevent the meeting of the Cortes at the periods fixed by the constitution; neither can he dissolve them or disturb their sittings. His advisers and abettors in such attempts are guilty of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASON\">treason</a>. 2d, If the king should quit the kingdom without the consent of the Cortes, he is understood to have abdicated the crown. 3d, The king cannot alienate any part of the Spanish territory. 4th, He cannot abdicate the crown in favour of his successor without the consent of the Cortes. 5th, He cannot enter into any political <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a>, or make commercial treaties without the consent of the Cortes. 6th, He cannot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> privileges or monopolies. 7th, The king cannot disturb any individual in the enjoyment of his property, nor deprive him of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> liberty. If the interest of the state should require the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARREST\">arrest</a> of any individual by virtue of a royal order, the prisoner must be delivered over to a competent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBUNAL\">tribunal</a> within eight and forty hours. 8th, The king cannot marry without the consent of the Cortes; he is supposed to abdicate the crown by taking a wife against their will.\n\nThe Council of State is composed of forty individuals, viz. two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a>, two priests, and four grandees; the other thirty-two must not belong to any of these classes. The members of the Council of State shall be chosen by the king out of a triple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIST\">list</a> presented to him by the Cortes. The Councillors of State cannot be removed without a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> before the Supreme Court of Justice. Their salary is fixed by the Cortes. The functions of this Council of State are to advise the king on all important matters of government, and especially upon giving or refusing his sanction to the laws, declaring war, or making treaties. The king, besides, cannot bestow any ecclesiastical benefice, or appoint any judge, but at the proposal of the Council of State, who, upon every vacancy, are to confine his choice to one out of three individuals, whose names they are to lay before his majesty.\n\nThe laws for the security of personal liberty are these, 1st, No Spaniard can be imprisoned without a summary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a>, wherein he is credibly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INFRACTION\">infraction</a> of some law which subjects the offender to corporal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>; 2d, The arrest cannot take place without the warrant of a competent judge; 3d, Prisoners are not to be examined upon oath; 4th, The gaoler shall keep a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGISTER\">register</a> of the prisoners, expressing the warrant, and the alleged cause of his confinement.\n\nSuch are the main articles of the Spanish Constitution; a production which, considering the circumstances of its appearance, highly deserves the attention of the politician and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>. Spain had been for ages under the most effectual restraints which can be laid on the human mind, to prevent its dwelling upon subjects connected with the authority of civil and ecclesiastical rulers. Few Spaniards, out of the learned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROFESSIONS\">professions</a>, devoted any part of their time to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a>. The knowledge of the clergy was generally limited to scholastic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a>, as that of the lawyers to the forms of the civil courts. A small proportion of both classes had privately ventured to look beyond the bounds which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> and government had set to their speculations, and, books being smuggled from France, an inconsiderable number were become initiated in the principles of the French Philosophical School. The seeds of doubt and dissent, in matters of religion and policy, had greatly spread for the last forty years; but the bulk of the nation was still without a thought on these subjects, and blindly followed the impulse which time and habit had given them. The events which dethroned Charles IV. had no farther broken these habits than merely to show the people how effectually they could oppose their own will to the constituted authorities. But their loyalty was not impaired by their successful efforts. The name of Ferdinand VII. was the great bond of union which preserved the Spaniards from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANARCHY\">anarchy</a>. To defend the authority of the crown was the only object of their general insurrection; and, having deposited its unbounded powers in the hands of a few, the people retired to their homes, setting no limits to their obedience.\n\nHad not the progress of the French armies dispersed the Central Junta, and concentrated the fugitive patriots at Cadiz, it is more than probable that the Cortes would have been assembled according to the ancient forms, and that the privileged classes, supported by the majority of the nation, would have defeated any attempt to alter the old\nconstitution. But Cadiz offered to that party, which has been since known by the name of Liberal, the most favourable opportunity of striking a deadly blow at the very root of the monarchical power, under which they had so long groaned in hopeless, yet silent, restlessness.\n\nFrom its maritime position, its commercial interests, and the foreign <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTRACTION\">extraction</a> of many of its inhabitants, Cadiz has, at all times, exhibited a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> so different from that which strikes the observer in the interior, that, upon entering its walls, he might imagine himself suddenly transported out of the kingdom. There, instead of the national prejudices in favour of birth, he might perceive the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a> of wealth, and an ill disguised impatience of all other claims to respect and influence. If the rich merchants decked themselves with the marks of distinction so eagerly coveted by Spaniards, they still wore them without ease or satisfaction. Apparently raised by these externals to the ranks of the old titled gentry, the new marquis or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNIGHT\">knight</a> still found himself but little removed above those of his former condition. He could not meet with the hereditary deference which the Caballero of the interior found in the labouring classes. Cadiz, in its days of prosperity, had no poor; for, while a stream of wealth was poured in from the American colonies, the sea forbade its population to spread beyond the limits of comfortable subsistence. The line of distinction between the higher and the lower classes was, therefore, less marked than in other large towns of the peninsula; and, when the season of mercantile prosperity was over, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPRESSION\">depression</a> was general, it left the various classes at the same proportionable distance. Cadiz, unknown to herself, cherished, in fact, a republican spirit. The line which divided her rich and her poor, her workmen and their employers, was almost imperceptible when compared with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GULF\">gulf</a> of prejudice and pride which separated the merchant from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANDEE\">grandee</a>. Thus, undivided by jealousies of rank, and feeling in common that impatience of political superiority which is inherent to the human heart, the people of Cadiz were ready to greet any prospect of change in the monarchical and aristocratical system of the country.\n\nAll that was wanting to bring these dispositions into action, and give them a definite aim, was driven into Cadiz by the advance of the French armies within sight of its walls. Madrid had, for a long time, been the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a> of the most enlightened Spaniards; the only spot where persons, who had embraced Liberal principles, could feel the oppressive yoke of religious tyranny somewhat eased on their necks. As they generally belonged to that numerous class of the Spanish gentry who look up to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRONAGE\">patronage</a> of government for the means of subsistence, the court drew them together from the provinces. On the prospect of the political changes which the captivity of Ferdinand opened to the country, these men attached themselves to the Central Junta, and finally followed its members in their flight from Seville to Cadiz. Thither, too, flocked all the stragglers of the philosophical party; and, on the dissolution of that dull, dilatory knot of ill assorted men, who, under the veil of dignified gravity, had for a time concealed their unfitness to direct the nation, the Spanish speculatists found themselves in the midst of a population highly disposed to listen to their doctrines, to embrace their views, and constitute them the organs of the new laws which were to remodel the kingdom.\n\nThe majority of the first Cortes being composed Character of the class of men whom, by anticipation, we have called Liberales, the project of a Constitution was immediately set on foot, and a committee of the ablest members appointed to draw up the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> code of the monarchy. Such a task, at all times arduous, was, in the present circumstances of the country, beset with peculiar difficulties. The legislators, confined within the walls of a town where innovations could not fail to be popular, went through their task under a strong delusion, mistaking their own wishes and the applause of the surrounding multitude for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of the nation. Encouraged by the absence of the king, placed beyond any check from the privileged classes, and the weight of the landed property of the country, it is surprising that the framers of the new constitution were not more rash than they appear in the code, of which we have laid an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> before our readers.\n\nWe strongly suspect, however, that the authors of the Spanish constitution were less disposed to consider the real sense of the nation, than to prepare, in their code, the most effectual means of working a radical change in the public mind. Perhaps they despaired of being able, by a more truly Spanish system of laws, to make a lasting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REFORM\">reform</a> in the state. Perhaps they feared that, if a portion of the legislative power was deposited in the hands of an upper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, composed of the Grandees and the Clergy, it would clog the motion which they wished to impress upon the almost disorganized machinery of the Spanish state. Perhaps they conceived that the power, which, in the hands of the crown, had been so outrageously abused, could not be reduced too much; and that, since the constitution must recognize a king, he could not be too strictly watched and fettered. We are not, indeed, surprised to find these views in the authors of the Spanish constitution\u2014they were the natural result of their position\u2014right feelings exasperated by a long endurance of tyranny and misrule. But we cannot, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, give them credit for any degree of that sound and practical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> which shone in the English patriots of 1688. The authors of the Spanish constitution had, it is true, to reconstruct the state almost from the foundations. But, professing that they only intended to re-establish the ancient constitution of the kingdom, they had not the ability even to preserve its external form. They certainly neglected all the old materials. Nor have they shown deeper views in the solution of the general problems of politics, such as the basis of representation, and the form of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a>. The Spanish legislators have, on both these points, shrunk at the view of difficulties which they wanted either the knowledge or the courage to meet fairly.\n\nOn one subject alone the authors of the constitu-\ntion yielded to national prejudice without reserve or modification. The article on religion is, unfortunately, an accurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> of the opinions which the mass of the Spanish nation hold upon that point. Shall we, then, suppose the framers of the constitution sincere in the profession of the strong, undoubting, dictatorial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>, which blazes forth in that notable article? Must we not suspect that exuberance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> which makes a Liberal party stand Catholic sponsors for generations unborn? For our part, we believe it equally impossible that men, whose course of reading and thinking had led them to embrace the political principles which have been enforced in the Spanish constitution, should approve the article in question, as that a nation, still bigoted to such doctrines, should be disposed to receive that constitution. It has been answered, we know, that the political part of the Spanish code was calculated to overturn the law concerning religion. But was it not to be feared that the reverse might happen? Or was it consistent with the wisdom of constitutional legislators to combine the most irreconcilable principles in the fundamental laws of the state? Had they been more temperate and yielding in their political views,\u2014had they not alarmed every Spanish prejudice by their plan of reform, they might have found their religious adversaries less on their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a>, and gained some ground on the side of toleration. But the Spanish constitution was like one of those treaties which wily politicians sign with a mutual hope that they contain the elements of destruction to the other contracting party. The Liberales, unable to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COPE\">cope</a> with religious prejudice, trusted to the operation of democratic principle; the bigots, cut off from their main body within the walls of Cadiz, clung to their monstrous privilege of keeping the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a> of every Spaniard in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONDAGE\">bondage</a>. The Liberales meant more than they dared to express\u2014the bigots gained all they wanted. Thus, while victory was apparently on the side of the former, the latter held, in the religious intolerance of the country, now raised into a constitutional law, the strongest pledge of a future and more permanent triumph. The events which followed the return of Ferdinand must convince every impartial judge, that the great mass of the Spaniards were not disposed to second the views of the Liberales; and that, if the constitution has, at a later period, had influence enough to arm one part of the kingdom in its defense, it owes this support to the injustice and misconduct of the Court <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACTION\">faction</a> after the restoration, and not to an original <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> on the part of the people.\n\nThe rapid series of misfortunes which had shaken the imperial throne of France to its foundations opened the way for the return of the captive Ferdinand to Madrid. His appearance on the frontiers would, a short time before, have been hailed by his subjects with general and sincere joy. But an absence of six years, employed by the friends of constitutional liberty in disseminating the principles of political reform, and fomenting a spirit of jealousy against the crown, had now created an active party, who dreaded the appearance of a monarch, born and bred a despot, among a people whose habits were those of implicit obedience. The arrival of the famous Palafox (who, since the taking of Zaragoza, had been a prisoner in France), bearing dispatches from the king to the regency, threw the constitutionalists into great consternation. Ferdinand announced to the regency that he had concluded a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a> with Napoleon, which, in his opinion, contained no condition that did not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCORD\">accord</a> with the honour, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>, and interests of the Spanish nation; as that country could not have obtained a more advantageous peace after a succession of victories.\" This implied acknowledgment of successive defeats, this readiness to conciliation with Napoleon, were strong indications of a mind habituated to feelings very different from those which had influenced the Spaniards during the eventful war against the French emperor. Such want of sympathy with those national feelings, which might have been supposed most flattering to any other man in Ferdinand's circumstances, gave little hope of his quiet submission to laws and principles which were plainly intended to reduce his power, and make him the first subject of the kingdom, instead of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> sovereign.\n\nThe Regency, composed of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARDINAL\">Cardinal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOURBON\">Bourbon</a> (a man, who, though related to the royal family, bore in the weakness of his mind the best security against ambition) and Agar and Ciscar, two naval officers of respectable abilities in their profession, whose only recommendation for that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POST\">post</a> seems to have been the absence of every qualification which might have given the slightest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> to their election\u2014this Regency beheld with alarm the danger which threatened the system from which they derived their power. The treaty was, of course, rejected, and the attention of the constitutional government anxiously fixed on the means of averting the blow which was already aimed at their authority.\n\nBy a decree of the Cortes, the king was suspended from the exercise of all power till he should take the oath which the new constitution prescribed; a route was made out for his journey from the frontiers to Madrid, and an escort directed to watch over him in his progress. The Cardinal, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">president</a> of the Regency, was to meet his royal relative on the road, under strict injunctions not to perform the usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a> of kissing the king's hand. General Copons, the military commander of Catalonia, was made the bearer of copies of the constitution, and of the decree which suspended the royal authority. These he was to deliver into the hands of Ferdinand on the frontiers of the kingdom.\n\nThe king entered the Spanish territory on the 24th of March 1814, and followed the route prescribed by the Cortes, till the vicinity of Zaragoza afforded him a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRETEXT\">pretext</a> for visiting that renowned scene of Spanish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRIOTISM\">patriotism</a>. He soon perceived a general indifference to the constitution among the lower classes; a jealousy of the new men who had risen into importance by means of the late changes; and a revival of those feelings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSIVE\">passive</a> loyalty which the unbounded power of the Spanish monarchs, during so many centuries, had blended with the national character. From Zaragoza, Ferdinand repaired to Valencia, a city well affected to the crown, where\nEl\u00edo, a royalist general, had the command of a considerable body of troops. Thither flocked many grandees and dignitaries of the church, anxious to inform the king of the favourable turn of public opinion in favour of an absolute monarchy. The cardinal, who, missing the king on the prescribed road, had been obliged to retrace his steps, arrived at Valencia, when a numerous train of royalists, ready to support their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>, would have placed a bolder and abler representative of the Cortes in difficulties from which it would be almost impossible for any one to extricate himself with credit. The weak prelate's attempt to follow the directions he had received, added <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUMILIATION\">humiliation</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of homage into which he was awed by the king's frown. His kissing hands, however, did not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> him from banishment and deprivation of the two sees of Toledo and Seville, which he held together with the pope's consent.\n\nThe progress which the constitutional principles had made was so slight, and the new political system had lately lost so much among people otherwise inclined to a reform in the state, that it was easy to foresee a revulsion of feeling in which the great mass, which had hitherto been nearly passive, would give the court party an irresistible preponderance. Ferdinand's advisers were sufficiently quick-sighted to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> the favourable moment. El\u00edo, in the name of his military division, presented a memorial to the king, in which he was entreated to govern in the manner of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>. A petition, signed by sixty-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> members of the sitting Cortes, reached the king, about this time, describing that body as a mere tool in the hands of a republican party, without freedom of debate, and acting under the control of a mob regularly hired to take possession of the galleries.\n\nA more favourable opportunity has seldom presented itself to any monarch for consolidating the privileges of his crown, while he promoted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> of his people, than that which the circumstances of Spain offered to Ferdinand at this moment. The feeble roots, which the new political principles had struck in the nation, were just kept alive by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOLLECTION\">recollection</a> of the ruinous follies of the preceding reign. The slightest security against the recurrence of similar excesses, granted by the throne to the people, would have deprived the Liberal party of the remnant of their influence. With his own party, the king was still absolute; and his will would have been obeyed without the least attempt at evasion or resistance. Ferdinand might have confirmed the abolition of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INQUISITION\">Inquisition</a>, and the existence of the Cortes. He might have established a Chamber of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PEERS\">Peers</a>, and raised the grandees, by that means, from a state of moral and intellectual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEGRADATION\">degradation</a>, which renders them worse than a useless burden to the state. A few reforms in the internal administration of the kingdom might, if proceeding from the crown, have enabled Spain to rise gradually, and without convulsions, from her former languor into a state of convalescence; during which, life and energy would, in due proportions, diffuse themselves through the whole body. But unfortunate Spain was doomed to suffer from the same cause, which, in our opinion, threatens Europe with a long series of bloody struggles between the people and their rulers. The popular leaders aimed at the possession of paramount power, while nothing but uncontrolled authority would satisfy the crown.\n\nOn the 4th of May 1814, a decree was solemnly promulgated, in which the Cortes were declared illegal, and all their laws consequently rescinded. The spirit of the worst times of the Spanish monarchy seemed to have dictated this first act of the restored Ferdinand\u2014that king for whom Spaniards of all classes, opinions, and denominations, had been lavish of their blood. Having thus announced his intention to wipe off the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of constitutional freedom, he set off for the capital, preceded by a division of El\u00edo's army, under the command of General Egu\u00eda. These troops found no resistance either on their way to Madrid, or upon entering that town. The people, on the contrary, seemed generally disposed to greet the approach of the absolute king. The Cortes, thus despised and neglected by the majority of the Spaniards, and internally cankered by the presence of a strong party, who had constantly aimed at the destruction of the system which they had sworn to support, were instantly dispersed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a>. The arrest of the two inferior regents, Aguir and Ciscar, and of the president and secretary of the Cortes, which took place on the nights of the 10th and 11th, seem to have been considered as preparatory steps to the reappearance of Ferdinand in the capital.\n\nThe news of these events had scarcely reached the chief towns in the provinces, when the mob, headed by their usual leaders, the priests, broke out into fierce demonstrations of joy, calling for the instant restoration of the Inquisition, and hastening to demolish the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAPIDARY\">lapidary</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-INSCRIPTIONS\">inscriptions</a>, which the Cortes, from the vanity of displaying their triumph over their opponents, had caused to be erected in every town and village. It is fortunate, indeed, that no bloody scenes followed this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REACTION\">reaction</a> of a long suppressed popular sentiment; though a desperate attempt was made at Corunna against the most active members of the Liberal party in that town, who had been previously committed to prison.\n\nHad Ferdinand and his advisers allowed their judgment to prevail over their resentment, they would have readily perceived that their future security was not consistent with the habits of insubordination which the Spanish mob was so rapidly acquiring; and that leniency and forgiveness were the most effectual means of thinning the ranks of their enemies. The court party, however, showed a fixed determination of allowing full sway to their revengeful spirit. The arrest of between thirty and forty deputies of the late Cortes, attended with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEIZURE\">seizure</a> of papers and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEQUESTRATION\">sequestration</a> of property, was decreed by the king, who appointed a commission of three judges, two of whom had been fellow-deputies of the prisoners, to collect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> against them. By another order, the members who had subscribed the above-mentioned petition for the repeal of the constitution, were invited to criminate the Liberal deputies for their conduct and opinions during the last session.\nIn the course of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSECUTION\">persecution</a> not one was spared who had, directly or indirectly, contributed to the establishment of the constitutional system. The number of state prisoners was increased in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of June, by the arrest of forty-five individuals, formerly members of the Cadiz Cortes, and literary men of eminent talents, who had assisted the popular government with their pen. The trial of the prisoners, if such a name can be given to judicial proceedings, which precluded all chance of acquittal, was conducted with more than Spanish dilatoriness. Three sets of judges were successively appointed and removed; till the king, impatient of further delays, ordered a list of the prisoners to be laid before him; and in a decree of the 15th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> 1815, each of the names (about seventy in number) appeared before the public, bearing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> which Ferdinand, in his own writing, had affixed to them. We shall give the following by way of specimens. Count Tor\u00e9no, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINA\">Mina</a>, and Florez de Estrada, who had evaded pursuit, and fled the country, were condemned to death. Arguelles, who may be considered the author of the constitution, was sentenced to eight years' exile at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CEUTA\">Ceuta</a>, on the coast of Africa. Canga Arguelles was confined to the fortress of Pe\u00f1\u00edscola, in Catalonia, for an equal period. The same length of confinement was assigned to Mart\u00ednez de la Rosa, and to Calatrava, two distinguished members of the Cortes. The four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ECCLESIASTICS\">ecclesiastics</a>, Villanueva, Mu\u00f1oz-Torero, Oliveros, and Cep\u00e9ro, were sentenced to six years' imprisonment in different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONVENTS\">convents</a>, and to the loss of their benefices. \u00c1lvarez-Guerra and Garc\u00eda-Herreros, who were ministers to the Regency on Ferdinand's return, and Generals Vald\u00e9s, O'Donoghue, and Villa-campa, who had evinced a firm attachment to the new system, were to be imprisoned for periods of eight, six, and four years. Quintans, one of the first ornaments of modern Spanish literature, who, probably from his great moderation, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of studious retirement, had never been elected a member of the Cortes, was sentenced to be imprisoned six years in the fortress of Pamplona. Strict orders were issued to deprive the prisoners of all communication, and not to be allowed pen and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INK\">ink</a>. The persons contained in the list, who had not escaped, were seized in the night of the 17th December, and subsequently removed to their destinations.\n\nIt was not more safe to be admitted to Ferdinand's confidence than to side with the enemies of his arbitrary power. Macan\u00e1z, his confidant, in France, was arrested, the same night, by the king in person. Esc\u00f3quiz, Ferdinand's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TUTOR\">tutor</a>, and one of his companions in exile, was, at this period, disgraced and removed to Zaragoza. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">Duke</a> of San Carlos, another of the king's adherents in his misfortunes, was dismissed from the ministry.\n\nThe court party having gratified their spite, wished now to secure the support of the clergy, whom the Liberals had offended. By a royal order of the 20th of May 1814, all purchasers of church property were compelled to restore it, without receiving compensation. The Inquisition was regularly re-installed, and urged to exert its powers against all persons suspected of Liberal opinions. A bull was obtained from the Pope for the restoration of the Jesuits in Spain. Monks and bigots were the sole directors of the king's conscience. Conceiving that the times when Spanish monarchs could trample down their subjects, without being disturbed by a single murmur, had returned, he publicly declared himself \"not accountable to any, except God and his confessor,\" and thus proclaimed his will to be the law.\n\nThe convulsions, however, which had agitated the kingdom, could not but have roused the dormant energy of such spirited people as the Spaniards. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a>, it is true, of the political doctrines which the Cortes had sanctioned; the disturbance which the new order of things had given to the national habits; the doubtful, or still unperceived advantages of the Liberal institutions; the jealousy which is always created by the sudden elevation of new men;\u2014such were the main sources of the dissatisfaction with the Cortes, which restored despotic power to the hands of Ferdinand. But a fresh disappointment awaited the fond hopes of the people. Ferdinand could not recall the languid repose of former days. The spell of custom, which bound the nation together, with the ties of mere form, and made the strength of millions shrink before the shadow of power, had been broken for ever. The court, besides, had found the treasury doubly drained, from the effects of former extravagance, and the demands of the late war. Bribery and venality were soon seen to prevail round the throne, to a greater extent than in the time of Godoy. The army, who had been hitherto amused with promises of regular pay and promotion, began to groan under want and neglect. Officers of high rank appeared about the streets in the night imploring the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CHARITY\">charity</a> of their fellow countrymen. The armed bands, or Guerrillas, who had assisted in the defeat of the French, having now nothing to expect from Ferdinand, and being unfit to resume habits of industrious labour, became regular and organized banditti. Melchor, the leader of a numerous band, infested the whole of Extremadura, for a considerable time, setting the helpless magistrates at defiance, and committing all sorts of atrocities.\n\nA government so unable to gratify the ambition of its adherents, and so incapable of affording protection to the people, could not employ restrictive measures without hastening its own destruction. In vain did the court party silence the press, or bribe it into their service. Facts, which crowded before the eyes of the public, and addressed themselves to their feelings, pleaded, daily, the cause of liberty, in the most powerful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>.\n\nMany of the Spanish officers, who were prisoners in France, had become Free-Masons in that country, and numerous lodges were established in Spain, during the occupation by Napoleon's armies. Masonry had at all times been held in the utmost abhorrence by the church and government, and both had employed their respective weapons to deter their subjects from its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MYSTERIES\">mysteries</a>. Finding now that the evil they dreaded had found its way into the country, nothing was left untried in order to check its progress. A fresh sentence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCOMMUNICATION\">excommunication</a> was\nobtained from the Pope against Free-Masons. The Inquisition traced out, in every province, the officers who had been initiated in France, as well as the members of the Spanish lodges. Fortunately, they were too numerous to be punished with all the rigour of the law. But the imprisonment of some, and the fears of all, were sufficient to prevent the Spanish Masons from acting collectively.\n\nIt was, however, about this time, we believe, that another kind of secret <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a>, exclusively political, were formed in Spain. The members assumed the name of Comuneros, to denote that they met in the spirit of Padilla and his followers, who, under the same appellation, rose against the encroaching despotism of Charles V.* An extensive correspondence was established between the associates in the different provinces, who, acting in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONCERT\">concert</a>, and according to a fixed plan, were ready to seize the first opportunity of restoring the constitution.\n\nThough we account it a signal misfortune that Spanish patriotism had not a less objectionable rallying point than the Code of the Cadiz Cortes, yet it is probable that, but for the existence of such a definite object for which to contend, the enemies of despotism would not have been able to combine their efforts. Men possessed of more talents than the purblind crew who surrounded the throne would have easily seen the necessity of setting up some rival Charter; anything in the shape of a Fundamental Law, which might divide the public opinion, and divert it from a constitution which had been conceived in a spirit of violent hostility to the crown. But Ferdinand's counsellors took the course which was most apt to raise the new code in the estimation of the country. As many copies as could be obtained at Madrid were heaped on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CART\">cart</a>, together with the journals of the Cortes. The guilty volumes were thus conducted, with ludicrous solemnity, to one of the public squares, and there committed to the flames by the hands of the hangman. This contemptible triumph was closed with a solemn Te Deum in the collegiate church of the capital.\n\nThe effect of prohibitions and autos da f\u00e9 against books is well known; it gives them reputation in all countries; how much more among a people whose eyes were just opening to a perception of the intellectual thraldom in which they had been kept by similar means,\u2014a country, where the notion that the merit of a work should be judged by the anathemas it lay under, was making a rapid progress?\n\nThe constitution of the Cortes, though ill suited to the institutions, habits, and feelings of the bulk of the Spanish nation, is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANUAL\">manual</a> of popular principles, which might, under any circumstances, bring constant accessions of strength to the Liberal party. A train of reasoning, however powerful, upon the rights of the people, would make but a slight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> in a country where close and industrious reading is scarcely known. But the effect of a small volume, containing the abstract principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEMOCRACY\">democracy</a> disguised under monarchical forms, and reduced to practical laws or simple declarations, would engage the attention of thousands; for the shallowest and most undisciplined mind will readily catch the notion of sovereignty inherent in the people; and, in proportion to the want of deep views on the complicated machinery of human society, will be the self-complacency of the young politician, who imagines he has obtained a clue to every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a> of government.\n\nThe effects of the new Constitution, considered as Progress of a political pamphlet, could only be checked by the dignified and judicious conduct of a court supported by the most respectable classes. But Ferdinand was surrounded by a medley of cowed courtiers, intriguing priests, and old placemen, all poor, and all ambitious. The king himself had much to ask for, and but little to give, save empty titles. The army, who had now learnt their irresistible weight in political changes, became dissatisfied and restless under a state of things which doomed them to neglect and poverty. The inferior gentry, of which a great portion depend on court favour for places, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a>, with dismay, that while the late reform had swept away many of the situations under government, such as remained were reserved for those only who had never wavered in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALLEGIANCE\">allegiance</a> to monarchical despotism. The young men, lastly, of the middle classes, who, during the existence of the Cortes, had had a taste of the agreeable excitement of a popular system, could not brook the death-like apathy which followed the restoration.\n\nThe malcontents, though numerous, and constantly augmenting, would have found it difficult to communicate with each other, to calculate their strength, and direct it with skill, if the secret societies had not created among them something like the union and activity which, in free <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, are the effects of a well-regulated party. In spite of the Inquisition and its emissaries, the Comuneros held meetings in most of the head towns, and kept up an active correspondence among their lodges. Cadiz, whose political temper has been described already, was, it seems, the head-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of the conspirators. They could not have fixed upon a more advantageous position; for, besides the opportunities which its numerous and changing garrison constantly afforded of tampering with the officers, some wealthy merchants of that place had devoted their fortunes to the restoration of liberty.\n\nCadiz and its neighbourhood had been made the General rendezvous of the troops which, under the command of General Morillo, were ordered by Ferdinand's government against the revolted provinces of South America.\u2020 It being now agreed among the Liberals that the intended revolution should be effected\n\n* Vide Robertson's Charles V.\n\n\u2020 The unyielding and illiberal spirit of the Cortes in regard to the Colonies was closely followed by the king's government on his resumption of absolute power. It is a curious circumstance that the Liberal party, who, by their obstinate refusal of the demands of the Colonies, urged them into open rebellion, should\nby the army, the presence of a strong military division reluctantly engaging in a dangerous service beyond the seas, must have greatly raised their hopes and increased their activity. Morillo's loyalty was tried, and he seemed for a time to waver between the obvious duties of his station and the suspicious call of revolutionary patriotism. It is said that the General was found, at first, ready to listen to the offers of the patriots; and if it be true that he subsequently thought it necessary to make a spontaneous confession before the Inquisition, he must have been present at some masonic meetings\u2014a crime from which, we believe, none but the members of that tribunal could give <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTION\">absolution</a> at that period. By what precautions of the patriots, or what subterfuge of Morillo (who, though shrinking from the proposed rebellion, might yet be unwilling to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> for ever with a determined and fast growing faction), the effects of such a recantation were not felt by the lodges, we are not told, and cannot conjecture. It is a fact, however, that Morillo embarked with his troops while the secret societies continued their labours unmolested.\n\nGalicia was one of the provinces to which the Cadiz patriots had extended their secret influence. Don Juan Diez Porlier, an officer who had distinguished himself against the French, was at this time confined, under suspicion of disaffection, to the Castle of San Ant\u00f3n, near Corunna. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> being impaired after a year's imprisonment, he obtained leave to proceed under an escort to a watering-place in the neighbourhood. The officer, to whom the prisoner was given in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a>, was a member of the secret societies, in correspondence with the head lodge at Cadiz. He soon put Porlier in possession of the plans for a military insurrection which were then under discussion among the patriots, and earnestly urged him to strike the first blow in the province of Galicia. Many officers in garrison at Corunna and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FERROL\">Ferrol</a> offered also their services to Porlier, who, miscalculating his means, and judging of public feeling from that which prevailed among his friends, was not long in accepting the dangerous command to which he was invited. Attended by the officer, whose duty it was to prevent his escape, and the twelve soldiers commanded by that officer, Porlier entered the city of Corunna, about midnight of the 18th September 1815, and was soon joined by most of the troops in that town. Supported by his associates, he arrested the governor and the principal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUPPORTERS\">supporters</a> of the Servile party. The imprisoned Liberals were set free, and such proclamations as are usual on these occasions were posted about the town. The oath to the constitution of 1812 was repeated, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DETACHMENT\">detachment</a> of 800 men was ordered to march on Ferrol, where the garrison, it was said, only awaited the presence of Porlier to declare in favour of the constitutional system. But the royalist party had been actively employed in that town since the arrival of the news from Corunna. Emissaries were sent to mix with Porlier's troops on their march. They found him with his detachment at the village of O'Ordenes, where the troops were to pass the night. The non-commissioned officers were soon gained over, and the men yielded to the first suggestion of making their peace with the king's government by the seizure of their leader. Porlier and some of his officers were at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUPPER\">supper</a> when the soldiers surrounded the house. The officers, it should seem, were able to escape; but the General, being obliged to surrender, was executed at Corunna, on the 3rd of October. Porlier met his fate with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> and composure of a man who feels conscious of the justice of his cause and the purity of his intentions. Had that unhappy officer possessed means to keep his ground till Cadiz, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARCELONA\">Barcelona</a>, Valencia, and Zaragoza, had declared themselves, the revolution would have been complete, as it happened at a subsequent period.\n\nOur limits do not permit us to mention the numerous conspiracies which were discovered and quelled in Catalonia after the death of Porlier. But we cannot omit a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIEF\">brief</a> account of the unfortunate attempt made by General Lacy in Catalonia, where, during the latter part of the war against France, he had commanded the Spanish army against the invaders. As a reward for his services, Lacy had been appointed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a>-General of Galicia; but being suspected by Ferdinand's government, he was removed to Catalonia, and confined within the limits of a certain district. In the spring of 1817, Lacy obtained leave to visit the mineral waters of Caldetes, near Barcelona. He there met with several discontented officers, with whom he planned an insurrection. It was expected that all the garrisons of Catalonia would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTINY\">mutiny</a> on the 5th of April, a day on which Lacy was to raise the standard of rebellion by the assistance of the regiment of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TARRAGONA\">Tarragona</a>, which was stationed at a short distance. Two companies had been gained over by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">lieutenant</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLONEL\">colonel</a>, when the whole plan was disclosed to the colonel by two subalterns in Lacy's confidence. The colonel appealed to the loyalty of the yet undebauched part of the regiment, and he was answered by a display of zeal in the royal cause. The two revolted companies joined Lacy, who, perceiving no other movements in his favour, began a march to Matar\u00f3, proposing to raise the peasantry, or to escape into France if he failed of support. The peasants appearing everywhere either\n\nhave virtually sanctioned the separation, by stopping the reinforcements which might have given a chance of success to the Spaniards. For an account of the war of independence in Spanish America, see the Articles New Granada, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEXICO\">Mexico</a>, and Buenos Ayres.\n\n* We relate this and similar facts on the authority of Mr Blaquiere's Historical Review of the Spanish Revolution, which we have followed in the narrative of that period. From our personal knowledge of Spain, we have considered ourselves entitled to use our own judgment in rejecting some circumstances which seem to have been admitted into that work from the author's honest but excessive confidence in some of his Spanish authorities.\nhostile or indifferent, the soldiers were disheartened, and fell off to a man. Lacy took shelter in a cottage; but was soon betrayed and taken. It was not deemed safe by the government to execute the sentence of death which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COURT_MARTIAL\">court-martial</a> pronounced against him, within the walls of Barcelona, where a strong feeling of compassion had shown itself towards the unfortunate Lacy. It was, therefore, reported that the king had commuted the sentence into that of imprisonment for life in the fortress of Majorca. Lacy's removal took place under that impression. He was cruelly undeceived, on his arrival, and desired to prepare for death within a few hours. Lacy was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a> in the ditch of the castle at five o'clock in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> of the 4th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> 1817.\n\nFrom the character of these attempts, and the temper manifested by the bulk of the people, a dispassionate observer will readily adopt the conclusion, that the endeavours of the patriots depended for success on some happy combination of circumstances, which, by once disconcerting the weak government of Ferdinand, and making him yield even for a moment, would give an impulse to that impassive mass who had hitherto beheld the contest unwilling to share its dangers. For it is clear, that a great majority of the nation, though determined not to make or modify a government for themselves, would readily submit to any political system which might happen to obtain the ascendancy. The chances were, therefore, in favour of the active party, who, though so often defeated, had still sufficient courage and perseverance to renew their attacks on a dull enemy, who adhered, from ignorance and weakness, to a plan of defensive warfare.\n\nIt was not long before the erroneous policy of the court of Madrid, in regard to the revolted colonies, presented to its enemies at home the means of reestablishing the constitution, and making their party paramount in the state. Instead of paying the arrears of the army, the only body of men which could effect a revolution, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a> obstinacy of Ferdinand and his advisers employed all the money they had been able to collect, in fitting up a second expedition, which was to reinforce the Royalists at Venezuela. The troops which were to embark in the autumn of 1819 had been collecting in Andalusia, then governed by Henry O'Donnell, Count of Abisbal, whose assistance in the restoration of arbitrary power had been rewarded with the military command of that province. The expeditionary army was, consequently, under his command till it should sail from Cadiz, and the various corps had been quartered at no great distance from that residence of the Captain-General.\n\nIt will be readily admitted, that a more favourable opportunity could hardly offer itself to the Patriots than the presence of a military division, whose officers were favourably inclined to their cause, and where a general dislike of the service, for which it was intended, was prevalent. The prospect appeared the more favourable as it was credibly reported, that O'Donnell, wishing to atone for the mischief he had done by an excess of loyalty, had volunteered to be the leader of the insurrection. The report was, indeed, well-founded. The Captain-General himself had fixed a day for proclaiming the constitution, and meetings had been held at his residence for the organization of a temporary government. Some offence, it seems, had been given him at one of these conferences, by the determination of separating the civil from the military command, when the revolutionary government should be established. He had continued, nevertheless, at the head of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSPIRACY\">conspiracy</a>, and even urged the necessity of anticipating discovery by striking the blow on the 8th, instead of the 15th of July. On the 7th, O'Donnell repaired to Port St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>'s, where all the infantry had been collected by his orders. Sarsfield, his second in command, was to join them, the next morning, in the plain of Palm\u00e1r, with the cavalry which was quartered at Xerez.\n\nSoon after sunrise, on the 8th, the infantry was drawn up in the place of their rendezvous. The officers who were in the secret could hardly refrain from breaking it to the troops under their command; yet waited with impatience the arrival of the cavalry, and the presence of their general. Both were at length seen at a distance, and approaching in opposite directions. O'Donnell, with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAFF\">staff</a>, and Sarsfield at the head of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>, came up at the same moment. But, instead of the expected signal, the cries of Viva el Rey, which were raised by the cavalry as they galloped along the line, were instantly re-echoed by the infantry. The deluded conspirators were immediately called in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> of the troops, and Abisbal himself gave the necessary orders for their removal under an escort, to some of the neighbouring fortresses.\n\nThe duplicity of Abisbal had rendered such an effectual service to the cause of despotism, and the repeated defeats of the Liberal party had so clearly shown the difficulty of giving an impulse to the lower classes in its favour, that it is quite surprising to find a complete revolution effected within a few months of the event we have related. But the court party were not stupid enough to mistake Abisbal's conduct for pure unalloyed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a> to the crown; nor yet sufficiently politic to secure his services to the king by such rewards as might satisfy his ambition, and make him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEAL\">seal</a>, by his subsequent conduct, the well-merited distrust and hatred to which he was exposed among the Patriots. He was removed from the command of the expeditionary troops, and a man scarcely known by his title of Count Calderon, and much less by any talents displayed in the service, appointed to succeed him.\n\nThe reappearance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a>-fever at Cadiz, soon after the imprisonment of the patriot officers at Palm\u00e1r, obliged the government to remove the troops to more healthy spots, at some distance. Arcos was made the head-quarters; the rest of the army was divided between Las Cabezas de San Juan, to the north of that town, and Alcal\u00e1 de los Gazules, in the opposite direction. This was considered a favourable opportunity for carrying into execution the same plan which had failed through the treachery of O'Donnell. The members of the secret societies, at Cadiz, engaged to procure the escape of the prisoners, one of whom, Quiroga, had been appointed to be the commander-in-chief of the revolt-\ned army. Riego was, in the meantime, to be placed at the head of the insurrection.\n\nThe 1st of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1820, being fixed upon, the soldiers were gradually gained over by means of the gold with which the officers were supplied from C\u00e1diz. On the morning of that day, Riego drew out the battalion of Asturias, of which he had a temporary command, and having proclaimed the constitution, began his march towards Arcos, where, by the assistance of part of the officers in that town, he intended to seize the general-in-chief. Quiroga, who, it was expected, would be at liberty, by that time, was to march with the forces stationed at Alcal\u00e1, to the Isla, and from thence to the gates of C\u00e1diz, which, if he could reach before the news of the insurrection, would be thrown open by some officers of the garrison, now enrolled in the bands of the insurgents. Riego, though arriving at Arcos much later than he had expected, effected the arrest of Calder\u00f3n, with scarcely any difficulty. Quiroga, being much longer detained in his march, could only take possession of La Isla. Riego advanced to Xerez, thence to Port St Mary's, and finally joined Quiroga. The strength of the patriots was about five thousand men, unsupported by either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTILLERY\">artillery</a> or cavalry.\n\nThe period which followed this junction is one which throws considerable light on the state of the public mind in Spain, and shows the difficulty, which we have pointed out already, of giving an impulse to the great mass; who, influenced by inveterate habits, will take no side in these political struggles.\n\nFive and twenty days had elapsed since the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROCLAMATION\">proclamation</a> of the constitution at Las Cabezas, without the revolution making any visible progress. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> warfare was carried on by the leaders at the Isla, and the authorities at C\u00e1diz; but the patriots were left to their own resources within a very limited spot, while troops were collecting about them, and the activity of the loyalists at C\u00e1diz precluded all hope of assistance from the revolutionists who were within the walls. To rouse the spirit of the country, and spread the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> of the insurrection, Riego proposed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a> column of 1500 men, in such direction as circumstances would allow. Followed by a division of the royalists, who seemed more determined to harass him than to fight, he successively proclaimed the constitution at Chiclana, Conil, Vejer, and Algeciras. Though ordered by Quiroga to march back to the Isla, Riego found it necessary to proceed in the only direction which the royalists had left him. In this situation, however, he spent three days at Vejer, in public balls and banquets, where officers and privates mixed indiscriminately with the town's people. From thence the flying column advanced to M\u00e1laga, closely pursued by the enemy. Meeting with no support from the inhabitants, Riego proceeded to Antequera. Harassed by incessant marches, and having sometimes to fight their way through detachments of the enemy's forces, Riego took the determination to push, with the remnant of his force, now reduced, by desertion, to about 300 men, into the fastnesses of Sierra Morena, where they eluded further pursuit by dispersion.\n\nThe patriots of the Isla had seen three long months elapse without any prospect of support from their countrymen, and trusting merely on the efforts of the secret societies, which had hitherto appeared unavailing. Mina had, however, entered the valley of Bastan, in Navarre, on the 25th of February. He had been, long before, obliged to fly into France in consequence of a fruitless attempt to overturn the government of Ferdinand, and now he hastened to lend his assistance to the patriots. He found a numerous band ready to follow his standard.\n\nThe garrison of Corunna, headed by Don Carlos Espinosa, a colonel of artillery, had risen, about the same time, against the Captain-General of Galicia, and proclaimed the constitution throughout the whole province. Similar movements took place on the first days of March at Zaragoza, Cartagena, Valencia, Murcia, and Granada.\n\nThese insurrections, though partial, could not but appal the weak, ignorant, and unpopular party, which surrounded the throne. Had Ferdinand been able to depend on the loyalty of an able general, he still would have found fidelity among the soldiers, and a great part of the officers. It was, however, an expiring feeling which, in the present circumstances of the country, a mere breath could extinguish. Should the general, to whom the command of a central army, which was to be formed in La Mancha, be inclined to betray his charge, the king himself would be obliged, by the constitutionalists of the capital, to save his life by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSUMPTION\">assumption</a> of their badge, and surrender, at once, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-DISCRETION\">discretion</a>.\n\nAbisbal was still at Madrid; and his late important service gave hopes that he would be faithful to the king, for whose sake he had sacrificed the honour he had pledged to the patriots. It was considered improbable that he would change a fourth time in his politics; and he was, accordingly, invested with the command of the army of La Mancha. But, before he quitted Madrid, on the 3d of March, he had plotted with the colonels and superior officers of the garrison, engaging to declare for the constitution as soon as he should reach Oca\u00f1a, where one of his brothers commanded a battalion of infantry. True to this last engagement, Abisbal proclaimed the constitutional system, the day after he had quitted the court. He established a communication with the patriots of La Isla, and left the final completion of the revolution to his reconciled friends, the liberals of Madrid.\n\nThe account of the military insurrection at Oca\u00f1a did not fail to produce the effect which had been prepared by the constitutionalists of the capital. An immense crowd surrounded the royal palace, who called on Ferdinand to accept the constitution. Things had now come to a point where there was no room for deliberation. The king appeared at the balcony holding a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> of the constitution in his hand, as a pledge of his readiness to swear observance to its laws. As, according to that code, the monarch cannot exercise his portion of authority till he has taken the oath therein prescribed, a committee of government was installed, who should convolve the Cortes, in whose presence alone the king can perform those acts which put him in full possession of his constitutional rights.\nWhatever may be the merits of the political system which the success of the Spanish Liberales restored,\u2014whatever the censure which competent and dispassionate judges may pass on the means which ensured their success,\u2014there is something so glorious in the first results of the change, that, for a moment at least, the heart must give itself up to mere feeling, and oblige reflection to shrink and be silent.\n\nThe instant dispersion of that abominable tribunal, the Inquisition, and the liberation of the state prisoners, whom Ferdinand allowed to linger in confinement, were acts which might ennoble a worse cause than that of the Spanish Liberals. They were performed without delay, and, as far as circumstances permitted, by the hands of the mob\u2014a dangerous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> indeed, which can never be employed without mischief; but which would lose much of its destructive character if it were only used, as the last resource, in the defence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>.\n\nAs it has been our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> so to perform this rapid sketch, as to put the reader in possession of such facts as may enable him to understand the principles and temper of the two great parties which contend for political power in Spain, we cannot omit the bloody and disgraceful scene which took place at Cadiz on the 10th of March, the day which had been appointed to proclaim the constitution.\n\nThe accounts from Madrid had dashed the hopes, with which the unfavourable circumstances of the constitutional troops of La Isla, had flattered the Andalusian royalists. Urged by a blind and ferocious spirit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a>\u2014perhaps encouraged by some dark hints from persons who could effectually screen them\u2014the partizans of absolute monarchy contrived a plot, of which the absurdity is hardly exceeded by its barbarity.\n\nThe Captain-General Freyre, on the receipt of dispatches announcing the King's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCEPTANCE\">acceptance</a> of the Constitution, repaired to Cadiz from Port St Mary's, in the afternoon of the 9th of March. The impatience of the triumphant party to have the Constitution proclaimed, scarcely allowed him to postpone that ceremony till the next morning. But a desire that the chiefs of the patriotic army, whom he had invited, should be present, was a sufficient reason to check the eagerness of the people. Quiroga, the patriot general, was, however, too well acquainted with the temper and dispositions of his enemies; to acquiesce in the demand that he should disband his troops, and allow the unarmed soldiers to mix with the citizens, at the ensuing solemnity. Four officers alone, preceded by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAG\">flag</a> of truce, were sent to witness the proclamation. Being admitted to the presence of the Captain-General, the evident uneasiness under which they perceived him labouring, and some expressions indicating a degree of anxiety for their safety, had just begun to raise their fears, when the report of musquetry, mixed with the cries of the suffering, or affrighted multitude, suddenly changed suspicion into the most appalling certainty. Freyre hastened out of the house, without providing for the safety of the deputies, who yet were so fortunate as to find the means of escaping the fury of their enemies.\n\nIn the mean time, the most atrocious massacre was taking place in the streets, and in the principal square of Cadiz, where the people had assembled to witness the proclamation. The instruments of this barbarous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEED\">deed</a> were the privates and non-commissioned officers of two battalions of infantry, called the Guides, and the Loyalists of Ferdinand the Seventh. Instigated, as it is believed, by the governor of the town, and the chiefs of the royalist party, the soldiers had engaged to disperse the multitude, and prevent the intended ceremony. Large quantities of wine and spirits had been sent to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARRACKS\">barracks</a>, so that the men were in a state bordering upon intoxication, when they broke out with their arms. From the moment these monsters were loosed, they continued firing, indiscriminately, upon the people, till their ammunition was exhausted. About five hundred persons, men, women, and children, were seen in the streets of Cadiz, dead, dying, or wounded, before the authorities of the place had taken any measure to stop the massacre. Some officers of the Andalusian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITIA\">militia</a>, not on duty, ran, of their own accord, to their barracks, and, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> up in great haste, part of the men sallied forth into the streets, where they exercised themselves, with the utmost zeal, in protecting the lives of the defenceless citizens, and giving help to the wounded. The author of this article feels the greater satisfaction in recording this act of courage and humanity, as he believes it passed unnoticed, probably because the Andalusian militia had, to the last, remained in the royalist army. He received, at the time, an account of the whole transaction from an eye-witness of unimpeachable veracity. In the evening of the same day, the soldiers who had been employed in the massacre, were marched out of Cadiz. The deputies from the patriotic army, coming forward from their places of concealment, surrendered themselves into the hands of the Captain-General, who, still hoping some favourable turn in the affairs of the royalists, confined them within the Castle of Saint Sebastian. Indeed, so blindly confident were the leaders of that party that the insurrection would yet be quelled, as to have ventured on giving public thanks to the assassins. But the next dispatches from Madrid put an end to their hopes. The deputies were set at liberty. Both Freyre, the Captain-General, and Campana, the governor of Cadiz, were arrested, to take their trial. That trial was, however, delayed till public indignation died away; and we have not heard of any punishment inflicted on the criminals.\n\nThe Constitutional System being now completely restored, and in action, the Cortes assembled at Madrid in June 1820, and the King took his solemn oath, before them, on the 9th of the following month.\n\nWe might here conclude this article, leaving the task of describing the events of this new era to those who, free from the mists which always envelope and distort the passing transactions of political revolutions, would be able to record them without the danger of being misled by their own prejudices, or the misrepresentations of parties. But we feel that we should not do justice to our readers, did we con-\nclude without attempting a brief sketch of the character and temper of the Government of the Cortes, their chief aims in the reform of the country, and the obstacles which have hitherto opposed their system.\n\nThe Cortes Extraordinary, which were convened on the restoration of the constitution, contained most of the patriots who had suffered during the arbitrary reign of Ferdinand\u2014the original contrivers and supporters of the constitution. This was a measure which the military reformers of the Isla could not, and, probably, were not disposed, at that time, to oppose. But the seeds of jealousy between the two parties, the contending claims of the liberators, and those they had set free, could not remain dormant and inactive. The Isla Patriots naturally aspired to the first places and influence in the state: the Old Liberals soon felt their own dependence and inferiority. The Secret Societies were now more active than ever, and a rivalry between the Free-Masons and the Comuneros grew out of the different principles adopted by each of these parties, who, in their character and views, might be compared to the Old Whigs and the Radical Reformers in England. The Free-Masons, however, soon found themselves defeated; and those who had been forced upon Ferdinand, as his Ministers, were displaced to make room for the friends of the Revolutionary army.\n\nThe Cortes, though elected under the influence of the triumphant party, and acting under the direction of the popular leaders and their emissaries, who were regularly stationed in the galleries of the House, exhibited a degree of moderation which does honour to the national character. The measures of retaliation were limited, and infinitely less severe than those in which the king's friends had indulged. Even the most violent democrats, those who had placed themselves at the head of the populace, were satisfied, for a time, with the awe into which the Revolution had thrown their opponents. But the numerous conspiracies, subsequently discovered, increasing the fears of the new patriots, a deed of horror was perpetrated at Madrid, on the person of a dignified <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a>, which, from the perfect indifference shown, upon the occasion, by the existing authorities, we strongly suspect to have been planned by the secret societies. It was indeed evident, since that period, that nothing was done but through their influence in Spain.\n\nFew of these atrocities were needed in that country to paralyze into perfect passiveness a great part of the population, especially among the middle and higher classes, and to revive those habits of silent submission to \"the powers that be,\" which a tyranny of ages had confirmed. Had it been in the power of the new government to establish themselves without encroaching upon the rights of the church, and, thereby, confirming the suspicions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFIDELITY\">infidelity</a>, under which all denominations of Liberals have long lain among the Spaniards, the resistance to the new order of things would have been limited, at least for a time, to a very inconsiderable and powerless minority of the nation. But, unfortunately for the interests of freedom in Spain, the old political system is too intimately blended with the strongest religious prejudices of the country.\n\nTo steer clear of this rock exceeded the powers of human wisdom. The Cortes Extraordinary, as well as the Ordinary, which succeeded them, contained a large proportion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a>, though scarcely any of the rank and property, of the country. Most of the clergymen, and perhaps all the lawyers, who had obtained seats, belonged to that class of Spaniards, who, free from religious prejudices, but having no system of their own to support upon these points, would shrink from an open contest with the zealots, without, however, letting pass any opportunity of showing their spite, by a side-blow. The pecuniary wants of the government; the desire of gaining partizans to the constitutional system by the transfer of property, exclusively under its sanction; together with the opportunity which the existing circumstances presented, of indulging the secret, though strong, feelings of aversion to the national system of religion, which rankle in the bosom of every liberal Spaniard, betrayed the Cortes into measures which could not fail to drive the bigots into an open and desperate resistance. One of the first steps against the religious orders was the suppression of those properly called Monks,\u2014such as lived under the Ascetic institutions which preceded the establishment of the mendicant orders in the thirteenth century. As their houses were wealthy, this measure might be suspected to proceed rather from a wish to increase the resources of the government, than from ill will to the establishments themselves, which, besides, had long ceased to be objects of veneration for the mass of the people. But when, in the pure desire of removing the most odious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NUISANCE\">nuisance</a> to which the religion of the country has given birth, the Cortes decreed the abolition of the privileges hitherto enjoyed by the heads of the mendicant orders;\u2014when they limited the number of convents, and subjected the individuals resident in each to a local superior, under the jurisdiction of the diocesan;\u2014when impediments were thrown in the way of taking religious vows, and the admission into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SECULAR\">secular</a> clergy, of such as were willing to throw off the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COWL\">cowl</a>, was encouraged;\u2014when even the helpless victims of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NUNS\">nuns</a>, were protected by the civil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a>, in case they evinced a desire to break the perpetual imprisonment of the cloister;\u2014the alarm of the bigots was turned into downright frenzy, and even the court of Rome, conscious as it is of its weakness, thought it necessary to resent the insult.\n\nA step, much more questionable both as to its policy and justice, was taken by the Cortes against the church interest, in the abolition of one half of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITHES\">tithes</a>. Had they appropriated this portion of the church property to the use of the State, the spoliation might have been excused upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLEA\">plea</a> of necessity. But the Cortes well knew that the farmers, once freed from the religious feeling which enforces the payment of tithes, would find means to defraud the civil authorities of nearly all the sequestrated portion. The measure was, therefore, simply directed to the acquisition of friends to the new order of things.\n\nWe mention these detached specimens of the policy of the Cortes, not so much for the sake of their intrinsic importance, as in order to show the temper of the Liberal party, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTRAST\">contrast</a> it with that of their opponents. And here we cannot help lamenting that want of space compels us to omit the details\ncontained in the Reports of the Ministers, presented to the Spanish legislature in 1821 and 1822, as to the nature and extent of the resistance offered to the present system by one part of the nation. Cautious as they are in their language, and desirous to make light of the influence and resources of their adversaries, one great and important fact is clearly established from their evidence\u2014a fact which has always forced itself upon our conviction, and which, from the knowledge we have of the country, appears to us in the shape of an almost insuperable obstacle to a speedy triumph of freedom in Spain\u2014namely, that the present is a purely religious contest, in which one party engages with all the sincerity and straightforwardness of zeal, while the other has to defend itself under the disadvantages of unavowed principles, and disguised views.\n\nThe Minister of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRACE\">Grace</a> and Justice begins his Report of the 1st March 1822, by declaring that \"the evils arising from the existing circumstances of the clergy are of the greatest magnitude.\" He then proceeds to state the questions that had been agitated between the two courts of Rome and Madrid, giving a long detail of the theological and canonical arguments with which the Pope's objections had been met. Of these points some were yielded to the Spaniards, some absolutely insisted upon. But the most resolute opposition had been made against a decree of the Cortes, prohibiting the remittance of Spanish funds for bulls and dispensations. And here we beg our readers to observe the circumstances of the whole transaction, as highly illustrative of the moral and intellectual relations in which the mass of the Spaniards stand, with the small party who have seized the reins of Government. When the Spanish Minister at Rome communicated this decree to the Papal authorities, he found that two thousand five hundred and forty-one bulls had been stopped for want of payment. Alarmed at the consequences of this spiritual embargo, the Spanish government paid the whole amount of the fees. But the sum had scarcely been laid down when the mail brought fifteen hundred petitions for bulls of the same private nature. Baffled by the irresistible power of religious prejudice, the Spanish Ministers were under the necessity of engaging for the payment of all bulls relating to Spain, until they should be able to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLINESS\">Holiness</a> for an annual sum. The account of this transaction concludes with the following observation of the Minister: \"We shall thus be able to stop the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRABAND\">contraband</a> in bulls which has been set on foot already, and which is likely to increase the contributions to Rome to a much greater extent than before, as the parties concerned, finding the regular channels obstructed by government, have had recourse to others which, from their private and confidential nature, will require greater sacrifices on the part of the petitioners.\" We cannot dismiss this topic without observing, that one of the most certain and abundant sources of revenue arises, in Spain, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a> of an annual bull, called the Bull of the Crusade, which the government (even the liberal government) buy of the Pope, and retail to the people. The Report of the Minister of Finance for the same year observes, that by the Cortes having placed the produce of this pious sale in the hands of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCIAL\">provincial</a> treasurers, it had diminished from 1,500,000 of reals a month, to about 538,360 of the same money. The re-establishment of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSARY\">Commissary</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CRUSADES\">Crusades</a>, a dignified ecclesiastic, into his former authority, had, however, increased the sale to 1,073,674 reals a month.\n\nWhatever might be the caution and timidity of the middle classes of Spain, especially those that are possessed of some wealth, or exercise any lucrative branch of industry, it was impossible that the more violent and daring of the sincere Catholics should remain perfectly inactive under a state of things so discordant with the truly national sentiments and habits. The rabble of the large towns, which is numerous, and quite worthy of that name, had, since the revolution of 1820, been gained over to the constitutionalists; but the peasantry, who, to this day, have shown a general dislike of the new system, would afford a considerable number of active and determined partizans to any who should be ready and able to marshal them under the standard of the Faith,\u2014a word by which the Spaniards denote the Catholic religion, such as it was established in their country. Few months, indeed, had elapsed, when conspiracies were detected in various parts of the country; and Guerilla parties, in support of Religion and the King, were found ranging over the provinces. The seeds of a civil war had thus been brought into activity, and in the opinion of all who are well acquainted with the dilatoriness and obstinacy of the Spaniards, the character and circumstances of the contending parties were, alone, enough to threaten the destruction of every source of power, wealth, and happiness, in that devoted kingdom.\n\nIt was not long, however, before a determination was observed, on the part of France, to encourage and support the Spaniards, who were actually in arms, or ready to take them up, against the new system of government. Emigrants were protected on the French side of the frontiers, and enabled to organize themselves into military divisions. The yellow-fever, which attacked Catalonia, in the summer of 1822, afforded a pretext for establishing a Cordon Sanitaire, which might act as an army of observation. French money was employed in raising fresh disturbances in the kingdom; and, it is more than probable, French influence fomented the conspiracy of the Guards, which, on the 7th July of the same year, would have placed the King out of the hands of the Cortes if he had had either the will or the courage to join the troops, who awaited his presence at a short distance from the palace.\n\nA <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONGRESS\">congress</a> of the powers which compose what is known by the name of the Holy Alliance, was, at this time, about to be assembled at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERONA\">Verona</a>. From the character of the governments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUSTRIA\">Austria</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUSSIA\">Prussia</a>, and Russia, and their habitual fears of the spirit of political reform, which for the last thirty years has shaken the foundations of all absolute monarchies, it could hardly be imagined that Spain should pass unnoticed at this meeting. Nor was it long before the disclosure of their views and principles, joined to the open avowal of hostile intentions against Spain, on the part of France, evinced a settled and systematic plan for restoring absolute mo-","sp":558,"ep":582},{"h":"SPONGES ARE COMPOSED OF HORNY FIBRES CONNECTED TOGETHER BY","t":"s are composed of horny fibres connected together by means of an animal jelly, but hitherto <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> distinct polypi have been detected in them. They occur in a fossil state, and are abundant in the flint of the chalk formation, and in the chalk itself.\n\nII. Fossil Remains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTS\">Plants</a>.\n\nCasts and Impressions of Trees and Ferns.\n\nVegetable remains occur in great abundance, and in considerable variety, in different formations, particularly in the coal formation. In some coal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> they appear well preserved, and thus afford many facilities for the determination of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a>; whilst in others they are so much changed, as to render it nearly impossible to make out the classes and orders to which they belong. In Plates CVII.-CVIII., we have given representations of several casts and impressions of the fossil vegetables met with in our coal fields, partly from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> drawings, partly from the plates of Sternberg.\n\n1. Lepidodendron.\u2014Stem squamosus, the scales in perfect specimens, with attached leaves, which are arranged in a spiral manner around the stem. Specimens of four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> are represented by fig. 1, 2, 3, Plate CVII., and fig. 7, Plate CVIII., and all of them from the coal formation of the river district of the Forth. Mr Allan, in the Transactions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, has given a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of a Lepidodendron, with several circular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a>.\n\n2. Variolaria.\u2014Stem scutellar, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> verrucose, and the centre of the scuta affording a point of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to leaves. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> bears some resemblance to arborescent Euphorbia, and to some Cacti. In Plate CVIII., fig. 8, is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> of the Variolaria ficoides, with attached leaves. Fig. 4, Plate CVII., is another specimen without leaves, and both from our neighbouring coal fields.\n\n3. Calamites, so named from their general resemblance to the calamites of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>. One species is represented by fig. 5, Plate CVII. Fig. 9, Plate CVIII., is another figure of the same genus, but probably a different species.\n\n4. Syringodendron.\u2014Of this tribe, one species is figured, fig. 6, Plate CVII.\n\n5. Rhytidolepis\u2014Is so named on account of the thick wrinkles with which the back is marked. In coal formation, England. Fig. 7, Plate CVII.\n\n6. Flabellaria.\u2014A tribe which resembles the palms, fig. 8, Plate CVII., F. borassifolia, from the coal formation near Burntisland.\n\n7. Noeggerathia.\u2014Fig. 3, Plate CVIII. A representation of one of the species of this fossil genus.\n\n8. Rotularia.\u2014So named from its resemblance in form to a wheel. Appears to be a cryptogamous plant, probably peculiar to marshy places or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> and forms a particular genus. Fig. 6, Plate CVIII., is one of the species from the coal formation.\n\n9. Schlotheimia.\u2014Stem jointed, contracted at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a>, leaves verticillated. Fig. 1, Plate CVIII., S. tenuifolia; leaves sessile, awl-shaped, and rigid. Is the hipparris of some authors. From the coal formation near Burntisland.\n\n10. Annularia.\u2014Leaves disposed in a verticillate manner, and inserted in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a> which surrounds the stem. Fig. 2, Plate CVIII., is A. spinulosa from the coal formation.\n\n11. Osmunda gigantea.\u2014Fig. 5, Plate CVIII. Occurs in the bituminous shale of the coal formation near Burntisland. The species figured differs from any of the recent species. It is indeed very difficult, in general, to form an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> as to the ferns found in rocks; for the leaves of ferns of the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a>, even of different genera, are so alike, that they are easily confounded, when we have not an opportunity of examining their seeds, and particularly when we do not attend to the nicer distinctions known to the experienced botanist. How, then, can we determine in a satisfactory manner the impressions in rocks where the seeds are so rarely visible, and the parts so often altered? Smith, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">Brown</a>, Link, and other eminent botanists, on examining these impressions in slate clay and bituminous shale, thought some resembled a Pteris, another a Dicksonia, others Polypodium, Adiantum, Osmunda; and in all these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, the individuals they most resembled were natives of tropical climates,\u2014but not a single instance occurred of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> of any known and recent species.*\n\n2. Leaves of Plants.\n\nImpressions of leaves occur in rocks of different descriptions. Fig. 4, Plate CVIII., is the representation of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a> of a tree, intermediate between a Platanus and Lyriodendrum. Some impressions resemble Spirea, others the Tilia Europea, Betula alnus, Betula fruticosa, Salix caprea, Acer pseudo-platanus, Populus nigra, Acer campestre, Rhamnus frangula, Salix myrsinites. These impressions are found in some of the rocks of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> formation. Leaves are also sometimes found in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMBER\">amber</a>, and some are of opinion that these belong to the Aloexylon agallachum, and the amber itself is conjectured to be an exudation from that tree.\n\n3. Impressions of Flowers.\n\nBeautiful specimens of aster-like flowers are sometimes met with in a lepidodrendous tree in the coal formation near to Edinburgh; and one of these, as already mentioned, has been figured in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.\n\nSchlotheim describes the impressions of a flower\n\n* Schlotheim has lately published descriptions and figures of impressions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> plants, fuci, found in a coal formation connected with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">limestone</a> which rests upon the new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> sandstone formation. Similar impressions occur in the coal field near Burntisland.\nof a ranunculus from a metalliferous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a> near Frankenberg in Hessa; also impressions of an aquatic Ranunculus or Trollius in the limestone of Oeningen. In Blumenbach's Spec. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">Arch</a>. Tellur., and in Karg's Essays, there are observations on this subject.\n\n4. Fossil Seeds and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">Fruits</a>.\n\nFossil seeds and fruits of plants occur in different formations, but usually in such a state as renders it nearly impossible to determine the tribes to which they belong. Faujas St Fond found fossil fruits in the brown coal of Liblar, which, he said, bore a strong resemblance to areca nuts; an opinion in which he was not supported by the after examinations of Jussieu, Desfontaines, Lamarck, and Thouin. They probably belong to some palm. The fossil seeds that occur in bituminous wood, in which amber also is found, cannot be referred to any known plants. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">Island</a> of Sheppey there are accumulations of seeds, some of which are like those of the palm, others the chestnut, cocoa, but none identical with any of these.\n\n5. Plants in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-CALCEDONY\">Calcedony</a>, Siliceous Sinter, and Calc-Tuff.\n\nThe early observations of Daubenton, and the later ingenious investigations of Dr Macculloch, seem to prove the existence of various cryptogamic plants in calcedony, particularly in that variety named mocha <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>. The included vegetables are referred to the tribes Jungermannia and Hypnum of botanists. The siliceous sinter of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ICELAND\">Iceland</a>, sometimes confounded with calcedony, we find also to contain occasionally plants of different descriptions. Calc-tuff, in some districts, as at Burgtonna, contains well preserved specimens of the Chara vulgaris, and Ch. hispida. Conifers have also been found in a preserved state in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a> calc-tuff. Some of the gyrogonites of Lamarck, found in calc-tuff, are certainly seeds of the chara tribe.\n\n6. Petrified Woods.\n\nTrunks, branches, and roots of trees occur in rocks of different kinds, or even loose, more or less impregnated or petrified with mineral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>. The structure and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> form are sometimes well preserved, and in other cases both are nearly obliterated. Some of these, belonging to the palm tribe, are therefore monocotyledonous; others, and the greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, present concentric rings and other internal arrangements which characterise dicotyledonous trees. Hitherto no accurate descriptions have been published of the internal structure of these petrifications, and consequently the names given to them are not to be depended on. Thus it is said that oak, birch, pine, box, elm, willow, hazel, ash, occur petrified in the form of wood-stone and wood-opal; but our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> does not go to confirm these determinations.\n\nII.\u2014STATE OR CONDITION OF FOSSIL ORGANIC REMAINS.\n\nFossil organic remains occur either unchanged, or more or less altered from their original state or condition, by the removal of some of their constituent parts, their bituminisation, or owing to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-IMPREGNATION\">impregnation</a> with various mineral substances. Shells, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>, vegetables, of various descriptions, in some alluvial soils, are scarcely at all altered, and remains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRUPEDS\">quadrupeds</a> have been found well preserved in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ICE\">ice</a> in polar countries; and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEAT\">peat</a>-mosses, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> bodies remain uncorrupted for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of years. Shells are sometimes found in a nearly unaltered state in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> rocks, as limestone. The beautiful fire marble of Carinthia contains unaltered shells of ammonite, with their pearly lustre, and rich tints of the most beautiful colours. Shells and bones occur in other alluvial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRATA\">strata</a>, more or less bleached, being dry and fragile, owing to the removal of a portion of their animal matter. In fossil fishes, sometimes not only the bones, but also the soft parts, and even the scales, occur more or less perfectly preserved. Fossil vegetables occur, either nearly unaltered, or more or less bituminised or carbonised, in alluvial strata, also in the brown-coal formation, and in some sandstones. In other cases, the animals or vegetables have disappeared, and only their casts, or impressions, remain to attest their former presence. This change is more frequent with vegetables than animals. In particular situations, the organic body, whether plant or animal, is simply coated, or incrustated, with the mineral matter, and but slightly impregnated with it. The incrusting matter is most frequently calc-tuff and calc-sinter, less frequently volcanic tuff. But the most durable state of fossil organic remains is the petrified, when they are more or less completely impregnated with mineral matter.\n\nI. PETRIFIED VEGETABLES.\n\nWood Petrified with Hornstone.\u2014Trunks, branches, and roots of trees and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHRUBS\">shrubs</a> are sometimes impregnated with hornstone, forming what is called wood-stone, or ligneous hornstone, and this is one of the most frequent of the petrified woods. The wood appears, in some cases, to have been in a rotten state when petrified, and such varieties appear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> coloured and shivery; in other cases, it appears first to have been bituminised, so that it is both bituminous and siliceous together, in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> it is of a dark brown or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, and of a more compact texture. In our Cabinet, we have several specimens to show the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of siliceous matter and bituminous wood in its different stages of bituminisation. Lastly, in other cases, the wood appears to have undergone no change, and then, the wood, or at least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the ligneous matter, remains in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PETRIFICATION\">petrification</a>, while, in others, the whole has disappeared, leaving nothing but its form behind. It is probable, however, that many wood-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, in collections, are not real petrifications, but portions of trees in which a great secretion of silica has taken <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSEUM\">Museum</a> of the University of Edinburgh, there is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of wood-stone, said to have been obtained from the centre of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a> of a teak tree, which may be viewed as a portion of the wood highly im-\nOrganic Remains\n\n2. Calcedonic Wood and Jasper Wood.\u2014In some cases the wood is petrified with calcedony, and in others with jasper; the first has usually a yellowish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> colour, and resembles decayed wood, while the latter exhibits great variety of colours. In some rare varieties of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HELIOTROPE\">Heliotrope</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FIBROUS\">fibrous</a> and probably vegetable structure occurs.\n\n3. Opaline Wood.\u2014Wood, when impregnated with opal, forms the most beautiful variety of petrified wood. It is distinguished from the others by resinous lustre, conchoidal fracture, inferior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a>, and lower specific gravity. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUNGARY\">Hungary</a> is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> of this beautiful fossil remain.\n\n4. Calcareous Wood.\u2014Wood is sometimes more or less completely petrified with carbonate of lime, in the form of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CALCAREOUS_SPAR\">calcareous <a c</a>lass=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAR\">spar</a> or of limestone. In some cases the wood appears to have been bituminous before petrifaction, in others rotten, and in some not altered. It occurs in alluvial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> and in various limestones in different parts of England.\n\n5. Aluminous Wood.\u2014Some woods are petrified with aluminous matter, but generally along with it there is a considerable intermixture of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> pyrites.\n\n6. Wood petrified with Iron Pyrites.\u2014Fossil wood of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> soon decays on exposure to the influence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>. Seeds are sometimes in this state, as is the case in the Island of Sheppey.\n\n7. Wood and other Parts of Trees and Plants petrified with Carbonate and Hydrocarbonate of Iron.\u2014Wood and fossil vegetables in this state are not of rare occurrence, and are the most indestructible of the woods impregnated with ores.\n\n8. Wood impregnated with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COPPER\">Copper</a> Pyrites.\u2014This variety of mineralized wood generally contains, besides pyrites, blue and green malachite, which stains it with their beautiful colours.\n\n9. Wood impregnated with Galena or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">Lead</a>-Glance.\u2014Some specimens of this description occur in old mines, thus proving the comparative newness of their formation, while others of a more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a> occur in brown coal.\n\n2. Petrified Animal Remains.\n\nThe remains of quadrupeds, birds, and amphibious animals are seldom impregnated with mineral matter, and when this takes place, it is generally their harder parts which are petrified. The horns of deer are sometimes impregnated with clay iron ore, and bones of quadrupeds occur penetrated with lead-glance and iron pyrites, and have superimposed crystals of the same minerals. The fossil fishes in the bituminous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARL\">marl</a> slate of Thuringia are often entirely bituminised, and, according to Werner, the bituminous impregnation of the slate is derived from these fishes. Sometimes the fishes in the marl slate are also impregnated with copper pyrites, and also with lead-glance and iron pyrites. Crustaceous animals are petrified with calcareous spar, or with iron pyrites. The Echini, or Sea Urchins, are petrified with calcareous spar, with flint, and seldom with iron pyrites. The various tribes of shells and corals are often petrified with calcareous spar, less frequently with clay iron ore, and rarely with flint or calcedony, and with sulphur. And lastly, the Alcyonia and Sponges, the lowest of the animal world met with in a fossil state, are usually penetrated or impregnated with flint.\n\nIII.\u2014GEOGNOSTICAL SITUATIONS OF FOSSIL ORGANIC REMAINS.\n\nWhen fossil organic remains first engaged the particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of naturalists, it was believed that they were irregularly distributed throughout the different formations of which the crust of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> is composed, and that the whole had been deposited from the waters of the Deluge. It was soon, however, ascertained, that some rock formations never contain petrifications; a fact which gave rise to the opinion, that fossil organic remains were confined to one set of rocks, the secondary, in which they were jumbled together in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> manner, while they were entirely wanting in the formations of the primitive class. The more accurate investigations of geologists, particularly those of the geognostical school of Werner, not only proved the insufficiency of former views, but gave a new and interesting character to the whole subject. It was shown by these inquiries, 1. That petrifications, or fossil organic remains, do not occur in primitive rocks, but first appear in rocks of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, or Transition class. 2. That these organic remains are, in general, more altered, or mineralised, in the older than in the newer formations; so that they appear much changed in transition rocks, and scarcely at all altered in the rocks of the newest, or alluvial class. 3. That these remains are so arranged in the bowels of the earth, that those of the more simple animals and plants appear first, or in the oldest rocks; that in rocks of a middle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, the remains are of animals higher in the zoological and botanical scales; and that in the newest rocks, the fossil organic remains are of the more perfect animals, even reaching to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>.\u2020 4. That the fossil organic remains in transition, secondary, and diluvial formations, are in general different from those of the present creation; but that, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POST\">post</a>-diluvial formations, the remains are of recent species of animals and vegetables. 5. And lastly, that although these fossil animals and plants, in general, differ from those of the present world, we observe\n\n* Workmen remark that mahogany, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> tree, and other woods, are sometimes harder than usual; and also, that they occasionally contain grains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>. The hardness may be partly owing to secreted silica, and the sand would appear to be silica, secreted by the powers of the plant, therefore resembling that in the teak wood, the rush, and the bamboo.\n\n\u2020 The terrestrial rock formations, or those which have been formed on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, are still so imperfectly known, that, in some cases, it is not easy to determine their age in relation to those which have originated under the water of the ocean.\nthat they approach nearer and nearer, in appearance, to those of the recent tribes the newer the formation in which they are contained; so that, as already mentioned, in the newest formations there is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> identity of character, proving that the fossil species are the same as those of the present creation. A full statement of all the facts on this very interesting subject would extend this article much beyond the limits prescribed; and, therefore, we must rest satisfied with the following account of the distribution of petrifications as they occur in different rock formations, particularly as observed in Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>.\n\nPrimitive rocks, as already mentioned, contain no organic remains, and, therefore, are supposed to have been formed before animals and vegetables were called into existence. They first appear in the rocks of the second great class or the Transition.\n\nI. Fossil Organic Remains in Transition Rocks.\n\nThe rocks of this class which afford organic remains are limestone, greywacke, and clay slate; but of these limestone is that which affords the greatest number and variety. All the remains, nearly, are of animals, and of tribes occupying a comparatively low <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> in the zoological scale; none of them ranging higher than the class <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOLLUSCA\">Mollusca</a>; and most of the species, and some of the genera, occur only in the transition series, disappearing entirely in the rocks of the succeeding formations.\n\nThe following tribes of corals are met with, and generally in the limestone, Caryophylla, Tubipora, Favosites, Astrea, Madrepora, and Styliina. The last mentioned genus is, with the exception of one recent species found in the South Sea, entirely fossil, and confined to the transition class. This is one of many instances, of the occurrence of fossil animals along with those of the earliest creation, no traces of which have been seen in any of the subsequent formations, but which are now found in a living state in the seas of the opposite hemisphere. No fossil Echini, or Asteriae, occur in the rocks of this class, but several tribes of the nearly allied <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> Crinoidea are met with, such as the Cyathocrinites from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHROPSHIRE\">Shropshire</a>; Platocrinites in limestone, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUDLEY\">Dudley</a>; and Rhodocrinites, also at Dudley. The Trilobite tribe, so nearly allied to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CRUSTACEA\">Crustacea</a>, occurs abundantly in the rocks of this class, but principally in the limestone. When the crustacea begin to appear in the newer formations, the trilobites have disappeared, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> not altogether, at least almost so. Fossil shells occur in greater numbers and variety than is generally imagined. Of these the multilocular univalves are the most characteristic in a geognostical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, and the following are the genera met with, viz. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMMONITES\">Ammonites</a>, Orthoceratites, Nautilites, and Conularia. Unilocular univalves are Euomphalus, Heliocites, Patellites, Buccinates, and Bucardites. Bivalves are Anomites, Terebratalites, and Pentamerus. The vegetable remains are of rare occurrence, and their peculiar characters have not been determined. The corals, or-Organic Re-thoceratites, and trilobites are the most characteristic petrifications of this class.\n\nII. Fossil Organic Remains in Secondary Rocks.\n\n1. First Sandstone, or Old Red Sandstone.\n\nOccasionally, remains of plants, shells, and corals, occur in this formation, but hitherto they have not been determined with the requisite accuracy.*\n\n2. First Secondary Limestone, or Mountain Limestone.\n\nThis formation, which, in a general view, rests upon old red sandstone, and sometimes alternates with the rocks of the coal formation, is more abundant in petrifications than the transition rocks. Of the tribe of corals, it contains species of the genera Caryophyllia, Turbinolina, and Flustra; of the unilocular univalve shells, Euomphalus, Planorbis, and Cirrus; multilocular univalve, Orthoceratites, Nautilites, Ammonites, Ellipsolites, Nauteillipsites, Conularia, and Ampexus. Of the bivalve genera, the following are met with, viz. Productus, Pentamerus, Spirifer, Terebratalites, Gryphites, and Cardites. It is worthy of remark, that many of the univalves and some of the bivalves that occur in this and the transition limestone, possess that particular kind of structure, rarely met with in the shells of the present creation, which enabled their inhabitants to rise and sink in the water. The curious structure of Spirifer, and the multilocular arrangement of Productus, Pentamerus, Ampexus, and Conularia, as Mr Parkinson remarks, imparted, in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>, to their inhabitants, a power of a similar kind. Sowerby mentions a shell resembling the Helix found in mountain limestone; but Parkinson is of opinion, that it belonged to a distinct genus, and probably possessing the same power as janthina (formerly considered as a helix), that of sinking and rising in the water. Hitherto, no remains of Asteriae or Echini have been met with in this formation, but the platycrinites of the Crinoid family, is not unfrequent. No true crustacea occur, but several members of the family Trilobites are found in the mountain limestone of England and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>. Some obscure traces of fossil fishes are rarely met with. As examples of these may be mentioned the supposed spinous radii of a Balistes, and imperfect remains of what resembled the snout of the Xiphias, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>-fish.\n\n3. Coal Formation.\n\nThis formation is principally remarkable on account of the numerous fossil remains of plants which it affords. Several of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> tribes are represented in the plates attached to this article. All the species, and most of the genera belong to plants different from those of the present creation; many of them, and those the predominating ones, resemble cacti, palms, reeds, and ferns; thus intimating the general state of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-EARTH_S\">earth's</a> surface when they flourished.\n\n* The petrified woods in old red sandstone are often in the state of woodstone.\nThe bituminous shale and slate clay sometimes contain Orthoceratites, Terebratulites, Ammonites, and some species of the genera Lingula and Unio.\n\n4. Second Secondary Limestone, or Magnesian Limestone.\n\nThe fossil organic remains of the magnesian limestone, which, in the general succession, rests immediately upon the coal formation, have not hitherto been much studied. Some Flustrae and Crinoidea are mentioned as occurring in it; and also species of the genera Donax, Arcu, Anomia, and Unio; and lastly, remains of a fish, of the genus Chelodon, were found imbedded in this formation near to Sunderland.\n\nThe limestones named Bituminous Marl Slate and Zechstein, are associated with this magnesian limestone, and, therefore, are considered as belonging to the same general formation. The bituminous marl slate often forms the lower part of the series of magnesian limestone, and contains numerous petrified fishes; which some naturalists are inclined to consider as principally fresh water species; a few only appearing to them to have been inhabitants of the ocean. In this limestone also there occur remains of an animal of the genus Monitor, of the class <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMPHIBIA\">Amphibia</a>; but petrifications of vegetables are rarely met with. We sometimes meet with branches of plants analogous to the Lycopodium, and more rarely of ferns, and of plants allied to the genus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHALARIS\">Phalaris</a>. Amongst these fresh water productions, various remains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">marine</a> animals, such as Gryphites, Trilobites, and Crinoidea, make their appearance.\n\nThe Zechstein is particularly distinguished by the great abundance of the Gryphites aculeatus it contains; Ferns and Lycopodiums resembling those of the coal formation; and it is said, also remains of Lepidodendrous plants are found in it.\n\n5. Second Sandstone, or New Red Sandstone Formation.\n\nVery few organic remains have hitherto been found in this formation, and those met with are fossil trees and shells.\n\n6. Third Secondary Limestone, including the Lias, and Oolite.\n\na. Lias Limestone.\n\nThis limestone rests on the new red sandstone. It abounds in fossil organic remains, of which the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIST\">list</a> contains several of the more interesting:\n\nCorals are of rare occurrence; species of one tribe only, the Turbinaria, having been met with. Several species of the genus Pentaclitinae are met with; and also remains, more or less perfect, of Echini. The fossil shells in this rock differ considerably from those of the mountain limestone and other preceding formations; only a few species of some of the multilocular univalves, as Ammonites, Nautilites, and Belemnites, and of the Terebratulas, being here discoverable. The fossil shells found in this formation chiefly consist of bivalves of the genera Ostrea, Gryphaea, Plagiostoma, Plicatula, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol0.html#article-AVICULA\">Avicula</a>, Mya, and Cardita, with the single univalve shell Trochus Anglicanus of Lister, not, perhaps, met with in any of the succeeding strata; a shell of the genus Helicina, and the first simple unilocular shell having a turriculated form, met with in a fossil state, being a species of the genus Melania. Several species of crustacea occur. Spines, teeth, and other parts of fishes also occur, but in general in an imperfect state. Bones and palates of turtle have been found in this formation; but it is particularly distinguished by its containing remains of two very remarkable extinct genera of oviparous quadrupeds, belonging to the same class with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> order <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LACERTA\">Lacerta</a>, but yet differing in structure from all the genera at present known to exist, and in such particulars as must have fitted them to live entirely in the sea. These are the animals already mentioned under the names Ichthyosaurus and Plesiosaurus.\n\nb. Oolite, &c.\n\nIn the strata above the lias belonging to the oolite, including also the rocks named Cornbrash, Coral Rag, &c., many genera of organic remains are met with, which we shall now enumerate in the usual manner, beginning with those of the lowest or least perfect animals.\n\n1. Lower Oolite.\u2014Traces of Aleyonia, and the following genera of corals, are met with, viz. Explanaria, Astrea, Caryophyllia, Fungia, and Cyclotites. The interesting Crinoide family affords the Pentacrinites Caput <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDUSA\">Medusa</a>; and Subangularis; species, sometimes well preserved, of the genera Conulus, Cidaritis, Echinus, and Clypeus of the Echinus family, are met with, and rarely fragments of Crustacea. Shells of the following genera are abundant, viz. Pecten, Ostrea, Terebratula, Modiola, Tellina, Unio, Lutraria, Trigonia, Trochus, Belemnites, Nautilites, and Ammonites. Remains of vertebral animals are of rare occurrence, the only instance known being of vertebrae, supposed to belong to the marine lacertae.\n\n2. Cornbrash, Stonesfield Slate, Forest Marble, and Great Oolite.\u2014The following is a general enumeration of the organic remains met with in this part of the oolite series, which, in the regular succession, rests on the lower oolite.\n\nSpecies of Millepore, Tubipore, Cyclolite, and Caryophyllia, occur in this part of the oolite series, and the Encrinital family appears in considerable variety; species of Echini, and two or three varieties of Crustacea also occur. The fossil shells are of the following genera: Terebratula, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIMA\">Lima</a>, Avicula, Pecten, Ostrea, Cardium, Trigonia, Modiola, Serpula, Voluta, Turbo, Turritella, Ampullaria, Ammonites, and Nautilus. Teeth, vertebrae, and palates of fish are met with; and also several species of Tortoise. Several oviparous quadrupeds have been found; one is a well characterized Crocodile, and remains of a Megalosaurus, forty feet long, were found at Stonesfield. But the most singular fact is, the occurrence of bones of a species of Delphis, or Opossum, in the Stonesfield slate. Fragments of fossil wood are met with; and the Stonesfield slate exhibits beautiful impressions, chiefly of ferns and reeds, many of which resemble those of the coal formation.\n3. Coral Rock.\u2014This limestone lies above the preceding, and is also a member of the Oolite series. It abounds in corals, contains many different species of the tribe *Echinus*, and considerable variety of bivalve and univalve shells, and among the latter are species of *Ammonites*, *Nautilites*, and *Belemnites*. The remains of vertebral animals are rare, and of these the most remarkable are the vertebrae of the *Ichthyosaurus*.\n\n4. Kimmeridge Clay.\u2014Under this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> we include a series of clay beds, higher in the series than the preceding, but still belonging to the oolite formation. It contains both bivalve and univalve fossil shells, and of these the most characteristic is the *Ostrea deltoidea*. It also contains remains of the *Ichthyosaurus* and bones resembling those of the whale.\n\n5. Portland Oolite.\u2014The most characteristic shells in this Oolite are the *Ammonites triplicatus*, and *Pecten lamellatus*.\n\n6. Purbeck Beds.\u2014This limestone contains beautiful impressions of fish; also bones of turtle, and heads of crocodiles. Its shells have not been well examined.\n\n7. Third Sandstone Formation, or Green Sand Formation.\n\nIn this formation the organic remains, whether of animals or vegetables, are often in a siliceous state. All the wood found in this formation is silicified, but none of it has hitherto been referred to any even of the most general divisions of the botanical system. Numerous silicified *Aleyonia* are met with, and also a good many fossil species of the family *Echinus*. Corals, and also species of the *Crinoid* family, rarely occur. Shells occur in vast abundance, and in great variety; but, with the exception of a few teeth of fish, no remains of vertebral animals have hitherto been met with.\n\n8. Fourth Limestone Formation, or Chalk Formation.\n\na. Chalk Marl.\n\nThe lower part of this formation, named chalk marl, affords considerable variety of fossil organic remains\u2014fossil Corals, Sponges, *Echinus*, *Crustacea*, *Encrinites*, and bivalve and univalve shells; and of these the most abundant and interesting are those of the multilocular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a>. The species of the multilocular genus *Hamites* are numerous and abundant, and are highly characteristic of this part of the chalk formation. Fossil wood is sometimes met with.\n\nb. Chalk.\n\nThis formation contains many organic remains of animals, from the sponge to the alligator. The families of *Aleyonium* and *Spongia* occur in great variety of form, but their characters are still much involved in obscurity. *Madrepores* occur, and but little changed from their original state; also several genera of the *Crinoidea*, and the species often in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> state of preservation. Several species of the *Asterias*, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAR\">star</a> fish, are described as occurring in chalk; but of all the organic remains, those of the tribe *Echinus* are the most numerous, abundant and characteristic of the formation. Of the fossil shells probably the only genera peculiar to the chalk are the *Crania* and *Magas*. Of the multilocular genera the following are met with: viz. *Ammonites*, *Scaphites*, and *Belemnites*. The first occurs rarely in the upper chalk; the second only in the lower. The remains of several tribes of fishes are met with, which are alleged to belong to the following genera: viz. *Squalus*, *Diodon*, *Balistes*, *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-MURANA\">Murana</a>*, *Anarhichas*, *Salmo*, *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ESOX\">Esox</a>*, and *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ZEUS\">Zeus</a>*. The remains are chiefly different suctated palates, teeth, detached vertebrae, and irregular masses, with the scales of fishes. The teeth are generally referable to different species of shark or *Squalus*; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BONY\">bony</a> tongues and palates to different species of *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-RAIA\">Raia</a>*.\n\n9. Brown Coal Formation.\n\nThis formation, which rests upon chalk, is almost entirely composed of extinct species of plants; and in some countries, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWITZERLAND\">Switzerland</a>, it is associated with vast accumulations of a conglomerate named *Nagelfluhe*.\n\n10. Paris Formation.\n\nUnder this head we comprehend all the different secondary rocks newer than the brown coal or chalk formations. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUP\">group</a> of rocks the number and variety of organic remains is great, and in general they are in a higher state of preservation than in the preceding formations, and also approach much nearer to the organic beings of the present creation. The members of this series, as it occurs in England, are as follows, reckoning from below upwards. 1. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLASTIC\">Plastic</a> clay. 2. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> clay. 3. Fresh water formations. 4. Upper marine formations.\n\n1. Plastic Clay.\u2014In this clay, which repose immediately either on brown coal or chalk, there are *Ostrea*, *Cerithia*, *Turritella*, *Cyclades*, &c. together with the teeth of fish and portions of coal.\n\n2. London Clay, the Calcaire Grossier of the French.\u2014Few corals occur; the echinites, so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> in chalk, are very rare in this formation, and very few of the encrinite family have yet been discovered. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CRABS\">Crabs</a> and lobsters are frequent; for in the British Museum there are preserved thirty different species of crabs from the London clay in the Island of Sheppey. Fossil shells are numerous and well preserved, often retaining nearly the appearance of recent shells. There are but few genera of recent shells that do not occur in this formation, but the species are generally different; on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, few of the extinct genera, so common in the older formations, occur in this. No multilocular or bivalves of complicated structure occur in this clay. About thirty-two genera of bivalves have been found in the more ancient strata; and only five or six new genera have been found in the London clay; but, on the other hand, the more ancient strata have been found to contain only twelve or fourteen genera of simple turbinated univalves, whilst the London clay and its accompanying sands and crag have afforded thirty-two genera of turbinated shells; twenty-five of which, with about sixteen other genera not known to have existed, in a mineralised slate, inhabit the present waters of our globe. Petrified fishes of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> are\nOrganic remains sometimes met with; also crocodiles and turtles in a more or less perfectly mineralised state. It frequently contains portions of fossil wood, and vast variety of fruit or lignaceous seed-vessels. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">Seven</a> hundred different seed-vessels have been collected, and few of them agree with any known kinds.\n\n3. Fresh-water Formations.\u2014These are so named from their containing principally shells resembling those of fresh-waters. The following genera occur here, viz. Lymnus, Planorbis, Cyclostoma, and Helix. And these are associated with seeds, and with parts of coleopterous insects.\n\n4. Upper Marine Formation.\u2014It is remarked of this formation by Parkinson, \"A few shells only, which may be placed among those which are supposed to be lost, or among those which are the inhabitants of the distant seas, are here discoverable; the greater number not appearing to differ specifically from the recent shells of neighbouring seas.\" Besides these shells, there rarely occur palates of fish, and fossil sponges, and aleogeton; and, it is said, fossil bones of some unknown animal, and teeth of the mammoth.\n\nIII. Fossil Organic Remains in Alluvial Rocks.\n\nIn the diluvial members of this class are found the fossil remains of elephants, hippopotami, rhinoceri, &c. already enumerated; while the post-diluvial soils contain, principally, the remains of animals and vegetables of the present creation.\n\nIV.\u2014FORMATION OF THE STRATA IN WHICH FOSSIL ORGANIC REMAINS ARE CONTAINED.\n\nOur limits do not permit us to enter into any particular discussion on this branch of our subject, which is, indeed, the less to be regretted from its vague and dubious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>. We shall, therefore, conclude with a very few observations. The primitive rocks, as already mentioned, appear to have been formed before the organic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> was called into existence; because they contain neither animal nor vegetable remains. It is in the transition rocks that organic remains first make their appearance; showing, that at their formation, and not earlier, animals and vegetables began to exist; and thus nearly establishing one of the most remarkable and striking facts in the whole range of geological science. For a long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, the organic productions of the earth appear to have been principally marine; as in all the formations extending from the transition class, to the chalk, inclusive, corals, shells, encrinites, echinites, fishes, and marine oviparous quadrupeds, are the predominating fossil animals; and hence the different rocks of those formations must have been formed under the waters of the ocean. But the strata of the coal formation contain, besides marine organic remains, land plants and land shells, and the bituminous marl slate, already mentioned as lying over the coal formation, principally fresh water fishes; facts which lead to the conclusion, that fresh or land water was concerned in their formation. The formations extending from chalk to the alluvial series, from their containing abundant remains of both marine and fresh water animals, show that the waters of the land and the ocean assisted in the formation of these rocks. And lastly, in the diluvial formations containing the remains of so many extinct quadrupeds, &c., we have sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> of their formation by a great rising of the waters of the ocean, or of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOD\">flood</a>; which appears to have been that described in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIBLE\">Bible</a>; while the post-diluvial clays, and sands, and gravels, with their fossil remains of known plants and animals, are formations daily taking place upon the land, and under the sea.\n\n(M.M.)\n\nORKNEY and SHETLAND, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-ZETLAND\">ZETLAND</a>, two groups of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">North</a> Sea, belonging to, and forming together one of the counties of Scotland. The Orkney Isles, which are separated from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CAITHNESS\">Caithness</a> by the Pentland Frith, a strait from six to twelve miles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, are situated between $58^\\circ 47'$ and $59^\\circ 20'$ north latitude, and between $20^\\circ 24'$ and $3^\\circ 23'$ west <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a> from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREENWICH\">Greenwich</a>. Between these, and what properly form the Shetland group, are the two isles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FAIR_ISLE\">Fair <a c</a>lass=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLE\">Isle</a> and Foula; the former lying about 24 miles to the south of the mainland of Shetland, and the latter, supposed to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THULE\">Thule</a> of Tacitus, about 20 miles to the west: both of them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> under the general denomination of Shetland. With these exceptions, the Shetland Isles may be placed between $59^\\circ 48' 30''$ and $60^\\circ 52'$ north latitude, and between $52'$ and $1^\\circ 57'$ west longitude. In clear weather they can be distinctly seen from Orkney, from which Fair Isle is only about 36 miles distant. The Orkney Isles have been computed to contain 384,000 acres, which is probably above the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>; and of this, 300,000 are said to be waste, or covered by water. Those of Shetland may be about twice as large as Orkney; of which only about 20,000 acres are supposed to be cultivated. But the very irregular form of the islands, penetrated by arms of the sea in all directions, render those estimates, in the absence of any accurate survey, nothing more than approximations. Orkney is divided into seventeen parishes, comprising three presbyteries and one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYNOD\">synod</a>; and Shetland into twelve, here called ministries, making one presbytery, which is invested with synodal powers. Together they constitute one sheridom or stewartry, under the jurisdiction of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SHERIFF\">sheriff</a>-depute and two substitutes, whose courts are held at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KIRKWALL\">Kirkwall</a> in Orkney, and at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LERWICK\">Lerwick</a> in Shetland. Orkney alone sends one member to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a>; the landholders of...\nOrkney and Shetland, owing to their peculiar tenures, or the want of a separate valuation of their estates, having no vote in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a>. Kirkwall, the only royal burgh, joins with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DINGWALL\">Dingwall</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TAIN\">Tain</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-DORNOCH\">Dornoch</a>, and Wick, in electing a member for the Scottish burghs. Of the land-tax payable for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a>, two-thirds are levied from Orkney, and one-third from Shetland. The valued rent is L. 37,786 Scots; and the real rent, as returned to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>-tax in 1811, was, for the lands of Orkney, L. 9495, 3s. 6d. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">Sterling</a>, and for the houses L. 2138, 14s. 6d.; for the lands of Shetland L. 6741, 6s., and for the houses L. 1408; the land rent of both being thus L. 16,236, 9s. 6d. Supposing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> to be a million of acres, this gives a rent of not quite 4d. the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACRE\">acre</a>; but the landowner derives a profit from the labour of the tenantry, which, though considerable, being indefinite in its amount, and difficult to be ascertained, was not probably included in this rental.\n\nThe number of the Orkney Isles, besides insulated rocks which bear little or no herbage, here called skerries, is 67; of which only 28 or 29 are inhabited; the others, known by the name of holms, being employed only as grazing grounds for sheep and cattle. Of the inhabited isles the most southerly is South Ronaldshay, supposed to contain 24 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> miles, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> of upwards of 1600, partly employed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>; much of this island being good arable or grass land; and partly in the manufacture of kelp. To the north-west of this is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOY\">Hoy</a>, an island of twice the extent, but containing only about a third of the inhabitants, the greater part of it being high land covered with heath. Burray, situated north from South Ronaldshay, from which it is separated by a channel about a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> broad, has an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a> of only three square miles, but produces grain, green crops, and good pasture, and has a valuable rabbit warren. Farther north is the largest island of the group, called Pomona, or Mainland, extending at least 30 miles from east to west, and containing upwards of 200 square miles. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> of Kirkwall and Stromness are in this Island; the former having about 2000 inhabitants, and the latter 1400. The harbour of Stromness, to which the entrance is from the south, by a passage only a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of a mile in breadth, is particularly safe and commodious, though somewhat difficult of access. Shapinshe and Rousa, each containing from 10 to 12 square miles, partly arable and partly pasture, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> to the north of the Mainland. Beyond these are Stronsa, to the northeast, about 16 square miles; and Eda, north-west from Stronsa, not quite so large; both of them containing a considerable proportion of productive land; the former having two good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HARBOURS\">harbours</a>, and the latter carrying on the manufacture of kelp on such a scale as to afford employment to a great part of its inhabitants. Still farther north lie <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDA\">Sanda</a> on the east, and Westra on the west. Sanda, though only about 19 square miles, has about 1800 inhabitants, being naturally a productive territory, and yielding about a fifth of all the kelp made in Orkney. Both from this and Westra, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISHING\">fishing</a> is carried on to some extent. North Ronaldshay, the most northerly of all the Orkneys, lies about two miles north from Sanda, and upon an area of from four to six square miles, has a population of about 500. If the extent of the Orkneys be only 440 square miles, the estimate given in the General Report of Scotland, the population in 1811 would be nearly 53 per square mile.\n\nOf the Shetland Isles, the number altogether is about 100; of which upwards of thirty are inhabited, isles, and some of these last are very small. The first to the south is Fair Isle, only about two or three square miles in extent, the inhabitants of which are chiefly employed in the cod fishery. To the north, and a little to the east of this, is the Mainland, or largest of the group, about sixty miles long, and from two to seven miles and upwards broad; having the promontories of Sumburgh-head and Fitful-head on the south, and stretching from thence northward in a form very irregular on all sides. Arms of the sea, here called voes, penetrate the land in all directions, so much so, that no part of the island is said to be more than two miles from the sea; and at one place, the isthmus of Mavis Grind, the breadth is less than one hundred yards; and it is surrounded at no great distance by a great many holms and skelesies, which give to the landscape, if it may be so called, a singularly wild and romantic appearance, when viewed from the high grounds, which here occupy a much greater proportion of the surface than in the Orkneys. Mainland contains Lerwick, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of the Shetlands, having about 1300 inhabitants; and a little to the south-west, Scalloway, the only other town, which now consists of but a few scattered houses, though a place of some antiquity, and formerly distinguished for its castle, and for being the seat of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>. Between this island and Bressay, on the east of Lerwick, is Bressay <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUND\">Sound</a>; so celebrated for being the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a> of vessels employed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FISHERIES\">fisheries</a>. It is upwards of three miles in length, and from one to two in breadth, and affords safe anchorage to ships of any burden. St Magnus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">Bay</a>, on the north-west of the Mainland, with an inlet from it called Hammersvoe, also presents a secure retreat for shipping in the most tempestuous weather. On the east of this island, which in extent is greater than all the others put together, the principal islands from south to north are Bressay and Whalsey, and on the west Burra, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PAPA\">Papa</a> Stour, and Muckle Roe, and at a distance from these Foula. Bressay and Whalsey contain each about sixteen or eighteen square miles, but the others are much smaller. North from the Mainland is Yell, the next largest of the Shetland isles, about twenty miles long, and eight broad. East from Yell lies Fetlar, consisting of good arable and pasture land. Unst, the most northerly, about two miles from Yell, in extent about forty square miles, also contains much good land, fit for either tillage or grazing. It was here that the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> Biot, in 1817, and in the following year <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> Kater, prosecuted their experiments for the purpose of determining, in this high latitude, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> in the length of the seconds <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PENDULUM\">pendulum</a>. The former has given an animated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> of the country and its inhabitants, in his Notices sur les Operations, &c. read to the French Institute in 1818. Assuming the extent of these islands to be 880 square miles, or twice that of the Orkneys, the population in 1811 was at the rate of only twenty-six\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> of these islands is exceedingly moist, and the winters long; yet the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> is not intense, and snow seldom lies more than a few days. The thermometer in the Orkneys <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> ranges between $23^\\circ$ and $68^\\circ$, and in 1811, a rainy year, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> was 29.05 inches. In Shetland, during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> of 1808, the thermometer was for a few days at $75^\\circ$, the medium temperature of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> and August being about $70^\\circ$; and it seldom falls $10^\\circ$ below the freezing point. According to Dr Edmondston, the medium temperature of the winter months may be taken at $38^\\circ$, and of the summer at $65^\\circ$. On the shortest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> of the year the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> is above the horizon five hours and twenty-five minutes. From the middle of May to the end of July it is never dark, the short absence of the sun being supplied by a bright twilight. Yet all these islands are much exposed to high winds, which often destroy the crops, as well as occasion great losses at sea; while, surcharged as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a> commonly is with moisture, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a> of cold is often greater than what is indicated by the thermometer.\n\nOf the arable or productive land, the soil is in general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a>, or a light loam, of no great depth, sometimes upon limestone, but frequently sandstone, and in the latter case it is often much injured by wetness. But by far the greater part of the surface is covered with moss and moor, and exceedingly sterile. Among the minerals are iron, lead, and copper, none of which are wrought at present. In 1817 Dr Hibbert found the chromate of iron in the island of Unst. Marl is very common in Orkney, but much neglected, and also limestone. Beds of limestone occur in almost every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> of Shetland. There is no coal, but peat is everywhere so abundant, that the inhabitants do not suffer from want of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a>.\n\nThe rural economy of these islands presents several peculiarities, to which we can only advert very shortly. The proprietors of Orkney derive a greater income from the kelp manufactured on the shores, and those of Shetland from the fisheries on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a>, than from the soil itself; and to obtain a sufficient number of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> for these employments, the land is, in general, divided into very small farms, of which most of the rent is paid in produce and in services; \u2014in Shetland chiefly in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a>, and in fish sold to the landlord at a price below that of the market. In Orkney land is let by the mark, or merk, an indefinite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, and not by the acre; and in Shetland, where the same practice prevails, the marks are divided into different classes, such as sixpenny, ninepenny, and twelvepenny marks; terms which, whatever they may have denoted originally, do not now define either their relative extent or value; a sixpenny mark being often as large and productive as a twelvepenny one. Both in Orkney and Shetland nearly all the estates are freehold, though the udal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TENURE\">tenure</a> was formerly general in the latter country; but they are burdened with feu-duties and rents, formerly paid to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CROWN\">Crown</a> and Bishop of Orkney, and now to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Dundas, the grantee, or lessee of the Crown. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITHES\">Tithes</a> are drawn in kind, and in Shetland are said to be very oppressive. Most of the small tenants hold their possessions only from year to year, having no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LEASES\">leases</a>.\n\nOats, bear, or big, and potatoes, are the principal crops; yet the soil and climate are in general well adapted to turnips and clovers, which are now to be found cultivated upon a small scale in many of the islands. All their implements are rude, and, as we should think, ineffective; in many parts the spade is almost the only one in general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>. Their native horses, cattle, and sheep, are all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIMINUTIVE\">diminutive</a> animals, stunted by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUNGER\">hunger</a> and cold, particularly those of Shetland; but better breeds are now found in Orkney. The late Mr Malcolm Laing (the well known historian of Scotland), who introduced a flock of Merinos into Orkney in 1808, found them to thrive well, and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a> not to deteriorate, but rather improve. The Shetland <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> seldom reaches the height of eleven hands, or the cow the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of 3 cwt., and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILK\">milk</a> which the latter yields, on the common pastures, does not exceed three English quarts per day. In Orkney, the number of sheep has been computed at 50,000, and in Shetland at from 70,000 to 80,000. The wool of many of the latter is very fine, and might probably be much improved, as well as the animal itself, by proper treatment. But at present, the sheep depasture promiscuously without being herded; neither shelter nor food is provided against the rigour of a long winter, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>, when once introduced into the flocks, makes the most cruel ravages. A great many swine are bred in these islands, particularly in the Orkneys. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>, or rather wool, with which they are covered is made into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROPES\">ropes</a>, \"and it is not uncommon for a man who sells his pig to bargain to have his wool returned.\"\u2014(Shirreff's Agricultural View.) Rabbits are found in most of the Orkneys; and geese are reared in great numbers as an article of export.\n\nOf the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a> of this county, by far the most important is kelp, of which the quantity produced in the Orkneys yearly is about 3000 tons, but in Shetland only from 400 to 600 tons; the precipitous shores of the latter islands being less favourable to the growth of the sea-weeds from which it is made than those of Orkney. During the late <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, it has been computed that about L40,000 a year was received by the landholders for the kelp made in Orkney alone; and the people whom it employs, for eight or ten weeks in summer, include a great proportion of the inhabitants. But since peace, the price has fallen so much, that this important branch of industry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> perhaps cease to be profitable; and the repeal of the duties on Scotch <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>, in the last session of Parliament, which may lead to the production of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SODA\">soda</a> from that article, has filled the proprietors with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> that it may soon be annihilated. Before the late war, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> manufacture was carried on to a considerable extent in Orkney, but has decreased since. Straw-plaiting has been introduced both into Orkney and Shetland, and employs from 1200 to 1400 people, chiefly females. Shetland has been long celebrated for its hosiery. Stockings are knit upon wires in almost every family, and of such different qualities, that while some\nOrkney and Shetland are valued at L.2 a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a>, others are so low as 5d or 6d.\n\nThe fisheries are to Shetland what kelp is to Orkney, the great source of employment and revenue to its inhabitants; yet cod and lobsters are caught in great quantities among the Orkney isles, and carried alive to the London market, and the dog and coal-fish, for the use of the inhabitants; the former affording <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>, and the latter an agreeable article of food. But the fisheries of Shetland are far more considerable. About 600 boats and 3500 men are employed from the 20th May to the 12th August in fishing for ling, cod, and tusk, called the white fishing, at from twenty to forty miles from the coast. The principal stations, or hagfs, are in the parish of Northmaven, in the north-west quarter of the Mainland. The spacious bay of St Magnus, which is on the south side of this parish, leads to the harbour of Hillswick, where there is good anchorage in from seven to twenty fathoms; and on the beach, which is large and commodious, there are warehouses and salt and fish cellars, with every other necessary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a>. Another great station is at the Out Skerries, east from the Mainland. As the fishermen are also small farmers, it is commonly stipulated that these three kinds of fish shall be delivered to their landlord at so much per cwt. of wet fish, the landlord curing them, and taking all further risk upon himself. Two tons and a half of wet fish make only one of dry; of which the quantity annually cured by the landholders was, a few years ago, upwards of 1000 tons; and the price in Shetland was 18s.-6d. the cwt. This was before the discovery of the Cod-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a>, which we shall notice immediately. But there is a number of what are called free fishers, especially in the two islands of Burra, who being at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> to sell to whom they please, receive a higher price than the small tenants, and the quantity caught by them is not included in the above. Besides these kinds of fish, halibut, skate, and several others, are got at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, all of which belong to the fishermen, without any claim on the part of the landholders; and this is the case also with what is caught on hand-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> during winter and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>. Of these winter fish, the annual export is about 65 tons. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERRING\">herring</a>-fishery was formerly prosecuted by the Dutch to a great extent among these islands. \"Some old men,\" says Gifford, who wrote his Description of Shetland in 1793, \"say that they have seen in Bressay Sound, at one time, 2200 busses.\" Since peace, these industrious people have begun to resume their labours, though upon a much smaller scale. But the quantity of herrings caught by the Shetland fishermen on the coast is comparatively trifling; and notwithstanding the encouragement afforded by Parliament, it does not appear that they have embarked to any extent in the deep sea fisheries. One of the most ancient and beneficial branches of the Shetland fisheries is that of the coal-fish, known according to its age, by the names of sillock, pillock, and sethe. These form a principal article in the subsistence of the lower classes.\n\nIn the summer of 1818, an extensive cod-bank was discovered to the west of the Shetland Isles. According to the fishermen, it lies from 25 to 30 miles west from Foula. They refer to the west of the island of Westra, one of the Orkneys, as its origin, and from thence it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> nearly north by west, having been variously entered upon in steering from the east, as far as about 20 miles north-west of Shetland, a distance of about 140 miles. The breadth is reported to be from 18 to 45 miles, and the depth of water from 28 to 50 fathoms. The great productiveness of this bank has been fully established. About <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> the weight of fish was caught on it in 1819 that had been formerly taken by vessels of the same burden in other parts.\n\nThe nature of the trade of these islands may be anticipated from what we have said of their products. Orkney exports kelp, linen cloth and linen yarn, skins, goose feathers and quills, and a few other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a>; and the imports are wine, spirits, groceries, &c. Oatmeal and bear or big appear both among the imports and exports; but it is understood that this range of islands, in ordinary seasons, grows corn enough for the consumption of its inhabitants. The chief exports of Shetland are fish, kelp, oil, butter, and hosiery; and the imports the same with those of Orkney, with the addition of corn, of which it does not raise nearly a sufficiency. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> brought into Shetland by such of the natives as engage themselves as seamen in the whale vessels is computed to amount to no less a sum than L.15,000 yearly.\n\nThere is no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> rate in this county. It is the practice of the island to board the poor upon the tenantry, in proportion to the extent of their possessions; each pauper having a certain number of families assigned to him, with whom he lives in succession, and who are said to treat him with kindness. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WAGES\">wages</a> of labour cannot be accurately expressed in money, as they are paid partly in produce, and vary much at different seasons, owing to the demand for kelp-making and the fisheries. In Shetland a man-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a> will seldom engage for more than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> months in the year. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> obtained from their own soil and from the fisheries are sufficiently moderate, but such as must be imported are proportionally high priced. The condition of the labouring classes is understood to have been much improved since the introduction of kelp-making; but it is alleged, that the practice of connecting this kind of industry, and that of the fisherman, with the occupation of land, is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a> with agricultural improvement. The population of the county, in 1801 and 1811, will be seen in the annexed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a>.\n\nSee The Statistical Account of Scotland. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARRY\">Barry</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> of Orkney.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of carrying the project into execution is clearly, though concisely, described in a very curious and learned treatise, De Re Militari, by Valturius of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIMINI\">Rimini</a>. This remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> is justly deemed one of the finest and earliest specimens of typography and wood-engraving. It was first printed by John of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERONA\">Verona</a> in 1472, and from the same press an Italian translation of it by Paul Ramusio issued in 1483. It was afterwards reprinted at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> in 1532, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> Latin, by the celebrated Printer, Christian Wechelius.\n\nOf the numerous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACHINES\">machines</a> described and delineated in that rare <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a>, several have been frequently reproduced as new inventions during the course of the last century. Such waste of ingenuity, is really a serious evil, arising from inattention to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> arts, and the want of a public repository to exhibit their successive improvements. Mr Dibdin has given, in his Bibliotheca Spenceriana, fac-similes of several warlike engines from Valturius; but we have copied the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of a\nflat-bottomed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a> for crossing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> by the circumvolution of paddles or vanes. (See Plate CXVI.) These vanes consisted of pitched sail-cloth; and it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be seen, that the impulsion was communicated by means of cranks. The action of each axle is said to have been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to that of twelve oars. (Valturius, De Re Militari, p. 314.) We must not, however, suppose that the power thus applied was really augmented by such machinery. It has been ascertained that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> force is advantageously exerted in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of rowing; but this operation requires skill, and not more than one person can work conveniently at the same oar. Where paddles are substituted, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> strength is sufficient; and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of men may combine their labour in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> a crank. Animal power will, indeed, effect the same purpose.

Valturius even speaks of pontoons, composed of three parts, like drums, which could be conjoined at any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, and again separated, to facilitate their carriage over <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a>.

Hulls. The first attempt, however, on record to apply steam to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a> was made by a person of the name of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JONATHAN\">Jonathan</a> Hulls, who, on the 21st of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> 1736, obtained a Patent, to endure for 14 years, for what may, without any impropriety, be called a Steam-Boat. The Letters Patent, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of this boat, illustrated with a plate, are contained in a very rare Tract, published by Hulls in 1737, under the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a>: A Description and Draught of a new invented Machine for carrying Vessels or Ships out of or into any Harbour, Port, or River, against <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">Wind</a> and Tide, or in a Calm. As the origin of the invention has been much disputed, we shall subjoin some extracts from this pamphlet, which lay totally forgotten till within these few years, and is even yet, on account of its great rarity, but very little known.*\n\nHe introduces his description by a concise view of the principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIMENTAL_PHILOSOPHY\">experimental <a class=\"</a>xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>; in which he observes (p. 39), \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> a person were to descend to the bottom of a well full of water, his body would be pressed the same as if he descended the same depth into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>; for there is the same pressure against a pool-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> as there is against the sea-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a> at the same depth, as hath before been demonstrated.\n\n\"Thus I have endeavoured to explain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the pressure of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> on other bodies, by comparing it with other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a> that are visible to our eye, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a>, water, &c. and, since the pressure is so very great, it is the more fit to be applied to a purpose wherein all sorts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANUAL\">manual</a> operations are insufficient. For this present undertaking cannot be supposed to be done by strength of men or horses, or any machine driven by either.\n\n\"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a> being of a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>, and striving to get in where there is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VACUUM\">vacuum</a>, I shall endeavour to show how this vacuum is made, and in what manner this force is applied to drive the machine.\n\n\"In some convenient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the Tow-Boat there is placed a vessel about two-thirds full of water, with the top <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> shut; this vessel being kept <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a>, rarifies into a steam. This steam being conveyed through a large pipe into a cylindrical vessel, and there condensed, makes a vacuum, which causes the weight of the atmosphere to press on this vessel, and so presses <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> a piston that is fitted into this cylindrical vessel, in the same manner as in Mr Newcomen's engine, with which he raises water by fire. (See Plate CXVI.)\n\n\"It hath been already demonstrated, that a vessel of thirty inches diameter, which is but two feet and an half, when the air is driven out, the atmosphere will press on it to the weight of four tons, sixteen hundred weight, and upwards; when proper instruments for this work are applied to it, it must drive a vessel with a great force.\"\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">Note</a>.\u2014The bigness of the machines may be proportioned to the work that is to be performed by them; but, if such a force as is applied in this first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSAY\">essay</a> be not sufficient for any purpose that may be required, there is room to make such addition as will move an immense weight with tolerable swiftness.\n\n\"It is my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> it will not be found practicable to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> the machine here recommended in the vessel itself; that is to be taken in or out of the port, &c. but rather in a separate vessel, for these reasons:\n\n\"1st. This machine may be thought cumbersome, and to take up too much room in a vessel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LADEN\">laden</a> with goods, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>, &c.\n\n\"2d. If this machine is put in a separate vessel, this vessel may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> at any port, &c. to be ready on all occasions.\n\n\"3d. A vessel of a small burthen will be sufficient to carry the machine to take out a large one.\n\n\"4th. A vessel will serve for this purpose for many years, after she is thrown off, and not safe to be taken abroad.\"\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> above quoted are followed by the\n\n* It consists of forty-eight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAGES\">pages</a>, in duodecimo; was \"printed for the author, and sold, price sixpence, at the Pamphlet Shops in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WESTMINSTER\">Westminster</a>.\"\nExplanation of the Machine. The Figure to which this Explanation refers is copied, from that given by Hulls, in Plate CXVI.\n\n\"A represents the chimney coming from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FURNACE\">furnace</a>.\n\n\"B, The tow-boat.\n\n\"CC, Two pieces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a>, framed together, to carry the machine.\n\n\"Da, D, and Db, are three wheels on one axis, to receive the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROPES\">ropes</a> Fa, Fa, and Fb.\n\n\"Note.\u2014F is the same rope that goes into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a>.\n\n\"Ha and Hb are two wheels on the same axis with the fans II IIII, and move alternately in such a manner, that when the wheels Da, D, and Db, move backward or forward, they keep the fans II IIII in a direct motion.\n\n\"Fb is a rope going from Hb to Db, that when the wheels Da, D, and Db, move forward, moves the wheel Hb forwards, which brings the fans forward with it.\n\n\"Fa is a rope going from the wheel Ha to the wheel Da, that when the wheels Da, D, and Db, move forward, the wheel Ha draws the rope F, and raises the weight G, at the same time as the wheel Hb brings the fans forward.\n\n\"When the weight G is so raised, while the wheels Da, D, and Db, are moving backward, the rope Fa gives way, and the power of the weight G brings the wheel Ha forward, and the fans with it, so that the fans always keep going forward, notwithstanding the wheels Da, D, and Db, move backwards and forwards, as the piston moves up and down in the cylinder.\n\n\"LL are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a> for a catch to drop in from the axis, and are so contrived, that they catch in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> manner, to cause the fans to move always forward, for the wheel Ha, by the power of the weight G, is performing his office, while the other wheel Hb goes back in order to fetch another stroke.\n\n\"Note.\u2014The weight G must contain but half the weight of the pillar of air pressing on the piston, because the weight G is raised at the same time as the wheel Hb performs its office, so that it is, in effect, two machines acting alternately by the weight of one pillar of air of such a diameter as the diameter of the cylinder is.\n\n\"If it should be said that this is not a new invention, because I make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of the same power to drive my machine that others have made use of to drive theirs for other purposes; I answer, The application of this power is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> more than the application of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> and known <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> used in mechanism for new invented purposes.\" P. 43.\n\nThis Explanation is followed with the annexed \"Answers to some Queries that have been made concerning the possibility and usefulness of this undertaking.\"\n\n\"Query I.\n\n\"Is it possible to fix instruments of sufficient strength to move so prodigious a weight as may be contained in a very large vessel?\n\n\"Answer. All <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a> will allow it is possible to make a machine to move an immense weight, if there is force enough to drive the same; for every member must be made in a proportionable strength to the intended work, and properly braced with laces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, &c. so that no part can give way or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a>, if the braces, &c. necessary for this work had been put in the draught, it would have been so much crowded with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a>, that the main instruments could not be so well perceived.\n\n\"Query II.\n\n\"Will not the force of the waves break any instrument to pieces that is placed to move in the water?\n\n\"Answer. First, It cannot be supposed that this machine will be used in a storm or tempest at sea, when the waves are raging; for, if a merchant lyeth in a harbour, &c. he would not choose to put out to sea in a storm, if it were possible to get out; but rather stay until it is abated.\n\n\"Secondly. When the wind comes a-head of the tow-boat, the fans will be protected by it from the violence of the waves; and when the wind comes side-ways, the wind will come edge-ways of the fans, and therefore strike them with the less force.\n\n\"Thirdly. There may be pieces of timber laid to swim on the surface of the water on each side of the fans, and so contrived as they shall not touch them, which will protect them from the force of the waves. Up inland rivers, where the bottom can possibly be reached, the fans may be taken out, and cranks placed at the hindmost axis, to strike a shaft to the bottom of the river, which will drive the vessel forward with the greater force.\n\n\"Query III.\n\n\"It being a continual expense to keep this machine at work, will the expense be answered?\n\n\"Answer. The work to be done by this machine will be upon particular occasions, when all other means yet found out are wholly insufficient. How often does a merchant wish that his ship were on the ocean, when, if he were there, the wind would serve tolerably well to carry him on his intended voyage, but does not serve, at the same time, to carry him out of the river, &c. he happens to be in, which a few hours work of this machine would do. Besides, I know engines that are driven by the same power as this is, where materials for the purpose are dearer than in any navigable river in England; therefore, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> demonstrates, that the expense will be but a trifle to the value of the work performed by those sort of machines, which any person that knows the nature of those things may easily calculate.\" P. 45\u201448.\n\nThus, Jonathan Hulls appears to have been the first person who suggested the propulsion of vessels by paddle-wheels moved by steam. His mode of converting the rectilineal into a rotatory motion was ingenious, though not so simple as the crank. It is most probable, however, that he possessed not the means, and did not receive at the time sufficient encouragement to carry his scheme into execution.\n\nA <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> elapsed before a similar project was attempted. About the year 1772 the celebrated Mr. Watt had completely remodelled the steam-engine;\nand before 1779 it was, by various improvements, reduced to a compendious form, and adapted to almost every purpose where great power was required. The idea of employing it to propel vessels then naturally suggested itself. One of the first to whom it occurred was the Marquis De Jouffroy, who, in 1781, constructed a steam-boat on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAONE\">Saone</a> at Lyons; it was 10 feet long, and he made several experiments with it.\n\nIn the year 1785 two keen competitors for the invention of steam-navigation appeared in America; namely, James Rumsey of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGINIA\">Virginia</a>, and John Fitch of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILADELPHIA\">Philadelphia</a>. The following extracts from a Pamphlet, very little known in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, published by the latter in 1788, are curious:\n\n\"I confess the thought of a steam-boat, which first struck me by mere accident, about the middle of April 1785, has hitherto been very unfortunate to me; the perplexities and embarrassments through which it has caused me to wade far exceed anything that the common course of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> ever presented to my view.\"\u2014In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> I formed models, and in August laid them before <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONGRESS\">Congress</a>, as will appear on their files. In September I presented them to the Philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a>, as per certificates.\"\n\n\"Philadelphia, Sept. 27, 1785. At a special meeting of the American Philosophical Society, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODEL\">model</a>, accompanied with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> and description of a machine for working a boat against the stream, by means of a steam-engine, was laid before the Society by John Fitch.\"\n\n\"At a meeting of the American Philosophical Society on December 2, 1785, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> of the drawing and description of a machine for working a boat against the current, which some time ago was laid before the Society by Mr John Fitch, he this evening presented to them.\n\nExtract from the Minutes,\n\n\"Samuel Magaw,\n\"one of the Secretaries.\"\n\n\"In October I called on the ingenious Mr Henry of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANCASTER\">Lancaster</a>, to take his opinion on my drafts, who informed me that I was not the first person who had thought of applying steam to vessels; that he had conversed with Mr Andrew Ellicot as early as 1775, and that Mr Paine, author of Common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">Sense</a>, had suggested the same thing to him in the winter of 1778.\"\n\n\"In Virginia I waited on his Excellency General <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WASHINGTON\">Washington</a>, who, in the course of conversation, informed me, that the thought of applying steam was not original; that Mr Rumsey had mentioned steam to him: but nothing that passed in the conversation with General Washington had the least tendency to convey the idea of Mr Rumsey's relying on steam; and General Washington's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a>, p. 10 of Mr Rumsey's pamphlet, clears up the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>\u2014for the General himself did not conceive any such thing. Knowing that the thought of applying steam to boats had been suggested by other gentlemen long before; I left his Excellency, with all the elated prospects that an aspiring projector could entertain, not doubting but I should reap the full benefit of the project: for although I found that some had conceived the thought before, yet I was the first that ever exhibited a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> to the public; and was fully convinced that I could not interfere with Mr Rumsey, otherwise the known candour of General Washington must have pointed out to me such interference. I immediately applied to the Legislature of Virginia for assistance to execute my plan, who signified their wish to encourage my designs, but that the state of their finances prevented it.\"\n\n\"Finding that undoubtedly I was the first person in America that could be termed the inventor of a steam-boat, either agreeably to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EQUITY\">equity</a>, I thought it prudent to apply to the different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> for the exclusive privileges for the emoluments of such invention, which were granted by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-NEW_JERSEY\">New <a cla</a>ss=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERSEY\">Jersey</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 1785, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DELAWARE\">Delaware</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NEW_YORK\">New <a c</a>lass=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PENNSYLVANIA\">Pennsylvania</a>, in the winter and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> following, and by Virginia in October 1787.\n\n\"I have from the time of my first thought pursued my scheme with unremitting application, without a suspicion of an interruption, until the circulation of Mr Rumsey's invidious pamphlet, the contents of which I now find it necessary next to take under consideration, not doubting but that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> and tendency of that production will be a sufficient apology for the plainness with which I shall treat it.\"\n\n\"Mr Rumsey says, in page 2, that 'in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of September 1784, he exhibited the model of a boat to his Excellency General Washington, at Bath, in Berkeley <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a>, calculated for stemming the current of rapid rivers only, constructed on principles very different from his present one. Satisfied,' says he, 'of the experiment of her making way against a rapid stream, by the force of the stream, the General was pleased to give me a most ample certificate of her efficacy.' Here it is to be observed, that no mention was made to General Washington of steam at the time of such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXHIBITION\">exhibition</a>: the principles upon which the boat was propelled were entirely unconnected with, and distinct from steam; being simply a model, propelled by water wheels, cranks, and setting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-POLES\">poles</a>: a mode which was many years ago tried on the river Schuylkill by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">farmer</a> near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">Reading</a>, but without success. From an exhibition of this plan it was that Mr Rumsey procured the certificate from General Washington, and on that certificate were Mr Rumsey's laws founded. In his petitions to the several legislatures, he prayed for no exclusive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> for the use of steam-boats; neither did he make mention of steam to their committees, or even suggest an idea of the kind.\"\n\nPatrick Miller, Esq. of Dalswinton, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUMFRIES\">Dumfries</a>-shire, made many experiments on the best mode of impelling single, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a>, and triple vessels with paddle-\n\n---\n\n*The Original Steam-Boat supported; or a Reply to Mr James Rumsey's Pamphlet, showing the true priority of John Fitch.* Philadelphia, 1788.\nwheels, by the power of men and horses; and printed and circulated extensively an account of a Triple Vessel and wheels, in February 1787. In this Tract, he states,\u2014\"I have also reason to believe that the power of the Steam-Engine may be applied to work the wheels, so as to give them a quicker motion, and, consequently, to increase that of the ship. In the course of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> (1787), I intend to make the experiment.\"\n\nAs the power of men produced only the slow motion of five miles per <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>, Mr James Taylor, then residing in Mr Miller's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, and now at Cumnock, suggested the application of a steam-engine as the moving power; and he carried Mr Miller to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of Gilbert Meason, Esq. St Andrew's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">Square</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, to see the model of a steam-carriage invented by Mr William Symington of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALKIRK\">Falkirk</a>. Mr Miller was much pleased with the model, and desired Mr Symington to make him a small steam-engine, to work a twin or double boat on Dalswinton Loch. The engine having been accordingly executed and put on board the boat, the experiment was made at Dalswinton in autumn 1788; and it succeeded so well, that Mr Miller commissioned Mr Symington to purchase a gabert, or large boat, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARRON\">Carron</a>, and to fit up a steam-engine on board of her, to make a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> on a larger scale. Every thing being completed, the trial was made on the Forth and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLYDE\">Clyde</a> Canal, in summer 1789, Messrs Miller, Stainton, Taylor, &c. being on board, and the result answered their most sanguine expectations.\n\nFrom a manuscript Memorial on Steam-Navigation, drawn up by Mr Symington, with the perusal of which we have been favoured, we make the following extract:\n\n\"Mr Miller being then very much engaged improving his newly purchased estate in Dumfries-shire, and I also employed to construct large machinery for the use of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> at Wanlockhead, the idea of carrying the experiments, at that time, any farther, was entirely given up, till meeting with the late Thomas <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Dundas of Kerse, who wished that I would construct a steam-boat for dragging vessels on the Forth and Clyde Canal, in place of horses. Agreeably to his Lordship's request, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of experiments, which cost nearly L. 3000, were set on foot in the year 1801, and ending in 1802, upon a larger scale, and more improved plan, having a steam cylinder 22 inches diameter, and four feet stroke; a complete model of which, with a set of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ICE\">ice</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAKERS\">breakers</a> attached, may be seen (if not in Lord Dundas's house, Arlington Street) in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">Institution</a>, London, which proved itself very much adapted for the intended purposes, as will appear from the following simple yet authentic narrative. Having previously made various experiments, in March 1802, at Lock No. 20, Lord Dundas, the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a> and steam-boat promoter, along with Archibald Speirs, Esq. of Elderslie, and several gentlemen of their acquaintance being on board, the steam-boat took in two loaded vessels, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">Active</a> and Euphemia of Grangemouth, Gow and Esplne masters, each upwards of 70 tons burthen, and with great ease carried them through the long reach of the Forth and Clyde Canal, to Port-Dundas, a distance of 19\u00bd miles, in six hours, although the whole time it blew a very strong breeze right <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AHEAD\">ahead</a> of us; so much so, that no other vessels could move to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WINDWARD\">windward</a>, in the canal, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, but those we had in tow; which put beyond the possibility of doubt the utility of the scheme in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CANALS\">canals</a> or rivers, and ultimately on open seas; though in this state of forwardness it was opposed by some narrow-minded proprietors of the navigation, under a very mistaken idea, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNDULATION\">undulation</a> of the water occasioned by the motion of the wheel would wash and injure its banks: in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> the boat was, with great reluctance, laid up in a creek of the canal, near Bainsford Draw-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a>, exposed for years to public view; where Henry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELL\">Bell</a> from Glasgow, who frequently inspected the steam-boat at Carron in 1789, did also particularly examine this; and afterwards, in conjunction with other gentlemen, in the year 1811, constructed the first steam-boat, Comet, to ply on the river Clyde, which was soon followed there by many more, and its use is now rapidly extending to different regions of the globe.\"\n\nIt is indisputable, therefore, that Mr Symington was the first person who had the merit of successfully applying the power of the steam-engine to the propulsion of vessels. The boat which he constructed was, like that proposed by Hulls, really a Tug. It is much to be regretted, that there existed not enterprise enough at that time in Scotland to encourage the ingenious artizan to repeat his experiments on the Clyde. All the subsequent improvements, however, in steam-navigation may be fairly traced to Mr Symington's attempt, and we cannot help thinking that he has a strong claim on the national <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a>. He is still alive, and we fear not in the most flourishing circumstances. Should the state decline rewarding such meritorious services, the opulent proprietors of steam-boats might well evince their liberality and discernment, by bestowing on him some recompence.\n\nConsidering the importance to America of navigating her mighty rivers, it is not surprising that the application of the power of steam to the propulsion of boats should, by persevering efforts, have been first carried into successful practice in that continent. This was achieved by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> and zeal of Mr Fulton, who appears evidently, however, to have derived all his primary knowledge of the subject from Scotland.\n\nMr Symington's Memorial, above referred to, gives the following remarkable statement:\n\n\"When engaged in these last experiments in 1802, I was called upon by Mr Fulton, who very politely made himself known, and candidly told me that he was lately from North America, and intended to return thither in a few months, but having heard of our steam-boat operations, could not think of leaving this country without first waiting upon me in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a> of seeing the boat, and procuring such information regarding it as I might be pleased to communicate; he at same time mentioned, however advantageous such invention might be to Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, it would certainly become more so in North America, on account of the many extensive navigable rivers in that country; and as timber of the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, both for...\"\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> the vessels, and also for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a> to the engine, could be purchased there for a small expense; he was decidedly of opinion it could hardly fail, in a few years, to become very beneficial to trade in that part of the world; and that his carrying the plan to North America could not turn out otherwise than to my advantage; as, if I inclined it, both the making and superintendence of such vessels would naturally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> upon me, provided my engagements with steam-boats at home did not occupy so much of my time as to prevent me from paying any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to those which might afterwards be constructed abroad.\n\n\"Mr Fulton having thus spoken, in compliance with his most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARNEST\">earnest</a> request, I caused the engine fire to be lighted up, and in a short time thereafter, put the steam-boat in motion, and carried him from Lock No. 16, where the boat then lay, four miles west the canal, and returned to the place of starting, in one hour and twenty minutes, to the great astonishment of Mr Fulton, and several gentlemen, who, at our outset, chanced to come on board.\n\n\"During the above trip, Mr Fulton asked if I had any objections to his taking notes respecting the steam-boat, to which question I said, none; as I considered the more publicity that was given to any discovery intended for general good, so much the better; and having the privilege secured by letters-patent, I was not afraid of his making any encroachment upon my right in the British dominions; though in the United States, I was well aware, I had no power of control. In consequence, he pulled out a memorandum-book, and, after putting several pointed questions respecting the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> and effect of the machine, which I answered in a most explicit manner, he jotted down particularly everything then described, with his own remarks upon the boat, while moving with him on board, along the canal; but he seems to have been altogether forgetful of this, as, notwithstanding his fair promises, I never heard any thing more of him, till reading in a newspaper an account of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>.\n\n\"From the above incontrovertible facts, which can be corroborated by a number of people of respectability living at this day, it is very evident that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> is not indebted to North America for the invention of steam-packets, it being hereby established beyond the possibility of doubt, to be truly British, both in idea and practice, and that Mr Fulton's steam-vessel did not make its first appearance in the Hudson River earlier than 1806 or 1807, four years at least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POSTERIOR\">posterior</a> to his having been on board the Charlotte Dundas steam-boat, and minutely examined it, when at work upon the Forth and Clyde Canal, and 18 years later than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a> of the first experiments made by me upon steam-boats, on the lake at Dalswinton, Dumfries-shire, in Great Britain.\"\n\nThe following statement upon the same point, by Mr Henry Bell of Glasgow, was addressed by him to the Editor of the Caledonian Mercury, and published in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> in October 1816:\u2014\"Sir, I observed in your paper lately a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARAGRAPH\">paragraph</a> respecting steam-boats, in which the Americans claimed the right to the discovery, which is become of so much utility to the public. On this account I propose to give you a full statement of what I conceive to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>. Mr Miller of Dalswinton first wrote upon the method of moving vessels or rafts through water by paddles, wrought by a capstan, or by the wind, in the manner of a wind-mill, which idea he afterwards gave to all the different Courts in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. It will be recollected by most people in this country, that the French proposed to erect rafts for conveying troops to invade this country by means of Mr Miller's wind-mill or capstan plan; for it may be stated that this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> built two vessels at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEITH\">Leith</a>, and put them in motion upon his new improvement, and even sent one of them to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">King</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a>, as a present. After this, he thought that an engine could be so constructed as to be applied to work his machinery for the moving of his paddles; and accordingly he employed an engineer to put his plans in execution; but they failed for want of being properly executed.\u2014But to give you a more correct account of the manner Mr Fulton, the American engineer, came to the knowledge of steam-boats, that gentleman had occasion to write me about the plans of some machinery in this country, and begged the favour of me to call on Mr Miller of Dalswinton, and see how he had succeeded in his steam-boat plan; and if it answered the end, I was to send him a full drawing and description of it, along with my machinery. This led me to have a conversation with the late Mr Miller, and he gave me every information I could wish for at the time; I told him where, in my opinion, he had erred, or was misled by his engineer; and, at the same time, I told him that I intended to give Mr Fulton my opinion on steam-boats: the friends of Mr Miller must have amongst their papers Mr Fulton's letter to me, for I left it with Mr Miller. Two years thereafter I had a letter from Mr Fulton, letting me know that he had constructed a steam-boat from the different drawings of machinery I had sent him out, which was likely to answer the end, but required some improvement on it. This letter I sent to Mr Miller, for his information, which must also be among his papers. This letter led me to think of the absurdity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> my opinion to other countries, and not putting it in practice myself in my own country; and, from these considerations, I was roused to set on foot a steam-boat, for which I made a number of different models, before I was satisfied. When I was convinced that they would answer the end, I contracted with Messrs John Wood and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">Company</a>, ship-builders in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PORT_GLASGOW\">Port-Glasgow</a>, to build me a steam-vessel, according to my plans, 40 feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KEEL\">keel</a>, and 10 feet 6 inches beam, which I fitted up with an engine and paddles, and called her the Comet, because she was built and finished the same year that a comet appeared in the north-west part of Scotland. This vessel is the first steam-boat built in Europe that answered the end, and is at this present time upon the best and simplest method of any of them; for a person sitting in the cabin will hardly hear the engine at work. She plies on the Frith of Forth, betwixt the east end of the Great Canal and Newhaven, near Leith. The distance by water is 27 miles, which she performs, in ordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, in 3\u00bd hours up, and the same down. There were many attempts to make steam-boats in this country...\nbefore this one, but none of them ever answered the end; and even three years after the Comet was set a sailing, there was a number of our first rate engineers joined together, and obtained a patent for what they conceived a new discovery on the paddles for impelling the vessel forward. They were disappointed in their plan, and had to return to the mode of the Comet.\n\nThe first American steam-boat which completely succeeded was launched at New York on the 3d October 1807 (five years before the construction of the Comet at Port-Glasgow), and soon after pried between that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALBANY\">Albany</a>, a distance of 160 miles.\n\nIn Britain, steam-vessels were first brought into use in 1812 upon the Clyde. They were built at Port-Glasgow, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GREENOCK\">Greenock</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUMBARTON\">Dumbarton</a>, where the art of ship-building had for many years been conducted by carpenters eminent in their profession. When launched, they were towed at a very trifling expense up the Clyde to Glasgow, situated in the midst of inexhaustible mines of coal and iron, and where the number of skilful practical engineers and artificers rendered the construction of the engines and machinery easy, and the prices moderate.\n\nThe early experiments were, of course, made upon a small scale. The first steam-boat actually put to use there was the Comet (40 feet keel, 10\u00bd feet beam, 4 wheels, 4 shovel-shaped paddles on each, with a cistern of fresh water to feed the boiler), built, as already mentioned, by Mr Henry Bell. She had an engine of only three horses' power, being intended merely for passengers; who, till then, had no other means of conveyance on the river than small row boats, either quite open, or supplied with only an awning to secure them from the weather. Small as this engine was, it rendered the passage certain in one tide; the vessel being able to make head-way even against the wind, and in rough weather.\n\nThe success of the first experiment soon excited competition; and a larger vessel, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a> (58 feet on deck, 11 feet beam, with an engine of 8 horses power), was completed in March 1813, and for a time proved very profitable to the proprietors. The third boat, the Clyde, which began plying in July of the same year, was still larger in her dimensions; being 70 feet keel, 75 feet on deck, 13 feet beam, with an engine of 14 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> power.\n\nAt present there are about thirty-five steam-vessels on the Frith of Clyde, some of which sail from Glasgow almost every hour, or half-hour, during daylight, to the various ports on the river, and the lochs <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> with it; as Dumbarton, Helensburgh, Loch-Long, Rothsay, Loch-Fine, and Campbellton, on the right bank, and Port-Glasgow, Greenock, Gourock, Innerkip, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGS\">Largs</a>, Milport, Ardrossan, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AYR\">Ayr</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRVINE\">Irvine</a>, Girvan, Stranraer, &c., on the left bank. Many of them occasionally visit Islay, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MULL\">Mull</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STAFFA\">Staffa</a>, Icolmkill, and adjacent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>, during the summer months; and also <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDONDERRY\">Londonderry</a>, Coleraine, and other ports of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>. Several vessels of larger dimensions, are employed as regular packets to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELFAST\">Belfast</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLE\">Isle</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">Man</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIVERPOOL\">Liverpool</a>, &c., and thus a constant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> between the united kingdoms is maintained. Since 1821, two steam-vessels have regularly sailed from Leith to Aberdeen, calling at several of the intermediate ports. Five or six steam luggage-boats are constantly employed as lighters and draggers of other boats, for the speedy conveyance of goods from Glasgow to the ports of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPORTATION\">exportation</a>, and occasionally towing large vessels in or out of harbour. The annual voyages of each of these 35 vessels may be averaged at 10,000 English miles; consequently, the whole sail 350,000 miles yearly, or nearly 14 times the circumference of our globe.\n\nThe success of steam-vessels at Glasgow soon excited attention in other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>, and several of the Clyde vessels were purchased as models. It is worthy of mention, that shortly after the time of their appearance on the Clyde, Mr Lawrence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRISTOL\">Bristol</a> established a steam-boat on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEVERN\">Severn</a>, and having carried her to ply on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THAMES\">Thames</a>, the Company of Watermen made such opposition to this innovation, that he was obliged to take her back. Now, however, not only are all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> navigable rivers in Britain thus navigated, but steam-vessels ply regularly from London to Aberdeen, sometimes passing the Pentland Frith.\n\nOn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLYHEAD\">Holyhead</a> station, to carry mails between England and Ireland, there are three steam-vessels employed, viz. the Royal Sovereign, 210 tons; two 40-horse engines; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METEOR\">Meteor</a>, 190 tons, two 30-horse engines; and the Ivanhoe, 165 tons, one 56-horse engine. They have answered the purpose much better than sailing vessels; as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of which, during the last year the latter were employed, exactly 100 Irish mails arrived in London late; while, during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> months after the steam-boats were first established, only 22 arrived late; and that winter happened to be extremely boisterous. These boats use sails occasionally, and go to sea when sailing vessels dare not leave port. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> passage of the Royal Sovereign, from Houth to Holyhead, is six hours, fifty-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> minutes; from Holyhead to Houth seven hours, thirty-six minutes. Of the Meteor, from Houth to Holyhead, seven hours, four minutes, and back, eight hours, thirteen minutes. The average passage is half the time, in which the average passage of sailing vessels used to perform the voyage. The shortest passage was from Houth to Holyhead, five hours, thirty minutes; which, the distance being about 73 miles, is nearly 12 miles an hour.\n\nIt is difficult to say what is the maximum speed of steam-vessels. Several of those between London and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARGATE\">Margate</a> make the voyage in seven hours and a half, a distance of 84 miles. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERO\">Hero</a> made the voyage, wind and tide in her favour, in six hours, sixteen minutes. The Eclipse, from Belfast to Greenock, 120 or 130 miles, has been known to come in nine hours; and, on one occasion, having about 3000 square feet of canvas set, besides the engine at work, she came from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AILSA\">Ailsa</a> to Greenock at the rate of 9 miles. The Henry Bell, a new steam-trader between Glasgow and Liverpool, has delivered goods at various warehouses in Glasgow, several hours before the invoices, or advice of the shipment, had arrived in course of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POST\">post</a>. The New York steam-vessels run up\nSteam-boats frequently ply between London and Dieppe, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROUEN\">Rouen</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAVRE\">Havre</a> de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRACE\">Grace</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CADIZ\">Cadiz</a>, Corunna, Alicante, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIGO\">Vigo</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LISBON\">Lisbon</a>, and other ports of France, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PORTUGAL\">Portugal</a>. One was lately established between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPLES\">Naples</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEGHORN\">Leghorn</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENOA\">Genoa</a>; but soon abandoned, owing to the oppression of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-QUARANTINE\">quarantine</a> laws, and the rapacity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of the Two Sicilies. Another steam-vessel was launched by an American gentleman on the Lake of Geneva; but, being a very bad sailer, it is about to be replaced by another. Every season they are becoming more numerous, and adventurous in sailing to greater distances and through heavier seas; such as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">Bay</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISCAY\">Biscay</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a>, the Baltic, the Gulfs of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINLAND\">Finland</a>, Bothnia, &c. A steam-packet, carrying the mail, now sails between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KIEL\">Kiel</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLSTEIN\">Holstein</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COPENHAGEN\">Copenhagen</a>. In the Adriatic, the Carolina goes every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> day from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRIESTE\">Trieste</a>, and the Bridano to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PAVIA\">Pavia</a>; the latter voyage being usually accomplished in 37 hours. The Royal George steam-packet makes her passage from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PORTSMOUTH\">Portsmouth</a> to Corunna in from 60 to 64 hours; a distance of between 400 and 500 miles.\n\nHaving thus endeavoured to give a sketch of the origin and progress of steam-navigation, we shall now proceed to describe the form and parts of a steam-boat (suppose of 100 tons), and to some other details, calculated to furnish a more particular view of the present state of steam-navigation in Britain and other countries.\n\nFig. 1, Plate CXVII., is an elevation; fig. 2, a longitudinal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">section</a>; fig. 3, a ground plan; fig. 4, a transverse section. The same letters refer alike to the respective parts of each figure: A, the two boilers, with their two manhole doors, one to each; B, the chimney; C, the steam <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PIPES\">pipes</a>; DD, the cylinders of the two engines; EE, the two air pumps; F, the side <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEVER\">lever</a>; one on each side of each engine; GG, the crank of the paddle-wheel shaft; H, the rod that works the steam valves or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> gear, moved backward and forward by an eccentric wheel on the shaft; I, the nozzles; K, pillars of the framing; LL, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a> where the fireman stands to put coals into the furnace; MM, place where the coals are stowed away; NN, the paddle-wheels and covers; O, ladies' parlour; P, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> cabin; Q, second cabin; having each a raised <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANTERN\">lantern</a> or sky-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, besides the lateral windows of P and Q; R, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEWARD\">steward</a>'s room; S, breakfasting-room; TT, refreshment rooms for the second cabin passengers; U, small boat ready to be let down on an emergency; V, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RUDDER\">rudder</a>; WW, seamen's beds; XX, space for lumber or spare fuel. The fireman stands in the space LL; an iron trap-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LADDER\">ladder</a> leads down to it from the deck, flush with which are two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> gratings for the admission of fresh air to himself and the fire; his coals are built up behind him, and he brings down only a few lumps at a time, which he breaks into small pieces as required. The chimney B is a series of sheet-iron cylinders rivetted at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a>, and slipt the one over the other. Each boiler has a flue within, making various convolutions under the surface of the water; through which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a>, until they enter the chimney.\n\nThese wheels being ponderous, acquire sufficient momentum to turn the crank, and supersede the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of a fly. The air-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PUMP\">pump</a>, feed-pump, and occasional <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> water-pump, are wrought by rods from FF, the side horizontal levers. To prevent the waste steam of the boilers from annoying the passengers, a pipe conveys it into the chimney. Besides this, a waste steam <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VALVE\">valve</a> is within reach of the engine-man, who loads and unloads it as he finds necessary. It is a curious fact, that a great flow of steam into the chimney prevents <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> smoke from issuing from it, which otherwise would. The paddle-wheels are firmly wedged on their shaft, and whatever pressure they exert against the water causes an equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REACTION\">reaction</a> on the vessel, which is thus impelled either forwards or backwards according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of circumvolution.\n\nThe principal cabin is painted, and otherwise tastefully fitted up, and furnished with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STOVE\">stove</a>, the chimney of which rises up through the deck. The second cabin occupies the fore-end of the vessel, and is also completely furnished, less elegantly. Small steam-boats from 30 tons upwards are generally laid out much in the same way, only varying according to the nature of their employment. When intended for sea voyages, a great part of the internal space is allotted for sleeping births.\n\nPlate CXVI. exhibits a sketch of one of the Clyde vessels, the City of Glasgow, of 300 tons.\n\nThe following is an alphabetical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of steam-vessels built in Britain:\n\n| When Built | Names of Vessels | Tonnage | Engines | Horse

1823, intended to ply between Leith and London, a distance of about 460 miles. She is impelled by two engines of 60 horse power each; her length of deck is 163 feet; breadth 27; depth of hold 16 feet, 10 inches; burden 510 tons. Her accommodations are extensive, having space for 112 beds. The ladies' cabin is eight feet high.\n\nThe Soho is, however, of somewhat smaller dimensions than the American steam-boat, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">Chancellor</a> Livingston, plying on the Hudson river between New York and Albany, constructed by Mr Fulton. The following are some particulars respecting this vessel. Her keel is 154 feet long; deck 165; broad; burden 320 tons; draft of water about seven feet three inches; principal cabin 54 feet long, 7 high; ladies' cabin, above the other, 36 long, with closets; forward cabin 30 long, 7 high. Permanent sleeping-births, in principal cabin, 38; in ladies' cabin, 24; in fore cabin, 56; in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">captain</a>'s cabin on deck, 2; engineers' and pilots', 2; forecastle, 6; fire-men, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-COOKS\">cooks</a>, &c., 6; total, 135. Her engine is of 75 horse power; diameter of cylinder 40 inches, length five feet; piston rod, 8\u00bd feet; stroke, five feet; boiler, 28 feet long, 12 broad, with two funnels; paddle-wheels, 17 feet diameter; paddle-boards five feet, ten inches long, with two fly-wheels, each 14 feet diameter, connected by pinions to the crank wheel. The machinery rises 4\u00bd feet above the deck. Average rate of sailing eight and one-half to eight and three-fourths miles an hour. With a strong wind and tide in her favour, she has made twelve; but with a strong wind and tide against her, not more than six miles per hour. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> employed on board are\u201413 mariners, 11 cooks, waiters, stewards, &c.;\u2014in all 24.\n\nThis vessel, however, is still much surpassed in size by the Lady Sherbrooke, of 787 tons, and 60 horse power; being the largest of eight which ply on the river St Lawrence. This gives 13 tons for each horse power, whereas in the Soho, the same burthen has three times as much action applied to it. The American steam-vessels, though fast sailers, are thus impelled by comparatively smaller engines than those built in this country.\n\nIt appears from the Report of the Select <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMITTEE\">Committee</a> of the House of Representatives, for session 1817, that there were then 17 large steam-boats in constant employment on the American rivers, besides ferry-boats. But since that time they have increased so rapidly, that there are now (1823) about 300.\n\nThe following are the names of 35 vessels, and their tonnage, plying on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MISSISSIPPI\">Mississippi</a> and its tributary rivers alone, viz. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALABAMA\">Alabama</a>, 200 tons; Buffalo, 300; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CEDAR\">Cedar</a> Branch, 250; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CINCINNATI\">Cincinnati</a>, 120; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">Constitution</a>, 75; Eagle, 70; Etna, 390; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCHANGE\">Exchange</a>, 200; Experiment, 40; Frankfort, 320; General Jackson, 200; General Pike, 250; Governor Shelby, 120; Harnot, 40; Hecla, 70; Henderson, 85; Independence, 300; James Monroe, 90; James Ross, 320; Johnston, 80; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KENTUCKY\">Kentucky</a>, 80; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOUISIANA\">Louisiana</a>, 54; Madison, 200; Maysville, 150; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NAPOLEON\">Napoleon</a>, 332; Ohio, 443; Paragon, 400; Rifleman, 250; Rising States, 150; St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a>, 220; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TAMERLANE\">Tamerlane</a>, 320; Vesta, 100; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VESUVIUS\">Vesuvius</a>, 390; Volcano, 250; Washington, 400;\u2014in all 7259 tons.\n\nBelonging to some of the States, there are steam frigates and ships of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> carrying guns, some of them 100-pounders. These vessels are 13 feet thick in the sides, of alternate layers of oak and cork; are so constructed, that they can eject boiling water on their enemies; and there are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> of cutlasses and pikes which project from their sides, and draw back again every fifteen seconds.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVANNAH\">Savannah</a>, of 350 tons, was the first steam-vessel that crossed the Atlantic. She arrived at Liverpool 20th June 1819, in 21 days from land to land; 18 of which her engine was going; her daily consumption of coal was about 10 tons, so that she must have had at least 200 on board, leaving 150 for the weight of engine and cargo. Her paddles were occasionally taken off, when she sailed by wind and the whole of the paddle-wheels were capable of being taken to pieces and shipped, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of bad weather. As the distance is not much short of 4000 miles, she must have averaged nearly 200 per day.\n\nBy far the greatest number of steam-vessels use low pressure engines. A larger proportion of American vessels have high pressure engines than in this country. High pressure engines are wrought with steam of a great variety of strengths, from 30 to 160 lbs. per square inch. Some engineers assert, that it is capable of being used at 1000 lbs. The steam is not condensed, but, after having acted on the piston, is allowed to blow off into the air. The diameter of their steam cylinders may be made of any size proportioned to the strength of the steam used. Thus, when it is 160 lbs., the area of the cylinder may be only a sixteenth part of the area of one using steam of 10 lbs.; consequently, a five inch cylinder wrought with such strong steam will be equal in power to a 20 inch cylinder wrought with such weak steam. High pressure engines require neither air-pump, conductor, nor the parts therewith connected; and as the volume of steam used is in proportion, their boilers may consequently be much smaller.

According to what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a> of the pressure the strength increases, we have not experiments to determine, and we therefore point out the circumstance to the notice of experimental inquirers.\n\n57. The preceding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a> being confined to the conditions under which the equilibrium could not be disturbed by the pressure, it would be quite unnecessary to consider the phenomena of actual fracture, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> it were not for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> which even these phenomena afford of the defects of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of constructing these walls. The back of the wall is generally formed of inferior materials, hence the technical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a> mortar* and *backing mortar*; but, even with inferior mortar, the workmanship is so carelessly done, towards the back of the wall, that when it fractures a portion is left behind. A moment's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of the pressure (see fig. 9) must show the importance of using good mortar, and making good bond at the back of the wall; if any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> be neglected it ought to be the middle, which is of least importance, provided the wall be well bound together by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> bond <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>.\n\nThe strength of a wall to sustain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> will always be greatly increased by any roughness <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> irregularity in the back of the wall, such as projecting stones or bricks; in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> it is easy to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> much stability by this means. The friction against a smooth wall must add much to its strength; we have not thought it necessary to include its effect in our calculations; but intend that, with counterforts, it should be considered as a set-off against accidental pressures, &c.*\n\nCounterforts are usually placed at about three times the thickness of the wall apart, and are made of the same width as the thickness of the wall. In fig. 11 is shown a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> a wall to sustain the pressure of earth according to the form proposed by Vitruvius, Lib. VI. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAP\">Cap</a>. IX. And fig. 12 is a plan from Perrault's Notes.* Various other plans have been proposed, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> of which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLONEL\">Colonel</a> Pasley has collected in his Course of Fortification; but most of them have little to recommend them. It seems desirable that every kind of curved work should be avoided; and perhaps that plan which unites the most economy with the greatest stability is shown by figs. 13 and 14, Plate CXIX. The spaces A, A, A, are proposed to be filled with gravel or fragments of stone; the whole of the stone-work to be well bonded; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> and back wall of that thickness which is best suited for bond, in the kind of material to be employed.\n\n**Bond of Walls and Cramps.**\n\n58. It is not sufficient to depend entirely upon the cementing power of mortar in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of walls; the stones themselves should also be bound together by their disposition. The art of disposing stones for this purpose is called bonding. Part of the longest stones should be employed to bind the wall in length, and the other part to bind it crossways; the former are called stretchers, the latter headers.\n\nFigs. 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19, show various methods of bonding walls; these are selected from Greek and Roman examples. The courses of stone are often <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a>, as in fig. 17; and in some works we find both irregular courses and broken ones; that is, such as are intercepted by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> blocks of stone. Broken courses should be avoided, because they occasion irregular settlements.\n\nThe bond of walls requires to be most carefully attended to in the construction of piers, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a>, and, in general, every part exposed to great strain.\n\nOn this subject it also may be remarked, that crossing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a> properly is a more effectual means of bonding a wall than that of employing very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> stones, unless they be very strong ones. For if a stone exceed about three times its thickness in\n\n---\n\n* See Philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGAZINE\">Magazine</a>, Vol. LI. p. 401, where the effect of such friction is considered.\nlength, it cannot be so equally bedded but that it is liable to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> from unequal pressure; and the fracture <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> takes place opposite to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a>, and therefore destroys the bond of the wall. This defective mode of construction we have often had occasion to notice.\n\nIn works of hewn stone destined to support great pressure, or to bear the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of a heavy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, it is necessary that the stones should be of great bulk, and connected in the firmest manner. Sometimes this is effected by forming the stones so as to lock them together. The Eddystone and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELL\">Bell</a>-Rock <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">Light</a>-Houses are bound together at the base on this principle. (See Bell-Rock in this Supplement.)\n\nWhere less strength is required, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> cramps are used, and sometimes pieces of hard stone are dovetailed into the adjoining blocks. We think cramps of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a>-iron might be employed with much advantage in all these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>.\n\n59. The proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of mortar to be employed in stone-work is another point to which it will be useful to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> the mason's attention. A stone cannot be very firmly bedded upon a very thin layer of mortar; and if the stone be of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSORBENT\">absorbent</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, the mortar will dry too rapidly to acquire any tolerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a> (Vitruvius, Lib. II. Cap. VIII.), however well it may have been prepared. On the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a> of mortar be thicker than is necessary to bed the stone firmly, the work will be a long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> in settling, and will never be perfectly stable.\n\nWhen the internal part of a wall is built with fragments of stone, they should be closely packed together, so as to require as little mortar as possible. Walls are often bulged by the hydrostatic pressure of mortar, when it is too plentifully thrown into the interior, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> the labour of filling the spaces with stones.\n\nThe walls of houses are frequently built with hewn stone on the outside, and rubble stone on the inside. The settlement of these two kinds of stone-work during the setting of the mortar are so different, that the walls often separate; or where this separation is prevented by bond stones, the wall bulges outwards, and bears unequally on its base. These evils are best prevented by using as little mortar as possible in the joints of the interior part of the wall, and not raising the wall to a great height at one time.\n\nFoundations.\n\n60. The nature of the materials employed in masonry having been considered, and also the methods of uniting them, we have, in the next place, to turn our attention to the nature of those foundations on which it is commonly required to raise permanent structures of such heavy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>.\n\nIn founding on dry ground, the nature of the foundation is ascertained without much difficulty. When it is found to be of firm hard rock, that will bear the action of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> particular precautions are necessary; but in all other cases it is desirable to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRENCHES\">trenches</a> to such a depth as will prevent them from being affected by the change of seasons. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FROST\">Frost</a>, we believe, seldom penetrates so low as two feet below the surface (see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">Climate</a> in this Supplement, Vol. III. p. 179); but in clayey ground, the effect of shrinkage, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, is often sensible at four feet below the surface; for to that depth the cracks in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> often extend. Consequently, in clay, the depth of the foundations should never be less than four feet, and in heavy buildings, deeper in proportion to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> they are to support.\n\nIn large works it is also necessary to examine the matter, inclination, and thickness of the under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRATA\">strata</a>, particularly when the upper stratum is of inconsiderable thickness. For this purpose, the older writers on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a>, with much propriety, recommend that a well should be dug near the place, to ascertain these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>. A knowledge of the inclination and nature of the strata will also be of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> in planning <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAINS\">drains</a>, a subject of no small importance to the durability and comfort of a mansion.\n\nIn soft ground the base of the wall should be made wide, and it may be reduced to the proper thickness by small off-sets or steps, as in fig. 20. On clay or dry sand the breadth at the bottom may be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> the thickness of the wall. On <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a> gravel or chalk the breadth may be to the thickness as 3 is to 2.\n\nIf the ground be soft and wet, with a firm bottom within the reach of piles, then piles may be employed with advantage; but they are very likely to rot, in a few years, where the ground is not wet; and, therefore, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of soft ground, not sufficiently wet to preserve piles from decay, we should recommend, in preference, a very wide base or footing, well bonded together, with bars of cast-iron, disposed so that one part could not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> without causing the adjoining ones to go <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> at the same time; and the whole of the base should, for greater strength, be built in the best water cement.\n\nIt is a practice with some architects to employ <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a> beams and planking in such cases, and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of its decay, in many instances it has been necessary to replace the timber with stone and brick at an enormous expense. It should be a maxim in construction, never to employ timber in a permanent structure where it is not either absolutely wet or perfectly dry.\n\nWhen ground is very soft and wet, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> stratum is beyond the reach of piles, a solid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> may be formed to erect the superstructure upon; by means of a grating of timber, planked over. The brick or stone work which is built upon the planking should be joined with a water cement.\n\nWhen such ground is not absolutely wet, instead of planking we would employ a connected grating of cast-iron, with stone or brick work built in water mortar.\n\nIn all these cases the greatest difficulty consists in preventing irregular settlements; and hence the advantage of employing wood or iron to bind the base together, and render it, as far as possible, an inflexible and solid mass.\n\nIn all edifices which press perpendicularly on their foundations, the centre of pressure should coincide, as nearly as may be, with the centre of gravity of the surface which sustains it. In wharf walls, ter-\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> walls, abutments and piers of bridges, and the like, the resultant of the pressures should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> in the centre of gravity of the surface which supports it.\n\nFoundations are most difficult to manage where the ground is irregular, particularly for highly finished buildings, which are so much disfigured by a small settlement. In such cases we would endeavour to procure an inflexible base by means of cast-iron beams. It is a good plan to form <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTER\">counter</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a> under the openings, provided these arches be carefully built; but where they are not well built, they yield so much as to be no better than common walling.\n\nExcavating and removing the earth from foundations is frequently a considerable part of the expense of large works; hence the peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of management which will economize this branch of labour, has become an interesting subject of investigation. We intended to give an outline of the manner of treating it, but we find that it would extend this article far beyond its proper limits.\n\n61. Founding in water may be done in various ways; most of them are very expensive, presenting many difficulties in deep and rapid water; we shall confine our attention to this case only. The best method now in use consists in excluding the water from the space to be founded upon by means of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAM\">dam</a>, called a coffer-dam, formed by rows of piles, with bricks or clay between the rows. When bricks are used, it is necessary to caulk the interstices between pile and pile. The space is kept clear of water by means of engines, and the foundation deepened, and piled if necessary.\n\nConsidering the immense expense and risk of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, which is encountered in excluding water of 30 or 40 feet depth, we shall here propose, for suitable ground, a more economical and safe method, which is adapted for founding piers, abutments, sea-walls, &c.\n\nThe space for the foundation being cleared, let the space it is to occupy be inclosed by a single row of piles, driven near to one another, but not so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> as is necessary for a dam. The upper ends of these piles must be high enough for a stage to be formed upon them; which should be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> above the height of floods or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-TIDES\">tides</a> as the case may be. From this stage, the ground within the inclosure may be excavated, by means of a machine, formed so as to combine the principle of the field <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLOUGH\">plough</a> with that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DREDGING\">dredging</a>-machine. (See Dredging-Machine in this Supplement.)\n\nWhen the foundation has been cleared to a proper depth by this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a>, and levelled, the stone-work may be built in courses with a proper bed and joint of water cement. (See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">Sect</a>. I. art. 22.) A simple machine might easily be contrived for the purpose. If brick be employed instead of stone, it may be done, by forming the bricks into blocks of three feet long, and eighteen inches square, with cement, and using these blocks instead of stones. This method of building with blocks is already in use for constructing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SEWERS\">sewers</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>. When the work is brought to that height which will enable the workmen to proceed in the ordinary manner, either then or afterwards, the piles may be cut off at low-water line, and a cap-sill being fixed upon their tops, they will remain, and serve as a protection to the work below water.\n\n62. For many purposes it would not be necessary to excavate, nor yet to build in courses; for example, let us suppose it to be the pier of a light <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a>, the row of piles being driven in an elliptical form, a strong chain should encircle it at one or two places, and the internal space filled with rough stones, thrown in with water cement, to fill the interstices between them. As the cement indurated, the whole mass would become one solid stone. This mode of construction is effected on the same principle as that the French term \"Les Enrochements en B\u00e9ton\" (Gauthey, Construction des Ponts, II. p. 276); and we have the advantage of a much superior cement to any they have employed.\n\nSect. III.\u2014Stone-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">Cutting</a>.\n\n63. Before we proceed to explain methods of forming stones to the particular shapes required for arches, vaults, &c., it may be remarked, that the young mason should be extremely careful to avoid making the beds of stones concave or hollow. For, if this be done, in any case where the stones have to bear much pressure, they will flush, or break off in flakes at the joints, and entirely disfigure the work. It is better that they should be slightly convex. In the construction of piers and columns, where perfectness of form is at least as much regarded as strength, this maxim should be carefully attended to. Nothing can be more offensive to the eye than a flushed joint, since it not only deforms, but also gives the idea of want of strength.\n\n64. Stone-cutting may be equally well done by various methods; the most certain consists in forming as many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> surfaces to the stone as may be necessary, in such manner that these surfaces may include the intended form, with the least waste of stone, or in the most convenient way for applying the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOULDS\">moulds</a>. Upon the plane surfaces thus prepared, the proper moulds are to be applied, and the stone worked to them. It will generally happen that the bed of the stone will be one of the first plane surfaces, and the arrangement should always be made, so that there may be as little reworking as possible.*\n\n65. When an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> is square to the face of the wall, the only difficulty is in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> it to the proper curve. When the arch is circular, it may be described from a centre, unless the centre be very distant; and in that case a method proposed by Dr T. Young\u2020 will be found extremely convenient for the mason's purposes. Fig. 21 represents the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a>. Three points in the curve being known, it is easily\n\n---\n\n* Frezier may be consulted with advantage on this subject. Coup\u00e9 des Pierres.

Plate VI. fig. 83. This instrument might be usefully applied in Ship-building.\nadjusted to the curve, and will also answer as a mould in many cases. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">AB</a> is a straight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> of any convenient length; at each end, a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROLLER\">roller</a> is fixed by means of two plates of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a>; against these rollers the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> bar CD slides as it adapts itself to a regular curvature, when moved by the screw E. The natural form of the elastic bar is shown by C'D', the depth in the middle, H, should be double the depth at either end, and the breadth uniform throughout the length. This bar, when of wood, should be of straight-grained ash, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANCE\">lance</a>-wood; the latter is best.\n\nAn elliptic arch may be described by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, in the following manner. On a straight bar AB, fig. 22, if AC be made equal to the height of the arch, and CB equal to half the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAN\">span</a>, then if the end A be moved along a straight edge, ED, while the point B moves along another straight edge, FD, the point C will describe an ellipse.* If the bar be made to move on rollers, an arch on a large scale may be easily and accurately described in this way, when a trammel would become very unmanageable. For other methods, see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELLIPTOGRAPH\">Elliptograph</a> in this Supplement.\n\nTo find the direction of the joints, with a radius equal to half the span, from the point K, fig. 22, as a centre describe the arc GH, which determines the points G,H, called the foci. Let it now be required to draw the joint I, join IG, and IH, draw LI to bisect the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> GIH, and it is the joint at I.\n\nA parabolical arch may be drawn very easily on a large scale by means of tangents. Make AE, fig. 23, equal to the rise CA, and join ED and EB. Draw FG <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to DB, and divide DF and EG (which are equal) each into the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of equal parts, then join 11, 22, 33, &c., as is shown in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>; a curve drawn to touch these tangents is a parabola.\n\nArches are most conveniently drawn on a large scale by means of parallel ordinates; and an extremely simple method of this kind, for a parabolic arch, has been described by Professor Leslie. (Inquiry into the Nature of Heat, p. 593.) Let AB, fig. 24, be the span, and CD the height. Divide AB into twenty equal parts, and raise a perpendicular from each point of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">section</a>. Let CD be 100 by a scale of equal parts, make the next ordinate on each side 99 parts, or 9 X 11, by the scale; the next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of ordinates make 96 parts, or 8 X 12, and so on; those numbers being respectively as the rectangles of the segments into which AB is divided.\n\nTo draw the joints of a parabolic arch, let I be a point, at which a joint is to be drawn, fig. 24; draw Id parallel to BA; and make DT equal to Dd; join IT, and make EI perpendicular to IT, which is the joint required.\n\n66. The finest form for a Gothic arch is a cubic parabola; it is easily constructed from its equation.\n\nObserving that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERTEX\">vertex</a> of the curve is at the springing of the arch, and making x the abscissa, and y its corresponding ordinate, by the nature of the curve \\(x = \\frac{y^2}{a}\\). Now, if we make y successively equal to 1, 2, 3, &c. feet, we shall have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{a} &= x^1; \\\\\n\\frac{8}{a} &= x^{11}; \\\\\n\\frac{27}{a} &= x^{11}; \\\\\n\\frac{64}{a} &= x^{14}; \\\\\n\\frac{125}{a} &= x^{15}; \\\\\n\\frac{216}{a} &= x^{16}; \\\\\n\\frac{343}{a} &= x^{17}; \\\\\n\\frac{512}{a} &= x^{18}; \\\\\n\\frac{729}{a} &= x^{19}; \\\\\n&\\text{&c.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTo find a, when x is equal to half the span CD, fig. 25, Plate CXX., and \\(y = \\text{the height <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-AD\">AD</a>};\\) we have \\(a = \\frac{AD^3}{CD}\\). If it be desirable that the ordinates should be \\(1 - n\\)th part of a foot apart, then divide each by the \\(n^3\\), which gives the dimensions in feet.\n\nExample. In a Gothic building it is proposed to make an arch to an opening 10 feet wide, the height of which is to be 4 feet 6 inches above the springing line. There CD = 5 feet, and AD = 4.5 feet, therefore \\(a = \\frac{AD^3}{CD} = \\frac{91.125}{5} = 18.225\\). And using this number for a divisor, the ordinates are easily found, by once setting a slide rule, to be,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx &= 0.0548 \\text{ feet}; \\\\\nx &= 0.068 \\text{ feet}; \\\\\nx &= 0.438; \\\\\nx &= 1.48; \\\\\nx &= 3.51; \\\\\nx &= 6.86; \\\\\no &= 0.068; \\\\\no &= 0.185; \\\\\no &= 0.857;\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nAnd dividing the first, third, and fifth, each by 8 (considering \\(n = 2\\)), gives the intermediate ordinates; \\(o_1, o_{11}, o_{111}\\). The advantage of this method consists in the facility of setting out the work on either a large or small scale. Every practical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> is aware of the trouble of dividing a distance into equal parts, or of performing other geometrical operations on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATFORM\">platform</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a>; but here, by an easy arithmetical operation, this is avoided. Draw the springing line CD, and the middle line AD; and let the line EC be drawn parallel to AD. Beginning at D, make a mark at every 6 inches on DA, and also on CE, beginning at C; then, through these divisions draw the parallel ordinates. Let the abscissas be measured off on these ordinates, from the line CE by a rod divided into feet, tenths and hundredths of a foot. Put a nail in at each point found in the curve, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEND\">bend</a> an uniform lath against the nails, and mark the curve.\n\n67. Our next example is for the purpose of show-\n\n---\n\n* See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> Review, Vol. VI. p. 387. A most ingenious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of the principles of describing curved <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> has been lately invented by Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a> Jopling, which promises to be of much use in the arts, as well as a curious subject for mathematical speculation. The system is somewhat obscurely announced in a Pamphlet, entitled The Septenary System of Generating Curves by Continued Motion. London, 1823.\ning the principles of constructing an arch for a bridge, when the span is considerable. In the Article BRIDGE, Prop. S, the equation of the curve of equilibrium is found to be \\( y = \\frac{1}{m} ax^2 + \\frac{1}{2} bx^4 \\), for a disposition of the load which has place commonly in bridges. Making \\( x \\) successively 10, 20, 30, &c. feet, we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\ny_1 &= \\frac{50}{m}(a+16\\frac{3}{8}b), \\\\\ny_2 &= \\frac{200}{m}(a+66\\frac{3}{8}b), \\\\\ny_3 &= \\frac{450}{m}(a+150b), \\\\\ny_4 &= \\frac{800}{m}(a+266\\frac{3}{8}b), \\\\\ny_5 &= \\frac{1250}{m}(a+416\\frac{3}{8}b), \\\\\ny_6 &= \\frac{1800}{m}(a+600b), \\\\\ny_7 &= \\frac{2450}{m}(a+816\\frac{3}{8}b), &c., &c.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThe curve of equilibrium being to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> at the middle of the depth of the arch-stones, CB, fig. 26, will be the height \\( h \\), and AB the semi-span \\( S \\); also let the depth of the arch and roadway at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>, or \\( a \\), be 7 feet; and suppose the quantity of matter be so regulated by hollow spandrels that \\( b = \\frac{10}{S^2} \\).\n\nUnder these conditions we shall have\n\n\\[\nm = S^2 \\left( a + \\frac{1}{6} b S^2 \\right) = \\frac{S^2}{2h} \\left( 7 + \\frac{10}{6} \\right)\n\\]\n\nIf the semi-span be 72 feet, and the height 24 feet, then \\( m = 936 \\), and \\( b = -00193 \\). Calculating the ordinates from these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATA\">data</a>, we shall have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\ny_1 &= 375, \\\\\ny_2 &= 152, \\\\\ny_3 &= 35, \\\\\ny_4 &= 64, \\\\\ny_5 &= 104, \\\\\ny_6 &= 157, \\\\\ny_7 &= 224, \\\\\nAD &= 240.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nConstruct the curve according to these ordinates, and divide it for the arch-stones. The joints should be perpendicular to this curve; but great accuracy is not necessary in this respect, provided the inclination from that perpendicular be considerably within the angle of repose. (See BRIDGE, Prop. Z.)\n\nThe joints may be drawn thus, with any radius:\n\nfrom the next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> on one side of the joint \\( a \\) describe an arc, and from the next division on the other side, with the same radius describe another arc to intersect the former one, through the intersection and the division \\( a \\) draw the direction of the joint.\n\nTo find the depth of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KEY\">key</a>-stone, let the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> thrust \\( m = 986 \\) be multiplied by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> specific weight of a cubic foot of the materials to form the bridge, and calculate the depth by equation (17). Suppose the mean to be 160 lbs. then the horizontal pressure will be 149,760 lbs. and\n\n\\[\n\\frac{fbd}{4} = 149,760; \\quad \\text{which, considering } b = \\text{unity, gives} \\quad d = \\frac{599,040}{f}.\n\\]\n\nFor Craigleith stone, No. 15, Table III. the key-stone should be 6 feet deep.\n\nTo find the depth of the arch-stones at any other part of the arch, set off BC equal the depth at the key-stone, and draw BC parallel to a tangent to the curve of equilibrium at the point where the depth is to be determined, then BC is the depth at that point.\n\nThe depth at a sufficient number of points being found as above, and set off equally on each side of the curve of equilibrium, the form of the intrados will be determined, which may be terminated by a circular arc at the springing; and it is not a little remarkable that the arch, thus described from principle, is a pointed arch.\n\n68. When an arch cuts a plane wall in an oblique direction, there is a little more scope for the art of the stone-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTER\">cutter</a>. But previously to attempting to proceed further, we would recommend the young student to make himself <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of the principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROJECTION\">projection</a>, development, and solid angles. The first section of the Article JOINERY in this Supplement is wholly restricted to these principles; all of which being equally applicable to both arts, it will be unnecessary to repeat them in this place.\n\nLet an elliptical arch be supposed to cut a plane wall obliquely, and the wall to be inclined, ABCD, fig. 27, is the plan of the arch; EF a section at right angles to its direction; IH a section at right angles to the line AB. Project the inclined face of the wall, as shown at AO PB, by the method of projecting planes (JOINERY, Sect. I. and II.); and in doing this it will be found an advantage to produce the joints till they cut the base line EF, because the angles will be set out with greater accuracy from long lines. In the case where the wall is vertical, the section and projection of the face are not required.\n\nNext let the soffit be developed, on the supposition that the arch is a polygon of as many sides as there are arch-stones. (See JOINERY, Sect. I. art. 13.) KLMN shows the development of the soffit or soffit moulds. The form of the bed of each stone is\n\n---\n\n*Monge, in an elaborate article on the application of Descriptive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">Geometry</a> to the use of Architects, has drawn a very erroneous conclusion respecting the joints of vaults and arches; for it is the direction of the pressure, and not the form of the soffit, which determines the best direction for a joint; but the views developed in the Article BRIDGE were not known at the time Monge wrote. In other respects, the article of Monge is well worthy of the attention of the mason. See G\u00e9om\u00e9trie Descriptive, article 130, 4me ed. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, 1820.*\nshown by the planes \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(d\\), and is thus found, for the joint, \\(4\\), draw \\(he\\) and \\(mf\\) parallel to \\(EF\\), and produce the joint \\(8+4\\) on the development to cut \\(he\\) in \\(g\\); set off \\(ge\\) equal to \\(4i\\), and draw \\(ef\\) parallel to \\(48\\); then, a line drawn from \\(e\\) through the point \\(4\\), will give the bevel at one end, and a line drawn from \\(f\\) through \\(8\\) gives the bevel at the other end; its width is equal to \\(4k\\) on the section. As there are no curved parts, except the soffit of the arch, the stones may be worked by means of bevels, without having moulds made for the soffits and beds.*\n\n69. When a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> crosses a canal in an oblique direction, the bridge is often made oblique. When the angle does not vary more than ten or twelve degrees from a right angle, the arch-stones may be formed as already described; but in cases of greater obliquity, a different principle of construction is necessary. These cases should, however, be avoided wherever it is possible; as, however solid the construction of an oblique bridge may be in reality, it has neither that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> solidity nor fitness which ought to characterize an useful and pleasing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>.\n\nAn oblique arch may be constructed on the principle of its being a right arch of a larger span, as is shown in fig. 28. Let \\(ABCD\\) be the plan, and \\(EFGH\\) the corresponding points in the elevation, in this elevation the dotted lines show the parts which would not be seen.\n\nThe joints of the arch are supposed to be divided upon the middle section, and therefore drawn to the mean centre \\(K\\), which corresponds to the point \\(I\\) on the plan.\n\nDivide \\(AD\\) into any number of equal parts, as at \\(1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\), and transferring these points to the elevation; describe the arch belonging to each point, and also draw the parallel lines \\(11, 22, \\ldots\\) on the plan.\n\nTo find the mould for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARRIS\">arris</a> of any joint, as \\(a\\), draw \\(ab\\) parallel to the base line \\(EF\\), and from \\(a\\), as a centre, transfer the distances of the points where the arches cut the joint, to the line \\(ab\\). Then let fall perpendiculars from the points in the line \\(ab\\) to the lines \\(11, 22, \\ldots\\) in the plan, whence we find \\(a, m, n, o, p\\), in the curve of the mould for the arris of the joint \\(a\\). The mould for any other joint may be found in the same manner. The ends of the arch-stones will be square to the joints, and \\(pcde\\) will be the mould for one end, and \\(acdf\\) the mould for the other end. It will be of some advantage in working the arch-stones to observe, that the arch-stone being in its place, the soffit should be everywhere perfectly straight in a direction parallel to the horizon.\u2020\n\n70. If it be required to construct an arch in the wall of a circular building, as in fig. 29, where \\(ABCD\\) is the plan of the wall, the elevation \\(EF\\) should be drawn, and the joints in the same manner, as if the arch were in a plane wall. The curved surface of Walls. The soffit should be correctly developed by the process described in the Article Joinery, art. 13, and the moulds made of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEXIBLE\">flexible</a> material; these soffit moulds are shown at \\(a, b, c, \\ldots\\). The mould for the joint \\(2\\) may be found by dividing the joint into any number \\(m, n, \\ldots\\) parts; and let a perpendicular fall from each point of division to the curved lines representing the faces of the wall on the plan, and from each point in which the curved lines are intersected by these perpendiculars, draw a line parallel to \\(EF\\). Also, from \\(2\\), as a centre, transfer the divisions on the joint to the horizontal line \\(f2\\), and from thence let perpendiculars fall, which will cut the lines that are parallel to \\(EF\\) in the points through which the curves of the mould must be drawn, as shown by the shaded part \\(P\\) on the plan. Any other joint may be described in the same manner.\u2021 In the figure, the section is drawn, because it shows somewhat more distinctly the size of the arch-stones; it is not necessary in finding the moulds, except the face of the wall be inclined, a case of very rare occurrence in practice. An arch in a circular wall always has the appearance of a want of strength on the convex side; and when the curvature is considerable, it becomes absolutely insecure.\n\nThe method describing the raking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOULDINGS\">mouldings</a>, so as to mitre with horizontal ones, has been explained in the Article Joinery in this Supplement, art. 21\u201424, and the same methods apply in masonry.\n\n71. Respecting the general principles of stairs, we may also refer the reader to Joinery, art. 39, 40, where the proportions of steps, &c. are shown; in masonry the kinds termed geometrical stairs are the only ones which offer any considerable difficulty in the execution.\n\nEach step of a geometrical stair is partly supported by wedging its end into the wall of the staircase, and it is further strengthened by resting upon the step below it. The outward end of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of these steps is represented by fig. 7, Plate CXVIII.; the line \\(abc\\) shows the form of the joint between two adjoining steps; in the straight part of a flight of stairs, \\(ab\\) is made about an inch, and the part \\(bc\\) is made perpendicular to the soffit of the stair, and of such a depth as may be required for the kind of stone. As this depth is determined by the mean depth necessary to render a stair safe, we shall here give an example of computing the mean depth of a step for Craigleith stone, by\n\n* Our method is analogous to that called Biais par abr\u00e9g\u00e9 by the French writers.

Masonry is the art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>; the art of reducing stones to regular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> determinate forms is sometimes called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a>, but is usually considered a branch of masonry. Workers in marble are also called masons; but it is stone-masonry only which we intend to treat of in this article; as marble masonry is rather a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANUAL\">manual</a> than a scientific art.\n\n2. The art of building with stone is undoubtedly of great antiquity; and its early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> is difficult to trace beyond the existing remains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> buildings; the oldest of which are objects of wonder, chiefly on account of the difficulty of moving, with ordinary powers, the immense stones of which they are formed. There is one thing remarkable in these stupendous efforts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> labour; its directors have often been happy in the choice of almost imperishable materials, for a lasting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> of their command of power. The remains of this kind of gigantic masonry are found in various parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>; some of the finest specimens are the ancient Egyptian buildings; which seem to have been intended to resist the power of men, as well as the slow operations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>.\n\n3. The masonry of the ancient Greeks closely resembles that of the Egyptians; it is a more refined application of the same principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a>, to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of chaste and beautiful architectural forms, in which the ornamental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the art has evidently been in that state of perfection, which is rarely, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> ever surpassed. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a> of the Octagon Temple of the Winds may be considered the best example of their constructive skill, while it betrays their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> of the principles of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a>.\n\n4. In Roman masonry we find less of ponderous strength, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> construction, than in the Egyptian and Greek, and rarely anything approaching to the accurate and highly finished labours of the latter, but considerably more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> and economical knowledge. If the manner of forming <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a>* and domes was not actually invented by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, at least the merit of applying them successfully, in the art of building, was undoubtedly theirs; they also excelled in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of mortars and cements; hence, they found it easy to construct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> works at a moderate expense, which could not have been accomplished by the limited methods of building of their predecessors. It gives us a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> notion of the intrinsic value of the art of masonry, to examine its application by the Romans, whether it be in the celebrated Cloacae, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AQUEDUCTS\">Aqueducts</a>, Bridges, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">Military</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROADS\">Roads</a> of those enterprising people. To them also we owe the beautiful idea of covering a temple with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOME\">dome</a>.\n\n5. After the decline of the Romans, the art of Early masonry, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, gradually acquired its former importance through its application to the construction of castles, towers, and other places of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>; and eventually, it gained a complete ascendancy over the other building arts in the construction of Cathedrals, Monasteries, and the like. In our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> it made an equal if not a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of progress than on the Continent. The science of masonry\u2020 appears to have attained the most perfect state it arrived at in those times, about the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">King</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">College</a> Chapel, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>, was built (about 1512). From that time, or soon after, the knowledge of construction declined; but the researches of men of science have, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> times, more than replaced those lost principles which, there can be little doubt, the elder free-masons possessed. Unfortunately, such principles are, even at the present time, as inaccessible to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> workman as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MYSTERIES\">mysteries</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>-mason were to the apprentice and fellow-craft of former ages; unless it be in some rare instances where the force of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> genius has risen superior to the difficulties before it, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> workman, like the \"prentice of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROSLIN\">Roslin</a> Chapel,\" has outstripped the masters of technical science.\n\n6. The most important principle of the free-masons, or, as they are usually called, the \"Gothic builders,\" was that of reducing all the pressures of a vaulted roof to a few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> supports. These supports were either strong pillars, or buttresses, accordingly as the support was within the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a>, or formed a part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> wall. The buttresses were made of considerable depth in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of the pressure, with a thin wall from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUTTRESS\">buttress</a> to buttress, for enclosing the building. If they had made the external walls of uniform thickness, according to the modern practice, a much greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of material would have been required to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> the pressure of the vaulting. For similar reasons, the strength of their best vaulting consists in deep moulded ribs; the spaces between these ribs being formed of thin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> stones, supported from rib to rib.\n\n---\n\n* Perhaps the oldest arches, at present known, are those which Mr Belzoni discovered in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>; they are executed in bricks of the same size, and of the same material, as those the Egyptians used in the construction of their walls and pyramids. For farther remarks on the subject of Arches, see the Article <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIDGE\">BRIDGE</a>, in this Supplement; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARL\">Earl</a> of Aberdeen's Inquiry respecting Grecian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">Architecture</a>, page 191\u2014211.\n\n\u2020 What other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> than science can be applied to that knowledge, which enables a mason to dispose large masses of stone-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> over a considerable area, with only a few distant supports?\nThe principles of construction of the Gothic builders may be readily shown by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> of wicker work, in the manner of Sir James <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HALL\">Hall</a>'s truly elegant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of explaining his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> respecting the origin of Gothic vaulting. The earliest notice we have seen, in architectural works, of any thing resembling the principles of construction <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> noticed, is given by Alberti, who, alluding to a method of building known to former architects, says, \"The arches on which the roof was placed being drawn quite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to the foundation with wonderful art, known but to few; so that the work upheld itself by being only set upon arches; for those arches having the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> earth for a chain, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> wonder they stood firm without any other support.\"\n\n7. Masonry, with some other arts, having been drawn out of their ordinary course by the peculiar state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> in the middle ages, fell back to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a>, if not below it, at the Reformation; the natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of this change was the loss of the greater part of the knowledge which had been gained by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> of several centuries. But even in the most depressed state of masonry, there were some individuals in whom the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of that excellence which animated their predecessors, was not subdued by want of encouragement; and some scattered works were executed which are worthy of notice, if our limited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> would allow of it.\n\n8. When <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> had become happily free from all internal disturbances, and there was little to occupy the time and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of a rapidly increasing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a>, except the improvement of their own condition in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> fruit of their exertions for this purpose was, an unprecedented <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of the foreign and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> trade of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>; wharfs, docks, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HARBOURS\">harbours</a>, and lighthouses; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CANALS\">canals</a>, locks, roads, and bridges, became the necessary appendages of this new state of things; and, accordingly, it became desirable again to cultivate the art of masonry.\n\nThese important works also called forth a new profession, of which the celebrated Smeaton has been called the father. Smeaton's first work was the Eddystone <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTHOUSE\">Lighthouse</a>, which, in originality of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>, and soundness of construction, has not been equalled. Since its erection, such a succession of bold and useful works have been accomplished, that it would be difficult to enumerate them; it is sufficient to remark, that the masonry of our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> and country, as it is exhibited in these works, is without a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> in preceding times.\n\n9. In the northern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> of Europe, their best works are chiefly modelled after ours; and, with the exception of France, there is not in the southern states any considerable degree of encouragement given to any branch of masonry. It may nevertheless be remarked, that the principles of construction is a popular subject of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>.\n\n10. In France, masonry has always been a popular art; partly, perhaps, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> being situate in the midst of a district which abounds in excellent building stone. The French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> has always directed a considerable share of attention to the construction of roads, bridges, and military works; and, consequently, has afforded sufficient scope for its improvement. When, however, the larger works of the French masons are compared with those of our own countrymen, one very remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> may be observed; the French works have more of the character of daring experiments, than that which ought to belong to the works of regular professors of an art; while the British works of the same kind have evidently been directed by men better versed in practical construction than in the refinements of science. There is, perhaps, more of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a> in the French works than is to be found in ours; but it may be remarked, that this novelty of character is often obtained by a sacrifice of fitness; as in the cataract dome of the Pantheon, &c.; or of strength, as in the bridges of Nogent, Neuilly, &c. The true criterion of excellence in a useful art seems to be, fitness for producing the desired end in the best possible manner.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">Sect</a>. I.\u2014Of Materials used in Masonry.\n\n11. The first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of attention, in a treatise on masonry, ought to be, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the materials employed in it; because the greater part of the principles of an art always depend on the nature of the substances it is to be exercised upon.\n\nOf Stones.\n\n12. Building stone is a dense, coherent body, of considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a> and durability, but generally brittle. It possesses these qualities in various degrees, according to the nature of its chemical elements, or the state of aggregation of its parts.\n\nThe structure of stones is either laminated or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANULATED\">granulated</a>, or of a mixed kind.\n\nThe chemical constituents of building stones are silica, alumina, lime, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNESIA\">magnesia</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a>; combined with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, and sometimes with alkalis; some other chemical elements are found in building stones, but not often in sufficient quantity to affect the nature of the stones.\n\n13. Laminated stones consist of thin plates, or layers, cohering more or less strongly together; when the layers are of considerable size, and cohere so slightly that they may be easily separated, the stones are said to be slaty. The layers are always nearly parallel to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARRY\">quarry</a>-beds of the stone, and they should always be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a>, or as nearly so as\n\n---\n\n* <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> on the Origin, History, and Principles of Gothic Architecture, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, 1813. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARE\">Ware</a> has collected most of the forms employed, in his Tracts on Vaults, &c. London, 1822.\n\n\u2020 Architecture of Leon Baptista Alberti (Leoni's Translation), Book I, Chap. XII.\n\n\u2021 See the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">Articles</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELL\">Bell</a>-Rock Lighthouse, Bridge, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAKWATER\">Breakwater</a>, Caledonian Canal, Docks, in this Supplement.\npossible, in a building; otherwise the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> cause them to separate, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> off in flakes. In sandstones, the direction of the layers may often be discovered by their different shades of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>; in others, by the position of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> scales of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MICA\">mica</a>, which always <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> parallel to the layers. In most stones the direction of the layers may be ascertained by the facility with which the stone yields to the tool in that direction; but a considerable degree of practice is necessary to acquire so nice a discrimination of resistance, and good workmen only attain it. Among laminated stones, those are the most durable in which the laminae are least distinct, and the texture uniform. When the laminae do not perfectly cohere, they are soon injured by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FROST\">frost</a>, and they are wholly unfit for places alternately wet and dry.\n\n14. Granular stones consist of distinct concretions resembling grains, either of the same, or of different simple minerals cohering together. When the structure is uniform, and the grains or concretions are small, stones of this kind are always strong and durable, if the concretions themselves be so. Granular stones are sometimes open and porous, but when they are uniformly so, they seldom suffer materially by frost; because their uniform porosity allows the expansive force of congealing water to be distributed in every direction.\n\n15. Stones of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> structure, partly laminated and partly granular, have more or less of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> of the two classes before described; for it may be observed in coarse-grained <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANITE\">granite</a> that the laminated structure of some of its parts renders it very susceptible of disintegration.\n\nAll kinds of stone obtained from quarries are found divided by vertical or inclined seams, which are sometimes so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> that they cannot be distinguished till the stones are wrought; but they often separate under the tool at such seams; and it is not safe to employ stone to resist any considerable transverse strain on account of the difficulty of knowing where those seams are.\n\n16. In the present state of our knowledge of this important subject, we may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> the failure of building stones to two causes; the one chemical, and the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a>, which we shall here distinguish by the terms decomposition and disintegration.\n\n17. Decomposition consists in the chemical elements of a stone entering into new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a> with water, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OXYGEN\">oxygen</a>, or carbonic acid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAS\">gas</a>. Stones containing such elements as are readily acted upon by these external causes will be found most subject to decompose; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> will be, in many kinds, much hastened by a loose texture.\n\nStones containing saline <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, as the felspar of some granites, are acted upon by water, particularly where the soluble <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> is in considerable proportion; and in some stones the application of salt water soon destroys them. Dolomieu says, the houses at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALTA\">Malta</a> are built with a fine-grained <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">limestone</a>, of a loose and porous texture, which speedily moulders away when it has been wetted with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> water. (Kirwan's Geological Essays, p. 148, 149.)\n\nStones containing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, which is not in a maximum state of oxidation, are often destroyed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSORPTION\">absorption</a> of oxygen and carbonic acid; the presence of moisture accelerates their decomposition, and it is always still further hastened by increase of temperature. According to the observations of Kirwan, stones containing iron in a low state of oxidation are of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a>, or a bluish colour; and in some instances, when united with alumina and magnesia, they are of a gray, or a greenish gray; the former, as they become more oxygenized, change to purple, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">orange</a>, and finally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a>; the latter become at first blue, then purple, red, &c. (Kirwan's Geological Essays, p. 145, 6.) But stones containing iron, combined with its maximum of oxygen, do not readily decompose, such are red porphyry, jaspers, &c. When stones contain manganese, lime, alumina, carbon, or bitumen, in particular states, they are subject to decomposition, from the affinities of one or other of these bodies; but nothing very decisive is, or perhaps can be, known respecting such changes, till some improvement be made in analytical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">chemistry</a>, by which the state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of the constituents of minerals can be determined with more certainty.\n\n18. Disintegration is the separation of the parts of stones by mechanical action. The chief cause is the congelation of water in the minute pores and fissures of stones, which bursts them open, or separates small parts according as the structure is slaty or irregularly granulated. The south sides of buildings, in northern climates, are most subject to fail; because the surface is often thawed and filled with wet in the sunny part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, and frozen again at night. This repeated operation of freezing is also very injurious to sea walls, the piers of bridges, and other works exposed alternately to water and frost.* The decay and destruction of rocks being the effects of the same natural causes, the reader will find some further illustration of this subject in the Article <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINERALOGY\">MINERALOGY</a> in this Supplement, Vol. V. p. 477.\n\n19. The resistance of stones to wear and tear is, for many purposes, a subject which it would be useful to investigate, since on this resistance depends also the labour of working them. From some experiments made by Rondelet, it appears that granite will bear eight times as much wear as veined <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> marble; and that the labour of sawing granite was about ten times greater than that of sawing veined white marble. (Trait\u00e9 de l'Art de B\u00e2tir, Tome I. p. 95.)\n\nScotland abounds in quarries of excellent building sandstone; such, in particular, are the quarries at Culello, in Fifehire, which furnished the stones for the monument erected at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-YARMOUTH\">Yarmouth</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Nelson, and that at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> to the memory of Lord Melville. Nothing can exceed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> of the sandstone used in those noble\n\n* The decayed state of the piers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WESTMINSTER\">Westminster</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACKFRIARS\">Blackfriars</a>' Bridges shows us how very little this important subject has been studied; as well as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of studying it.\nstructures; and besides beauty, and other valuable qualities, it has in a high degree that of being easily chiselled into the smoothest and finest forms.\n\nOf Mortars and Cements.\n\n20. In the greater part of works executed in stone, it is necessary to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> some kind of cementitious matter for connecting the parts together, to render them firm and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a>. Works to be exposed to the action of water, immediately after being built, require this cementitious matter to be of such a nature, that it will indurate under water. Hence it is, that we have occasion for two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTAR\">mortar</a>; one which will set and harden under water, called a water mortar, or cement; and common mortar.\n\n21. If a piece of limestone, or chalk, be slowly calcined, so as to expel the whole, or nearly the whole, of its carbonic acid, it loses about 44 per cent. of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>; and on a small quantity of water being added, it swells, gives out <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, and falls into a finely divided powder, called slackened lime. The bulk of the powder is about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> that of the limestone. If this powder be rapidly formed into a stiff paste with water, it sets or solidifies as a hydrate of lime, and ultimately hardens by the absorption of carbonic acid from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>. This constitutes common building mortar. Hydrate of lime consists of lime, 100 parts, and water 31 parts.\n\n22. If any substance, in powder, which contains much iron in a low state of oxidation, be mixed with slackened lime, the mixture will become harder and more coherent than when lime alone is employed; and it possesses the valuable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of acquiring an equal, or perhaps greater degree of hardness, if it be immersed in water as soon as it is formed into a paste. This constitutes water mortar. A paste of hydrate of lime alone softens and dissolves in water.\n\nAlumina, silica, and manganese, are endowed with the same property as oxide of iron, but in an inferior degree.\n\nIt may be observed, in forming such combinations, that when the lime is in excess, it separates; and in favourable situations, either crystallizes or forms <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STALACTITES\">stalactites</a>; indicating that there is a definite proportion according to which the materials should be combined to form the best cement.\n\n23. If some kind of matter, in the state of particles or grains, be mixed with the cementing material, and then the mixture be formed into a paste with water, the strength and hardness of the cement will greatly depend on the nature of the particles added to it. In order that the cement may be improved by such addition, it is necessary that the hardness of the particles should at least be equal to the greatest degree of hardness the cement can acquire; and also, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> between these particles and the cementing matter should exceed the affinity between the parts of the cement itself.\n\nFrom this explanation it will readily appear, that any substance which is added to a cement for the purpose of increasing its bulk, its hardness, or its strength, ought to be in particles or grains; and that no soft, earthy, or pulverulent matter is fit for this purpose.\n\nIt will be equally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a>, to those who have considered the nature of chemical combination, that the cementing part of the materials employed in the composition of mortars and cements, should be in the finest state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> that it is possible to reduce them to.\n\nAn attentive consideration of these principles will afford an easy solution of some of the most interesting questions to which this important subject gives rise; and correct some errors that have originated from a partial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of the phenomena. We have now to examine the qualities of those materials which naturally occur in the earth; from these must be selected the kinds that can be obtained at the least expense for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> they are to be employed at, when their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> is suitable for the nature of the work.\n\n24. The cementing materials are chiefly from the Limestones, different species of limestone, to which may be added pizzolana, terras, iron ores, basalt, and other substances of a like character. The limestones may be divided, as regards cements and mortars, into three classes; common limestone, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> limestones (chaux maigre of the French), and cement stones.\n\n25. Common limestones consist of carbonate of lime with very little of any other substance; they produce a white lime, which slacks freely when well burnt; they dissolve in diluted muriatic acid with only a small portion of residue, and never contain more than a trace of iron. They differ much in external characters, as chalk, marble, common compact limestone, &c.\n\nThese limestones do not form water cements without the addition of other kinds of cementing matter; hence they are usually employed for common mortar. The hardest marble and the softest chalk make equally good lime when well burnt; but chalk lime will slack when not perfectly burnt, and, therefore, seldom has a sufficient quantity of fire; whereas stone lime must have sufficient to make it slack. It has also been observed, that stone lime does not reabsorb carbonic acid so rapidly as chalk lime. (Higgins on Mortar and Cements, p. 29.)\n\nLime, made from common limestones, sustains very little injury from being kept after it has been formed into a thin paste with water, provided the air be effectually excluded; indeed, Alberti mentions an instance of some which had been covered up in a ditch for a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> time, that was of an excellent quality.\n\n26. Poor limestones consist of carbonate of lime united with silica, alumina, and metallic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OXIDES\">oxides</a>. They in general produce a buff-coloured lime, but sometimes it is white. When the lime is white, there are no metallic oxides present. They contain a considerable portion of matter, which is insoluble in acids. They differ considerably in external characters; the blue lias, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUSSEX\">Sussex</a> clunch, and Sutton limestones, may be cited as instances.\n\nThe lime of poor limestones does not slack freely; and it would always be desirable to reduce it to powder by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRINDING\">grinding</a>, in preference to slacking, because in slacking a part of its setting property is destroyed. When poor lime is slackened, it should be made into mortar, and used immediately. Moisture does such lime more injury than the reabsorption of\ncarbonic acid. And mortar made of it ought not to be disturbed after it has begun to set or harden.\n\nPoor limestones are subject to vitrify in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a>, unless the heat be increased gradually; but by a little management in this respect they will bear a heat sufficiently intense to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> them into good lime.\n\nThe lime of poor limestones makes excellent common mortar, when the precautions we have pointed out have been attended to. It is much superior to mortar made from common limestones. It is not, however, sufficiently powerful for a water cement without the addition of Puzzolana, Terras, or other like substances.\n\n27. Cement stones. We have taken the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> of giving this name to the class of earthy bodies which afford a good water-cement without addition; and it appears to be essential for that purpose that there should be at least 50 per cent. of carbonate of lime in the stone. Those cements which answer best are made from stones containing about 60 per cent. The other substances usually contained in these stones are, silica, alumina, oxide of iron, sometimes oxide of manganese, carbonate of magnesia, with traces of other alkaline and earthy salts. Cement stones are in great part soluble, with effervescence, in diluted muriatic acid; they lose about one-third of their weight by calcination, after which they do not slack, but may be ground into a fine powder, of a brown colour, of different degrees of intensity according to the nature of the stone. Those now used to make cement are found in rolled pieces, or in nodules, with septa of carbonate of lime, on the seacoast at Sheepy, Harwich, and near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITBY\">Whitby</a>, and at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOULOGNE\">Boulogne</a> on the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a>. The nodules are plentifully dispersed through the London clay stratum, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALUM\">alum</a> shale of Whitby; they are termed clay-balls, ludus helmontii, septaria, &c.\n\nCement stones are also liable to vitrify in burning, either from being quickly exposed to a strong heat, or by making the heat too intense.\n\nWhen cement stones have been calcined and ground, the powder thus obtained should be kept in a very dry place, as its setting property is soon destroyed by moisture. It absorbs moisture rapidly from the air; and, therefore, it should be as little exposed as possible; but when closely packed, and in a dry place, it may be kept a considerable time.\n\n28. There are perhaps few mineral bodies which would answer as well as clay-balls for making cement; unless it be calcareous marls; but there are very few situations where the means of forming an artificial cement are wanting; the manner of proceeding must depend on the nature of the substances employed. In general it will be necessary to mix slackened lime with the substance containing silica, alumina, and oxide of iron, and calcine them together, and afterwards grind them. The iron should be in the state of protoxide, to the amount of from 13 to 18 per cent. by weight. The quantity of lime may be about 30 per cent. or 53 per cent. of carbonate of lime; the silica and alumina being in equal portions: hence, in the raw materials, one hundred parts by weight may consist of\n\n| Substance          | Percentage |\n|--------------------|-----------|\n| Carbonate of lime   | 53        |\n| Protoxide of iron   | 18        |\n| Silica and alumina  | 29        |\n\nThere are several mineral bodies which, combined with lime, form good cements; some of these may be used in their natural state, others require calcination. Puzzolana and terras are of the former kind; basalt, iron ores, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FERRUGINOUS\">ferruginous</a> clay, belong to the latter class.\n\nPuzzolana is a volcanic production much used in making water cements. It was known to the Romans, and employed by them both in ordinary buildings and water works. Its colour is reddish or reddish brown; and gray or grayish black; that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPLES\">Naples</a> is generally gray, that of Civita Vecchia more generally reddish brown.\n\nIts surface is rough and uneven, and it has a baked appearance; when broken and examined by a magnifying glass it appears to be a spongy substance, with innumerable small cavities like a cinder, and not much harder. It comes to this country in pieces varying in size from the bulk of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NUT\">nut</a> to that of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGG\">egg</a>. It is very brittle, and has an earthy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a>. Specific gravity from 2\u00b7570 to 2\u00b7785. It does not effervesce with acids; and is not diffusible in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> water.\n\nThe iron it contains is not oxidated; and, being finely divided and dispersed through its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>, offers a large surface which quickly decomposes the water with which it is mixed when made into mortar. The union of the oxygen of the water with the iron is the principal cause of the solidification of water mortar; and this union is greatly facilitated by the heat given out by quicklime.\n\n30. The substance called Terras or Trass, found near Andernach, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHINE\">Rhine</a>, is endowed with similar properties. Its colour is light gray or brownish gray. Its surface is rough and porous; and it is often found mixed with other matter. It is sometimes so hard that it yields with difficulty to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a>. According to Bergman, it contains more lime than puzzolana does, and effervesces slightly with acids.\n\nSmeaton found puzzolana to be equal, if not superior, to terras in forming a water cement with Aberthaw lime; he also observed that terras is inferior for work which is to be alternately wet and dry.\n\n31. If any stone be employed in which the iron is perfectly oxidized, it will be necessary to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> some portion of the oxygen from the iron in the process of calcination, on the same principle as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> of iron from the ore is effected. (See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IRON_MAKING\">Iron-Making</a> in this Supplement.) It is also necessary to employ similar means to restore the cementing power of materials that have attracted moisture after being calcined.\n\nSect. II.\u2014Of the Principles of Strength and Stability in Masonry.\n\n32. The strength and stability of stone-work depends partly on its mass or weight, and partly on the Stones.\nresistance of the materials. And, since we cannot imagine incompressible fulcrum, nor that the materials of masonry are infinitely hard and inflexible, as writers on elementary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a> consider them to be; therefore, it is essential that the resistance of materials should be considered, and the effect of their weight allowed for in estimating the power of the straining force.\n\nThe resistance of stones being dependent on their state of aggregation, and not on the hardness or density of their elementary parts, their comparative strength cannot be judged by these qualities; indeed, there are few kinds of materials of which the resistance is so uncertain as that of stone; hence, it is not at all adapted for any support where its resistance depends on its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COHESION\">cohesion</a> only, unless it be very carefully examined, and abundant strength be allowed. (See \u00a7 15.) The resistance of stone to compression is less affected by its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> nature, particularly as it is usually employed in blocks of considerable height; and, in general, there is scarcely any reason to be sparing of a material which it is often more expensive to reduce than to employ in large blocks. When, however, works of great magnitude are to be constructed, the weight of the materials themselves forms the chief part of the straining force; and, consequently, in such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> it becomes desirable to form a tolerably accurate estimate of their power.\n\n33. This power is limited by a property of bodies, which has not received that degree of attention its importance would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> us to expect: we shall in this place make it the basis of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> of the power of materials to resist a force applied in any given direction; and show its application to some of the cases where a mason is most likely to need the assistance of calculation.\n\nWhen a material is strained beyond a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, every time the strain is increased to the same degree, there is a permanent derangement of the structure of the material produced; and a frequent repetition will increase the derangement till the parts actually separate. (See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARPENTRY\">Carpentry</a> in this Supplement, p. 622, 623.) When a small base rests upon a considerable mass of matter, as a pier on the ground, the quantity of derangement will increase only till the mass be compressed to that degree which renders the increase insensible; but in many cases a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of years will elapse before the settlement becomes insensible.\n\n34. The strain which produces permanent derangement in the structure of a material varies from one-fourth to two-fifths of that which would destroy its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> cohesion. In stone the lower value should be taken, on account of its being subject to so many defects; and, for the present, let this strain be denoted by f lbs. upon a superficial foot.\n\n35. Imagine ABCD to be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLOCK\">block</a>, Plate CXVIII. fig. 1, strained either in the direction EF or FE, by a force W; and let BDF be a line drawn in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> as the direction of the straining force; and perpendicular to the axis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">ab</a> of the block. Now, if we consider the resistance of the block to be collected at the centres of resistance t and c; then, cF will represent a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEVER\">lever</a> acted upon by three forces; that is, the resistances at t and c, and the straining force at F. If the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a>, FEG, be denoted by a; then, the effect of the force W, reduced to a direction perpendicular to the lever, will be expressed by cos. a W.\n\n(1.)\n\nAlso, if T be the resistance at t, and C the resistance at c, we shall, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of equilibrium, have\n\n\\[ C = T \\cos. a W. \\]\n\n(2.)\n\nAnd, by the property of the lever,\n\n\\[ \\frac{tc}{cF} \\times T = W \\cos. a \\]\n\n(3.)\n\nHence,\n\n\\[ \\frac{tc}{cF} = \\frac{C}{T} - 1 \\]\n\n(4.)\n\n36. Without stopping to notice some maxims furnished by this equation (see the Art. Bridge, Prop. B), we will proceed to explain the notation used in the investigation which follows:\n\nl = the length AB.\nd = the depth BD, measured in the same plane as the direction of the strain.\nb = the breadth.\nz = the distance of the neutral point e from the axis ab.\ny = the distance of the point g from the axis ab.\np(\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)d-z), and p(\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)d+z) the respective distances of the centres of resistance t and c from the neutral point; and, consequently,\npd = the distance, ct, between them. And,\ng(\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)d-z), and g(\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)d+z) the respective distances of the centres of gravity of the sections into which the neutral axis divides the block, counted from the neutral point.\n\nThe leverage, cF, expressed in this notation will be\n\n\\[ l \\sin. a \\cos. a + y - \\frac{1}{2}pd + (1-p)z; \\] consequently, equation (4) becomes\n\n\\[ \\frac{pd}{\\cos. a} + y - \\frac{1}{2}pd + (1-p)z = \\frac{C}{T} - 1 \\]\n\n(5.)\n\n37. Now, it is shown, by writers on the resistance of solids, that the resistance of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">section</a>, collected at its centre of pressure, is equal to its cohesive force multiplied by the distance of its centre of gravity from the neutral axis, and divided by the distance of the point of greatest strain from the neutral axis. (Emerson's Mechanics, Prop. 77. 4to. ed.)\n\nAccordingly we have \\( C = \\frac{fbd(\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)d+z)^2}{\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)d+z} \\)\n\n(6.)\n\nAnd\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{fbd(\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)d-z)^2}{\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)d-z} \\]\n\n(7.)\n\nTherefore\n\n\\[ \\frac{C}{T} = \\frac{(\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)d+z)^2}{(\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)d-z)^2}; \\] which being substituted in Equation (5), we obtain\n\n\\[ (3p-2)z^2 - 2z \\left( \\frac{\\sin. a \\cdot l}{\\cos. a} + y \\<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>) + \\frac{1}{2}pd^2 = 0 \\]\n\n(8.)\n\nIf the block be rectangular \\( p = \\frac{2}{3} \\), and, therefore,\nthe distance of the neutral point from the axis is\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{d^2}{12 \\left( \\frac{\\sin a}{\\cos a} + y \\right)} \\]  \n\n(9.)\n\n38. The value of \\( z \\) for a rectangular section being determined, the magnitude of the straining force is easily found, so that it may not exceed the power of the material; for, by the properties of the lever,\n\n\\[ W \\cos a = \\frac{pdC}{\\sin a + y + \\frac{1}{2}pd + z(1-p)} \\]\n\n\\( = fbg(\\frac{1}{2}d+z) \\) by Equation (6), and\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{d^2}{12 \\left( \\frac{\\sin a}{\\cos a} + y \\right)} \\]  \n\nby Equation (9), and \\( g = \\frac{1}{2} \\) by the form of the section, we have\n\n\\[ W = \\frac{fbd^2}{d \\cos a + 6l \\sin a + 6y \\cos a} \\]  \n\n(10.)\n\n39. In particular cases this formula becomes more simple,\u2014for example, when the distance of the point \\( g \\) from the axis \\( ab \\) is \\( o \\), that is, when \\( y = o \\),\n\n\\[ W = \\frac{fbd^2}{d \\cos a + 6l \\sin a} \\]  \n\n(11.)\n\nIn a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a>, or pillar, the section of greatest strain will be at the middle of the length, as at BD in fig. 2; and the direction EF of the straining force is usually parallel to the axis; and then \\( \\sin a = 0 \\), and \\( \\cos a = 1 \\), and therefore \\( W = \\frac{fbd^2}{d + 6y} \\)  \n\n(12.)\n\nWhen the direction of the straining force coincides with the axis, or when \\( y = 0 \\), the strain on a column or pillar is expressed by the equation\n\n\\[ W = fbd \\]  \n\n(13.)\n\nThese equations apply also to tensile forces.\n\nWhen the strain becomes transverse, or when EF is perpendicular to the axis, as in fig. 3, then \\( \\cos a = 0 \\), and \\( \\sin a = 1 \\), hence \\( W = \\frac{fbd^2}{6l} \\)  \n\n(14.)\n\nIf the block be supported at the ends, and the load be applied in the middle of the length, as in fig. 4, the fracture will take place at BD; and W in equation (14) will be the pressure on either support, which is obviously half the load in the middle.\n\n40. In any of these equations it is immaterial how the load be distributed, provided that the line of direction be that which passes through the centre of gravity of the mass supported, and the weight be the whole weight of that mass. Or, if the strain be the combined effect of several pressures, then the direction must be that of the resultant of these pressures, as determined by the principles of mechanics. (See CARPENTRY, p. 627, in this Supplement.\n\n41. If a slab of equable thickness and width be supported along two of its sides, as at AC, AB in fig. 5, and it be strained by a force acting at D, in a direction perpendicular to its surface, and DE be made equal to DB, then the fracture will take place in the direction EB; for it may be shown, by the principles of the maxima and minima of quantities, that the resistance, according to that line, is a minimum. And since, in that case, EB = 2 FD, we shall have, by equation (14), \\( W = \\frac{fd^2}{3} \\)  \n\n(15.)\n\nA force uniformly diffused over the surface of the slab would fracture it in the direction CB, shown by a dotted line in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, and if \\( w \\) be the load in pounds upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> foot of the surface, then the proper values being substituted for the leverage and breadth in equation (14), \\( w = \\frac{fd^2(CD^2 + DB^2)}{CD^2 \\times DB^2} \\)  \n\n(16.)\n\nThe strength of a series of steps <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> upon one another, as in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSPECTIVE\">perspective</a> sketch, fig. 6, may be determined with sufficient accuracy by the last equation, supposing the depth to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> vertical depth of any one step; as, for example, taken at GH in fig. 7, the figure showing the ends of the steps.\n\n42. The case to which equation (14) applies, affords the most convenient, as well as the most accurate, means of determining the value of \\( f \\) for any material; and, supposing it to be one-fourth of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> cohesion (\\$ 34), the last column of the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> of experiments gives its value for various stones, mortars, &c. in the nearest simple numbers under the calculated value.\n\n**Table I.\u2014Experiments on the Transverse Strength of Stones, &c. to the Case Equation (14.)**\n\n| No. of Expts. | Substance tried | Weight of a Cubic Foot | Length l | Depth d | Breadth b | Breaking Weight | Values of \\( f = \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the absolute strength of a Square Foot |\n|---------------|-----------------|------------------------|----------|---------|-----------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| 1             | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATUARY\">Statuary</a> marble | 169-12lbs              | 15 inches| 1-075 in.| 1-075 in.| 25 lbs.         | 65,000 lbs.                                        |\n| 2             | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DITTO\">Ditto</a>           |                        | 7-5      | 1-08    | 1-05      | 55              | 73,000                                            |\n| 3             | Ditto           |                        | 7        | 1-075   | 1-075     | 65              | 78,000                                            |\n| 4             | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUNDEE\">Dundee</a> stone    | 163-80                 | 7        | 1-5     | 1-45      | 207             | 95,000                                            |\n| 5             | Portland stone  | 132                    | 21       | 1-5     | 2         | 28              | 28,000                                            |\n| 6             | Ditto           |                        | 12       | 1-45    | 2         | 50              | 30,000                                            |\n| 7             | Ditto           |                        | 6        | 1-55    | 2-07      | 185             | 35,000                                            |\n| 8             | Ditto           |                        | 15       | 1-25    | 1-2       | 30              | 26,000                                            |\n| 9             | Craigleith white sandstone | 147-6 | 7        | 1-55    | 1-55      | 68-5            | 26,000                                            |\n| 10            | White sandstone from Hailes Quarry | 134-8 | 7        | 1-5     | 1-55      | 61-5            | 26,000                                            |\nNumbers 18, 19, and 20, are from Barlow's Essay on the Strength of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">Timber</a>, &c. p. 250; each a mean of three trials.\n\nNumber 23, from Rondelet's Trait\u00e9 de l'Art de B\u00e2tir, Tome III. p. 377, lowest result; the rest of the experiments were made by the writer of this article.\n\nWe have not availed ourselves of the experiments of Gauthey (Rozier's Journal de Physique, Tome IV.) on the transverse strength of stones; because those he fixed at one end appear to have been injured in fixing, and only a calculated result is given for the other specimens supported at both ends; both of which are given in the Article <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRENGTH_OF_MATERIALS\">Strength of Materials</a> in the Encyclopaedia.\n\n43. Several experiments have also been made, with the intention of measuring the direct resistance to extension or compression; but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> indicates so nice an adjustment of the direction of the straining force to be necessary in these experiments, that the reader may expect the results to differ as widely among themselves as they do from theoretical calculation.\n\nTable II.\u2014Experiments on the Direct Resistance of Stones, &c., to the Case Equation (13.)\n\n| No. of Expts. | Substance tried. | Weight of a Cubic Foot | Length l | Depth d | Breadth b | Breaking Weight | Value of f=1 of the absolute strength of a Square Foot. |\n|---------------|------------------|------------------------|----------|---------|-----------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| 1             | Hard stone of Givry | 147 lbs.               | 96 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> | 164 livres | 8,400 lbs. |\n| 2             | Tender stone of Givry | 130                   | 324      | 183     | 1,400     |\n| 3             | Mortar of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> and lime 16 years old | 1 pouce | 53       | 1,800   |\n| 4             | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLASTER\">Plaster</a> of Paris     | 1                      | 76       | 2,500   |\n| 5             | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ADHESION\">Adhesion</a> of mortar to limestone, joined 6 months | 4        | 64       | 547     |\n| 6             | Adhesion of mortar to brick, joined 6 months | 4        | 138      | 1,180   |\n| 7             | Adhesion of mortar to tile, joined 6 months | 4        | 141      | 1,200   |\n\nThe experiments, Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, are extracted from Rondelet's L'Art de B\u00e2tir, Tome I. p. 342.\n\nNos. 1 and 2, by Gauthey, Rozier's Journal de Physique, Tome IV. p. 414. In the Article Strength of Materials, in the Encyclopaedia, these experiments have been quoted as experiments on compression, by mistake.\n\n44. In the resistance to actual fracture, from a compressive force, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> effect of cohesion and friction is concerned, and, therefore, a much greater force is required to crush than to tear asunder the same quantity of material. The resistance to fracture might be investigated on principles analogous to those we intend to employ in determining the pressure of earth against retaining walls, &c. (See also Carpentry, p. 623, in this Supplement.) But we conceive, that it is neither prudent, useful, nor necessary, to load the parts of a structure beyond that limit we have made the basis of our investigation. (See \u00a7 34.) Rondelet has observed, that the load under which a stone began to split was, nearly always, two-thirds of that which crushed it; but that stone, of some kinds, began to split with half the load that crushed it (L'Art de B\u00e2tir, III. 86 et 101): the value of f should, therefore, not exceed one-fourth of the force which splits stone; and supposing the splitting force to be always half the crushing one, we shall have f=one-eighth of the crushing force.\n\n45. In this, as in the preceding tables, the reader will observe, that the results of all experiments are given in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-WEIGHTS_AND_MEASURES\">weights and <a class</a>=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a>; but that the value of f and the weight of a cubic foot are in English pounds Avoirdupois, and for an English foot.

21, 22, and 36, were made by Gauthey. (Roz. Journal de Physique, Tome IV. p. 406.) Those numbered 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, to 20, 30, 31, 32, 34, 37, 38, and 39, were made by Mr George Rennie. (Philosophical Transactions for 1818.) The others were made by Rondelet. (Trait\u00e9 de l'Art de B\u00e2tir, Tome I. and Tome III.) We have selected those which will be most useful, with others of a more interesting and curious nature; such are Rondelet's experiments on the effect of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEATING\">beating</a> mortar, the strength and density of ancient mortar, and the resistance of stones used in ancient and modern structures.\n\n46. It was observed by Rondelet, in the course of his very numerous experiments, that it was not the heaviest stones which offered the greatest degree of resistance to compression, but those of a fine even grain and close texture, with a deep colour; that of granites, the most compact and perfectly crystallized are the strongest (L'Art de B\u00e2tir, I. 213, 215); and when all other qualities were the same, it appears that the strength was in proportion to some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a> of the specific gravity.\n\nThe writers who have contributed to our experimental knowledge of the strength of stones are not numerous; the chief are Emerson, in his Mechanics, 4th Ed. p. 115; Gauthey, in his Memoire sur la <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> que peuvent porter les Pierres en Rozier's Journal de Physique, Tome IV. 1774, and in his Construction des Ponts, Tome I. p. 267; Coulob, M\u00e9moires pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l'Acad\u00e9mie, 1773; Rondelet, in his Trait\u00e9 de l'Art de B\u00e2tir, Tome I. et III. The latter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> contains the experiments made by Perronet and Soufflot. Rennie, Philosophical Transactions for 1818, or Philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGAZINE\">Magazine</a>, Vol. LIII.; Tredgold, Philosophical Magazine, Vol. LVI., p. 290.\n\n47. The last column in each of the three tables of stone experiments shows the greatest load that we suppose should be borne by a superficial foot of the different kinds of stone contained in those tables; we now propose to give the results of some calculations respecting the extent to which stone has been loaded in practice.

From these circumstances, the strength of piers, columns, pillars, and arch-stones, should be estimated by equation (12), and when the line of direction falls within the pier, always making \\( y = \\frac{1}{2} \\) half the least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIMENSION\">dimension</a> of the section, an allowance which will include the effect of the greatest possible inequality of action.\n\nWe shall, in that case, have \\( \\frac{fbd^2}{d + 6d} = \\frac{fbd}{4} = W. \\) (17.)\n\nIf the pressure on the Bagneux stone in the piers of the dome of the Pantheon at Paris be estimated by this formula, it will be found that it is sufficient to split the stones, and this has actually happened.\n\n48.

When any of these bodies are in a moist state, the parts cohere, and the angle of repose is greater, though the friction be actually less. The preceding Table shows that the pressure of water is greater than that of any of the other kinds of matter, and from the nature of\nfluids it is evident, that if water be suffered to collect behind a retaining wall, calculated to sustain common earth only, it will most likely be overturned. Such accidents may be prevented by making proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAINS\">drains</a>.\n\n53. The preceding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a> will apply, without sensible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>, to the curved walls which have lately become fashionable. Fig. 10 is a section of one of these walls, as executed from a design by Rennie. The vertical height, AB, 21 feet; the wall of uniform thickness, with counterforts 15 feet apart; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> of the walls described by a 69 feet radius, with the centre in the horizontal line DA produced. The wall is built of brick, and the uniform part is 4\u00bd feet thick. The radius is usually thrice the vertical height of the wall; when this proportion is adhered to, the angle c will be ten degrees, for which the value of R is calculated in the Table.\n\nResistance of Walls.\n\n54. In the first place, we propose to investigate the resistance a wall offers to being overturned; and, in so doing, it appears desirable that the resistance of the mortar in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a> should be considered one of the elements of the strength of the wall. Good mortar adds much to the firmness of walls, and still more to their durability; and, all things considered, its first cost is less than that of bad; besides, the resistance of mortar to compression must be considered, for, in practice, we have no perfectly hard arrises to fulfil the conditions of common mechanical hypotheses.\n\nPut A = the area of the wall.\nw = the weight of a cubic foot of masonry.\ny = the horizontal distance, ga, between the vertical passing through the centre of gravity of the wall, and the point where the axis cuts the plane of fracture, the same notation being applied to the other quantities as in the foregoing equations.\n\nLet G, fig. 9, be the centre of gravity of the wall; and on the vertical GG set off gL, the height of the centre of pressure: also, let IK represent A \u00d7 w = the weight of the wall, and HI the force R of the earth.\n\nThen, completing the parallelogram, EI will represent the direction and intensity of the straining force; consequently, \\( \\frac{R}{Aw} = \\tan a \\) (28.)\n\nWhich determines its direction, and its intensity is\n\n\\[ W = \\frac{Aw}{\\cos a} \\] (29.)\n\nBut, we have found, equa. (10),\n\n\\[ W = \\frac{fbd^2}{d \\cos a + 6l \\sin a + 6y \\cos a} \\]; and as W =\n\n\\[ Aw \\left( \\text{Equa. (29.)} \\right) \\tan a = \\frac{R}{Aw}; \\text{Equa. (28)}; l = \\frac{h}{2}, \\text{art. 51;} \\text{and } b = \\text{unity; the equation reduces to} \\]\n\n\\[ f'd^2 - Adz = 6Aw = 2Rh. \\] (30.)\n\nIf the section of the wall be a parallelogram, then A = hd, and \\( \\frac{h}{2} \\tan c = y \\); these values of A and y being substituted in Equa. (30), it becomes \\( -whd^2 + f'd^2 + 3h^2wd \\tan c = 2Rh. \\) (31.)\n\nOr, \\( d = \\frac{h^2w}{f-hw} \\left( \\frac{-3 \\tan c}{2} + \\sqrt{\\frac{2R(f-hw)}{h^2w}} \\right) \\)\n\n\\[ + \\frac{9 \\tan c}{4}. \\] (32.)\n\nWhen the section of the wall is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECTANGLE\">rectangle</a> y = 0, therefore Equa. (31) reduces to\n\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{\\frac{2Rh}{f-hw}} \\] (33.)\n\nThis last Equation is also correct for a wall of which the back is vertical, and the front sloping. We suppress the investigation, to afford the young student an opportunity of proving that the diminution of weight is exactly counterbalanced by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> of the distance of the centre of gravity from the axis.\n\nThe tendency of a wall to slide forward may be easily prevented, by giving an inclination to the joints.\n\n55. To illustrate these rules we shall give two examples, and in these show the construction of a table, which the reader may enlarge at his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>.\n\nExample I. Let it be required to determine the thickness of a rectangular wall for supporting the front of a wharf 10 feet in height, the earth being a loose sand, and the wall to be built of brick.\n\nThe weight of a cubic foot of brick-work may be estimated at 100 lbs., and the resistance of mortar being valued at 5000 lbs. per superficial foot, the experimental value being 7900 lbs., Table III. Experiment 42, and the difference an allowance for any irregularity in building, consequently, \\( f = 5000; w = 100 \\); and by Table IV. \\( R = 13-8h^2 \\); hence, Equa. (33), \\( d = \\sqrt{\\frac{2Rh}{f-hw}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 13-8 \\times h^2}{5000 - 100h}} \\)\n\n\\[ = \\sqrt{\\frac{h^2}{181 - 3-62h}}. \\] When h = 10 feet, then the thickness of the wall \\( d = 2-644 \\) feet. If h be made successively 10, 20, 30, 40, &c. feet, the numbers under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of dry sand in the following Table will be obtained, observing that they are only calculated to the nearest tenth of a foot.\n\nThe proper thickness being found for supporting one kind of material, that for any other may be easily determined; as the thickness varies as the square root of R, Equa. (33). Let the thickness for dry sand be \\( d \\), then \\( \\sqrt{13-8}: \\sqrt{31-25}: d: 1-5d \\) the thickness for supporting water. \\( \\sqrt{13-8}: \\sqrt{17-85}: d: 1-14d \\) the thickness for supporting moist sand. In this manner, by means of Table IV. the thicknesses for other kinds are easily calculated.\n\nExample II. If a retaining wall be intended to support a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a> and loose kind of earth, to be constructed of brick, and to be inclined 10 degrees from the vertical, the thickness being uniform; it is required to determine that thickness for any given height.\n\nBy Equa. (32), \\( d = \\frac{h^2w}{f-hw} \\left( \\frac{-3 \\tan c}{2} + \\right. \\)","sp":605,"ep":617},{"h":"SUCH ARE THE PRETENSIONS OF THE DUTCH TO THE HONOUR OF THE INVENTION OF PRINTING BY","t":"h are the pretensions of the Dutch to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINTING\">printing</a> by means of stereotype. But unfortunately for this claim, M. Camus, who published two papers on Polatype and Stereotype in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> of the National Institute of France (Vols. III. and V.), in his anxiety to do <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> to the merits of a countryman of his own, was led to make some inquiries regarding the existence of Vander Mey's plates of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIBLE\">Bible</a>. The result was, that he found these plates were still in existence, and in the possession of Messrs G. and J. Luchtmans of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEYDEN\">Leyden</a>; the grandchildren of Samuel Luchtmans, the bookseller, at whose expense it appears Vander Mey had originally prepared them. From a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> of these gentlemen to M. Renouard, a bookseller in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, dated 24th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 1801, accurately describing the plates of this Bible, it turns out that the forms of types have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> at all to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> stereotype plates, but are merely the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAGES\">pages</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> moveable types, soldered together at the bottom: \"c'est une reunion de caracteres ordinaires par le pied avec de la matiere fondue.\" (M\u00e9m. de l'Inst. Tom. V. p. 330.) The Dutch Bible in folio, we learn from the same authority, was at that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of Elwe the bookseller, and the Greek New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a> in the hands of Messrs Luchtmans. The forms of the other works mentioned as having been prepared in this manner had been broken up and sold.\n\nM. Camus having disposed of the pretensions of Vander Mey, his next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> was to support the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of one Valleire, a Paris printer, to the merit of the invention; at least to the practice of printing from stereotype plates. In his first memoir (M\u00e9m. de l'Inst. Tom. III. p. 440), he claims the invention for the French; 1st, Because, in a modern catalogue of the printers of Paris by Lottin, it is asserted, without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the fact being adduced, that the calen-\ndars at the beginning of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> books were printed from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> plates towards the end of the seventeenth century. 2d. From the existence of a plate formed of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>, of which he has given an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> in his memoir, containing a page of such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-CALENDAR\">calendar</a>; and 3d. From the testimony of a compositor, who had been witness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of such plates in the office of Valleure, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> to the year 1735. Two other pages of a similar calendar were in the possession of M. Herlhan; but unfortunately, notwithstanding one of these contained the months of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> and February, and another the months of November and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a>, the year to which they referred was not inserted; nor was M. Camus's industry sufficient to procure one of those church books printed by Valleure to ascertain this fact, though, from their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, it is reasonable to conclude the impressions must have been numerous.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to make any remarks upon this claim of M. Camus for the invention being French. Lottin's catalogue is of no authority on the point; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOLLECTION\">recollection</a> of a nameless compositor, who must have been nearly eighty years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, concerning a circumstance which happened sixty years before, is not more satisfactory. It seems, therefore, more than probable, that the plates of the calendar alluded to, which, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> complete, would have only amounted to six very small 24mo pages, had been formed by some Parisian printer, who had heard of the invention of Ged, and attempted to imitate it; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a>, if they can be really proved to have been manufactured previous to 1735, the material, and the manner of their formation, were so different from his, and so nearly similar to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> and tail pieces fabricated by the Dutch founders for centuries before, that all claims to the invention of stereotype, as now practised, by Valleure or his predecessors, must <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> to the ground.\n\nIt may be mentioned that these plates of copper containing the calendar seem to have been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a>, and that not very perfectly, from a mould formed of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>, clay, or some similar substance; precisely in the same manner that, till within these twenty years, the larger letters and vignettes used in printing were fabricated by the ordinary letter-founders, both on the Continent and in England. We have seen many of these antique decorations cast in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYPE\">type</a> metal of the thickness of stereotype plate, and fastened to blocks of wood to raise them to the proper height; and though the transition from this to stereotype plates appears sufficiently obvious, yet it seems quite certain, that till our ingenious countryman, William Ged, attempted and perfected the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a>, in a manner that had not before been practised, the art of stereotype printing was unknown.\n\nWilliam Ged, the inventor of printing from plates in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of moveable types, and whose invention has formed the basis of all the subsequent attempts in the art, was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOLDSMITH\">goldsmith</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, in which profession he is said to have made many improvements, which he liberally communicated to the other members of the trade. In the year 1725, happening to be in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> with a printer, the conversation turned on the disadvantages which persons in that profession experienced from want of a letter-founder; the printers at this time, both in Scotland and England, being chiefly supplied with types from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>. Mr Ged's friend then showed him the types, both singly and put together in pages, and asked him if he could contrive a method to remedy that defect. \"I answered\" (says Mr Ged, in a narrative dictated by himself a short time before his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>), \"That I judged it more practicable for me to make plates from the composed pages than single types. To which he replied, that if such a thing could be done, an estate might be made by it. I desired he would give me a page for an experiment, which, after some days <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>, I found practicable, and so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> for near two years improving on my invention, and making a great many experiments, several of which were expensive; but the more I practised, and the less chargeable materials I used, I was the more successful, till at last I brought it to bear, as that no distinction could be made between the impression from my plates, and that from the types.\"\n\nMr Ged's invention was now complete; and nothing but the want of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> hindered its being brought before the public in the most complete manner. To procure the necessary funds, he, therefore, in 1727, entered into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> of Edinburgh, who, for a fourth share of the profits, agreed to advance the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> that might be necessary for carrying on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>. But the jealousy of trade soon interrupted Mr Ged's progress; for his partner, consulting with a printer on the subject, was led to believe that his whole fortune would not be sufficient to complete the undertaking. This representation so intimidated the monied <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, that in two years he had made no farther advance than L. 22; and so, says Mr Ged, \"finding no appearance of success that way, I was glad of an opportunity by which I might expect better encouragement.\"\n\nIn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> 1729, Mr Fenner, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> stationer, being in Edinburgh, and hearing of Mr Ged's project, made him proposals for carrying it on in London. He was, accordingly, induced to enter into a contract with that gentleman; obliging himself to share with him the profits of the proposed concern, on condition that he advanced the money that should be required. Mr Ged, accordingly, removed to London; but not finding that his partner Mr Fenner had provided the necessary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a> and funds, Thomas James, a letter-founder, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> John James, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARCHITECT\">architect</a>, were successively adopted into the copartnership; and some time afterwards, a privilege was obtained from the University of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>, in the name of Fenner, for printing Bibles and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRAYER\">Prayer</a> Books on the new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>. This connection turned out unfortunately for Mr Ged;\n\n* See Biographical Memoirs of William Ged; including a particular Account of his Progress in the Art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLOCK\">Block</a>-Printing. Nichols, London, 1781, p. 1.\nfor Thomas James, whose types were little calculated to do honour to their exertions, had, it is alleged, leagued with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">King</a>'s Printers to defeat a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> which might eventually hurt their interests; and it seems to have been the object of Fenner, after acquiring sufficient knowledge of the art to carry it on without assistance, to drive Ged from the concern.\n\nTo accomplish their purposes, these persons are said to have engaged only such people, and procured only such types as were most likely to render the undertaking abortive; and the workmen themselves, averse to an invention which promised to lessen the demand for their labour, were not backward in lending their assistance to the same end. One of the workmen engaged in the business informed Mr Mores, that the compositors, when they corrected one fault, purposely made half a dozen more; and that the pressmen, when the masters were absent, broke the pages intentionally in aid of the compositors. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> was, that the Bible and Prayer Books printed in this manner were suppressed at the University; the plates were afterwards sent to the King's Printing-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, and from thence found their way to Mr Caslon's foundery. (Memoirs of Ged, p. 36.)\n\nDisappointed in his prospects, and depressed by the ill-usage which he had experienced from all with whom he was connected in this unfortunate speculation, Mr Ged returned to Edinburgh. His friends in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> being anxious that a specimen of his art should be published, a subscription was opened for this purpose, and an edition of Sallust was finished in 1739, in 150 pages 12mo. We <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> the title-page of this curious and interesting monument of Ged's ingenuity: \"C. Crispi Sallustii Belli Catilinarii et Jugurthini Historiae. Edinburgi, Gulielmus Ged, Aurifaber Edinensis, non Typis mobilibus, ut vulgo fieri solet, sed Tabellis seu Laminis fusis excadebat, MDCCXXXIX.\"\n\nEven in getting this small work carried through the press Mr Ged met with difficulties, which it is painful to believe should have obstructed his progress. No compositor could be found to set up the types from which the plates were to be fabricated; and the whole of the work was composed by his son James, then a boy about twelve years of age. He had been put apprentice to a printer about a year before, and with the consent of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>, he was allowed to work at this task in the night time when all the workmen were absent.\n\nWhat became of the plates of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> is not well known. Mr Alexander Tilloch, the ingenious editor of the Philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGAZINE\">Magazine</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> inventor of the art of stereotype printing, relates, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> on the subject in the tenth volume of that work, that he was in possession of one of them. \"This plate,\" says he, \"I first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> in the hands of the deceased Mr John Murray, bookseller, in the year 1782, but do not now recollect the way in which he said it came into his possession. Having, about a year ago, applied to his successors in business, Messrs Murray and Highley, to request, if the plate could be found, that I might be allowed to take some impressions of it, they very politely insisted on my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCEPTANCE\">acceptance</a> of what they had used for years as a flat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> to lay upon papers at the end of the desk.\" (Philosophical Magazine, Vol. X. p. 273.) <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a> Denis Pierres, an ingenious printer of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSAILLES\">Versailles</a>, had, along with a copy of the book, the plate of page 44, so early as 1773. Its size, appearance, &c. is minutely described in the first memoir of M. Camus (M\u00e9m. de l'Inst. Tom. III. p. 445); and Pierres, we are given to understand, made many fruitless attempts to discover the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> by which it was produced.\n\nSome years afterwards another work, which is less known, was undertaken and finished by Mr Ged. This was The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">Life</a> of God in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUL\">Soul</a> of Man, in a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> pot 12mo. The imprint of this little volume, which is as well executed as books were generally at the time, is, \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEWCASTLE\">Newcastle</a>: Printed and sold by John <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">White</a>, from plates made by William Ged, goldsmith in Edinburgh, 1742.\" Mr Tilloch was in possession of a copy of this volume; and in the Philosophical Magazine has given an impression of a page of Ged's Sallust, and specimens of his own and Mr Foulis's stereotype, in Greek and Roman letters. (Vol. X. p. 272.)\n\nWilliam Ged died at Edinburgh, in but indifferent circumstances, on the 19th of October 1749, after having invented, and dedicated the greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his life to the improvement of an art from which neither he nor his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> were destined to receive any benefit. From the testimony of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a>, however, it appears that advantageous terms had been repeatedly offered to him if he would remove to Holland, or sell his invention to the printers of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>; but that he uniformly rejected offers, the acceptance of which would have had the effect of giving an advantage to strangers over the artists of his own country. (Memoirs of W. Ged, p. 26.) His son, James Ged, whom the disappointments of the family had induced to join the rebel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> in 1745, was seized at Carlisle and condemned; but through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> of some of his father's friends, was pardoned and liberated in 1748. Notwithstanding the ill success his father had met with, he published proposals for reviving stereotype printing, dated at London, 29th May 1751; but these proposals having met with but little encouragement, he went to Jamaica, where he died in 1767. His younger brother, William Ged, had previously removed to the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>, where he died the year after his departure from England; and the name of Ged and the art of stereotype itself was soon forgotten.\n\nFifty years after the invention of stereotype by Mr Ged, Mr Tilloch was led to a similar discovery, without having, at the time, any knowledge whatever that another had preceded him in the invention. \"The knowledge of this fact,\" says Mr Tilloch, \"lessened the value of the discovery so much in my estimation, that I felt but little anxiety to be known as a second inventor; and, but for the persevering attempts of others to deprive Ged of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> so justly merits, and which he dearly earned, I might still have remained silent.\" (Philosophical Magazine, Vol. X. p. 268.)\n\nMr Tilloch having communicated his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> upon the subject to Mr Foulis, printer to the University of\nGlasgow, where he then resided, that gentleman furnished him with a page of types ready set up for his first experiment. The success of this trial induced Mr Tilloch to make others; and after numberless experiments, in which he was assisted by Mr Foulis, he was at length able to produce plates, the impressions of which could not be distinguished from those taken from the types from which they were cast.\n\nMr Tilloch and Mr Foulis, who, as a practical printer, saw all the advantages which the art promised, now agreed to prosecute the business together, and, if possible, to bring it to perfection. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time they accidentally learnt, that the art had been practised many years before by Mr Ged; and a biographical memoir of that ingenious man having been published soon after (in 1781) by Mr Nichols, they discovered that perseverance in the plan might be attended with difficulties which, till then, they had never contemplated. Notwithstanding, however, of the opposition which they were thus led to expect from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a>, Mr Tilloch and Mr Foulis persevered in their object, and took out patents for England and Scotland, dated 14th May 1784, to secure to themselves, for the usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a>, the benefits of an invention which they considered as much their own as if nothing similar had been practised before.\n\nNeither the ingenuity of Mr Tilloch, nor the public spirit of Mr Foulis, were, however, rewarded; for, owing to circumstances of a private nature, and after printing a few volumes in this way, the business was laid aside for a time; and Mr Tilloch's removal to London, and other avocations, prevented its being again resumed. The prejudices of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOOKSELLERS\">booksellers</a>, besides, were so strong against books printed in this manner, that what volumes Messrs Tilloch and Foulis had completed were sold to the trade without any intimation of their being printed out of the common way. Their first attempts were confined to trifling popular books, such as *The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">Seven</a> Champions of Christendom*, *The Twelve Caesars*, &c. and a cheap edition of *The Economy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">Human</a> Life*. A Greek volume, however, Xenophon's *Anabasis*, was printed in 1783; and they had prepared plates for several small volumes of the English poets, which, however, were never put to press. (*Philosophical Magazine*, Vol. X. p. 275.)\n\nThe art of stereotype printing was thus twice invented and practised in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, by natives of Scotland, prior to any thing of the same kind being attempted, or brought to the same perfection, in any other country of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>.\n\nIn the year 1784 Francis Ignatius-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a> Hoffmann, a native of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALSACE\">Alsace</a>, established himself in France as the printer of a stereotype journal, and an improver of the art; but, from the testimony of M. Camus, it would appear that he was in the knowledge of what Ged had previously done, and perhaps also knew of the patent and productions of Messrs Tilloch and Foulis. Hoffmann's process is thus described by himself: \"A page set up with moveable types in the usual manner, serves to make an impression in a soft fat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> mixed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLASTER\">plaster</a>, and prepared with a gelatinous paste, formed of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUM\">gum</a> and potatoe-sediment. This impression became a matrix, in which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PEWTER\">pewter</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BISMUTH\">bismuth</a>, when pressed in at the moment of cooling, gave a solid page, which bore in relief the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> that had served to form the matrix.\"\n\nBy this process Hoffmann printed many leaves of his *Polytype Journal*; and the work entitled *Les Recherches Historiques sur les Maures* by De Ch\u00e9ni\u00e9r, in 3 vols. 8vo, which appeared in 1787. Hoffmann and his son had also procured, in 1785, an extensive privilege for their new mode of printing, and some improvements which they had made in the art of engraving; but by a new order of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a>, in November 1787, the establishment was suppressed. (*M\u00e9m. de l'Inst.* Tom. III. p. 460.)\n\nHoffmann, thus deprived of his printing office (seemingly from having <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENT\">lent</a> his art to the fabrication of prohibited books), turned his ingenuity to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEVISE\">devise</a> some method which should facilitate the ordinary mode of printing. He began with forming two kinds of punches to stamp the characters in his matrices; the first of single letters in the ordinary mode, and the second of the same letters combined into syllables of most frequent occurrence in the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>; such as *a\u00efs*, *etre*, *eurs*, *ment*, &c. Hoffmann denominated this invention the *Logotype* art. By this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> for the types consisted of no less than 370 boxes. He published a *Memoir* on the subject in 1792; and in the same year procured a patent for his invention for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of 15 years. Hoffmann does not seem to have been aware that logotype had been proposed by Henry Johnson in 1778; and in France the same plan is said to have been invented by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a> in 1774. (See the Article *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOGOGRAPHY\">Logography</a>* in the *Encyclop\u00e6dia.*)\n\nThe proceedings of Hoffmann attracted considerable notice in France; and some numbers of his *Polytype Journal* having fallen into the hands of Joseph <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAREZ\">Carez</a>, a printer at Toul, he was struck with the advantages which it presented, and in 1785 began his operations. His first idea was, to take off the impression of the moveable types in plaster; but he afterwards adopted the plan of impressing the page in metal while at a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>; and this impression served him as a mould for casting with accuracy the facsimile of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> page. In 1786 Carez executed by this process an edition of a church book in two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> vols. 8vo, of more than a thousand pages each, twenty volumes of other descriptions, and afterwards a Bible in nonpareil characters, the execution of which is indeed very creditable to his ingenuity. (*M\u00e9m. de l'Inst.* Tom. III. p. 467.)\n\nOther individuals, whom the attempts of Hoffmann excited to experiment, also made new discoveries in the art, or improved those already known; and all the departments of printing were afterwards improved by the artists called in to assist in the manufacture of *Assignats* at the period of the French Revolution, who were prompted to exertion, as M. Camus expresses it, \"by a power which nothing could resist.\" Among the artists who assisted in the fabrication of Assignats, Firmin and Henry Didot, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> Etienne Herhan, and Nicolas Marie Gatteaux, severally obtained patents for different modifications of stereotype printing in the year 1798.\n\nFrom the specification in the patent of Herhan,\nhis mode of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-STEREOTYPING\">stereotyping</a> seems to have been particularly ingenious. He invented moveable types, in which the letters, in place of being in relief, were sunk (en creux); and by merely setting up these types, or rather matrices, which were of copper, he was enabled to produce from them directly a stereotype plate, without the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of an intermediate moulding. Herhan printed specimens of this mode of stereotyping by moveable matrices of copper, which are extremely pretty. One is inserted in the Memoirs of the Institute, Vol. III. 510.\n\nM. Poterat, many years afterwards, with a view to avoid the difficulty and expense of composing with matrices, suggested a plan by which the matrix of copper is soldered to the bottom of the types, which bear the characters in relief. But this plan is attended with an expense which more than counterbalances the proposed advantages.\n\nSoon after their patents were obtained, Pierre Didot, the elder, Firmin Didot, his brother, and Louis Etienne Herhan, issued a prospectus for printing works in stereotype. An edition of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGIL\">Virgil</a> in 18mo was published in the year 1798; and in spite of the clamours of those interested in opposing the scheme, Phaedrus, and successively afterwards many splendid works, were given to the world, by which these individuals have rendered their names celebrated as improvers of the art of printing. (M\u00e9m. de l'Inst. Tom. III. p. 502.)\n\nM. Camus thus describes the mode of stereotyping practised by Didot and Herhan; only concealing the composition of the metal of which the types used in stereotyping were formed, and that of the metal which formed the mould.\n\nThe types are cast in the ordinary mode, but of metal of a particular composition, and sufficiently hard to bear without injury the pressure required to stamp the metal matrix. After the page is composed, it is enclosed in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a> box, where it is compressed on all sides, and the surface made accurately <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a>. The page thus disposed serves for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNCH\">punch</a>. The metal plate intended for the matrix has two essential qualities, that of being able to receive a pure and distinct impression, and that of not being subject to any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a>, or commencing fusion, when by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of a press it is brought into contact with the heated metal. The punch, or page of moveable types, is now placed above the matrix, and an equal pressure is made upon it by a machine, in some respects resembling that used in giving the impress to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COIN\">coin</a>. The matrix is afterwards fixed in a frame, and is ready for the next operation, which the French founders consider as one of the most essential in the process. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> firmly fixed to the ground is provided, and at one side of this table two pieces of wood of convenient height are fixed, with a vertical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROOVE\">groove</a> or canal. A piece of wood furnished with a tongue, or feather, is formed to run in these grooves, so disposed as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> in the manner of the rammer used in sinking piles. At the lower part of this piece of wood, perpendicular to its axis, is fixed a screw, and the box or frame which contains the matrix has in its back a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> screw to correspond. The matrix is thus screwed firmly to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of wood, or rammer, with its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a> downwards. A drawer or tray of thick paper, or card, is now placed on the table below the descending matrix. This tray is filled with melted type metal, and when the metal is at the point of congelation, a peg disengages the rammer, which falls with its weight upon the metal, which congeals at the same moment. The matrix is now disengaged from the stereotype page by the blade of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a>, and the operation is completed if all the parts of the process have been well executed.* The rammer is raised by a handle; and a thin slip of copper or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a> round the matrix regulates the thickness of the plate. (M\u00e9m. de l'Inst. Tom. III. p. 492, 493, and 505, 506.)\n\nPrevious to this period, it may be mentioned, that Firmin Didot in 1796 prepared an edition of the Logarithmic Tables of Callet, much in the manner of Vander Mey's Bible. The displacement of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> in works of this kind, from causes well known to printers, often occasions a serious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>; and, with a view to prevent similar accidents, after the pages were composed in the usual manner, and finally corrected, the form of types was soldered at the bottom, by which all chance of a figure being displaced was completely prevented. (M\u00e9m. de l'Inst. Tom. III. p. 509.)\n\nTowards the end of the year 1798, M. Bouvier, also one of the artists who were engaged in the fabrication of Assignats, stereotyped with considerable success, by a process different from that of Didot and Herhan. The metal of his plate was copper, and his mould was formed of argillaceous earth. M. Camus has given a specimen of a page cast in this way, which, however, does not seem so perfect as those fabricated by the other process. M. Bouvier, in extending his invention, applied it to many other purposes, one of which was adapting it to the printing of music. (M\u00e9m. de l'Inst. Tom. III. p. 509.)\n\nThe success of the French printers in stereotype printing naturally excited the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of their brethren in England; and the next attempt to introduce the art into England was happily more successful than those which had been previously made. About the year 1800 Mr Wilson, a respectable printer in London, engaged with the late <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARL\">Earl</a> of Stanhope, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> arts is well known, for the purpose of bringing this mode of printing into general practice. His Lordship is said to have received his first instructions in the formation of stereotype plates from Mr Tilloch, the second inventor, and had afterwards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> attendance of Mr Foulis for many months at his seat at Chevening, where his Lordship was initiated in the practical part of the operation.\n\nAfter nearly two years spent in maturing the different processes connected with the operation, Mr Wilson announced to his friends that the ingenuity and perseverance of Earl Stanhope had overcome\n\n---\n\n* This operation is termed clichage, from cliche, a word signifying to make fall perpendicularly, quickly, and with force, a matrix upon a metal in fusion.\nevery difficulty,\u2014that the various processes had been so contrived as to combine the most beautiful simplicity with the most desirable economy,\u2014and that the public might look forward to the period when, by the application of this art to the manufacture of books, the prices of all standard works would be reduced at least thirty, and in many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> forty per cent.\n\nIn the year 1804 Mr Wilson offered, upon certain terms, the art of printing in stereotype to the University of Cambridge, for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADOPTION\">adoption</a> in the printing of Bibles, Testaments, and Prayer Books; but some differences between the syndics and the printer occasioned the contract to be dissolved. The plan, however, has been since adopted both at this university and that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a>; and thousands of Bibles, &c. are annually issued from their presses printed in stereotype. The art has also been gradually diffused, not only in the capital, but in other cities of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>; and it was carried on to some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> in Edinburgh by the late Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> Stewart, printer to the University, in the printing of school-books, for which, as insuring greater accuracy than the common mode, it is admirably adapted.\n\nThe mode of casting stereotype is sufficiently simple. A page of any work proposed to be stereotyped is set up in the usual manner, with the ordinary moveable types. From this page, when corrected, a mould in plaster, the basis of which is gypsum, is taken off; and from this mould an impression is cast in the ordinary type metal, from which the printing is made. Of course, the whole of a work to be stereotyped is set up by the compositor in distinct pages, from which casts are formed; and from these casts plates are procured from which impressions may be made, exactly the same in every particular as that from the moveable types originally set up. A stereotype plate is, therefore, nothing more than a fac-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIMILE\">simile</a> of the page from which it was taken; but the advantage in point of expense is, that a plate of stereotype does not require to be more than the seventh or eighth part of the thickness or height of the ordinary types.\n\nIn the selection of a proper substance for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOULDS\">moulds</a>, and the management of the casting, the success of the operation chiefly consists. The head and tail pieces of the older printers were chiefly cast in moulds formed of clay or sand; Ged, Tilloch, and after them Hoffmann, used a composition, of which plaster of Paris was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> ingredient; while Herban, Didot, Carez, and others, procured their mould by impressing the types in a soft metal, or metal in the act of congelation. The substance required for this purpose must be of a nature so delicate when soft, as to be capable of receiving an impression from the finest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a>, and when dry, must be capable of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> without injury the action of the melted metal. Gypsum or plaster of Paris, when finely pulverized, and mixed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, soon becomes hard, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> also bear any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of heat. But gypsum contracts when exposed to heat, and is liable to warp; it is also difficult to expel the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> and moisture which it absorbs and retains. The defects of the plaster of Paris are, therefore, to be counteracted by compounding it with other substances less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSORBENT\">absorbent</a>; but whatever be added, must be capable of receiving and retaining a fine surface, so as to preserve a perfect polish in the plate to be cast from it. The following simple expedient has been recommended as fully answering this purpose. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of common whiting is dissolved in a tub of clean water, and made nearly of the consistence of what is generally used in white-washing. The plaster is mixed with this solution, which makes it contract but little from the heat, and renders it less liable to crack than when the plaster is employed alone.\n\nIn making the mould for the page to be cast, a frame of cast-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> is prepared, nearly half an inch wider and larger than the page or pages proposed to be cast, and nearly an inch deep. This frame determines the thickness and strength of the mould. Four cubic pieces of metal are now required, the height of which should be exactly four-fifths of the height of the types; as on the height of these the thickness of the stereotype plate depends. The page or pages, wedged up as usual in the chases or iron frames <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> used, are now to be laid up on the moulding table, and in the openings at the corners of the page are placed the four pieces of metal, on which the iron frame rests when laid over the page.\n\nTo prevent the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ADHESION\">adhesion</a> of the plaster to the types it is necessary to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> over the surface of the page with a soft <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRUSH\">brush</a>. Then a quantity of the white-wash is taken into a wooden bowl, and as much finely powdered gypsum added to it as will make it into a thin plaster. When reduced to an equal consistence, it is applied to the face of the types with a painter's brush, so as to fill every cavity; and the remainder is then poured in so as to fill the frame. When beginning to harden, the superfluous plaster is struck off with a straight metal rule, to smooth the back of the mould; and when sufficiently consolidated the mould is separated from the page, and dried in an oven.\n\nThe mould properly formed, the next process is the casting of the plate. For this purpose, the dried mould is put in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAN\">pan</a> about two inches deep with the face upwards, and a small moveable screw is placed at each side or end of the pan, to fix the frame which contains the mould. The fluid metal (which is of the same composition as that used for ordinary types) is now applied to the mould in the pan, and carried to the oven, in which it should remain from one to two hours, to acquire an equal degree of heat; for, on the principle of equal temperature between the metal and moulds, the success of the operation materially depends; and unless the oven be kept sufficiently warm to raise the temperature of the mould to that of the fluid metal, the experiment cannot succeed.\n\nAfter the plate has been cast, little imperfections are frequently discovered; such as that of the top of the e or similar letters, having been full of dust when the mould was taken. The workman now takes the plate, and after clearing it of all superfluous metal, pulls a proof, marks the defects, and proceeds to make the requisite alterations. If any letter or word chance to be damaged in the course of the operation, it is cut out, and a letter or word from moveable types of the same size, cut to the proper depth, is inserted in its place. When this is done, the plate is ready for the press. The pages are ar-\nranged upon wooden blocks, and fastened <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> with slips of brass and a screw.\n\nSuch is the process of stereotyping, as usually practised; and such is its accuracy, that plates may be cast from copperplates as perfect as the engraving itself. Wood-cuts and ornaments of every kind may be cast in the same manner.\n\nA patent for producing stereotype plates, in a manner different from that now described, was granted to Mr Augustus Applegath, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SURREY\">Surrey</a>, printer, in April 1818. Mr Applegath's plan, however, is so similar to the process of Didot and Herhan, that it is not necessary to describe it. Both his mould and plates are procured by an impress on the semifluid metal in the act of congelation, in the manner originally practised by the French printers; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> he has invented for stamping the impression is the same in principle, though a little different in form, as the clich\u00e9 or stamping-machine of our continental neighbours. (Repertory of Arts, Vol. XXXVI. Second <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">Series</a>, p. 69.)\n\nAs connected with stereotype printing, it may be mentioned that Mr T. C. Hansard of London procured a patent, dated the 1st November 1817, for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of stereotype plate risers, with holdfasts or claws, which are formed of metal, are moveable, and easily adapted to any size of plates or forms. These plate risers were intended to supersede the wooden blocks upon which the plates were generally fixed. (Repertory of Arts, Vol. XXXIII. Second Series, p. 262.)\n\nThe advantages of stereotype printing are, saving in point of expense, and security against typographical errors. For works in great and general demand, such as the Greek and Roman classics, standard books in foreign languages, Bibles, Prayer Books, School-Books, &c. the saving in stereotyping is considerable. The expense of renewed composition in successive editions is thereby saved; and the additional capital expended in preparing the plates is, perhaps, more than compensated by the facility with which small editions of works can be printed without laying aside a stock of paper in warehouses to meet the gradual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a>. But it is only in works of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> that stereotype can be profitably employed. For works of living authors, successively improved by corrections and additions, stereotype printing is quite unsuitable. Mr Wilson, the coadjutor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Stanhope, in extending the practice of the art in England, stated, that the probable saving by stereotype to the public might be from 25 to 40 per cent.; but whatever may be the advantages in point of expense, its merit in point of accuracy is unquestionable. Dictionaries, classics, works on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARITHMETIC\">arithmetic</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a>, once made accurate, may for ever be kept so with but little chance of error. (q. q. q.)\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PLATES.*\n\nFig. 1, Plate CXI., represents a side elevation of the improved Stanhope Press; fig. 2, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> view, and fig. 3, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> plan; the same letters of reference being used upon all the figures. A A shows a strong cast-iron frame of the form represented in fig. 2. This frame is screwed down upon a piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a> B, which has another timber C morticed into it at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a>, forming a T frame, to serve as a base for the whole press. D D represent two horizontal rails, having channels formed along their upper surfaces, into which the two rails or ribs upon the underside of the carriage or table E E are adapted to slide. The carriage is put in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> by the action of the handle F and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARREL\">barrel</a> W, which has three strong straps or belts passing round its circumference, as seen in fig. 2; the ends of the said belts being attached to the opposite ends of the carriage, in the manner of ordinary printing presses. The table E E is made perfectly flat upon its upper surface in order to receive the form of the types: m represents the tympan, which is jointed to the end of the table; it is composed of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> frame of wrought iron, and fitted up in the usual manner.\n\nThe rails D D upon which the carriage runs, are secured to the main frame A A by screw bolts a a; the outer extremities of the rails D are united together by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> bars, and supported by an arched frame b and upright pillar G, the foot of which is bolted down to the timber C. H H represent the platen, which is guided in its perpendicular motion by a slider, I, moving between angular ribs formed within the opening of the main frame, as seen in fig. 2. The upper part d of the frame is considerably enlarged, and is perforated in the centre to receive a brass <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NUT\">nut</a> or female screw, through which the main screw of the press works. M shows an upright <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPINDLE\">spindle</a>, the lower end of which is formed with a pivot adapted to turn in a hole at the top of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> of the main frame; the upper part of the spindle M works through a collar c, formed in a piece of metal, which projects from the main frame, and is secured by a screw, as seen in figs. 2 and 3. N represents the handle of the press: it is firmly attached to the lower parts of the spindle M, by passing through a cross hole in the said spindle, and having a nut on the opposite side to keep it in its place. Thus, when the handle is moved backwards or forwards it turns the spindle M round, and by the operation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEVER\">lever</a> O, and connecting link P, the motion is communicated to the main screw, by the intervention of the arm or lever R fixed upon the top thereof. The platen is raised up and kept in contact with the end of the screw, by the operation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> weight S. The levers N O, and R, fig. 3, are represented in the positions they assume when at rest; but the dotted lines will serve to explain their positions when the power has been applied to the handle N; the motion in that case being limited by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> part of the connecting link P coming to bear against a projecting rib formed upon the upper surface of the lever O; at which period the lever O and connecting\n\n* Owing to an oversight, some of the figures in Plates CXI. and CXII. have been reversed.\nlink P will be nearly in one right line, and consequently exerting a very great power upon the lever R; which being nearly at right angles to the connecting link, is in a position to receive the greatest effect from the power applied to the handle N. The degree of pressure may be increased or diminished by the operation of the screw p at the end of the connecting link being disposed so as to admit of varying the effective length of the link.\n\nMr Parkin's Inking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARATUS\">Apparatus</a>.\n\nPlate CXI. fig. 4, shows a side view of the apparatus, which was obliged to be placed vertically in the Plate for want of room. Fig. 5 shows an horizontal plan. A represents a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> frame of metal which is mounted so as to slide freely backwards and forwards, being guided between a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of small rollers, b, the pivots of which turn in small standards attached to a fixed frame of cast iron, B, by screws and nuts so as to admit of raising or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOWERING\">lowering</a> any one of the rollers in order to adjust the position of the moving frame. I shows the inking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROLLER\">roller</a>, which is made of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> composition, being supported upon pivots working in short pieces of metal which project from the cross <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> a of the moving frame. The roller I receives its requisite supply of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INK\">ink</a> by passing over and rolling across the narrow table or metal plate T, as the moving frame is pushed in or drawn out by its handle H. The ink is distributed along the surface of the table T by means of a small furnishing roller F, being mounted in a carriage so as to be capable of rolling along the surface of the table T in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> at right angles to the motion of the sliding frame A. The furnishing roller F is made of the elastic composition, and receives the ink upon its circumference, by coming into contact with the ink boxes or reservoirs 1 and 2, situated at each end of the table T. The boxes 1 and 2 contain a supply of ink which finds its way slowly through a fine wire grating forming the face of the boxes; and is taken off upon the circumference of the furnishing roller every time that the moving frame is drawn out or put in. The carriage of the furnishing roller moves upon small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHEELS\">wheels</a> along the surface of the lower rail C of the fixed frame, and the pivots of the furnishing roller are not inserted into round holes through the plates of its carriage, but have the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> of sliding up and down a short distance in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a> holes; so that the circumference of the roller may always accommodate itself to the surface of the table T, along which it moves; the roller being kept down sufficiently by its own weight, in addition to the weight of several small metal rollers which are situated over the roller F, and adapted to bear upon it, for the purpose of distributing the ink more effectually upon its surface as it turns round. The traversing motion of the roller F, and its carriage along the table T, is effected in the following manner. The ends of the carriage have small catgut lines attached to them, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> over pulleys i i, situated at the ends of the cross rail C; the catgut lines then return under the rail C and pass round small horizontal pulleys k k, fixed also to the lower rail, as shown in fig. 6, from whence they proceed to two pulleys m, one only of which is seen in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> fig. 4, being placed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> together in one frame, but so as to turn round quite independent of each other. The frame of the pulleys m is screwed to the fixed frame B, and the catgut lines pass up and over two pulleys n fixed in a frame in the same manner as the pulleys m. Both of the pulleys n are seen in the plan, fig. 5, where one of the catgut lines marked o is represented as attached directly to the cross bar e of the moving frame A; and the other catgut line p is conducted over a pulley q, which is mounted in a frame projecting from the fixed cross bar t of the frame B: the line p then returns and is attached to the cross bar e in the same manner as the line o. This apparatus is intended to be fixed behind the printing press (as represented by the dotted lines in fig. 7, Plate CXI.), in such position that the surface of the table T may be exactly on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> with the surface of the form of types to be inked; and so that the pressman may take hold of the handle H, and thereby move the frame A with its inking roller I across the types, to apply the ink and prepare them for printing.\n\nColumbian Press.\n\nA front view of this press is represented in fig. 7, Plate CXI., and a side elevation in fig. 8. A shows the standards or main frame, of cast iron; they are united together at the bottom, but separate at the top; the main frame is supported upon four legs, x x. B B represent the rails or guides, upon which the carriage or table, C C, with its appendages of tympan, z, and frisket, y, is adapted to run, being moved backwards and forwards by the handle, E, and barrel, F, round which strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> belts are passed, and affixed to braces v w at each end of the carriage, as in ordinary printing presses. D shows the platen, which is guided in its motion up and down by its square stem or pillar, d, being placed angleways, and sliding between pieces of metal, a a, which project from the main frame, A A. The pieces a a are furnished with adjusting screws and wedges for the purpose of tightening them up, and preventing any looseness in the platen. The stem d has a square plate, e, upon it at the part where it joins to the platen. The pressure is produced by a combination of levers situated at the upper part of the frame, G H, I, shows the main lever, moving on a strong centre bolt at H, between a forked or divided part of the main frame; the end, I, of this lever also passes through an oblong opening formed between the bars, h, and projects some distance beyond the outside of the frame. The central part, G, of the main lever has a strong pivot or trunnion cast upon it; which projects out sufficiently on each side to enter into collars formed at the top of the stem, d, of the platen, being retained in their places by four screw bolts, two of which are seen at G in figure 7. m, n, o, shows the second lever, moving on a fixed centre <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PIN\">pin</a> in the main frame at m; it has the links n I jointed to it at the point n, one upon each side, as seen in figure 8; the uppermost ends of these links are also jointed on each side of the main lever at I. The point o of the second lever has the link or connecting-rod, p, jointed to it, whilst the opposite extremity of the connecting-rod is jointed to the lever or handle N, by which the pressman puts the system of levers into action.\nThe handle N turns upon a fixed centre pin passing through projecting pieces of the main frame, as seen at i; and the connecting-rod p is furnished with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a>, where it unites with the lever o, to admit of the oblique motion of the handle N, when it is pulled forwards to produce the pressure.\n\nA <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTER\">counter</a>-lever, r, s, t, is applied at the top of the press, moving upon a fulcrum at s; this lever has a balance weight clamped upon it by a screw at r, whilst the short end, t, of the lever is attached by a link to the end of the main lever at the end I. By this means the weight of the levers and platen is counterbalanced sufficiently to raise them up, when the handle N is left at liberty. The different levers in this press are so arranged, that the first motion which is communicated to the handle N brings the platen down quickly; but by the time that its under surface arrives upon the tympan, the second lever, m, n, is brought nearly in a line with the direction of the links u I, which causes them to draw down the end, I, of the main lever with great power; at the same time that the point, o, of the second lever is in the most favourable position to be operated upon powerfully by the connecting-rod proceeding from the handle N. When the impression is produced, two balance weights act in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONCERT\">concert</a> to return the handle N, and raise up the platen. The main frame A A of the press is strengthened by a cross bar situated behind the main lever, which bar serves to connect the top parts of the frame together, as shown by the dotted lines in fig. 7.\n\nBarclay's American Press.\n\nFig. 1, Plate CXII. represents a side elevation of this press; fig. 2 is a back view; and fig. 3 a horizontal plan, representing the table or carriage as partly run in. The same letters of reference are used upon all the figures. A A represents the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEEKS\">cheeks</a> or iron frame of the press, being of a curved form, as seen in fig. 2, and supported upon cast iron legs, B B. C C shows the table to receive the form of types; it is composed of a cast iron plate turned and ground perfectly flat upon its upper surface, and strengthened by deep ribs on the underside, two of which ribs are made straight, and serve as guides to slide in grooves upon the upper edge of the rails D D, as seen in fig. 2, for running the carriage backwards and forwards. The carriage is moved by the handle E in the usual manner. G G represent strong brackets which are cast upon the main frame of the press, and serve to support the rails D D, at the part where the pressure is applied. The farther ends of the rails are united by a cross piece, H, seen in fig. 3, from which two small pillars, I, descend to the ground, to support the weight of the carriage when run out. K K shows the platen; it is guided so as to move steadily up and down by the metal frames or bars, L L, being screwed to its upper surface in such manner as to embrace the upper part of the main frame of the press, and slide between small projecting pieces, c c. The bars L L are furnished with spiral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a>, which bear upon the top of the frame A A, and serve to balance the weight of the platen, keeping it always clear above the surface of the tympan, when the handle N of the press is left at liberty.\n\nWe shall now describe the manner in which the requisite pressure is effected in this press. R and S, figs. 1 and 2, represent two steel cylinders or rollers, having small projecting flanges on each end: the upper roller R, bears against the under surface of an inclined steel plate which is screwed to the projecting part T, of the main frame, and the under roller S, bears upon the upper surface of a similar inclined steel plate screwed upon the upper boss V, of the platen. In this situation a steel wedge is introduced between the rollers R and S, and this wedge is connected by a link W, with the lever or handle N, of the press, as shown in the plate, fig. 3. Now it is evident, that if the steel wedge is drawn forcibly between the rollers R and S, it will roll them along between the two inclined steel plates, and consequently force the plates asunder; and, since one of the inclined plates is fixed to the platen, and the other to the solid frame of the press, the platen will be forced down upon the types placed beneath it. The two small figures Y and Z, representing the rollers, &c., detached from the press, will serve to explain their operation. The rollers R and S, as also the inclined plates T V, and the wedge W, are made of steel, and hardened in the most perfect manner; otherwise, the immense pressure acting upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> line of contact upon their surfaces would indent them, and totally destroy their operation. The handle N moves upon a fixed center of motion, at N, in the projecting part of the frame, Q Q, and the pressure is regulated by lengthening or shortening the connecting link W, which is furnished with a screw in the middle of its length for that purpose. The rails D D, upon which the carriage moves, are furnished with small square pieces of steel placed at regular distances.\n\nRuthven's Press.\n\nPlate CXII. figures 4, 5, and 6. Fig. 4 on the Plate shows an horizontal plan of the press; fig. 5, a vertical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> taken through the middle; and fig. 6, an end view. The same letters of reference are used on all the figures. A A represents the table or surface upon which the form of types is laid. This table is mounted upon a framing of cast iron, consisting of four upright legs, B, strengthened by diagonal braces C. Immediately beneath the table two levers, D E, D E, are situated, moving upon fixed centers or fulcrums, at D D. These levers are jointed to double hooks or clutches F F, so that when the ends, E, of the levers are depressed or drawn down by the links, a (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> with a third lever G, H, I), the hooks F F are drawn down also, but with a slow motion. The fulcrum of the third lever is at G, and the point H is where the power is applied to actuate it by the connecting-rod K; the opposite end of which is jointed to a crank or short lever, situated upon an axis, L, which extends to the front of the press, and is furnished with a winch or handle N, for the pressman to move it by. M represents the platen. It has a strong metal bar, P, united to it by screws, r r, at the extremities of the bar P; strong iron bolts, d d, are secured by nuts upon their uppermost ends. These bolts have heads or projections formed at their lower ends, which are exactly fitted to the hooks or clutches, F F; by this means the\nPrinting platen is connected occasionally with the levers D E, D E, and may be brought down upon the types by the pressman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> the winch N, in the direction shown by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARROW\">arrow</a> in fig. 5.\n\nBy returning the winch N to its original position, the pressure is relieved, and the platen M may be removed from off the types. Thus, at the ends of the bar P, two springs c e are affixed, and in the ends of these springs small rollers or wheels are fitted to move freely upon these center pins. These wheels have grooves in their edges, adapted to run upon the angles of two rails R R, which extend on each side of the table A A, and project sufficiently behind the press to support the platen, when pushed back from off the types into the position shown in figures 4 and 6. The springs c e are so adjusted, that when the platen moves along upon the rails R R, its under surface will be raised up sufficiently above the tympan to allow it to come into its proper position, to produce the pressure; as shown by the dotted lines in fig. 6; or to go back into its original situation, without meeting with obstruction; but when the hooks F and bolts d are united, and the pressure brought on by turning the winch N, the springs yield and permit the platen to press upon the types. The platen in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> originally made by Mr Ruthven was contrived to be brought forward by a treddle; but in the presses since made, it is both brought forward and pushed back by the handle n. The centers of motion D D of the great levers, and of the lever G, as well as the pivots L of the winch N, are all supported in one frame, composed of two metal cheeks, which are situated beneath the table, and united thereto by screws, as shown by the dotted lines in the Plan, fig. 4. The lever G H is in the most favourable position to receive the action of the rod K, viz. perpendicular to it; and the lever G I is in a position to exert a greater power upon the links a, and levers D E, than when it is in the horizontal position; for when the pressman first takes the handle N, it acts with but little advantage as to power upon the levers, and, therefore, brings the platen down very quickly upon the tympan; but when the handle has arrived near the horizontal position, then the power it exerts to bring down the platen is immensely great. The tympan is jointed to one end of the table in the usual manner.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACON\">Bacon</a> and Donkin's Printing Machine.\n\nPlate CXIII. The machine represented in the Plate is furnished with a square <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRISM\">prism</a>, marked A, having four surfaces, upon which the types are fixed. The pivots at the ends of its axis are supported in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARINGS\">bearings</a> in the frames B B, and it is caused to revolve by a connection of wheelwork D E and F G, from the fly wheel and winch H. The types yield their impression upon the paper by means of the platen I, which is placed immediately beneath the printing prism. The circumference of the platen being formed, as shown at I in the section, fig. 3, applies itself in its revolution to the surface of the types. The ink is applied to the types by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a> K, placed above the prism. It is composed of a soft elastic substance upon a metallic cylinder or axis; and, that its surface may always apply to the types, its spindle is fitted in the pieces L, which move upon an axis n, so as to allow the cylinder to rise and fall, and thereby accommodate itself to the prism. The inking cylinder receives its ink from a second cylinder M, which is called the Distributing Roller, having also an elastic surface, which is supplied with ink by a third roller N, made of metal, and turned as true and cylindrical as possible. The ink is deposited in quantity against this roller, upon a steel plate O, the edge of which being placed at a very small adjustable distance from the circumference, permits the roller, as it revolves, to carry down upon its surface a thin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-FILM\">film</a> of ink, which being taken off by the distributing roller, is applied to the surface of the inking cylinder, which, as before mentioned, inks the types.\n\nThe sheet of paper to be printed is introduced to the machine by placing it upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLANKET\">blanket</a>, which is extended upon a feeding board P, and drawn in at a proper time by having a small rail or ruler a, fig. 3, fixed to it; the ends of which are taken forwards by studs b attached to endless chains, extending from the wheels c (at the end of the platen seen in fig. 1), to other wheels d, which are supported in the frame of the feeding board. The wheels e, having <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a> entering the links of the chains, cause them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRAVERSE\">traverse</a> and draw the blanket and sheet of paper into the machine. The page or pages of types are composed in the usual manner in galleyes, which galleyes are attached by screw clamps to the sides of the printing prism, so as to be readily taken off. They are also furnished with adjusting screws to fix them exactly in their proper situations, as shown in the Front Elevation, fig. 1. The two wheels D E, which cause the prism and platen to accompany each other in their revolution, are formed, as shown in fig. 4, to correspond with the prism and platen: thus the upper wheel D, is a square with its angles rounded off, and the geometrical outline is exactly the same as that of the prism. The lower wheel E, is of the same shape as the platen, and its pitch line the exact shape of the surface thereof. These wheels being toothed must revolve together, so that no slipping or sliding can take place between the surfaces of the printing prism and platen at the point of contact.\n\nTo regulate the pressure upon the paper, the bearings in which the pivots of the platen are supported can be elevated by screws, and to prevent any derangement of the wheels, D and E, by such adjustment, universal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a> are applied in their axes, as shown at R in fig. 1. The inking cylinder is turned round by a cog-wheel V upon the extremity of the axis of the prism, which is the same shape as the wheel D and shapes T. The wheel V communicates motion to a circular wheel W, fixed upon the end of the spindle of the inking cylinder. The wheel W gives motion to the distributing roller M, by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PINION\">pinion</a> f, and this again turns the ink roller N by a third pinion g, fixed upon the end of its axis n, which is supported upon bearings on the frame B B. The pieces L L, which support the pivots of the distributing roller and inking cylinder, are fitted upon the axis n of the ink roller, so as to rise and fall upon it as a center of motion. The steel plate o for regulating the supply of ink to the roller N, is supported by a bar\nof metal extending across the fixed frame B B, and the ink is prevented from flowing off at the ends of plate o, by pieces of metal p, which enter a short distance into grooves formed round the ink roller N near its ends. The frame, supporting the feeding board P, is composed of two rails fitted upon round parts of the axis of the platen, and borne up at their outermost ends by a brace from the wood framing of the machine; these rails sustain the pivots of the wheels d, as shown at X in fig. 2. The feeding board has two ledges c formed along its sides to allow the rulers a of the blanket to slide freely upon, in their progress to the types; and the space left between the segments of the platen, as seen at 6 in the section, fig. 3, receives the ruler a.\n\nBensley's Printing Machine.\n\nFig. 1, Plate CXIV, represents a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSPECTIVE\">perspective</a> view of a machine employed in Mr Bensley's printing office, which is moved by the power of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEAM_ENGINE\"><a class=\"xr</a>ef\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEAM\">steam</a>-engine. It is supposed to be in the act of printing, being attended by two boys, one of whom is occupied in laying on the blank sheets of paper, and the other in receiving the printed sheets as they quit the machine. Fig. 2 shows a longitudinal section of the machine, to explain the manner in which the paper passes through to receive the impression upon both sides, and also the means employed to apply the ink to the surface of the types. Though all the material motions of the machine are displayed, yet some of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> parts, which produce the various movements, have been omitted, in consequence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIMINUTIVE\">diminutive</a> scale of the figures, which is only about one-third of an inch to a foot.\n\nThe supply of blank paper is laid upon a support or table, A, from whence the sheets are taken, one by one, by a boy standing upon an elevated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATFORM\">platform</a>, who lays them out upon the table B, which has a number of narrow linen tapes or girths passing across its surface. These tapes are formed into endless bands, which extend round the cylinders, or rollers C and D, in such a manner, that when the rollers are turned round, the motion of the tapes will carry the sheet of paper along with them, and deliver over the roller E, where it is seized between two systems of endless tapes, passing over a series of rollers to keep them extended. These endless tapes are so adapted, in number and position, as to fall between the pages of printing, and also on the outsides, or beyond the margin of the printing; they may, therefore, remain in contact with the sheet of paper on both sides during its whole passage through the machine; by which means the paper being once received or taken between the two systems of endless tapes, it will be capable of continuing its motion along with the tapes, in order to bring it into a situation to be printed on both sides, without destroying the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGISTER\">register</a> (or coincidence of the pages on the opposite sides of the sheet). F and G represent the two main cylinders which effect the pressure upon the paper. They are mounted upon strong axes, which turn in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a> bearings affixed to the main frame of the machine. H and I are two intermediate cylinders situated upon axes between the main cylinders. Their use is to effect the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERSION\">inversion</a> of the sheet of paper, in order to print the opposite side.\n\nWe must now describe the manner in which the two systems of endless tapes before mentioned are arranged, to give a clear idea of the operation of the machine. We will suppose one system of tapes to commence at the upper part of the roller E, from whence they proceed in contact with the under portion of the circumference of the main cylinder F; they then pass over the upper portion of the intermediate cylinder H, and under the intermediate cylinder I, from whence they proceed to encompass a considerable portion of the main cylinder G; and by passing in contact with the rollers a, b, c, d, and e, they arrive again at the roller E, from whence they commenced; thereby forming one of the systems of endless tapes. The other system we will suppose to commence at the roller h. They are equal in their number to the tapes already described, and correspond with them also in their place upon the cylinders, so that the sheets of paper may be securely held between them. The second tapes descend from the roller k to the roller E, where they meet and coincide with the first system, in such a manner that the tapes proceed together under the main cylinder F, over the cylinder H, under the cylinder I, and round the main cylinder G, until they arrive at the roller i, where they separate; having remained thus far in actual contact, except at the places where the sheets of paper are held between them. From the roller i the tapes descend to the roller k, and by passing in contact with the rollers m, n, and o, they arrive at the roller h, from whence they commenced. Thus the two systems of endless tapes are established and arranged so as to be capable of circulating continually without interfering with each other. The cylinders F, G, H, and I, as also the roller E, are connected by toothed wheels, as represented in the perspective view, fig. 1, so as to cause their circumferences to move with one uniform velocity, and thereby prevent any sliding or shifting of the two systems of tapes over each other during their motion; as much of the perfection of the printing depends upon this circumstance. The separate forms of types for printing the two sides of the sheet are placed at a certain distance under upon one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> carriage, which is represented in a detached state at fig. 3. This carriage, with the forms of type secured upon it, is adapted to move backwards and forwards upon steady guides or supports attached to the main frame of the machine; in such a position, that the surfaces of the types may be operated upon by the circumference of their respective cylinders F and G, to produce the impression as the carriage moves backwards and forwards. This reciprocating movement of the carriage is effected by a pinion fixed upon the end of a vertical spindle, K, fig. 2, engaging in the teeth of an endless <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACK\">rack</a>, L L, which is connected by a system of levers with the type carriage in such a manner, that when the pinion is turned round, it engages at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> periods in the teeth formed upon the opposite sides of the rack L L, and consequently on the opposite circumference of the pinion; thereby a continuous motion of the pinion communicates a reciprocating mo-\ntion to the rack and carriage; the vertical spindle K is turned by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of bevelled wheels from the pinion P, fig. 1, which receives its motion by an intermediate wheel, Q, from the toothed wheel upon the end of the main cylinder G.\n\nThe mechanism for furnishing and distributing the ink upon the surfaces of the types in this machine is very ingeniously arranged, and performs its operation with great certainty. It is one of the most important <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>, and the most difficult to effect in printing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACHINES\">machines</a>. Two similar and complete systems of inking apparatus, one situated at each end of the machine, are adapted to ink their respective forms of types; we will therefore describe, by reference to the fig. 2, the inking apparatus situated at the right <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> end of the machine. It consists of a cylindrical metal roller, N, which has a slow rotatory motion communicated to it by a catgut band passing round a small pulley upon the end of the axis of the main cylinder G. The roller N is adapted to carry down a thin film of ink upon its circumference, by turning in contact with a mass of ink disposed upon a horizontal plate of metal, the edge of which plate is ground straight, and fixed by screws r r, at a small adjustable distance from the surface of the said roller. O represents an elastic composition roller, which is mounted in a frame turning upon an axis, p, extending across the main frame of the machine. This roller is connected by cranked levers with a small eccentric circle fixed upon the end of the axis of the cylinder G (as seen in fig. 1), which causes it to move round the axis p, and remain for a short period in contact with the surface of the ink roller N (as seen by the position at the left hand end of the machine, fig. 2), thereby receiving a portion of ink upon its surface; it then descends and rests with its whole weight upon the surface of a flat metal plate or table, T, which is affixed to the type carriage, as seen in fig. 3; so that the reciprocating motion of the carriage causes the ink table T to receive ink upon its surface from the elastic roller O. In this situation, when the type carriage returns, the surface of the table T is obliged to pass under three small elastic rollers (seen at R), which are mounted upon pivots in a frame, with liberty of motion up and down, in order that the rollers may bear with their weight upon the surface of the table. The frame in which they are centered has also a slight end motion given to it by the inclined form of the end of the table T (as seen in fig. 3), bearing against a roller fixed upon the said frame. Thus the small composition rollers R operate in a very complete manner to equalize the supply of ink over the surface of the table T, and by the farther motion of the type carriage, the ink table is caused to pass under four small elastic rollers (seen at S), which, in like manner, bear with their weight upon the surface of the table (but without end motion), and thereby take up the ink upon their circumferences. The type carriage then returns, for the table T to receive a new supply of ink, and by the form of types passing under the elastic rollers S, the letters become inked in a very perfect and uniform manner. Whilst the operation of inking the types is going on at one end of the machine, the printing is performed at the other end on one of the sides of the sheet from the types last inked, and vice versa. The type carriage is caused to move steadily along with the circumferences of the cylinders F and G, by having racks Y Y formed on each side of the forms of types (as seen in fig. 3), which engage with sectors or portions of toothed wheels, x x, upon the ends of the said cylinders; at which part the surfaces of the cylinders are covered with a blanket or felt, to give elasticity, and cause them to press equally upon the paper, as in ordinary printing presses.\n\nThe machine is put in motion by a strap, y y, passing round a pulley, X, as seen in fig. 1; upon the axis of which pulley a pinion is fixed, engaging with the teeth of the large wheel upon the end of the main cylinder G. Thus the various cylinders, with their two systems of tapes, are caused to revolve with an uniform movement in the direction of the arrows (seen in fig. 2), whilst the type carriage travels alternately backwards and forwards upon its guides, as before mentioned. The operation of printing is performed as follows: The sheets of blank paper are laid one by one upon the table B, so as to bear upon the linen tapes which extend over its surface. In this situation the rollers C and D are caused to move a portion of a revolution, by the operation of a lever fixed upon the axis of the roller D, being acted upon by another lever fixed on the cog-wheel of the main cylinder F. This motion advances the sheet of paper sufficiently to enable it to be seized between the two systems of endless tapes at the point where they meet each other, or between the rollers h and E. As soon as the sheet of paper is carried clear off the table B, the rollers C and D are caused to turn back again to their original position, by the operation of a weight, W, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CORD\">cord</a>, w, as seen in fig. 2, ready to advance a second sheet of blank paper into the machine. The sheet of paper is carried along between the systems of tapes, and applies itself to the circumference of the main cylinder F, upon the blanket before mentioned; and by the continuous motion of the cylinder, the sheet of paper is pressed upon the surface of the form of types as they pass under the cylinder by the reciprocating motion of the carriage. By this means one of the sides of the sheet receives its impression at the same time the form of types situated at the opposite end of the carriage is receiving its ink, as before described. Now, by the continuous motion of the machine, the sheet of paper advances in company with the endless tapes round the intermediate cylinders H and I, until it applies itself to the blanket upon the surface of the main cylinder G; at which place it will be found in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERTED\">inverted</a> position, so that the printed side of the sheet is in contact with the blanket and the blank side of the sheet downwards, which, upon meeting with the other form of types at the proper instant, is pressed upon their surface sufficiently to produce the impression. Thus having arrived at the point i, where the two systems of tapes separate, the printed sheet is delivered upon the board Z, where it is received by a boy, and laid upon the pile.","sp":413,"ep":424},{"h":"TABLE\nOF THE\nARTICLES AND TREATISES\nCONTAINED IN THIS WORK","t":"VOL.

It is clear, therefore, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> lasting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> real injury could be done to those professional men, whose earnings are proportioned to the necessary expenses of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>, by subjecting them to a tax on income.\n\nIt may be supposed, however, that the effect would be different in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of those whose incomes are not regulated so much by the expense of their education, as by the expense of maintaining themselves in the station in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> and the habits of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> require they should live. But this circumstance does not really make the slightest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> on the result. The situation of professional men must always bear some certain relation to the situation of those among whom they reside. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> you either improve or depress the condition of the landlords and capitalists of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be found to be utterly impossible to maintain professional men in their previous situation. Their interests are inseparably and indissolubly connected with those of the other classes: they must rise when they rise, and they must <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> when they fall. Suppose, to illustrate this principle, that a tax is laid on the incomes of landlords and capitalists, from which the incomes of professional men are exempted. It is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, that the immediate effect of such a tax would be to derange the previously subsisting relations among the different classes and orders of society. The condition of professional men, as compared with that of landlords, farmers, manufacturers, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a>, would be improved. But this improvement would be of very short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>. For the greater inducements, which the exemption from the tax would hold out to young men to enter on professional pursuits, would not fail to attract additional numbers, until, by the increase of competition, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WAGES\">wages</a> had declined so as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> the advantage of exemption from the tax, and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> them in the same relative situation as before.\n\nIf we reverse this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>, and suppose, that, instead of professional incomes being exempted from an income-tax, it is laid exclusively on them, the result will be precisely similar. The situation of professional men, as compared with that of the other classes, would in this case be changed to the worse. There would, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, be a greater disinclination to engage in professional pursuits: and the usual supply of entrants not being obtained, their numbers would be progressively diminished, until the greater competition for their services had again restored them to their proper relative situation; or to the situation they would have occupied, had the tax been levied equally on all classes.\n\nStill, however, it may be said, that though no injustice is done to professional men by taxing them to the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> as capitalists, when an income-tax forms a permanent source of revenue, an injustice would be done them were they taxed to the full extent of the other classes, in the event of its only being imposed during the continuance of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>; because, in such a case, sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> would not be afforded to permit the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> principles of adjustment we have described to operate their full effect. But this objection is as untenable as the former. Wars are calamities to which every people must always be liable; and if it were once known that the supplies required to defray their expence were to be raised within the year, by an equal income-tax, the chances of being subjected to this tax would most certainly enter into the calculations of all professional men, and the rate of their natural or necessary wages would be regulated accordingly. In every case, therefore; whether an income-tax is made one of the ordinary sources of revenue, or is only resorted to on extraordinary emergencies, professional incomes ought to be taxed to the same extent as others. To give abatements in their favour, serves only to introduce an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> inequality into the tax, and to render its collection more difficult, without doing them any real <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>. If you give them an abatement, their fees will be diminished; and if you do not give it, they will be raised; so that, in either case, they will preserve the same relative situation with respect to the other classes of society.\n\nThe only class in whose favour it would be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> and equitable to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> an abatement from the full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> on account of an income-tax, are those who derive their incomes from fixed and terminable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ANNUITIES\">annuities</a>. It is obvious, that such a tax would press with greater severity on them than on landlords or capitalists, whose incomes are derived from what may be considered as inexhaustible sources; and it would also press with greater severity on them than on professional men, whose incomes would be augmented in consequence of its imposition; and, therefore, it would be necessary to avoid laying any greater burden on the possessors of terminable annuities, than on the other classes; or, to preserve them in the same relative situation, to make an abatement in their favour in an inverse proportion to the duration of their annuities.\n\nIf an income-tax were extended to the wages of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> labourers, it would not really fall upon them, but on the capitalists who employ them. And it would, therefore, be necessary, in the event of such a tax being imposed, to increase the proportion affecting the rents of the landlords; for otherwise they would be less heavily taxed than the capitalists, who would have to pay the portion which falls on wages.\n\nAn Income-tax ought not to bear the same relation to all incomes. A tax of L. 10, for example, is said to be more severely felt by the possessor of an income of L. 100, than a tax of L. 1000 or L. 10,000, by the possessor of an income of L. 1000 or L. 10,000; and it is contended, that, in order fairly to proportion the tax to the ability of the payers, such a graduated scale of duties should be adopted, as would press lightly on the smaller incomes, and increase according as they became larger, and more able to bear taxation. We cannot, however, concur with those who hold this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>. It is surely no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the business of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">Government</a> to impose taxes, in the view of regulating the incomes of the contributors, or for the purpose of depressing one class and elevating another. Every just tax will leave individuals in the same relative situation in which it found them; and it cannot do this otherwise, than by taking the same proportion of their incomes from each. That such a tax will be more acutely\nfelt by the poorer than by the wealthier classes is undeniable; but the same thing is true of taxes on commodities, and of every imposition which does not subvert the already subsisting relations among the different orders of society. The hardship in question is, in fact, one of the evils of poverty, and not of equal taxation; and to attempt to alleviate it, by adopting such a graduated scale of duties as has been proposed, would really be to impose taxes on the wealthier part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a>, for the benefit of their less opulent brethren, and not for the sake of the public revenue. The establishment of such a principle would be most mischievous; if carried to its full extent, it would sanction the total exemption of limited incomes from the burden of taxation, until those that were higher had been reduced to the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a>; and would thus be subversive of almost every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a> to industry and economy.\n\nThe objections to an equal income-tax, on the ground of its making \"no distinction between the income which has a numerous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> to support, and that of the retired bachelor or the unexpensive maiden,\"* are still more destitute of foundation. In fact, the peculiar excellence of an income-tax consists in its making no such distinction,\u2014in its sweeping, with indiscriminating severity, its equal demands from all. If taxes be not laid on income, they must be laid on expenditure; and it is obvious, that while an individual who has an expensive station or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> family to support, must contribute largely to taxes on expenditure, misers and those who have no families may nearly escape them altogether. It has been suggested, that this inequality might be got rid of by making distinctions in the duties on commodities, proportioned to the relative condition of those who buy them; or by enacting, that those who have so many children shall pay a certain duty, and those who have so many more, a different duty. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> complexity of such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>, and the facilities it would give to every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of fraud and evasion, will always prevent its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADOPTION\">adoption</a>. Supposing, however, that it could be adopted, it would be, in the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, unjust and inexpedient,\u2014unjust, in as much as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> of duties in favour of those who have small incomes, would proportionally depress the wealthier classes, and change the relative situation of individuals; and inexpedient, in as much as a reduction in favour of those who have large families, would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> as a stimulus to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a>, which, if it ought not to be discouraged, certainly stands in no need of encouragement. So <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, therefore, as taxes affect only expenditure, those who are obliged to spend must unavoidably pay more than their just proportion of the public revenue. But a fairly levied tax on income would obviate this defect, and would make misers, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACHELORS\">bachelors</a>, and maidens, contribute equally with the other classes to the demands of the state.\n\nFor these reasons, we have no hesitation in giving it as our decided opinion, that if a tax on income could be fairly collected, it would be one of the most impartial and least objectionable taxes that it is possible to impose. It may, however, be laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> as an indisputable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-AXIOM\">axiom</a>, that every tax which affords a great facility of evasion is essentially defective; and there are very cogent reasons for thinking that this must always be the case with an income-tax. The income derived from lands, houses, and other fixed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>, may be learned without much difficulty; but it has hitherto been found to be quite impossible to ascertain the wages of professional persons, or the profits of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> engaged in manufacturing and commercial undertakings with any thing like tolerable precision. It is this extreme difficulty of making an equal and impartial assessment, that constitutes the real and only good objection to an income-tax. By setting the interests of the contributors in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> opposition to their duties, and tempting them to conceal and underrate their incomes, it obviously operates as a bounty on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERJURY\">perjury</a> and fraud; and, if carried to a very great height, it would undoubtedly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATE\">generate</a> the most flagrant and barefaced prostitution of principle, and would do much to obliterate that nice <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> which is the only sure foundation of national probity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>. The discovery of means by which these highly injurious effects might be obviated, and incomes ascertained without the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of instituting an odious and generally ineffectual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INQUISITION\">inquisition</a> into the private affairs of individuals, would be the greatest practical improvement which it seems possible to make in the science of taxation. But until such means are devised,\u2014and we are not certainly very sanguine in our expectations on the subject,\u2014an income-tax must, besides its injury to public morals, be partial and unequal in its operation, and ought not, therefore, to be imposed, except in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> when a large revenue must be raised.\n\nIn order to furnish the means of defraying the enormous cost of the war begun in 1793, Mr Pitt the late proposed, in 1797, to triple the amount of the assessed taxes, or duties on houses, windows, horses, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARRIAGES\">carriages</a>, &c. This plan, however, did not answer the expectations of its projectors, and next year it was abandoned, and a tax on income substituted in its stead. According to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> of the act imposing this tax, all incomes of less than L.60 a year were exempted from assessment; an income of from L.60 to L.65 was taxed one hundred and twentieth part; and the rate of duty increased through a variety of gradations, until the income reached L.200, or upwards, when it amounted to a tenth part, which was its utmost limit; a variety of deductions being at the same time granted, on account of children, &c. The commissioners to whom the management of this tax was entrusted were chosen by the freeholders of counties, and the electors of burghs, in the same way as their representatives in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a>, only that a smaller qualification was sufficient to enable any one to be elected a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSIONER\">commissioner</a>. The services of the commissioners were gratuitous; and they were sworn to preserve the most inviolable secrecy with respect to the affairs of individuals. They\n\n---\n\n* Glover On the Character and Tendency of the Property-Tax. Pamphleteer, Vol. VIII. p. 563.\nwere authorized to call for returns from every person whose income they supposed to exceed \u00a360 a year; and in the event of their being dissatisfied with these returns, they were empowered to call for written explanations, and ultimately for the oath of the party. But this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> was rarely necessary, except in the case of incomes derived from wages, from capital employed in manufacturing and commercial business, or from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> of loans; the rental of landlords being, in most cases, learned from the terms of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LEASES\">leases</a> held by their tenants; and the profits of the tenants being, as we have already observed, estimated at a certain proportion of the rent. The commissioners were assisted, or rather overlooked, by the tax-surveyors appointed by Government, who were required to see the provisions of the act strictly enforced, and whose duty it was to scrutinize all returns of income, to challenge such as they considered fraudulent, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> to the deductions allowed by the ordinary commissioners, and to bring the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> under the review of the commissioners of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a>, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FINAL\">final</a>. Notwithstanding the apparent complexity of these regulations, they worked extremely well; and though much fraud and evasion were certainly practised, yet, on the whole, the tax was collected with infinitely less difficulty, and with greater fairness and equality, than could have been rationally anticipated.\n\nThis tax was repealed in 1802, after the peace of Amiens, having produced, on an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a>, about five millions and a half annually.\n\nIn 1803 the income-tax, under the name of property-tax, was again revived. The assessment began, as before, on incomes so low as \u00a360 a year, and gradually increased until the income reached \u00a3150 a year, when it amounted to 5 per cent., which was its highest rate. An addition was made to this tax in 1805; and in 1806, during the short-lived administration of Mr Fox and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Grenville, the assessment was raised to 10 per cent. on all incomes, however small, arising from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> or capital; professional incomes under \u00a350 were exempted from the tax; and incomes of that sort exceeding \u00a350, and under \u00a3150, the limit at which they became subject to the full assessment of 10 per cent., were allowed deductions, varying inversely as their magnitude. A very great outcry was made against the ministers who proposed this addition to the income-tax; but it may safely be affirmed that, in the then situation of the country, it was a highly necessary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, and one for which they really deserved the thanks of the public. The income-tax was finally repealed in 1816.\n\nWe subjoin, from a Parliamentary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> presented to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">House</a> of Commons on the 26th February 1823, a return of the total <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">net</a> assessments to the property or income-tax, for the year ending 5th of April 1815:\n\n| Gross Assessment | Net Assessment |\n|------------------|---------------|\n| A.

V.\u2014<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">Poor</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATES\">Rates</a>.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INCIDENCE\">incidence</a> and effect of poor rates depend on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> in which they are imposed. If they were laid exclusively on the land, and levied proportionally to its rent, they would be really a tax on rent, and would be wholly defrayed by the landlords. If they were laid exclusively on the rent of houses, they would, in certain circumstances, fall wholly on the occupiers, in others on the builders, and in others on the occupiers and ground landlords; and, if they were laid on profits, they would fall equally on farmers, manufacturers, and merchants, or on capitalists in general. In the actual state of things in this country, we believe that a much larger proportion of the poor rates falls on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">farmer</a> than on any one else; and they, consequently, contribute to raise the price of his produce just as any other tax affecting either his crop or the instruments used by him in cultivation. Mr Ricardo has made an allowance for this greater pressure of the poor rates on the farmer in his estimate of the countervailing duty to be laid on foreign corn, to balance the excess of taxes affecting that which is raised at home.\n\nHaving thus endeavoured to exhibit the operation, and to trace the ultimate incidence and effect of such taxes as fall directly on income, we come now to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> branch of our subject, or to the\nAdvantages consideration of those taxes which fall indirectly on income.\n\nPART III.\u2014Indirect Taxes.\n\nSECT. I.\u2014Advantages and Disadvantages of Indirect Taxes.\n\nThough most governments have had recourse to direct taxes, they have rarely formed the sole or even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> source of their revenue. Indirect taxes have almost invariably been the greatest favourites both of princes and their subjects; and there are a variety of reasons why this should be the case. The burden of direct taxation is palpable and obvious. It admits of no species of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISGUISE\">disguise</a> or concealment, but makes every one fully sensible of the exact value of the portion of his income taken from him by government. There is, however, a natural and inherent repugnance in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a> to part with the produce of industry, except for the purpose of obtaining some more acceptable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> in its stead. And as the benefits derived from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> of government are neither so very obvious nor striking as to be easily and readily felt and appreciated by the great body of the people, there is, in the great majority of cases, an extreme disinclination to pay a large amount of direct taxes. It is for this reason that governments have so generally had recourse to indirect taxes. Instead of exciting the prejudices of their subjects by openly demanding a certain specific portion of their incomes, they have taxed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> on which these incomes are in general expended! The effect of this ingenious plan is to conceal the amount of taxation, and to make its payment appear in some measure voluntary. The tax being generally paid, in the first instance, by the producers, the purchasers confound it with the natural price of the commodity. No separate demand being made upon them for the tax, it escapes their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOLLECTION\">recollection</a>; and the article they have received seems a full equivalent for the sacrifice they have made in acquiring it.* Such taxes have also the advantage of being paid by degrees, in small portions, and at the time when the commodities are wanted for consumption, or when it is most convenient for the consumers to pay them.\n\nBesides their greater facility of imposition, indirect taxes have been frequently supposed to have the further and exclusive advantage of acting as a stimulus to industry. \"Dans la perception, directe,\" says the Marquis Garnier, \"l'imp\u00f4t se montre sans nul d\u00e9guisement; il vient sans \u00eatre attendu, \u00e0 cause de l'impr\u00e9voyance si ordinaire au commun des hommes, et il apporte toujours avec lui de la g\u00eane et du d\u00e9couragement. Mais l'imp\u00f4t indirect, en ajoutant successivement un surcroit de prix aux articles de consommation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et journali\u00e8re, au moment o\u00f9 tous les membres de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ont contract\u00e9 l'habitude des ses consommations, rend ses <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVERS\">divers</a> articles un peu plus co\u00fbteux \u00e0 acqu\u00e9rir, c'est-\u00e0-dire, qu'il donne lieu \u00e0 ce qu'il faille, pour se les procurer, un surcro\u00eet proportionn\u00e9 de travail et d'industrie. Or, si cet imp\u00f4t est mesur\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ne pas aller jusqu'\u00e0 d\u00e9courager la consommation, ne semble-t-il pas, dans ce cas, agir comme un stimulant universel sur la partie <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> et industrielle de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, qui l'excite \u00e0 un redoubllement d'efforts, pour n'\u00eatre pas oblig\u00e9 de renoncer \u00e0 des jouissances que l'habitude lui a rendues presque n\u00e9cessaires, et qui, en cons\u00e9quence, donne un plus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> d\u00e9veloppement aux facult\u00e9s productives du travail et aux ressources de l'industrie? Ne doit-il pas en r\u00e9sulter, qu'apr\u00e8s l'imp\u00f4t, il y a la m\u00eame <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOMME\">somme</a> de travail et d'industrie qu'appr\u00e9ciant pour fournir aux besoins et aux jouissances habituelles des hommes qui composent la classe laborieuse, plus la somme de travail et d'industrie qui a d\u00fb pourvoir au surcro\u00eet de prix destin\u00e9 \u00e0 l'imp\u00f4t? Or, cet imp\u00f4t, ou ce surcro\u00eet de produit que se paye, \u00e9tant d\u00e9pens\u00e9 par le gouvernement qui le recueille, sert \u00e0 alimenter une nouvelle classe des consommateurs, qui forment des demandes qui l'imp\u00f4t les met \u00e0 port\u00e9e de payer.\" (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-PREFACE\">Preface</a> \u00e0 la Traduction de la Richesse des Nations, Tome I. p. 66, ed. 2de.)\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of the greater part of this statement cannot be disputed. It is, however, essential to observe, that the whole effect ascribed by M. Garnier to indirect taxes, in stimulating industry, depends on the circumstance of their being so moderate as not to discourage consumption; or, which is really the same thing, that they are so moderate as to give the contributors the power of defraying them by increased exertion and economy. If this were not the case, they would have a precisely opposite effect, and instead of acting as a stimulus to production, they would certainly occasion its decline. But we can perceive no grounds for supposing that a moderate income-tax would have a different effect on industry from moderate taxes on expenditure. It would most undoubtedly serve as a spur to excite every one to make additional exertions, otherwise he would be unable to preserve his capital unimpaired, and to retain his former command over the necessaries and luxuries of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. Increase of exertion is not an exclusive consequence of indirect taxation; but it is an exclusive consequence of moderate taxation, whether it be direct or indirect. Just as a decay of industry, and a general impoverishment, is not the exclusive consequence of any particular species of taxation, but of all taxes whatever, when they are carried to an excessive height.\n\nWe doubt, therefore, whether the generality of taxes on expenditure possess any real advantage over taxes on income, except in the facility of imposition, while they certainly labour under many very considerable disadvantages. In the first place, taxes on commodities necessarily alter the natural distribution of Capital.\n\n* Nero was supposed to have abolished the duty of 4 per cent. on the slaves sold in Rome, when he really did no more than order it to be paid by the seller instead of the buyer. \"Remissum,\" says Tacitus, \"specie magis quam vi; quia cum venditor pendere jubetur, in partem pretii emptoribus accrescet.\" Annal. lib. 13, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>. 32.\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Indirect Taxes.\n\nThe advantages of indirect taxes are frequently incapable of violating those of natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, and who would have been in every respect excellent citizens, had not the laws of their country made that a crime which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> never meant to be so.\" (III. p. 378.) In consequence of this tendency, duties on commodities require the employment of a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of revenue officers; and as they expose the producers of the taxed articles to considerable inconvenience and hardship from domiciliary visits, they force them to indemnify themselves by making a corresponding addition to the price of their goods.\n\nBut the great objection to taxes on expenditure unequal consists in their inequality. We have already shown that such taxes cannot possibly be rendered equal and impartial in their operation; that they do not affect the different classes of society in proportion to their ability to bear them; and that, while they may be almost wholly evaded by rich misers, and those in unexpensive stations, they press with disproportionate severity on those who have large families and expensive stations to support. At the same time it should be remembered, that in taxation we have only a choice of difficulties. And notwithstanding it does not appear possible to free taxes on expenditure from these very weighty objections, the greater readiness with which they are paid, combined with the extreme difficulty of laying an income-tax equally on rent, profits, and professional wages, will always prevent their abolition. Neither, perhaps, would it be really desirable to take off those duties which affect only luxuries. But without entering on the discussion of this question, we are satisfied that if the difficulties, in the way of a fair income-tax, could be removed, it would be among the least objectionable of any; and if it were not exclusively adopted, it ought at all events to be made one of the principal sources of the public income. It is unnecessary, however, after what we have previously stated, to insist farther on this point; and we shall, therefore, proceed to inquire into the effects on their price, of taxes on commodities, and on whom they ultimately fall.\n\nSect. II.\u2014Inquiry into the Incidence and Effect of Indirect Taxes.\n\n1. Taxes on a particular Commodity.\u2014With regard to the effect of taxes on the price of commodities, it is clear that if a duty be laid on a particular commodity, and not on others, its price will sustain an equal rise; for, if it did not rise to this extent, the profits of the producers would be sunk below the common level, and their business would be abandoned. But it depends on the circumstance of the commodity being of the class denominated luxuries, whether a tax on it will fall wholly on the consumers. In so far as necessaries are consumed by landlords or capitalists, taxes on them are also defrayed by the consumers; but, in so far as they are required for the consumption of labourers, the effect of taxes on them is in no respect different from the effect of an equal amount of taxes laid directly on wages: And we have already shown that there are very few cases in which taxes affecting wages are really defrayed by the labourers; and that their common and ordinary effect is to cause an immediate...\nand equivalent rise in the rate of wages, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> fall of profits. It appears, therefore, that taxes on necessaries do not wholly fall on the consumers; but that they are partly defrayed by them, and partly also by the proprietors of stock, in consequence of their reducing the rate of profits. Such, however, is never the case with taxes on luxuries, or on commodities used only by the rich. A duty on velvets, on claret, and on coaches, for example, falls immediately on the consumers, and cannot be thrown on any one else. Such articles not being used by labourers, a duty on them can neither raise wages nor affect the rate of profit.\n\n2. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-AD\">Ad</a> valorem Taxes on all Commodities.\u2014It is not so easy to trace the effects, on their price, of an equal ad valorem duty on all commodities. Such a duty could not, it is obvious, at all affect their values relatively to each other; and supposing their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> and the quantity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> in the country to continue the same, it has been contended that it could occasion no rise of prices. But a very few words will be sufficient to show the fallacy of this statement. The Government must receive the tax either in money or in goods. Now suppose, for the sake of illustration, that the duty is ten per cent., and that it is paid in kind; in this case the supply of produce remaining in the market after the tax is paid being diminished one-tenth, the purchasers will only get <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a>-tenths of the commodities they previously got in return for the same quantity of money, or, in other words, prices will rise ten per cent. If the Government receives the tax in money, the result will be precisely similar. The purchasers will still have to reimburse the producers for the tax, or to pay them ten per cent. additional for their goods. For if this were not really the case\u2014if the purchasers who do not directly pay the tax to Government, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to get the same quantity of produce for the same sum of money, after its imposition as before, there would be no cause in operation to occasion the smallest diminution of individual consumption; and it is plainly impossible that the tax could, in such circumstances, give the Government the means of obtaining an increased share of the produce of the country, which is absurd. Not only, therefore, is it certain that a tax on a particular class of commodities will raise their price; but it is also certain that an equal ad valorem duty on all commodities will, without any increase of money, occasion an equal and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> rise of prices. The real effect of every such tax is to transfer a portion of the produce of the industry of the country into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of Government, and consequently to cause a less portion of that produce to come into the hands of every individual whose means of purchasing are not increased. Such a rise of prices is widely different from the rise which is occasioned by an increase in the quantity of money. When it is increased prices rise, because more money is given for the same quantity of goods; but when an ad valorem duty is levied, prices rise, because the same sum of money is given for a less quantity of goods, a portion of them having been transferred to Government.\n\n3. Taxes on Raw Produce.\u2014It has been very generally supposed that the taxes laid on the raw produce of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> have a different incidence from taxes laid on manufactured commodities; and that, instead of raising prices, and falling on the consumer, they have no influence on prices, and fall wholly on the landlord. We believe, however, that we shall be able to show that this opinion is entirely without foundation; and that the real effect of taxes on raw produce is to cause a proportional rise of prices, and to affect all classes equally in proportion to their respective consumption of the taxed articles.\n\nIf land yielded no surplus to its possessors above <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITHES\">Tithes</a>, the common and ordinary profit of the capital employed in its cultivation, it is plain that the imposition of a tax on its produce, a tithe, for example, would occasion an equivalent increase of its price. The level of profit may be temporarily, but it cannot be permanently, elevated or depressed in any particular branch of industry. And as there can be no reason why the agriculturists should content themselves with a reduced rate of profit, when all other employments are yielding a higher rate, as soon as tithes were imposed they would set about transferring a portion of their stock to some more lucrative business; and this transference would be continued until the diminution of supply had raised prices to their proper level, and restored the equilibrium of profit. In such a state of things, tithes would indisputably operate precisely as an equivalent addition to the price of raw produce. But after various qualities of soil have been brought under cultivation, and rents have, in consequence, been pretty generally introduced, it is not so easy to trace their ultimate incidence and effect. They then appear to occasion rather a diminution of the rent of the landlord than a rise of prices. Farms which are tithe-free always bring a proportionally higher rent than such as are subject to that charge; and it is naturally concluded, that, were tithes abolished, the depressed rents would be raised to the same level as the others. For this reason, in an advanced stage of society tithes have not been considered as increasing the price of raw produce to the consumers, but as falling on rent, and as diverting a portion of it into the pockets of its rightful owners, the clergymen and lay-impropriators. \"Taxes on the produce of land,\" says Dr Smith, \"are in reality taxes upon rent; and, though they may be originally advanced by the farmer, are finally paid by the landlord. When a certain portion of the produce is to be paid away for a tax, the farmer computes as well as he can what the value of this portion, one year with another, is likely to amount to, and makes a proportional abatement in the rent which he agrees to pay to the landlord. There is no farmer who does not compute, beforehand, what the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> tithe, which is a land-tax of this kind, is, one year with another, likely to amount to.\" (III. p. 274.)\n\nThat this is the general opinion on the subject cannot be doubted; but notwithstanding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> authority by which it is supported, it is most certainly without foundation. We have shown, in treating of taxes on rent, that in every country that portion of produce do not yield any rent but merely the common and average rate of profit to the landlord or the occupier. Now of Raw Produce.\nthis principle is decisive as to the effect of tithes and other taxes on raw produce. If tithes were only levied from the superior soils, they would not, after inferior soils had been cultivated, occasion any rise of price, but would fall entirely on the rent of the landlord. But this is not the case with tithes. They affect every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of land indiscriminately, and being exacted equally from the produce raised in the least favourable, as from that which is raised in the most favourable circumstances, occasion only an increase of prices.\n\nSuppose no tithes are levied, and that the wheat raised on the poorest lands, or with the capital last applied to the soil, and which determines the price of the whole crop, yields a sufficient profit to the cultivator, and no more, when it sells for 7s., a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>\u2014the price must rise to 7s. before the same profit can be obtained after tithes are imposed. In this case the tithe cannot possibly occasion any diminution of rent; for this produce pays no rent; so that if it were not compensated to the cultivators by an increase of prices, they would withdraw their capital from cultivation, and the necessary supplies would no longer be obtained.\n\nThis account of tithes is nowise inconsistent with the admitted fact, that farms which are free from this burden bring a proportionally higher rent. The expenses attending their cultivation are not increased by the levying a tithe from the produce of other farms; but, as there cannot be two prices, their occupiers obtain the same increased price for their produce which is necessary to indemnify the cultivators of the tithed lands. There must, however, be an equality of profits, as well as of prices; and hence, whatever advantage the occupier of a tithe-free <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARM\">farm</a> may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> by being relieved from a burden to which his neighbours are subjected, is compensated by a corresponding increase of rent.\n\nThus it appears, that, if tithes were abolished, the rent of such farms as pay tithe would not rise to a level with the rent of those which are tithe-free, but the rents of the latter would fall to the level of the former. As raw produce is uniformly sold at its necessary price, or the price necessary to afford the customary rate of profit to the cultivators of the worst land, it would fall the moment they had been relieved from this heavy charge. And the advantage previously enjoyed by the proprietors of tithe-free lands, and which was the only cause of their obtaining a higher rent, being done away, their rents would decline to the level of those around them.\n\nIf rents were uniformly paid in kind, the imposition of tithes would undoubtedly diminish the share of the produce paid to the landlord; but as its value would be increased in the precise proportion that its quantity had been diminished, this reduced share would continue to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a> for the same quantity of all other commodities. Thus, if lands of the qualities Nos. 1, 2, 3, &c. respectively produced, in return for the same expenditure, 100, 90, 80, &c. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>, the rent of No. 1 would be twenty quarters, of No. 2, ten, and so on. But they would no longer preserve that proportion after the imposition of tithes; for, supposing a tenth to be deducted from their gross produce, the remaining quantities would be 90, 81, 72, &c.; and, therefore, the corn rent of No. 1 would be reduced to 18, and of No. 2 to nine quarters. It is clear, however, that their money rents, or their rents estimated in any other commodity except corn, would not be at all affected. If corn sold at L. 4 before the imposition of the tithe, it would afterwards sell at L. 4, 8s. 10\u00bdd.; for, unless ninety quarters now brought as much as one hundred quarters previously brought, the cultivators of those soils, or the employers of those capitals which pay no rent, would not be able to realize the common and average rate of profit. Money rents would, therefore, continue unaltered; on the land No. 1, they would still be L. 80, and on No. 2, L. 40.\n\nIt appears, therefore, that in every state of society, whether rents are high or low, and whether they are paid in kind or in money, the charge of tithes is defrayed entirely by the consumers of raw produce. They do not consist of a portion of the rent of land belonging to the clergy, or the lay-impropriator; but they are a burden which falls equally on every individual in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>\u2014on the poorest beggar as well as the richest lord\u2014in proportion to their respective consumption of the articles from which a tithe is levied.\n\nBut, independently of these considerations, the fact that tithes and other taxes on raw produce do not frequently form a deduction from rent, but go to increase the price of produce, is obvious from the circumstance that the tithe of expensive crops, and which require a great expenditure in their cultivation, frequently amounts to four or five times the rent of the land. The Rev. Mr Howlett, by far the ablest advocate of tithes, and whose authority cannot, therefore, be questioned, informs us that the tithe of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACRE\">acre</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-HOPS\">hops</a>, raised on land worth 40s. or 50s. an acre, is, after deduction of drying and duty, generally worth from L. 3 to L. 4; and he farther <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, that he had known L. 7 or L. 8 paid for the tithe of an acre of carrot-seed where the land was not worth 20s.! In such cases, it is plainly as great an absurdity to affirm that tithes fall exclusively on the rent of the landlord, as it would be to affirm that a part is greater than a whole. Tithes cannot justly be objected to on the ground of their being a partial tax. It is a mistake to suppose that they are borne by any particular class. They are not a local but a general burden; and fall equally on the consumers of the tithed articles. Had the raiser of carrot-seed been relieved from the burden of tithes, he would have obtained precisely the same rate of profit by selling his produce for L. 7 or L. 8 less; nor, had such been the case, would it have been optional with him to have made this reduction; the competition of his neighbours would infallibly have forced him, whether he were so disposed or not, to make a corresponding diminution in his prices. (Influence on Tithes on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">Agriculture</a>, p. 4.)\n\nAn abolition of tithes is not, therefore, a measure of which landlords and farmers only are interested. It is obviously one of the greatest importance to the public in general. If 80s. be a remunerating price for wheat when tithes are levied, 72s. would be an equally high remunerating price were they remitted. When wheat sells at 80s., tithes, supposing them to be rigorously exacted, are really equivalent to a tax of 1s. a bushel, or 8s. a quarter. And as the average annual consumption of the different kinds of grain by each individual, when reduced to the standard of\nwheat, has been estimated, apparently on good grounds, at a quarter; it follows, that when the medium price of wheat is 80s., a tithe on corn is really the same thing as a capitation tax of 8s.; and consequently constitutes an item of 40s. in the expenditure of every family of five persons.\n\nBut tithes are objectionable on other grounds. They are not a permanent and fixed tax, but they increase according as the difficulty of raising raw produce increases; and are infinitely more burdensome and oppressive in a year of scarcity than in a year of plenty. If the price necessary to afford a sufficient supply of corn were 60s. a quarter, the tithe would be equal to a direct tax of 6s. a quarter; but if, in consequence of being forced to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a> to inferior lands, the increased difficulties of production had raised the price to 80s., the tithe would be 8s.; when prices rose to 100s., the tithe would be 10s., and so on. Nor is this all.\u2014The tithe is not only increased in value, but it is also increased in amount, according as cultivation is extended. When land of the first quality, and which we have supposed would yield 100 quarters, was cultivated, the tithe would be 10 quarters: But after land of the second quality, and which only yields 90 quarters, had been cultivated, the tithe would be levied on 190 quarters: When land of the third quality had been cultivated, it would be levied on $100 + 90 + 80$, or 270 quarters, and would go on progressively increasing, both in value and quantity, as fresh soils were brought under tillage.\n\n\"Not only,\" says Mr Ricardo, \"is the amount of the tax increased from 100,000 quarters to 200,000 quarters, when the produce is increased from one to two millions of quarters, but, owing to the increased labour necessary to produce the second million, the relative value of raw produce is so advanced, that the 200,000 may be, though only twice in quantity, yet in value three or four times that of the 100,000 quarters which were paid before.\n\n\"If an equal value were raised for the Church by any other means, increasing in the same manner as tithes increase, proportionally with the difficulty of cultivation, the effect would be the same. The Church would be constantly obtaining an increased portion of the net produce of the land and labour of the country. In an improving state of society, the net produce of the land is always diminishing in proportion to its gross produce; but it is from the net income of a country that all taxes are ultimately paid, either in a progressive or in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a> country. A tax increasing with the gross income, and falling on the net income, must necessarily be a very burdensome and a very intolerable tax. Tithes are a tenth of the gross, and not of the net produce of the land; and, therefore, as society improves in wealth, they must, though the same proportion of the gross produce, become a larger and larger portion of the net produce.\"\n\nTithe is certainly in one respect the same as rent; both the one and the other are portions of the produce of the soil converted into a revenue, for the support of those who bear no share of the trouble and expense of its cultivation. But in every other respect they are entirely dissimilar. Rent, when once fixed, must continue the same during the currency of the lease. Though an industrious and enterprising farmer should raise ten or twenty times the quantity of produce raised by a sluggard, his rent would not, therefore, be increased; and he would reap, as he ought, all the advantages of his greater industry and intelligence. Such, however, is not the case with tithes. To the sluggard they are invariable; to the industrious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> they become more and more oppressive, and increase with every fresh outlay of capital and labour. It is indisputable, therefore, that in their practical effect, tithes operate as a premium on idleness, and as a heavy and constantly increasing tax on industry! By preventing the cultivator from deriving the full and entire advantage of superior skill and increased exertion, they discourage his efforts, and powerfully contribute to render him indolent, careless, and indifferent. A farmer pays his rent willingly to the landlord; but, he considers the clergyman as an interloper, who, without having contributed in any way to raise the crop, claims a tenth part of its gross amount. The occupier of a farm, subject to this galling and vexatious charge, can never be brought to consider himself as realizing the same rate of profit from the capital he employs, as his neighbours in tithe-free farms; and so strong is this feeling, that we are told by Mr Stevenson, the well-informed author of the Agricultural Survey of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTY\">County</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SURREY\">Surrey</a>, that it is the common opinion that a farm tithe-free is better worth 20s. an acre, than a tithed farm equally favoured in soil and situation is worth 13s.! In this way, tithes contribute indirectly as well as directly to raise prices\u2014indirectly by generating an indisposition to apply fresh capital to the improvement of the soil, and directly, by the positive addition they make to the expense of cultivating bad land.\n\n\"Of all institutions,\" says Dr Paley, who cannot surely be reckoned unfriendly to the real interests of great discouragement both to the improvements of the landlord and to the cultivation of the farmer. The one cannot venture to make the most important, which are generally the most expensive, improvements; nor the other to rear the most valuable, which are\n\n* Principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">Political</a> Economy and Taxation, 1st edit. p. 228.\ngenerally, too, the most expensive crops, when the church, which lays out no part of the expense, is to share so largely in the profit. The cultivation of madder was for a long time confined by the tithe to the United Provinces, which, being Presbyterian countries, and, upon that account, exempted from this destructive tax, enjoyed a sort of monopoly of that useful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DYEING\">dyeing</a> drug against the rest of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. The late attempts to introduce the cultivation of this plant into England have been made only in consequence of the statute which enacted that \"5s. an acre should be received in lieu of all manner of tithe upon madder.\" (III. p. 275.) As a farther illustration of the principle here stated, we may mention, that the cultivation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAX\">flax</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEMP\">hemp</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a> never succeeded until a low modus had been fixed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a>; since then it has made a most rapid progress.\n\nThe effect of tithes and other taxes on the price of raw produce has been urged as a reason why an equal duty should be imposed on all such produce when imported from abroad. But all foreign corn imported must be paid either directly or indirectly by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPORTATION\">exportation</a> of some species of manufactured commodities; and it is, therefore, clear, that the home producers of corn can have no claim whatever to a protecting duty on the importation of foreign corn, unless the tithes, and other taxes falling on raw produce, exceed those which fall on manufactured goods. A tax which equally affects every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of products, leaves their relative values exactly where it found them. It does not render any particular class less able to withstand the unrestricted competition of foreigners than the others, and cannot, therefore, entitle them to a protecting duty. But if higher duties be laid on a particular class of commodities, the case is different. If, for example, while the duty on commodities in general is only 10 per cent., a duty of 20 per cent. were laid on a particular class, their price must rise 10 per cent. higher than the price of the rest, in order to maintain their producers in the same relative situation as before. It is plain, however, that in the event of the ports being opened to the importation of every description of foreign goods free of duty, the producers of the heavily-taxed commodities will be deprived of the means of limiting their supply, and consequently of raising their price, so as to indemnify them for the excess of the tax. The 10 per cent. excess of duty would then really operate as a bounty on the importation of the class of commodities on which it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a>; and if it were not defeated by a protecting duty of 10 per cent., the home producers of that class would be placed in a relatively disadvantageous situation, and would abandon their business.\n\nBut this principle only holds in the case of duties affecting manufactured products. If a direct tax of 10 per cent. were laid exclusively on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-HATS\">hats</a> produced in England, and on no other commodity, the hatters would most likely be ruined were foreigners permitted to import hats duty free. Manufactured goods are produced under the same, or, at all events, under very similar circumstances; so much so, that foreign competition must either be injurious to all the manufacturers of a particular description of goods, or to none. But in agriculture the case is otherwise. Corn is produced under very different circumstances, or from soils of very different degrees of fertility; and though the cultivators of the worst lands in tillage at any particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> might be injuriously affected by the unrestricted admission of foreign corn, the other cultivators, instead of being injured, would be really benefited by the rise of profit which must always follow every permanent reduction in the price of raw produce. Thus, suppose no duties are imposed on manufactured commodities, and that the ports are thrown open to the importation of foreign corn, without any protecting duty to balance the tithe\u2014the whole effect of such a measure would be to cause such a small additional quantity of bad land to be thrown out of tillage as would enable the cultivators to obtain eleven quarters for the same outlay that had previously been required to produce ten quarters. As soon as this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a> of tillage had been effected, the farmers would have nothing to fear from foreign competition. They would still obtain the same rate of profit that was obtained by the undertakers of other businesses; and the consumers would be able to purchase their corn for ten per cent. less than if a protecting duty had been imposed.\n\nBut notwithstanding it is thus most certainly true, that the cultivators are always in a condition to receive themselves of such taxes as affect them to a greater extent than they affect the other classes of society; yet, as they can only do this by contracting where Tithes and withdrawing capital from the cultivation and other inferior soils, the effect of admitting foreign corn without a protecting duty equivalent to the excess of taxation affecting the home-growers, would be to cause a diminution of rent. We have already shown that rent consists of the difference between the produce obtained from the best and worst lands under cultivation; and if, by admitting foreign corn duty free, bad land should be thrown out of cultivation, the rent of the landlords would be reduced, and their relative situation lowered. Although, therefore, it is not necessary for the protection of the cultivators that any countervailing duty should be laid on raw produce imported from abroad; still, if it be really true that higher duties are laid on the raw produce raised at home than on manufactured goods, justice to the landlords requires that a duty should be laid on all foreign raw produce equivalent to the excess of duty affecting home produce. Such a duty, by fitting all classes equally to withstand foreign competition, will preserve them in the same relative situation after the opening of the ports as previously; and will treat all parties, as they ever ought to be treated, with the same equal and impartial justice.\n\nTo whatever extent a countervailing duty might be laid on a foreign commodity, it would be proper to give the home producers of the same commodity an equal, or nearly equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWBACK\">drawback</a>. If the home producers were refused such a drawback, they might say, \"Before your duty, and before the price of our produce was raised in consequence of it, we could compete with the foreign grower in foreign <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARKETS\">markets</a>; by making the remunerating price of our corn higher, you have deprived us of that advantage, therefore give us a drawback equal to the duty, and you, in every respect, restore us to the position, both as it regards our own countrymen, as producers of other\ncommodities less heavily taxed, and foreign growers of raw produce, in which we were before placed.\"\n\nOn every principle of justice, says Mr Ricardo, and consistently with the best interests of the country, this demand should be acceded to. (On Protection to Agriculture, p. 16.)\n\nMr Ricardo thinks that the tithes and other taxes exclusively affecting raw produce, over those affecting manufactured goods, may be taken at about 10s. a quarter; and he therefore proposes that foreign corn should be freely admitted on paying this duty, and that a drawback of 7s. should be allowed on exportation. \"The duty of 10s. a quarter is, I am sure, rather too high as a countervailing duty for the peculiar taxes which are imposed on the corn-grower, over and above those which are imposed on the other classes of producers in the country; but I would rather err on the side of a liberal allowance than of a scanty one; and it is for this reason that I do not propose to allow a drawback quite equal to the duty.\" (Ibid. p. 80.)\n\nThe necessity of imposing this countervailing duty, originating, as it almost entirely does, in the imposition of tithes, affords another and a very powerful argument in favour of their abolition or commutation. Were tithes abolished, the protecting duty proposed by Mr Ricardo might be reduced to 8s. or 4s. a quarter, and the drawback to 2s. or 2s. 6d.\n\nTaxes on raw produce, by raising the price of the articles required for the food of the labourer, necessarily raise wages and lower profits. Such taxes, therefore, fall with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> on the capitalists; affecting them both as employers of labour, and as consumers. Indeed, the principal disadvantage of taxes on raw produce consists in their tendency to lower profits. \"With a permanently high price of corn,\" says Mr Ricardo, \"proportional wages would be high; and, as commodities would not rise on account of the rise of wages, profits would necessarily fall. If goods, worth L1000, require, at one time, labour which cost L800, and, at another time, the price of the same quantity of labour is raised to L900, profits will fall from L200 to L100. They will fall not in one trade only, but in all. High wages equally affect the profits of the farmer, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANUFACTURER\">manufacturer</a>, and the merchant; nor is there any other way of keeping profits up than by keeping wages down. In this view of the law of profits, it is at once seen how important it is that so essential a necessary as corn, which so powerfully affects wages, should be sold at a low price; and how injurious it must be to the community generally, that, by prohibitions against importation, we should be driven to the cultivation of our poorer lands to feed our increasing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a>.\"\n\n4. Custom Duties, or Duties on the Importation and Exportation of Commodities.\u2014These, like all other duties, are paid by the consumers of the commodities on which they are laid. When a government lays a duty on the foreign commodities which enter its ports, the duty falls entirely on its own subjects who purchase such commodities; for the foreigners would cease supplying their markets with them, if they did not get the full price of the commodities exclusive of the tax; and, for the same reason, when a government lays a duty on the commodities which its subjects are about to export, the duty does not fall on them, but on the foreigners by whom they are bought.\n\nIf, therefore, it were possible for a country to raise a sufficient revenue by laying duties on exported commodities, such revenue would be wholly derived from others, and it would itself be entirely relieved from the burden of taxation; except in so far as duties might have been imposed by foreigners on the commodities it imports from them! Care, however, must be taken in imposing duties on exportation, not to lay them on such commodities as can be produced at nearly the same cost by foreigners, for the effect of the duty would then be to put an entire stop to their exportation, by causing the market to be supplied by others. But when a country possesses any exclusive, natural, or acquired advantage, in the production of commodities, a duty on their exportation is really the most unexceptionable of all taxes. Such a duty would not fall upon itself, but upon its foreign customers; and if it were not carried so high as to balance the superior facilities of production, it would have only a very slight tendency to diminish the demand for the taxed articles. If the Chinese chose to act on this principle, they might derive a very considerable revenue from a duty on exported tens, which would have to be entirely paid by the English and other foreigners who buy them. And there is perhaps no country which does not possess some commodity demanded by foreigners that might not be advantageously charged with a moderate duty on exportation. The coal and tin, and probably also some species of the manufactured goods of Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, seem to be in this predicament.\n\nIt was the great object of the professors of the mercantile system of political economy to facilitate the exportation of commodities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> growth, and to fetter and restrict the importation of those produced abroad; and it is to the prevalence of this system in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> Europe, and its influence on financial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEGISLATION\">legislation</a>, that we are to ascribe the almost total exemption of exported commodities from duties, and the ruinous extent to which they have been heaped on those that are imported.\n\nDuties on imports and exports have been levied in almost every country which had any foreign <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>. The Athenians laid a tax of a fifth on the corn and other merchandise imported from foreign countries, and also on several of the commodities exported from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTICA\">Attica</a>.* The portoria,+ or customs payable on the commodities imported into, and exported\n\n---\n\n* Anacharsis's Travels, IV. p. 375, Eng.

See Clarke On the Connection between the Roman and English Coins, p. 58.\n\n+ Huic vero proprie vectigalis denominatio convenit quippe pro vehendis mercibus (unde vectigal), solum. Burman, De Vectigalibus Pop. Rom. cap. 5.\nfrom the different ports in the Roman empire, formed a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> and important part of the public revenue. They were imposed, as Tacitus has observed, when the spirit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> ran highest among the people.\n\n*A consulibus et tribunis plebis institutae, acri etiam populi Romani tum libertate.* (Annal. lib. 13, cap. 50.)\n\nThe rates at which they were charged were fluctuating and various, and little is now known respecting them. Cicero informs us (Cic. in II. Ver. cap. 75), that the duties on corn exported from the ports of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SICILY\">Sicily</a> were, in his time, 5 per cent. Under the Imperial Government the amount of the portoria depended as much on the caprice of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">Prince</a> as on the real exigencies of the state. Though sometimes diminished, they were never entirely remitted, and were much more frequently enlarged. Under the Byzantine Emperors they were as high as 12\u00bd per cent. (Burman, De Vectigalibus Pop. Rom. cap. 5, passim.)\n\nCustoms seem to have existed in England before the Conquest. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">King</a>'s first claim to them was established by statute of the 3d Edward I. The inconveniences arising from the multiplicity of the various separate acts relative to the customs, caused Mr Pitt to introduce a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BILL\">bill</a>, in 1787, for their consolidation. This bill was passed into a law, and several similar consolidations have since been effected. The last was by a statute passed in 1819. To this statute are subjoined tables, containing lists, ranged in alphabetical order, of the various articles of import and export, with the duties payable on each, and the drawbacks and bounties allowed on the exportation of particular sorts of British goods.\n\n5. Duties on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COINAGE\">Coinage</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">Gold</a> and Silver.\u2014For an account of the incidence and effect of these duties, the reader is referred to the article Money in this Supplement, cap. Seigniorage.\n\n6. Stamp and Legacy Duties.\u2014Stamp duties are duties laid on the paper or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARCHMENT\">parchment</a>, on which certain deeds, contracts, legal proceedings, receipts, acquittances, &c. are written. They are called stamp duties, from the paper being impressed with a public stamp, stating the amount of the duty. The ultimate incidence of these duties varies according to the nature of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEED\">deed</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>, for which it is necessary to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> stamped paper. The duties payable on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a> of land, or on the paper used in its conveyance from one party to another, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> fall on the seller. This arises, as Dr Smith has observed, from the circumstance of \"the seller being almost always under the necessity of selling, which forces him to take such a price as he can get. The buyer is scarce ever under the necessity of buying; he will, therefore, only give such a price as he likes. He considers what the land will cost him in tax and price together. The more he is obliged to pay in the way of tax, the less he will be disposed to give in the way of price. Such taxes, therefore, fall almost always upon a necessitous person, and must, therefore, be frequently very cruel and oppressive.\" (III. p. 318.) It is obvious that the same reasoning must hold in the case of the duties chargeable on the granting of mortgages; and that they will commonly fall on the borrower or poorer party.\n\nThis, however, is not the only objection to the imposition of duties on the transference of property. Both Mr Say and Mr Ricardo have observed, that the tendency of such duties is to prevent property from coming into the hands of those who would use it most advantageously; and consequently to prevent the national capital from being distributed in the best way for the community. For the general prosperity, there cannot be too much facility given to the conveyance and exchange of all kinds of property, as it is by such means that capital of every species is likely to find its way into the hands of those who will best employ it in increasing the productions of the country. \"Why,\" asks M. Say, \"does an individual wish to sell his land? it is because he has another employment in view in which his funds will be more productive. Why does another wish to purchase this same land? it is to employ a capital which brings him too little, which was unemployed, or the use of which he thinks susceptible of improvement. This exchange will increase the general income, since it increases the income of these parties. But if the charges are so exorbitant as to prevent the exchange, they are an obstacle to this increase of the general income.\"\n\nTaxes on law proceedings fall upon the suitors; and consequently operate as a check to prevent an injured party from seeking redress in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of justice. The impolicy, hardship, and injustice of such taxes, have been admirably exposed by Mr Bentham, in his Protest against Law Taxes.\n\nStamp duties, on the voluntary sale of all those articles which are the produce of human industry, fall, like all other taxes on such articles, wholly on the consumer; for, unless such were the case, the articles would not be offered for sale, subsequently to the imposition of the duties. Thus, the duties on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CARDS\">cards</a> and dice, on advertisements, newspapers, &c. are all paid by those who use them. Such, too, is the case with the stamp duties, payable on licences to retail any species of goods, or to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> any profession. The taxed party invariably adds as much to the price of the articles in which he deals, or of the services which he performs, as is sufficient to indemnify him for the tax.\n\nStamp duties were first levied in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>. Most of the accustomed methods of taxation having been resorted to, the Republic, in order to provide additional funds for carrying on her contest with the Spanish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONARCHY\">monarchy</a>, offered a considerable reward to any one who should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEVISE\">devise</a> the best new tax! Among many other taxes, that of the vectigal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CHARTA\">charta</a>, or stamp duty, was suggested; and having been approved of, it was introduced by an Ordinance issued in 1624, setting forth its necessity, and the benefits which it was supposed would result from its imposition.

Trans.\nbecome almost universal, and now form a very prominent branch of the revenue of almost every country; affording a striking example of the justice of Dr Smith's remark, that \"There is no art which one government sooner learns of another, than that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-DRAINING\">draining</a> money from the pockets of the people.\"\n\nStamp duties were introduced into England in 1671, by a statute entitled, \"An act for laying impositions on proceedings at law.\" The duties were at first granted for only nine years, and were afterwards continued for three years more, when they were allowed to expire. They were again revived in 1693, and have since been gradually and greatly increased.\n\nLegacy Duties, or duties on the transference of property from the dead to the living, are now a very common species of tax. The vicissima hereditatum, or the twentieth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PENNY\">penny</a> of inheritances, imposed by Augustus on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, is the earliest example of a tax on successions. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DION\">Dion</a> Cassius (lib. 55) informs us, that this duty was laid on all successions, legacies, and donations in case of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, except upon those to the nearest relations and to the poor. Pliny has given some of the reasons for this exception; in speaking of the Vicissima, he calls it tributum tolerabile et facile heredibus duntaxat extraneis, domestici <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a>. And a little after he adds, Itaque illis (that is strangers) irrogatum, his (that is near relations) remissum, idelictet, quod manifestum erat, quanto cum dolore laturi, sem potius non laturi homines essent, distingi aliquod et abradi bonis, que sanguine, gentilitate, sucrorum denique societate meruisset, quaeque nuncquam ut aliena et speranda, sed ut sua semperque possessia, ac deinceps proximo cuoque transmittenda, cepissent. (Panegyricus, cap. 37.) In addition to these very cogent reasons for exempting the successions of near relations from the vicissima, it may be observed, that the death of a father is seldom attended with any increase, and frequently with a considerable diminution, of revenue to such of his children as live in the same house with him; and when this is the case, the burdening of his inheritance with a tax must plainly be a very galling and cruel aggravation of their loss. But, if taxes on successions are always paid with very great reluctance by the children and immediate relations of the deceased, it is quite otherwise when they fall to distant relations or strangers. Those on whom an unexpected or remote inheritance devolves, are glad to accept it on any condition; and uniformly pay such moderate duties as may be laid on it with greater good will than any other impost whatever!\n\nIn Great Britain, a duty of one per cent. is laid on all successions devolving either to the children, or to any lineal descendant of the children of the deceased, or to his father or mother, or to any of his lineal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>; a duty of three per cent. is charged on successions devolving to brothers and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SISTERS\">sisters</a>; of four per cent. on those devolving to cousins; and of ten per cent. on those devolving to strangers. Exclusive of this, a farther duty, varying according to the amount of the property left by the deceased, is also charged on the probates of all wills, without regard to the propinquity of the successors. This duty amounts, at present, to L11 on a property worth from L450 to L600; to L22 on a property worth from L800 to L1000; and to L180 on a property worth from L8000 to L10,000, increasing according to the farther increase of the property. This tax presses more severely on lineal successors, and is more objected to by them than the legacy duty.\n\nThe great objection to taxes on successions, or objection on transference of property from the dead to the living, consists in the circumstance of their falling wholly on capital, without occasioning any effort to replace it, either by increased exertion or economy. If a legacy of L1000 be subject to a tax of L100, the legatee considers his legacy as only L900, and feels no particular inclination to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> the L100 from his expenditure; whereas, had he received the whole L1000, and been required to pay L100 in taxes on income or commodities, the desire to preserve his capital unimpaired would have prompted him to endeavour to defray the tax by increased industry and economy. The real advantage of the legacy duties consists in the facility with which they are collected; for by tending directly and necessarily to diminish capital, they are, in most other respects, extremely injurious.\n\nPostage of Letters.\u2014The conveyance of letters by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POST\">post</a> has, in almost all countries, been conducted by the agents of government; and it is one of the few industrious undertakings which appear to be better managed by them, than they could be by private individuals. This species of conveyance was originally established, and kept up by the Roman Emperors, for the safe, regular, and speedy transmission of the public dispatches to the most remote parts of their dominions; and such was also the purpose for which posts were first established in modern Europe, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> XI. Subsequently, however, private individuals were allowed to avail themselves of this institution, for the conveyance of their letters; and governments, by imposing higher duties, or rates of postage, on the letters and packages sent through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POST_OFFICE\">post-office</a> than are sufficient to defray the expense of the establishment, have rendered it productive of a considerable revenue.* Nor, while the rates of postage are confined within reasonable limits, is there perhaps a more eligible species of tax. The English post-office was placed on nearly its present footing in 1649, by the exertions of Mr Edmund Prideaux, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTORNEY_GENERAL\">Attorney-General</a> to the Commonwealth.\u2014(See Blackstone's Commentaries, I. p. 321.)\n\nThe limits within which this article must be confined will not allow us to enter at greater length into the inquiry concerning the incidence of taxes on commodities. We shall, therefore, proceed briefly to investigate their capacity to produce a revenue.\n\n* Bergier, Histoire des Grands Chemins de l'Empire Romain, I. p. 199.\nSect. III.\u2014Circumstances which determine the extent to which Taxes ought to be laid on Commodities\u2014Causes of Smuggling\u2014Means by which it may be prevented.\n\nWith regard to the capacity of a tax on a commodity to raise a revenue, it depends, first, on the nature and extent of the demand for the commodity; and, second, on the means of preventing its being smuggled. Every tax, by raising the price of the commodity on which it is laid, has a tendency to bring it within the command of a smaller number of purchasers, and to lessen its consumption. An individual who might be able and disposed to pay 1s. a bottle of duty on wine, might neither have the means nor the inclination to pay 2s. or 3s.; and instead of being augmented, the revenue might be diminished by such an increase of duty. And hence, whenever the duties on commodities are raised beyond a certain limit\u2014a limit, however, which it is impossible to define, and which must necessarily vary according to the nature of the commodity on which the duties are laid, and the varying tastes and circumstances of society\u2014their effect is to depress consumption to such an extent, as to render them less productive than if they had been lower.\n\nVariations in the amount of the duties affecting commodities have exactly the same effect on their price, and consequently on their consumption, as corresponding variations in the cost of their production. But it is clear that any reduction in the price of commodities, whose natural cost is very considerable, and which can, therefore, be used only by the rich, could not have so powerful an effect, in increasing consumption, as would follow the same proportional reduction in the price of easily produced commodities in general demand. A reduction of 50 per cent. from the price of coaches would not add greatly to the demand for them; for, notwithstanding this reduction, they would still be luxuries, for which none but the rich could afford to pay; whereas, a reduction of 50 per cent. from the price of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHISKY\">whisky</a>, gin, beer, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEA\">tea</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>, or any article in general request, would extend the demand for it in a much greater ratio. The reason is plain:\u2014The poorer classes form by far the most numerous portion of society; and as such commodities are even now partially used by them, a fall of 50 per cent. in their price would bring them fully within their command, and would thereby add prodigiously to their consumption. The truth of this observation may be strikingly exemplified by a reference to the case of cotton goods. At the Accession of his late Majesty, in 1760, the price of cottons, owing to the difficulty of producing them, was extremely high; and the value of the manufactured cottons annually brought to market did not exceed L.209,000. But thanks to the genius and inventions of Hargreaves, Watt, Arkwright, Crompton, and others, the price of cottons has been so far sunk, as to bring them within reach of the poorest individual; and yet, such has been the vast increase of demand, that, notwithstanding this reduction of price, the value of the cottons annually manufactured in Great Britain, and either disposed of at home, or sent abroad, mounts, according to the very lowest estimate, to the amazing sum of forty millions! It is obvious, however, that if cottons had been loaded with high duties; and if the same reduction in them, which has been brought about by the improvement in machinery, had been brought about by a reduction of the duties affecting them, precisely the same effects would have followed. The demand would have equally increased; and the greater consumption of the low taxed articles would have rendered the reduced duties more productive than the higher. Similar effects have uniformly followed from similar causes: low duties on commodities in general demand being invariably found to be more productive than when they are carried to a greater height\u2014and more productive than high duties on commodities used only by the rich.\n\nBesides diminishing the revenue by diminishing consumption, oppressively high duties tend to diminish it by encouraging and promoting the ruinously destructive trade of smuggling. The risk of being detected in the smuggling of commodities, under any system of fiscal regulations, may always be valued at a certain average rate; and whenever the duties exceed this rate, smuggling will be immediately practised. Now, there are plainly but two ways of checking this nefarious practice\u2014either the temptation to smuggle must be diminished by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOWERING\">lowering</a> the duties, or the difficulties in the way of smuggling must be increased. The first is obviously the most natural and efficient method of effecting the object in view; but the second has been most generally resorted to. In the great majority of cases, governments have attempted to put down smuggling, without reducing the duties, by establishing a more vigilant system of collection, and by increasing the number and severity of the penalties affecting the smuggler. As might have been expected, these attempts have, in the great majority of cases, proved signally unsuccessful. And it has been, almost invariably, found that no vigilance on the part of the revenue officers, and no severity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>, can prevent the smuggling of those commodities which are loaded with oppressive duties. The smuggler is generally a popular character; and though we have no desire to become the apologists of those who endeavour to defraud the revenue, and to injure the fair trader, it is idle to expect that the bulk of society will ever be brought to consider that those who furnish them with cheap tea, gin, whisky, brandy, &c. are guilty of any very heinous offence.\n\n\"To pretend,\" says Dr Smith, \"to have any scruple about buying smuggled goods, though a manifest encouragement to the violation of the revenue laws, and to the perjury which almost always attends it, would, in most countries, be regarded as one of those pedantic pieces of hypocrisy, which, instead of gaining <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> with any body, seems only to expose the person who affects to practise them, to the suspicion of being a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KNAVE\">knave</a> than most of his neighbours. By this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a> of the public, the smuggler is often encouraged to continue a trade, which he is thus taught to consider as in some measure innocent; and when the severity of the revenue laws is ready...\"\nto fall upon him, he is frequently disposed to defend with violence what he has been accustomed to regard as his just property; and from being at first, perhaps, rather imprudent than criminal, he at last too often becomes one of the hardest and most determined violators of the laws of society.\" \u2014 (III. p. 378. See also Montesquieu, *Esprit des Lois*, liv. 13, cap. 8.)\n\nTo create, by means of high duties, an overwhelming temptation to indulge in crime, and then to punish men for indulging in it, is a proceeding completely subversive of every principle of justice. It revolts the natural feelings of the people, and teaches them to feel an interest in the worst <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a>\u2014for such smugglers generally are\u2014to espouse their cause, and to avenge their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-WRONGS\">wrongs</a>. A punishment which is not proportioned to the offence, and which does not carry the sanction of opinion along with it, can never be productive of any good effect. The true way to put down smuggling is to render it unprofitable\u2014to diminish the temptation to engage in it; and this is to be done, not by surrounding the coasts with cordons of troops, by the multiplication of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OATHS\">oaths</a> and penalties, and making the country the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEATRE\">theatre</a> of ferocious and bloody contests in the field, and of perjury and chicanery in the courts of law, but simply and exclusively by reducing the duties on the smuggled commodities. It is in this, and in this only, that we must seek for an effectual check to smuggling. Whenever the profits of the fair trader become nearly equal to those of the smuggler, the latter is forced to abandon his hazardous profession. But so long as oppressively high duties are kept up, or, which is really the same thing, so long as a high bounty is held out to encourage the adventurous, the needy, and the profligate, to enter on this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAREER\">career</a>, we may be assured, that an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXCISE\">excise</a> officers, backed by the utmost severity of the revenue laws, will be insufficient to hinder them. The truth is, that the too great severity of these laws prevents their execution. \"It stimulates the trader to corrupt the officer to conceal a fraud; and it influences the officer to overlook what he would otherwise discover.\"\n\n(<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAMILTON\">Hamilton</a> *On the Principles of Taxation*, p. 244.)\n\nHeavy duties on any description of commodities will occasion smuggling; but, it is chiefly caused by their being laid on commodities in general demand, whose natural or necessary price is not very considerable. It is commonly said, when a proposal is made for laying a heavy duty on a low priced article, that its lowness of price fits it to bear such a duty, and that, notwithstanding its imposition, it may still be brought to market at a sufficiently moderate rate. But the encouragement to smuggling depends more on the proportion which the duty bears to the price of the commodity, than on the circumstance of the duty being absolutely high or low. To illustrate this principle, let us suppose, that a taxed commodity, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOAP\">soap</a>, costs, exclusive of duty, 10d. a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a>. If a duty of 1d. per lib. were laid on it, the inducement to smuggle would be equal to 10 per cent. of the value of the article, and if the duty were 2d. the inducement would be 20 per cent., and so on. Now, let us suppose, that the cost of producing the soap, or its natural price, falls to 5d.: a duty of 1d. per lib. would then make an inducement to smuggle of 20 per cent. of its value, and a duty of 2d. would make an inducement of no less than 40 per cent.! And hence, it is obvious, that, in order to prevent smuggling, a system should be adopted, precisely the reverse of that which is generally followed in the imposition of taxes. Instead of making duties to vary inversely as the price of commodities, or of raising them when the natural prices of the taxed articles fall, and reducing them when they rise, they ought to be made to vary directly as these prices\u2014to rise when they rise, and to fall when they fall.\n\nDisproportionally heavy taxes are the great cause of smuggling; and they have the farther and most injurious effect of preventing its being corrected by its natural and proper punishment, the confiscation of the commodities. Recourse is, in consequence, had to extraordinary pains and penalties, and all proportion of punishment being done away, \"men who,\" as Montesquieu observes, \"can hardly be considered as culpable, must be punished as atrocious criminals.\"\n\n(*Esprit des Lois*, liv. 13, cap. 8.)\n\nCertain commodities, from their greater bulk, from their susceptibility of being impressed with a permanent stamp, or from any other cause, are less liable to be smuggled than others, and may, therefore, be loaded with comparatively higher duties. But as a general rule, it cannot be doubted, that, in order to prevent fraud, the duties should always be proportioned to the cost of the articles on which they are laid.\n\n**Sect. IV.\u2014Comparative Productiveness of High and Low Taxes.**\n\nThe arguments adduced in the foregoing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> are sufficient to establish the superior productiveness of moderate taxes. But the subject deserves to be treated at greater length: and as the history of taxation, both in this and other countries, furnishes numerous direct, conclusive, and well established proofs of the same principle, we shall take this opportunity to bring a few of them under the notice of our readers. We shall class them under two different heads: the first, consisting of instances where-in a reduction of duty has been followed by an increase of revenue; and the second, of instances where-in an increase of duties has been followed by a diminution of revenue.\n\n1. The effects produced by the reduction of the tea duties, in 1745 and 1784, are among the most striking examples of the superior productiveness of low duties on articles in general demand. Previously to 1745, the excise duty of 4s. a pound on tea yielded, at an average, about L150,000 a year; which, had there been no smuggling or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADULTERATION\">adulteration</a>, would have shown that the consumption was equal to about 750,000 lbs. But it was well known that smuggling was then carried to a very great height, and that the real consumption of tea was much greater than the apparent consumption. To put a stop to this clandestine importation, a bill was introduced into Parliament in 1745, in pursuance of the recommendation of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMITTEE\">Committee</a> of the House of Commons, and passed into a law, by which the excise duty of 4s. was reduced to 1s., and 25 per cent. ad valorem. This measure was signal success.\nComparative In 1746, the year immediately subsequent to the reduction, the sales of tea for home consumption amounted to above two millions of pounds weight, and the revenue was increased to L. 243,309! But to set the effects of this wise and salutary measure in a still clearer point of view, we shall subjoin an account of the net produce of the tea duties from 1743 to 1748, both inclusive.\n\nIn 1743 it amounted to L. 151,959\n1744 \u2014 \u2014 147,065\n1745 \u2014 \u2014 145,630\n1746 (Duties reduced) 243,309\n1747 \u2014 \u2014 257,937\n1748 \u2014 \u2014 303,545.*\n\nBut notwithstanding this unanswerable demonstration of the superior productiveness of low duties, they were again increased in 1748; and fluctuated, between that epoch and 1784, from 64 to 119 per cent. ad valorem. The effects which followed this inordinate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of the duties are equally instructive with those which followed their reduction. The revenue was not increased in any thing like a corresponding proportion; and as the use of tea had become general, smuggling was carried to an infinitely greater extent than at any former period. In the nine years preceding 1780, above 118 millions of pounds weight of tea were exported from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHINA\">China</a> to Europe, in ships belonging to the Continent, and about 50 millions of pounds in ships belonging to England. But from the best information attainable, it appears that the real consumption was almost exactly the reverse of the quantities imported; and that, while the consumption of the British dominions amounted to above 13 millions of pounds, the consumption of the Continent did not exceed 5\u00bd millions! If this statement be nearly correct, it follows that an annual supply of about eight millions of pounds must have been clandestinely imported into this country, in defiance of the utmost vigilance on the part of the revenue officers. But this was not the worst effect of the high duties; for many of the retail merchants, who purchased tea at the East <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">Company</a>'s sales, being in a great measure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> out of the market, were, in order to put themselves in a condition to stand the competition of the smugglers, tempted to adulterate their teas, by mixing them with sloe and ash leaves.\u2020\n\nAt length, in 1784, ministers, after having in vain tried every other resource for the suppression of smuggling, resolved to follow the precedent of 1745, and reduced the duty on tea from 119 to 12\u00bd per cent. This measure was as successful as the former. Smuggling and the practice of adulteration were immediately put an end to. The following official statement shows, that the quantity of tea sold by the East India Company was about tripled in the course of the two years immediately following the reduction!\n\nIn 1781, the quantity of tea sold at the East India Company's sales amounted to 5,023,419 lbs.\n\n| Year | Quantity |\n|------|----------|\n| 1782 | 6,283,664 |\n| 1783 | 5,857,883 |\n| 1784 | (Duties reduced) 10,148,257 |\n| 1785 | 16,307,433 |\n| 1786 | 15,093,952 |\n| 1787 | 16,692,426 \u2021 |\n\nWhile the quantity of tea sold at the Company's sales was thus rapidly augmenting in consequence of the reduction of the duty, the quantity of tea imported into the Continent from China, which had, in the year 1784, amounted to 19,027,800 lbs., declined with still greater rapidity, and, in 1791, was reduced to only 2,291,500 lbs.! \u00a7\n\nThe duties on tea, on an average of the five or six years preceding 1784, produced about L. 700,000 a year. And, at the same time that Parliament reduced them to 12\u00bd per cent., they laid an additional duty on windows, estimated to produce L. 600,000, as a commutation tax, to compensate the deficiency which it was supposed would take place to that extent in the revenue formerly derived from tea. But instead of the duties falling off in the proportion of 119 to 12\u00bd, or from L. 700,000 to L. 73,000, owing to the increased consumption, they only fell off in the proportion of about two to one, or from L. 700,000 to L. 340,000! The commutation act has been always regarded, and with justice, as one of the most successful financial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> adopted in the course of Mr Pitt's administration. The plan was generally understood, at the time, to have been suggested by Mr Richardson, Accountant-General of the East India Company. But the popularity of the measure was so great as to induce several other individuals to claim this honour, and even to occasion some hot disputes on the subject in the House of Commons. In point of fact, however, the merit of having first suggested the plan did not really belong either to Mr Richardson, or to any of those who then claimed it; and such of our readers as will take the trouble to look into a pamphlet of Sir Matthew Decker's (Serious Considerations on the Present High Duties), published in 1743, will find that the measure adopted in 1784 had been strenuously recommended forty years before.\n\nBut the principle of the commutation act, and the striking advantage that had resulted from the reduction of the duty, were soon lost sight of. In 1795, the duty was increased to 25 per cent.; and after successive augmentations in 1797, 1798, 1800, and 1803, it was raised, in 1806, to 96 per cent. ad valorem, at which it continued till 1819, when it was raised to 100 per cent. Now, although it cannot be disputed that the duty on tea yields, at present, a vastly greater revenue than was derived from it in 1795, there are the strongest possible reasons for believing that the revenue would have been considerably greater,\n\n* Hamilton's Principles of Taxation, Appendix, No. 19; and Postlethwaite's History of the Revenue, p. 293.\n\u2020 Macpherson's Commerce with India, p. 208. Milburn's Oriental Commerce, Vol. II. p. 540.\n\u2021 Macpherson's Commerce with India, p. 416. \u00a7 Ibid. p. 210.\nComparative had the duty not been carried so high. The quantity of tea sold by the East India Company in 1795 and 1796 amounted to very nearly 20 millions of pounds a year, and in 1799, to very nearly 25 millions of pounds (24,853,508). Since then, there has been no increase. For, according to the account given in the Lords' Report on the East India Trade (p. 334), the average quantity of tea sold at the Company's sales in 1818, 1819, and 1820, is rather under 25 millions of pounds a year. But the population of Great Britain, which is ascertained by the late census to amount to 14,379,000, amounted to only 10,817,000 in 1800; and had there been no diminution of the individual consumption of the Company's tea in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> between these enumerations, their sales ought plainly to have been increased in the proportion of 10,817 to 14,379, or from 25 to 33 millions of pounds. Nor is this all. The sales made by the East India Company supply the markets of Ireland as well as Britain; and, if we take into account the extraordinary increase of population in that part of the empire, the diminution of consumption will appear still more striking. But, notwithstanding the Company's sales have thus continued stationary since 1795, it is, we believe, pretty generally admitted, that the individual consumption of tea, or rather of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> sold under its name, has not been considerably diminished in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>, while it has increased greatly in the country since that epoch. It is plain, however, that this increased supply can have been obtained only by clandestine importation, or adulteration; and, as there was no opportunity of smuggling during the latter part of the war, and as the powerful force that has been employed in the preventive service since the return of peace, must have rendered it extremely difficult to import any considerable quantity of foreign tea, we should be disposed to conclude, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VACUUM\">vacuum</a>, caused by the high duties, has been chiefly supplied by adulteration,\u2014and such, we find, is really the case. There is, indeed, every reason to think that the practice of adulterating by the intermixture of ash and sloe leaves, and by drying tea that has been already infused, and mixing it with fresh tea, is carried to a greater extent at this moment than in 1784. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of this, we may mention, that, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, in 1818, upwards of twenty grocers were convicted of having spurious tea in their possession. And it is worthy of remark, that in the case of the King v. Owen, the counsel for the defendant declared, that the practice was so general, that his client was not aware of the existence of any law by which it was forbidden! Since then, several additional convictions have taken place; but it is not in the nature of things that the evil can be materially diminished by such means. If we are really desirous of putting a stop to the practice of adulteration, we must follow Mr Pitt's example, and take 50 or 60 per cent. from the present duties. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> of the effects of the reductions in 1745 and 1784, enable us confidently to predict, that such a reduction would not be followed by any corresponding diminution of revenue; while, besides putting an instant stop to smuggling and adulteration, it would be a considerable boon to the lower classes, to whom tea is now become an article of prime necessity, and would powerfully contribute to extend our commerce with China.\n\nWe have been thus particular in noticing the variations in the tea duties, because the Company's sales afford the means of ascertaining the precise effect of their increase and diminution on consumption. The results are both curious and instructive; and would of themselves be sufficient to establish the truth of Dr Swift's observation, that, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARITHMETIC\">arithmetic</a> of the Customs, two and two do not always make four, but sometimes only one!\n\nThe narrow and contracted policy on which most ministers have generally acted, puts it out of our power to refer to many such conclusive instances as the reduction of the tea duties in 1745 and 1784, to prove the superior productiveness of diminished taxation; there are, however, one or two others which deserve to be pointed out. In 1742, the high prohibitory duties upon spirituous liquors, and upon licences for retailing the same, were abolished, and such moderate duties imposed, to commence after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">Lady</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">Day</a> 1743, as were expected to increase the revenue by increasing the legal consumption of spirits. This measure was vehemently opposed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">Bishops</a>; but their opposition was ineffectual; and the increase of the duties, and diminution of smuggling which followed, proved that the measure was alike advantageous to the revenue and to the morals of the people. (History of our Debts and Taxes, Part IV. p. 110.) In 1787, Mr Pitt reduced the duty on wine and spirits 50 per cent., and the revenue was, notwithstanding, considerably augmented. Perhaps, however, the progress of the duties on coffee illustrates this principle in a still more striking manner. In 1805, they were raised a third, and that year their produce fell off an eighth instead of increasing a third; in 1806, they had increased only a sixteenth, so that the consumption had diminished above a fourth. But it was at length found that the tax had been overdone, and it was lowered from 2s. to 7d. the cwt. Mark the immediate effects of this step. The average annual produce of the high duty for the three years, previous to 1808, when it was lowered, was L166,000; and the average annual produce of the reduced duty for the next three years was L195,000\u2014a proof that the consumption had been increased in a quadruple proportion.*\n\nThe history of other countries abounds with equally conclusive examples of the superior productiveness of moderate duties. In 1775, M. Turgot deducted a half from the customs and other duties chargeable on the fish sold in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> market; but, notwithstanding this reduction, the amount of the duties collected was not diminished. The demand for fish must, therefore, have been doubled, in con-\n\n---\n\n* Mr Brougham's Speech on the State of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">Nation</a> in 1817, p. 57.\nComparative sequence of the inhabitants being enabled to supply themselves, at a comparatively cheap rate, with a nutritious and agreeable food.\n\nIn 1813, all sugar imported into the French empire paid a duty of one franc sixty cent. The quantity imported that year amounted to about fourteen millions of pounds, which, as imported in France, and the countries then incorporated with her, contained about forty-two millions of inhabitants, gives the third part of a pound weight to each. In 1814, this exorbitant duty was reduced to about a fifth part, or to thirty cent. the pound; and though the population of France had now been reduced from forty-two to about twenty-eight millions, the average annual importations of 1814 and 1815 amounted to forty-four millions of pounds, being upwards of a pound and a half to each individual; or about five times as much as the consumption had amounted to under the high duty. In consequence of this increase of consumption, the low duty yielded very near as large a revenue as the high duties; and, since 1815, both consumption and revenue have continued to increase. (Richesse des Nations, par Garnier, V. p. 364, 2de Ed.)\n\nUstariz gives a variety of instructive details respecting the disastrous effects which the levying of certain taxes have had on the industry of the Spaniards, and of the advantage which has resulted from the repeal and modification of others. We shall give a single example. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VALENCIA\">Valencia</a>, he tells us, though very barren of grain and flocks, and not equal in extent to two-thirds of Arragon, paid a much larger revenue to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURY\">Treasury</a>. He says, that this was owing to the comparatively flourishing state of commerce and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a> in Valencia; and he then adds\u2014\"This increase and improvement in manufactures and commerce is ascribed to the equitable and kind treatment the weavers receive in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a>, and to his Majesty's goodness in reducing the excessive taxes which were charged upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> meat and other provisions; and his taking off wholly that which was laid on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a> in ancient times; as also, the imposts known by the name of ancient duties and generalities. These duties were partly replaced by others, but in such a manner that they were rendered much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a>, the people in general eased, and the royal revenue improved.\"\n\n2. But the superior productiveness of low duties on articles in general request may be equally shown from the consequences of the attempts to increase them beyond their proper limits. The history of the sugar duties is, in this respect, extremely important. In the three years from 1803 to 1806, the former duties were increased about 50 per cent. Now, the average produce of the old duties, for the three years before that rise, was L. 2,778,000. The produce of 1804, after they had been raised 20 per cent., was not L. 3,333,000, as it ought to have been, had the consumption remained the same, but only L. 2,537,000, comparative being L. 241,000 less than the produce of the low duties; and the average produce of 1806 and 1807, after the whole 50 per cent. was added, was only L. 3,183,000, instead of L. 4,167,000; which it should have been had there been no falling off since 1804. Thus, both consumption and revenue declined, in consequence of the increase of duty in 1804; and the consumption has declined, in consequence of the succeeding augmentations, while the revenue has gained very little.\u2020 The duties on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a>, after being stationary for nearly a century, were doubled in 1813. In 1812, the low duties produced L. 694,000; but, instead of being doubled, or of producing L. 788,000, when the tax was doubled, the annual revenue has scarcely ever since exceeded half a million, and has frequently fallen short of that sum.\n\nThe duties on foreign wines have been tripled since Increase of 1792. The last increase took place in 1815, when L. 30 per ton was added to the former duty on French, and L. 20 to that on Portuguese wine. Now, observe what has been the effect of this increase of duty. In the Second Report of the Lords' Committee on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">Silk</a> and Wine Trade (ordered by the House of Commons to be printed, 28th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 1821), a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of accounts are given, showing the quantity of wine imported into Great Britain, and re-exported, for a considerable number of years past, and the amount of the duties. From these accounts, we have drawn up the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">Table</a> of the number of tons of wine imported into Britain from 1809 to 1820, both inclusive; the number of tons re-exported during the same period; and the quantity remaining for home consumption.\n\n| Year | Tons Imported | Do.

Trans.\n\u2021 Mr Brougham's Speech on the State of the Nation in 1817, p. 54.\n\u00a7 The Records for the year 1813 were destroyed by fire.\nThus, it appears, that the increase of the duties on wine in 1815 has occasioned a diminution in the consumption of 7462 tons a year, or of one-fourth part of the total quantity annually consumed, on an average of the five years preceding the increase. Let us next see whether any augmentation of revenue has taken place to balance this diminution of the comforts of the people, and the loss of the market for the products which were previously exchanged for the wine.\n\nFrom a Table in the same Report (p. 78), it appears that the produce of the duties of excise on the wines consumed in England from 1810 to 1820, both inclusive, has been as follows:\n\n| Year | Duty |\n|------|------|\n| 1810 | L. 1,406,417 |\n| 1811 | L. 1,215,507 |\n| 1812 | L. 1,065,159 |\n| 1813 | L. 1,061,604 |\n| 1814 | L. 1,065,223 |\n| 1815 | L. 1,277,481 |\n| 1816 | L. 943,987 |\n| 1817 | L. 928,473 |\n| 1818 | L. 1,195,427 |\n| 1819 | L. 1,085,500 |\n| 1820 | L. 949,328 |\n\nThe average drawback, as given in the same Table, for the five years previous to 1815, is L. 63,674; and for the five years subsequent to 1815, L. 48,676; and, deducting these sums from the above, we have L. 1,098,708 for the amount of the average annual excise duty on wine for the five years preceding 1815; and L. 971,867 for the average annual amount of that duty for the five years after it had been increased about 20 per cent.; showing that the revenue, instead of being augmented, has sustained a diminution of L. 126,841 a year by this increase of duty.\n\nThe effect of the increase on the Custom duty has been equally striking. The accounts laid before Parliament do not go farther back than 1814; but in that year the low Custom duties amounted to L. 1,061,416. In 1816, the high duties only amounted to L. 780,238; and except in 1818, when they amounted to L. 1,056,894, they have never since reached one million.\n\nIt is unnecessary to make any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMENTARY\">commentary</a> on this decisive statement. The facts we have brought forward prove, beyond all question, that the revenue, the comforts of the people, and the commerce of the country, have all been diminished by this inordinate extension of the duties; and entitle us to conclude, that they would be all increased by their diminution.\n\nThere are, perhaps, no better objects of taxation than spirituous and fermented liquors, and none in which the injurious effects of over taxation are more striking and obvious. They are essentially luxuries; and while moderate duties on them are, in consequence of their being very generally used, exceedingly productive, the increase of price which they occasion has a tendency to limit their consumption by the poor, to whom, when taken in excess, they are extremely pernicious. Few governments, however, have been satisfied with the imposition of moderate duties on spirits; but, partly with the view of increasing the revenue, and partly with the view of placing them beyond the reach of the lower classes, they have almost invariably loaded them with such oppressively high duties as have entirely defeated both objects. The imposition of such duties does not take away the appetite for spirits; and as no vigilance of the officers, or severity of the laws, have been sufficient to secure a monopoly of the market to the legal distillers, the real effect of the high duties has been to throw the supply of a large portion of the demand into the hands of the illicit distiller, and to superadd the crimes and vices of the smuggler to those of the drunkard.\n\nNowhere, perhaps, have these injurious consequences of the excessive increase of spirit duties been more distinctly manifested than in Ireland. In proof of this, we may mention, on the authority of the official statements in the Fifth Report* of the Commissioners of Inquiry into the State of Irish Revenue (p. 19), that in 1811, when the duty on spirits was 2s. 6d. per gallon, duty was paid in Ireland on 6,500,961 gallons; while in 1822, when the duty was 5s. 6d., only 2,950,647 gallons were brought to the charge. The commissioners estimate the annual consumption of spirits in Ireland at about ten millions of gallons; and as scarcely three millions pay duty, it follows that upwards of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> millions are illegally supplied; and \"taking one million of gallons as the quantity fraudulently furnished for consumption by the licensed distillers, the produce of the unlicensed stills may be estimated at six millions of gallons!\" (p. 8.)\n\nIt is material, too, to observe, that this extraordinary increase of smuggling took place in defiance of the utmost efforts of the revenue officers, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-POLICE\">police</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a>, to prevent it. The only result of these efforts being the exasperation of the populace, and the committal of atrocities, both by them, and those employed in the collection of the revenue, that are hardly to be matched in the annals of civil warfare. \"In Ireland,\" say the Commissioners, \"it will appear, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> annexed to this Report, that parts of the country have been absolutely disorganized, and placed in opposition not only to the civil authority, but to the military force of the Government. The profits to be obtained from the evasion of the law have been such as to encourage numerous individuals to persevere in these desperate pursuits, notwithstanding the risk of property and life with which they have been attended.\" (p. 1.)\u2020\n\n* Printed, by order of the House of Commons, 30th May 1823.\n\u2020 The revenue and morals of no country, perhaps, have suffered so much from the injudicious extent to which taxes have been laid on commodities in general request as Ireland. This, however, is a subject on which our limits will not permit us to enter more at large; but our readers will find most of the necessary information in an article on High and Low Taxes in No. LXXII. of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> Review.\nThe too great height to which the duties were carried, and the injudicious mode in which they were charged and collected, produced similar effects in Scotland. The system of illicit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTILLATION\">distillation</a> made great progress of late years, and had the most injurious influence on the morals and industry of the people in the mountainous districts, where it was principally carried on.\n\nSuch having been the effects of their excessive increase, we have great satisfaction in stating, that the duties on both Scotch and Irish spirits have been reduced during the last session of Parliament (sess. 1822\u201423), from 5s. 6d. per gallon to 2s. 9d. Leave has also been given to use stills of a much smaller size,\u2014a regulation which will have the effect of enabling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINOR\">minor</a> capitalists to engage in the business of distillation, and which, by increasing competition, will tend both to improve the quality and to reduce the cost of the spirits. The country is indebted for this change of system to the recommendations in the excellent Reports of the Commissioners on Irish Revenue. It will certainly go far to suppress smuggling; and there is every reason to expect that the greatly increased consumption of legally distilled spirits, which the reduction of the duties will occasion, will make it have the same beneficial effects on the revenue as the reduction of duties in 1743 and 1787.\n\nIn England, the duty on spirits is as high as 10s. 6d. a gallon; and the trade in spirits between it and the other divisions of the empire is prohibited. This system is liable to many objections; but owing to the decided preference given by the lower classes in England to malt liquors over spirits, it has not given so great a stimulus to smuggling and illicit distillation as might have been expected.\n\nThe revenue collected within the United Kingdom on spirits distilled from grain, and the number of gallons on which it was paid in the year 1822, were respectively as follows:\n\n|                | Revenue     | Gallons    |\n|----------------|-------------|------------|\n| England        | \u00a32,749,372  | L.5,222,094|\n| Scotland       | 687,467     | 2,499,880  |\n| Ireland        | 811,428     | 2,950,647  |\n| **Totals**     | **\u00a33,248,267** | **L.10,672,621** |\n\nIn France, previously to the Revolution, the average annual consumption of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>, in the provinces subjected to the *grande gabelle*, or high duty on salt, was estimated by M. Necker, who had the best means of coming to a correct conclusion, at 9\u00bd lib. to each individual; and at 18 libs. in the *pays redim\u00e9es*, or provinces that had purchased an exemption from the greater part of this hateful tax. (*Administration des Finances*, Tom. II. p. 12.) It is evident, from this well authenticated statement, that a very great reduction might have been made from the duty paid on the salt consumed in the heavily taxed provinces, without occasioning any diminution of revenue; while, besides directly increasing the comforts of the people, it would have relieved Government from the necessity of surrounding particular provinces with cordons of troops, and would have put an instant stop to that smuggling of salt, which occasioned the sending of between 3000 and 4000 persons every year either to prison or to the gallies.

V.\u2014Method of Comparing the Amount of Taxation in Different Countries\u2014Circumstances which Depress the Rate of Profit\u2014Its Fall in this Country rather a Consequence of the Corn Laws and of Tithes, than of Taxation.**\n\nIt has been usual to endeavour to ascertain the amount of relative weight of the public burdens of different countries by comparing them with their population. But this is obviously a most false and erroneous criterion. In proof of this, we may observe, that, if the amount of population in a country were a true test of its capacity to bear taxes, it would follow that Ireland, which has a population of seven millions, could afford to pay three times the amount of the taxes paid by Scotland, which has only a population of two millions. So far, however, from this being the case, the actual revenue of Scotland is very little less than that of Ireland; and yet there is no reason whatever to think that the pressure of taxation is felt more severely here than amongst our neighbours.\n\nThe amount of the capital belonging to different countries has been suggested as a test by which to ascertain the relative weight of their burdens. But this would also <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> to the most erroneous results; for, it is plain that a small capital in a country where profits are high may be more productive than a large one in a country where profits are low. The market rate of interest, which is always proportional to the customary rate of profit, is at this moment only about 4 or 5 per cent. in England, while it is not less than 8 or 10 per cent. in the United States. One million of capital laid out in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a> must, therefore, be about as productive, that is, it must yield about as large an annual income as two millions laid out in this country. And, hence it is obvious, that, if taxation, as compared with the amount of capital, were the same in both countries, it would, as compared with the profits on revenue derived from that capital, be about twice as heavy in England as in America.\n\nIt is not, therefore, by the amount either of the population or the capital of a country, that its capacity to bear taxes is to be determined. Taxes, as we have already shown, really consist of a portion of the incomes of individuals transferred from the public to the State; and hence, to determine whether they are relatively higher or lower in one country than in another, it is necessary to ascertain the respective incomes of the States to be compared together, the number of their inhabitants, and the amount of their Bur-\n\n*Report on Distilleries*, p. 1.\nburdens. Supposing, for example, that the income of Great Britain, which has fourteen millions of inhabitants, is three hundred millions of pounds <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">Sterling</a>, which is believed to be very near its actual amount, and that its taxes, including poor rates, tithes, and public burdens of every description, amount to seventy millions, this sum deducted from the former would leave two hundred and thirty millions, which would give a free income of L. 16, 9s. a-year to every individual in the empire: Suppose, now, that the income of France is four hundred and fifty millions, and that the aggregate amount of her taxes, and public burdens of every description, is fifty millions, the four hundred millions of remainder, when divided among a population of thirty millions, would only leave a free income of L. 13, 6s. to each.\n\nThere is good reason to think, that these estimates are not very wide of the mark: we do not, however, give them as being correct, for in such matters it is impossible to attain to any thing like accuracy; but as illustrations of the method to be followed in comparing the burdens laid on different countries; and as showing that, in proportion to her means of paying, a country with a small population, and a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> amount of taxes, may be really less heavily taxed than a country with a much larger population, and a smaller absolute amount of taxes.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPRESSION\">depression</a> in the rate of profit\u2014a depression which can only proceed either from heavy taxes on the necessaries of life, or from the effects of monopoly enhancing their price, or both\u2014is by far the most unfavourable symptom in the economical situation of this country. The common and ordinary rate of profit is the sum which usually remains to those capitalists who employ their stock in productive businesses, after all their outlays, including a premium for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSURANCE\">insurance</a> of the capital itself, are compensated. It is by its amount, therefore, that the productive powers of industry are to be estimated. Wherever the rate of profit is relatively high, as in the United States, there is a proportional power of accumulation; and, provided the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> of property be well secured, the capital, and, of course, also the population of the country, increase with comparative rapidity: But in countries such as Holland, where the rate of profit is relatively low, there is but little power of accumulation; and not only is their progress in wealth and population proportionally slow, but there is, besides, a very powerful motive to transmit capital to those countries where it is more productive. It is plainly, therefore, of the utmost consequence that the rate of profit, in every country, should be maintained at as high a level as possible. This, however, can only be effected by allowing the labourer to purchase his food in the cheapest market, and by exempting, as far as it can possibly be done, the necessaries of life from taxation: For we have shown, * that profits always vary inversely as wages\u2014that they fall when wages rise, and rise when wages fall. Now, as the labourer must always have wherewithal to subsist and continue his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>, it is plainly impossible to go on constantly adding to the price of the articles necessary for his subsistence, either by forcing him to purchase in dearer markets, or by loading them with taxes, without, at the same time, raising his wages and depressing profits. It is undoubtedly very difficult to say how much of the decline of the rate of profit in this country is to be ascribed to the effect of taxes laid on the necessaries of life, and how much to the corn-laws and other restrictive regulations. But that these laws must have a powerful influence in this respect is abundantly clear; for, in ordinary years, their effect is to maintain the price of corn in this country at nearly double its elevation in any other country! Tithes also contribute to raise the price of corn; and as corn, though not the sole, is the main regulator of wages, we are inclined to think that it is to the combined operation of the corn-laws and tithes that the decline in the rate of profit in this country is chiefly to be ascribed.\n\nThe taxes on tea, sugar, soap, candles, and beer, are those which, with the exception of tithes, fall heaviest on necessaries, and consequently exercise the greatest influence on profits. We think we are entitled to conclude, from the preceding investigations, that a very considerable reduction might be made in the amount of the duties affecting them, without occasioning any decrease, and even with a positive increase, of revenue. At all events, it is clear that the public interests imperiously require that every practical effort should be made to lighten the pressure on the national resources, and to check the efflux of capital to other countries, by adding to the productive powers of industry, or, in other words, by increasing the rate of profit. And this will be most effectually done by making every possible deduction from the taxes affecting necessaries, and by ceasing to bolster up and protect any single species of industry at the expense of the rest.\n\nTables illustrative of the progress of the public revenue of Great Britain have been given in Postlethwaite's and Sir John Sinclair's Histories of the Revenue, Chalmers's Comparative Estimate, Dr Colquhoun's Treatise on the Wealth and Resources of the British Empire, and a variety of other publications.

href=\"vol20.html#article-TELEGRAPH\">TELEGRAPH</a>\n\nTelegraph, so named from two Greek words, \u1fe5\u03ac\u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd, end or distance, and \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd, to write, is a machine so constructed as to enable two persons to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONVERSE\">converse</a> with each other at a distance, either by sentences, words, or letters, according to a convention previously agreed upon by the parties. Such a mode of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> beyond the reach of hearing is not, however, confined to any particular machine; the fingers of the human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> are quite sufficient, as every young boarding-school lady knows, for the purpose; and, when so applied, may be called a Telegraph. Thus also, the signal flags used on board ships to communicate with each other, by making them represent letters or numbers, or both, constitute a Telegraph; as may also the sending up of sky-rockets, blue-lights, the suspension of lanterns, the making of fires on beacons, high hills, &c., be considered as Telegraphic communications.\n\nIn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of the French, however, we have almost indiscriminately adopted the use of the word Semaphore for the Telegraph, which is perhaps of more extensive application, being derived from \u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03af\u03b1, a sign, and \u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd, to bear; and may, consequently, be applied universally to whatever means may be used to communicate intelligence by signs or signals. Thus the firing of guns a certain number of times, at certain intervals,\u2014the notes of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRUMPET\">trumpet</a>, bugle, French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORN\">horn</a>, or other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a>,\u2014the strokes on a drum,\u2014may be used to convey information to a limited extent. The troops and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINES\">marines</a> which landed on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of America in the last war, when scouring the woods in detached parties, were regulated by the notes of the bugle, which were so clearly understood, that no false movements were ever made. The immense number of barges and boats which crowded the Imperial Canal of China are directed in their movements, both by night and day, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> of the gong. The Indians of America convey intelligence from hill to hill, by throwing out their arms with or without staves in them; by spreading their cloaks, holding up skins, &c.; and even the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> Hottentots, called Bosjesmans, the lowest probably in the scale of human beings, communicate with each other by arranging fires on the sides of the hills in certain positions.\n\nIt is rather surprising that an art so simple as that of conveying ideas by means of signals, so well understood in remote antiquity, and practised even by savages, should have made such little progress in its improvement, that it may be said to have remained in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> rude state nearly down to our own times, when it has almost at once been brought to that state of perfection, of which it appears to be capable.\n\nOne of the arguments usually adopted to prove that the art of conveying intelligence by signals was known in the very early ages of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>, is deduced from the opening of the Agamemnon of Aeschylus, where the man on the watch-tower, at the top of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a>, announces the fire-signals having communicated the fall of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TROY\">Troy</a>, long before any of the Greeks had returned from the siege; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLYTEMNESTRA\">Clytemnestra</a> afterwards relates the stations; but this event of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> of Troy, supposed thus to have been known in Greece soon after it happened, proves nothing more than that the use of signals was known to the poet who wrote eight or nine hundred years after the event. Mention, however, is made by Jeremiah (Ch. vi. v. 1), who was at least 200 years before...\nTelegraph. \u00c6schylus, of \"setting up a sign of fire in Beth-haccerem;\" and such signals are often alluded to by the prophets, as notices of the approach of an enemy.\n\nThe earliest decisive proof of telegraphic communications, except those by fires (\u03bd\u03b5\u03c6\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9), being in use among the Greeks, is found in the methods described by Polybius. (See Ency. Brit. under word Telegraph.) The Romans had their vexillarii, and used flags and other contrivances for regulating the movements of their armies; and they had hollow tubes constructed in the walls of their cities, by which they could communicate with the several ports or works by sound, as is done in our times in some manufactories by means of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PIPES\">pipes</a> or trumpets. Wherever the Romans pitched their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAMP\">camp</a>, an elevated spot was selected for the signal station, to convey intelligence to the foraging parties or detachments, but it is nowhere stated to what extent this was carried. Vegetius alludes to something like a beam in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, on the same principle perhaps as our Semaphore.\n\nIn modern times, Kircher, who had more learning and less sense than any man of his day, and who has written on almost every subject, gives an idea of telegraphic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a>; and so does the ingenious Marquis of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORCESTER\">Worcester</a>, in his Century of Inventions; but so vague as to convey no notion of the means he was to employ, except the use of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>; for the \"discourse\" to be held, is stated to be \"as far as eye can discover <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>.\" He also throws out a hint for a night telegraph, by which the same may be done, \"though as dark as pitch is black.\" But almost every modern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> is supposed to exist in the mysterious \"scantlings\" of the Marquis of Worcester.\n\nThe first telegraph on record in modern times, applicable to universal purposes, is that of Dr Hooke, described in the Philosophical Transactions of the year 1684. He minutely details the mode in which the stations should be selected, their height and intermediate ground, so that the refraction of the air may not disturb the clear appearance of the object; the telescopes to be used; the characters to represent the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-ALPHABET\">alphabet</a>, which, he says, may be varied ten thousand ways, and \"none but the two extreme correspondents shall be able to discover the information conveyed:\" and so convinced is he of the practical efficiency of his telegraph, as to leave no doubt on his mind, \"that the same character may be seen at Paris within a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> after it hath been exposed in London.\" His method consisted in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> in succession as many different shaped figures or signs, at least, as the alphabet consists of letters. If used in the daytime, they might be squares, circles, triangles, &c., made of deals; if at night, torches or other lights disposed in a certain order. These characters or signs were to be brought forth from behind a screen on rods, as they might be wanted, and exposed to view. The accompanying <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, where A is the screen, and one of the signs exhibited, will convey an idea of Dr Hooke's telegraph.\n\nMonsieur Amantons, of the Royal Academy of Paris, made an experiment to convey intelligence, which was highly approved of by the other members, and several persons of distinction belonging to the Court. By the description given of the machine, it seems to have differed very little from that of Hooke already published in the Philosophical Transactions; the signals being either large letters of the alphabet, or figures of various shapes to represent them; the latter being the more valuable, as, by a change of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KEY\">key</a>, the nature of the communication might be kept a secret from those actually employed in making the signals.\n\nIt has been supposed that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTRICITY\">electricity</a> might be the means of conveying intelligence, by passing given numbers of sparks through an insulated wire in given spaces of time. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> of the name of Ronalds has written a small treatise on the subject; and several persons on the Continent and in England have made experiments on Galvanic or Voltaic telegraphs, by passing the stream at the two extremities or stations through phials of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>; but there is reason to think that, ingenious as the experiments are, they are not likely ever to become practically useful.\n\nNecessity is said to be the mother of invention; she is also frequently the foster-mother, who calls forth into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, and displays the utility of inventions abandoned by their natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a>. Both Hooke's invention and Amantons' modification were published all over Europe, the former as early as 1684; yet they were not practically applied to any useful purpose till the year 1794, when Citizen Barrere, in a report made to the Convention, ascribed the invention then in use to Citizen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CHAPPE\">Chappe</a>.\n\nChappe's telegraph consists of a beam of wood, moveable on a pivot at the summit of an upright post; at each of the extremities of this beam is a moveable arm, as in the figure. The different positions in which both the beam and its two arms may be placed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> of 45\u00b0 give to this telegraph considerable powers; but it is a too complicated machine not to be liable to many mistakes, unless worked by long experienced operators.\n\nIn the year 1784, Mr Lovell Edgeworth produced his plan of a numerical telegraph, claiming, at the same time, the merit of having invented a mode of distant communication as far back as 1767, by employing a common windmill, and arranging the various positions of its arms and sails so as to represent a certain number of signals arranged in numerical order.\n\nMr Edgeworth's telegraph consisted of four wedges or cones, moveable on four upright posts, as under, which, by their different positions, might be used either numerically or alphabetically.\n\nIn the year 1795, when the advantages had been made evident which the French derived from M. Chappe's telegraph, the inventive faculties of our countrymen were called into action. Among other proposals, the Rev. J. Gamble produced two plans of a telegraph; the one consisting of five boards, one above the other, which, by opening and shutting singly, or according to all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a> of which they were capable, gave\nAmong other projects about this time was that of dividing a large circle into twenty-four parts, to represent the letters of the alphabet, round which a moveable radius was to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRAVERSE\">traverse</a>; then, by placing corresponding divisions, by means of wires, before the object-glass of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TELESCOPE\">telescope</a>, the coincidence of the two radii would mark out the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> meant to be designated. Of this kind, a plan by Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GARNET\">Garnet</a> approached nearest to efficiency; but, at best, could only be applied to very short distances.\n\nIn the same year (1795), Lord George Murray presented his plan of a six-shutter telegraph to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMIRALTY\">Admiralty</a>, which was the one adopted and made use of during the whole war, and until the year 1816, when it was changed for a simplified Semaphore, which will be noticed hereafter. The annexed figure represents that of Lord George Murray.\n\nOn the same principle as the radiated telegraph of Mr Gamble, but differently arranged, the French, on the commencement of the second war in 1803, erected signal-posts along the coast, to which they gave the name of Semaphores, being two or three beams of wood on the same post, but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> on different pivots.\n\nIn 1807, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> (now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLONEL\">Colonel</a>) Pasley published his Polygrammatic Telegraph, which differed only from the French Semaphore in having two beams turning on one pivot on the same post, and multiplying the number of posts; which he afterwards (in 1810) changed so far as to place three sets of beams or arms, two in each set, on one post, and thus approaching still nearer to the French Semaphore.\n\nThe last, but by far the most persevering and voluminous writer on telegraphs, is Lieut.-Colonel Macdonald, who, in 1808, published what he deems improvements in the system of telegraphic communications, both as they regard the machine itself, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DICTIONARY\">dictionary</a> to be used with it. He not only gives the preference, but is so much attached, to the shutter machine, that he is quite indignant at its being supplanted by the Semaphore; and so far from being satisfied with the powers of which a six-shutter telegraph is capable, he has extended his to no less than thir-\nAs the use of telegraphs is chiefly confined to public purposes, and more especially to convey speedy information respecting naval and military armaments and operations, the machine to be adopted, and the system of working it, ought to possess\u2014power\u2014certainty\u2014simplicity\u2014celerity\u2014and secrecy. The power of the machine, or the number of distinct combinations of its moveable parts, should be equal to the conveyance of every possible order or information, either by numbers, representing the letters of the alphabet, or words, or sentences. To ensure certainty, the moveable parts or signs should be so well and clearly defined, so wholly within the field of the telescope, and so completely removed from all ambiguity, as not to be liable to the mistaking of one signal for another; hence, the advantage of the simplicity of the machine. And as one of the main uses of the telegraph is to convey instructions or intelligence in a speedier way than the intermediate distance can be travelled over, it is evident, that celerity is an important quality of telegraphic communication. It is equally obvious that, if such instructions or intelligence could not be conveyed in secrecy from him who sent it, to him who was to receive it, such a system would be highly defective and objectionable.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEARING\">Bearing</a> these observations in mind, we shall not have much difficulty in determining on the merits of the several telegraphic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACHINES\">machines</a> above mentioned. The choice, indeed, appears to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> between the six-shutter telegraph, so long used at the Admiralty, to communicate with the several ports,\u2014the Semaphore of Sir Home Popham, which superseded it, and is now in use,\u2014and the Universal Telegraph of Colonel Pasley. Colonel Macdonald, who conceives the shutter telegraph as the perfection of the art, boldly asserts, that \"the Semaphore arm of proper dimensions is not to be seen in clear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> so well as the common sized boards, and in cloudy weather by no means so well;\" and consequently that, \"for this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, the boarded telegraph is, in all respects, more advantageous.\" This would be important if correct; but it is evident, that the Colonel is not aware of the discussion which took place on this very important part of the subject, on the first adoption of the boarded telegraph; had he read the clear and decisive observations of Mr Gamble, he would scarcely have ventured upon such an assertion.\n\n\"It is a theorem in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPTICS\">optics</a>,\" says Mr Gamble, \"that the apparent magnitude of an object varies nearly in the inverse ratio of its distance. Hence, it follows, that the larger its dimensions, to the greater distance will it be visible. But the nature of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>, even in its most transparent state, is such as to render any calculation, grounded on this principle, extremely erroneous; and in general its density so obstructs, and its refracting powers cause such confusion in, the rays issuing from those surfaces which are not placed sufficiently distant to be distinct, that their image falling upon the retina is frequently so ill defined, as to render it difficult to determine either their figure or position; for which reasons, that which I shall <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> insulation, is generally a quality more requisite to give distinctness to an object, than magnitude of superficial dimensions.\"\n\nThis is unquestionably true; but Mr Gamble illustrates his position thus: \"An example of this distinctness arising from insulation cannot be more readily obtained than by taking a page of printed paper, and fixing the eye on some particular letter (as I); then retiring from it, the letter will be so confused with the surrounding ones, as not to be easily distinguished: but if the same letter (I) be printed on a plain sheet of paper, standing by itself (or insulated), the eye will then not only discern it at a much greater distance, but the image falling single and unencumbered upon the retina, we shall be able to determine whether it be inclined to the right or to the left, or whether it be placed horizontally on the paper.\"\n\nThe shutter telegraph is the printed page, and the arm of the semaphore is the letter (I) on a plain sheet of paper.\n\nBut actual experiment has completely proved the fallacy of Colonel Macdonald's assertion, and the justice of Mr Gamble's theory. Every officer serving on the line of telegraphs has stated, that at all times, and more especially in cloudy weather, the arms of the semaphore are seen much better than the boards of the telegraph ever were. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">Lieutenant</a> Pace, who for many years superintended the Admiralty station, declared that on the first day after the West <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">Square</a> semaphore was erected, he could clearly distinguish the positions of the arms without a telescope, and accurately take down any signals that could be made, which he had never been able to do under any circumstance whatever with the shutter telegraph. He also stated that he had frequently an open communication with the semaphore at West Square, whilst St Paul's was kept by a fog, which was at all times considered by him and his assistant as the conclusive sign that the boarded telegraph could not be worked. But in order to set the matter entirely at rest, the shutter telegraph on Nunhead, near Newcross, was left standing on the same hill with the new semaphore, in order to try their comparative distinctness, for a whole winter. The result was, that the semaphore was frequently distinctly visible when the boarded telegraph was so much enveloped in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIST\">mist</a> or fog, that the particular boards, shut or thrown open, could not be distinguished: and it appeared by a journal kept by this officer, that in the course of the winter, the days on which the semaphore was visible exceeded those on which the shutters could be seen by fully one-third. If, then, this be the case with a six-boarded telegraph, how much more objectionable must one of twelve\nTelegraph shutters be, which must necessarily be placed so near to each other as to make it at all times a matter of difficulty to discern at once how many, and which of them, are closed, and which open? Even in the six-shutter telegraph, one board has frequently been mistaken for the other; for it may be remarked, that such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a> as is required for a shutter telegraph is seldom free from haze.\n\nIt will probably be urged, that the arms of the semaphore, having to describe a larger circle, must be slower in their operations; but this increased slowness is so amply compensated by the ease and certainty of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> off the signals as to render any such objection of little or no weight: it may make the difference of one second in each signal, whilst the machinery by which the semaphore is worked is as simple and as little liable to be out of order as that of the boarded telegraph.\n\nThe six-shutter telegraph, it is true, has greater powers than the two-armed semaphore, and much greater than the universal semaphore of Colonel Pasley; that is to say, the number of combinations of which it is capable of making without using the stop-signal (or signal which separates one word, or one sentence, from another), is much greater than in either of the other two; but all of them have sufficient powers, and a sufficient number of combinations, to convey with facility and dispatch any communication whatsoever, and in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, either by letters, words, or sentences. Their respective powers may be seen by the following tables of their positions.\n\n**Admiralty Six-shutter Telegraph.**\n\n| No. of Signal | Signification | No. of Signal | Signification | No. of Signal | Signification |\n|---------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|\n| 1             | A            | 9             | 1235         |               |              |\n| 2             | Z            | 6             | 1236         |               |              |\n| 3             | X            | 5             | 1245         |               |              |\n| 4             | W            | 4             | 1246         |               |              |\n| 5             | B            | 0             | 1256         |               |              |\n| 6             | F            | 1             | 1345         |               |              |\n| 12            | L            | 2             | 1346         |               |              |\n| 13            | O            | 6             | 1356         |               |              |\n| 14            | V            | 3             | 1456         |               |              |\n| 15            | U            | 8             | 2345         |               |              |\n| 16            | H            | G             | 2346         |               |              |\n| 23            | Qu           | C             | 2356         |               |              |\n| 24            | R            | D             | 2456         |               |              |\n| 25            | T            | E             | 2456         |               |              |\n| 26            | S            | Y             | 12345        |               |              |\n| 34            | P            |               |              |               |              |\n| 35            | N            |               |              |               |              |\n| 36            | I            |               |              |               |              |\n| 45            | O            |               |              |               |              |\n| 46            | K            |               |              |               |              |\n| 56            | M            |               |              |               |              |\n\nIn all\u201462 separate and distinct signals; which may be made consecutively in any order, without requiring any stop-signal, when applied to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPELLING\">spelling</a>.

The signal, No. 4, is besides, as Colonel Pasley is aware, liable to be mistaken, it being a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELONGATION\">elongation</a> of the mast, which, at a great distance, and owing to the refractive power of the atmosphere, will always be ambiguous when exhibited as a single signal. But Colonel Pasley has added a short arm which he calls an indicator, as below at A; and which, when made moveable, more than compensates for this defect.\n\nIt was with a different view, however, that he has added this indicator. It was suggested to him by a Captain in the navy, who had experienced the greatest inconvenience, in using Sir Home Popham's ship Semaphores, from the signal men confounding the positions of the arms when seen in reverse.\n\nWe apprehend no experienced signal men could possibly make any mistake in merely changing the right hand for the left.\n\nThe respective powers of the three telegraphs, in making single, or, what may be called, primary signals, are, as appears from the tables, 62, 42, and 28. In making two changes, with a stop between them (that is, three signals) to represent a word or sentence, their powers will be as $3844$, $1764$, and $784$. In making three changes (or, with the stop, four signals), as $238,328$\u2014$74,088$\u2014$21,952$.\n\nNow, as the telegraphic dictionary of Sir Home Popham, which has been, and still is, used in the navy, does not exceed 13,000 words and sentences, and has never been found deficient in any of its divisions of subjects, it is evident that even the lowest power of the three is more than sufficient for all useful purposes; and that those compilers, who have swelled out their telegraphic dictionaries to upwards of 100,000 (one mentioned by Colonel Pasley has extended his labours to 140,000), have made them nearly useless, by the difficulty and loss of time, in finding the required phrase or sentence. We have actually seen in one telegraphic dictionary 126 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAGES\">pages</a>, of 3 columns in each page, and 60 sentences in each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a>, containing upwards of 20,000 sentences (about one-third of the number of words in Johnson's Dictionary), and each of these sentences beginning with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> pronoun HE; 20 pages with IF, &c. Compared with the use of such a dictionary, spelling the sentences is infinitely preferable as to certainty, and in many cases as to celerity. Indeed, we should say that the abbreviated nature of communications made by telegraph renders spelling by far the most eligible mode. In clear weather, the rapidity of working single signals, the short compass within which any message may be condensed, the impossibility of committing any mistake that cannot be immediately rectified, more than compensates for the difference of a few minutes, which the use of sentences may probably save. In cloudy or foggy weather, the latter method will always be liable to mistake. If experience may be assumed as a guide, the practice at the Admiralty, of spelling all sentences for the last thirty years, must decide in favour of that system.\n\nIn making use of the alphabetical table, much time may be saved, by condensing the message into the briefest form possible, leaving out of the sentences such words as may not alter the sense, and generally the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOWELS\">vowels</a> of words. For instance, \"Order the Agamemnon out of harbour, and direct her to proceed to Spithead.\" To convey this message alphabetically, it would be quite enough to say, \"Agmenn to Spthed.\" If from Spithead into harbour, \"Agmenn nto hrbr.\" In spelling, too, it is very desirable, especially in our foggy climate, that the intelligence to be conveyed should be compressed as much as possible into the early part of the message. By not observing this rule, a curious mistake is said to have been made in the course of the Peninsular war. The Admiral at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLYMOUTH\">Plymouth</a> endeavoured to send up a message, but a fog coming on, part of it only on that day reached London. It began thus: \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-WELLINGTON\">Wellington</a> defeated\"\u2014and the rest was stopped by the fog: the anxiety for the remainder may readily be conceived; it came, however, complete towards the evening, and conveyed the intelligence, that \"Wellington defeated the French,\" &c. Had the message been thus framed, \"French defeated at,\" &c. (the word Wellington being quite superfluous), the anxiety for the particulars would have been of a very different kind. Much, therefore, depends, as far as celerity and certainty is concerned, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of the sentence containing the intelligence to be conveyed.\n\nThe methods suggested for making use of telegraphic communications by night have not been less numerous than those for the day, though on land there are very few occasions on which they can be of the least possible use. A regiment might perhaps be ordered to move, at a moment's notice, in order to reach a particular point at a given time; or, as an extreme case, the enemy's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a> might be seen towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of the day in a particular quarter, which would make it desirable to have the intelligence conveyed in various directions; but no naval movement could take place during the night at any of the ports. So little useful, indeed, does a night telegraph, for the navy, appear to have been considered, that, with all the facility of applying lamps to the shutter-telegraph at the Admiralty, no attempt was ever made for carrying such a purpose into execution. Colonel Pasley's description of the application of his Universal Telegraph to night signals will suffice to show one method (as good as any other perhaps) of adopting the machine to this purpose.\n\n\"For night signals, one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANTERN\">lantern</a>, called the centre <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, is fixed to the top of the post; and one lantern (1) as an indicator is fixed to a light <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CRANE\">crane</a> or derrick, attached to the post, by night only, as under.\n\n\"These lanterns are stationary, and appear on the same level. Two other lan...\"\nterns are suspended to the ends of the arms, upon fixing which a couple of weights are added to counterpoise them. Each of the two arms by day, and each of the two moveable lights by night, is capable of exhibiting the seven positions, besides position O pointing vertically downwards. The indicator serves to distinguish the low numbers 1, 2, 3, from the high numbers 7, 6, 5, in whatever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> the telegraph may be viewed.\n\nThe use of telegraphic communication, important as it may be on land, is far more so in the management of a fleet at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>. On the unfortunate result of Admiral Keppel's engagement, Dr Beatson, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a>, thus expresses himself:\u2014\u201cThe defects or impropriety of the signals having thus appeared clearly to be the true and sole cause of the miscarriage which disappointed the reasonable hopes of Britain on this critical and weighty occasion; we may be justified in observing, that if an admiral cannot command all the necessary movements of his ships by signal on the day of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a>, he is not upon a footing with an enemy who possesses that advantage; and even with better ships and better men, and more experienced commanders, he may be foiled in his expectations of victory, if not defeated, from his want of the means to direct and to perform the necessary evolutions of his fleet.\u201d\n\nIn the Fighting and Sailing Instructions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">Duke</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a> (afterwards James II.), a certain number of signals are established for certain movements and manoeuvres of the fleet, each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAG\">flag</a> or flags having their respective objects. The l'Art des Arm\u00e9es Navales de le P. l'Hoste, published at Lyons in 1697, contains something like a system of signals, but so awkward and clumsy, as to be of a very limited use. Indeed, the best signals made use of, down to the American war, could only be considered as expedients; the numerical plan having never once been attempted, though Dr Hooke, De la Bourdonnois, and some others, had long before suggested it.\n\nIn 1798 a new signal-book was issued by the Admiralty, containing about 400 sentences, for which flags were appropriated numerically, expressive of certain operations of a fleet, which were sufficiently useful as far as these sentences went; but when it became necessary to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> any order not to be found among them, the communication was obliged to be made by boats\u2014and \u201ca <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a> from each ship\u201d was ordered. The state of the weather did not always render this practicable; and when it was, men\u2019s lives were frequently exposed to imminent risk. To remedy this inconvenience, Sir Home Popham printed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CALCUTTA\">Calcutta</a> a numerical code of naval signals, which was reprinted in England in 1803. He afterwards extended the code very considerably, which, by a recommendation of a committee of naval officers, has been adopted, and is now in general use in the navy. The only objection to this code, which more or less applies to all that have subsequently been proposed, is the great number of flags, &c., required for making numerical signals to the extent as laid down in the code in question; and which consists of nine flags, five cornettes, five triangles, and five pendants. With such a number, it is next to impossible to make out, in calm weather, the figure and the colour of the flags; and equally so when in situations where, though expanded by the wind, they present only an edge to the eye of the observer when the distance is not too great, so as to sink the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HULL\">hull</a> of the ship behind the curvature of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>. The semaphore or sea telegraph of Sir Home Popham comes in aid of, and indeed entirely removes, those difficulties. It consists of two posts, with a moveable arm to each (see the article NAVY), and may be removed to any part of the deck; but we are not sure, simple as it is, that the Universal Telegraph of Colonel Pasley, consisting of one post and two arms, might not be adopted with advantage as a sea telegraph. The former exhibits eight, the latter seven positions.\n\n(Tennant)","sp":683,"ep":711},{"h":"TENNANT","t":"a distinguished Chemist, born at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SELBY\">Selby</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORKSHIRE\">Yorkshire</a>, 30th November 1761; was the only child of the Rev. Calvert Tennant, younger son of a respectable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> in Wensley Dale, near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RICHMOND\">Richmond</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VICAR\">vicar</a> of Selby; his mother was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a> Daunt, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of a surgeon of that town.\n\nHis father had been a fellow of St John\u2019s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">College</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>, and began to teach his son Greek when he was only five years old. He had the misfortune to lose him four years after; and before he grew up, his mother also, while he was riding with her, was thrown from her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> and killed on the spot. He was sent, after his father\u2019s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, to different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a>, at Scerton, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TADCASTER\">Tadcaster</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEVERLEY\">Beverley</a>; in these he was remembered as a boy retired in his manners, and somewhat melancholy, and indolent with respect to puerile amusements. He learned but little at school, and may be considered as in great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> self-educated; having been fond, almost as a child, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> books of science, and of amusing himself with little experiments which he found described in them; and while he was at school at Tadcaster, he took great delight in attending a course of Walker\u2019s lectures on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIMENTAL_PHILOSOPHY\">experimental <a class=\"</a>xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> which were given there. At Beverley he was under the care of Dr G. Croft, who had made himself known to the public by some controversial writings; here he never entered much into the pursuits of his contemporaries, but profited by a good library belonging to the school; and among other books which he read with avidity was Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Newton\u2019s Treatise on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPTICS\">Optics</a>.\n\nHe had entertained a great desire to complete his chemical studies under the immediate instruction of Dr Priestley, who was then enjoying deserved reputation for his recent experimental discoveries; but Dr Priestley\u2019s occupations did not permit him to undertake the task of directing his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>, however agreeable it might have been to him to have assisted such a pupil. In the meantime he had not neglected his classics, but had acquired a sufficient knowledge of the learned languages to appreciate with correct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> the beauties of the great writers of antiquity.\nNotwithstanding his admiration for Dr Priestley, he was an early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> to the antiphlogistic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">chemistry</a>; which, with all its errors, was still a material step in the advancement of science.\n\nIn 1781 he went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, with the view of qualifying himself for the profession of physic, and he had the advantage of attending Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">Black</a>'s lectures, which were then in great reputation. In October 1782, he entered as a pensioner of Christ's College, Cambridge, where he became intimately acquainted with the late Professor Harwood, who had been first a surgeon in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>, but having lost, by the misconduct of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a>, the fortune that he had there acquired, submitted cheerfully to the toil of recommencing his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAREER\">career</a> as a physician, though already past the middle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>: his talents for conversation were such as were extremely likely to captivate a young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of superior discernment; and he formed a friendship with Tennant which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> uninterrupted throughout their lives.\n\nAt Cambridge he studied a little of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a>, in the works of Newton, but much more of chemistry and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTANY\">botany</a>: he already began to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> his inventive powers in an attempt to economize the consumption of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTILLATION\">distillation</a>, which he did not make public until 20 years after, though he mentioned it at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> to some of his friends. He also occupied himself incessantly in general, and especially in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> reading, though he was far from having the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> of a student: but his rooms were always in confusion from the mixture of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HETEROGENEOUS\">heterogeneous</a> materials that were accumulated in them. His residence at Cambridge was perhaps the happiest time of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>; his spirits unrestrained, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> unbroken, his feelings acute, and his conversation brilliant, though simple and unaffected.\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> of 1784 he paid a visit to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DENMARK\">Denmark</a>, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a>, and to Scheele, whose acquaintance extremely delighted him, and most of all from the simplicity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> that he employed in his researches. A year <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> two afterwards he went to France, and being taken ill at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, he was joined there by his friend Harwood, with whom he returned through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NETHERLANDS\">Netherlands</a>; at the time that the bigotted people of the Low Countries were in insurrection against a philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESPOT\">despot</a>, while Holland remained free and prosperous.\n\nHe was particularly intimate with Dr Milner, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">Master</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a>'s College, and was recommended by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIGNATURE\">signature</a>, together with those of Waring, Maskelyne, Jebb, and Watson, as a Fellow of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a>, into which he was admitted in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1785. He removed, together with his friend Harwood, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> 1786, from Christ's College to Emmanuel, and in 1788 he took a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of Bachelor of Physic.\n\nIn 1791 he communicated to the Royal Society his very interesting discovery of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of obtaining carbon from the carbonic acid. Having observed that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARCOAL\">charcoal</a> did not decompose the phosphate of lime, he concluded that phosphorus ought to decompose the carbonate of lime, and the result fully justified his manner of reasoning.\n\nHe paid a third visit to the Continent in 1792, intending to go on through France into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, and arrived at Paris not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> before the 10th of August; but he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> some indications of an impending convulsion, and was fortunate enough to quit Paris on the 9th. He visited Gibbon at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAUSANNE\">Lausanne</a>, and was much interested in the sagacity that this eminent writer displayed in his conversation. He went on to Rome and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLORENCE\">Florence</a>, where he was fully impressed with all the admiration that he had been taught to anticipate for the treasures of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> art possessed by those cities; and in his return through Germany, he was greatly amused by the mixture of knowledge and credulity that he observed among the studious of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. At Paris he found everything enveloped in gloom and overwhelmed with terror, in 1793; his friend Lametherie was alarmed by the visit which he paid him, but he had the integrity to preserve for him entire some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of considerable value, with which he had entrusted him.\n\nUpon his arrival in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, Mr Tennant took chambers in the Temple, and was in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of living much with some of his early acquaintance, who had adopted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a> as their profession; to his own he was in great measure indifferent, neither seeking to practise it, nor being well calculated to succeed greatly in it with the public, though he studied it with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, and took pains to make himself master of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> and its philosophy, being a particular admirer of Sydenham, when considered in relation to the age in which he lived. He took his degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">Doctor</a> of Physic in 1796, and in the same year he gave the Royal Society a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of carbonic acid afforded by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIAMOND\">diamond</a>, which he measured by heating it with nitre, and obtaining a precipitate by the addition of muriate of lime; and he found that the diamond afforded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> more carbonic acid than an equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of charcoal. A subsequent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> contained the result of his observations on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of heated nitre on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> and platinum.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of travelling appeared to be his predominant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>; he studied in his travels, not only the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> and political history of the countries that he saw, but also their languages, and the philosophy of their etymologies. He observed, too, the peculiarities of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>; and, in 1797, he determined, after visiting an agricultural friend in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-LINCOLNSHIRE\">Lincolnshire</a>, to devote his attention to practical farming as a serious pursuit. He purchased some allotments of unenclosed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> in that neighbourhood, but he left the management of them chiefly to his friend, and made afterwards considerable additions to the property by further purchases. In 1798 or 1799, he bought a tract of newly enclosed land on the Mendip hills, near Cheddar, where he built a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, and resided for some months every summer through the remainder of his life. These speculations, though their results were at first doubtful, yet succeeded remarkably well on the whole; more especially considering the benefit that his health derived from the travelling and the exercise that they rendered necessary: but they occupied too much of his attention, and of that time which might have been employed so much more to the advantage of the public, and to his own ultimate satisfaction.\nIn 1799 he gave the Royal Society a paper on the magnesian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">limestone</a>, or dolomite, which he considers as rather a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> than an accidental mixture; and the forms of the crystals, as they have been determined by later observers, together with the laws of definite proportions, have tended to confirm this conjecture: he found that grain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> scarcely germinate, and soon perishes, when sown in the neutral carbonate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNESIA\">magnesia</a>. In 1802 he published his paper on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMERY\">emery</a>, which he showed to be a substance similar to the corundum or adamantine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAR\">spar</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHINA\">China</a>, and not an ore of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, as had been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> supposed. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> he was making some experiments on crude <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLATINA\">platina</a>, when he discovered in it a singular dark powder, which was left undissolved by the nitromuriatic acid, and which was also observed the next year by Messrs Descottis and Vauquelin. In 1804 Mr Tennant showed that the powder contained two new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a>, which he named <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRIDIUM\">Iridium</a> and Osmium; and he received the Copleian medal from the Royal Society in November, as an acknowledgment of the merit of his various chemical discoveries. In 1805 and 1806 he paid two successive visits to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>, by way of Scotland, one of them in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> with Browne the traveller, for whom he had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> esteem, and to whom he suggested the observation of the temperature of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> as a mode of determining the heights of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>; a method, however, which had been long before recommended by Achard and others.\n\nHe became latterly more fond of general society than he had been in his earlier years, and he used to receive miscellaneous parties at his chambers, and to show them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINTS\">prints</a>, and minerals, and novelties of various kinds. In 1812 he was persuaded to convert these mixed exhibitions into a more regular course of lectures, principally upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINERALOGY\">mineralogy</a>, calculated especially for the ladies of his acquaintance, and which highly delighted all his audience: \"Their attention was perpetually kept alive by the spirit and variety with which every topic was discussed, by anecdotes and quotations happily introduced, by the ornaments of a powerful but chastised <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>, and, above all, by a peculiar vein of pleasantry, at once <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> and delicate, with which he could animate and embellish the most unpromising subjects;\"\u2014a circumstance which, though not of much immediate importance to the public, yet probably led him the more readily to accept the Professorship at Cambridge, and would thus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he had survived longer, have greatly extended the sphere of his utility.\n\nHe delivered, in 1813, a lecture on mineralogy to the Geological Society, and gave them also an account of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a> of a volcanic substance from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol13.html#article-LIPARI_ISLANDS\">Lipari <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">Islands</a> containing the boracic acid, which has since been examined on the spot by Dr Holland. In the month of May he was elected Professor of Chemistry in the University of Cambridge, all opposition having been withdrawn before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a>. The following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> he gave his first and last course of lectures there. His introductory lecture still exists in manuscript, and is said to contain a masterly sketch of the history of the science. He communicated to the Royal Society, in 1814, a paper on the easiest mode of procuring potassium, and another on the economy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> in distillation, proposing to heat a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> boiler by the condensation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEAM\">steam</a> of the first. In the spring and summer of this year he was occupied in searching for the origin of iodine, and he succeeded in detecting this substance in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>-water, by the test of its tarnishing the surface of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a> silver. One of the last services, that he rendered the Royal Society, was in the capacity of a member of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMITTEE\">committee</a> which was formed in order to investigate, at the request of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, the degree of danger that might attend the general introduction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAS\">gas</a> lights into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a>; he undertook, together with his friend Dr Wollaston, to make some experiments upon the inflammation of the gas, and they discovered conjointly the very important fact, that the gas contained in a small tube will not communicate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a>: a fact which, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of Sir Humphry Davy, has been rendered productive of consequences so important to the public safety; although Sir Humphry having been abroad at the time of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>, and the report of the committee not having been then published, he had to rediscover this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, and many more, in his most ingenious and successful researches.\n\nIt was early in the month of September that Mr Tennant went for the last time to France, being impatient to observe the changes that an eventful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> of twenty years had produced in that highly interesting country. He was greatly delighted with Lyons and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARSEILLES\">Marseilles</a>, and, returning to Paris in November, he lingered there till February 1815; on the 15th of that month he arrived at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CALAIS\">Calais</a>; the 20th he went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOULOGNE\">Boulogne</a> with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARON\">Baron</a> Bulow, in order to embark there; they did embark on the 22d, but were forced back by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>, and meant to try again in the evening; in the meantime, they took horses and went to see Bonaparte's Pillar, about a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a> off, and going off the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> on their return, to look at a small fort, of which the drawbridge wanted a bolt, they were both thrown, with their horses, into the ditch. Bulow was only stunned, but Tennant's skull was so severely fractured, that he died an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> after.\n\nHis papers published in the Philosophical Transactions were eight in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>. 1. On the Decomposition of Fixed Air, 1791, p. 182. 2. On the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">Nature</a> of the Diamond, 1797, p. 123. 3. On the Action of Nitre upon Gold and Platina, p. 219. 4. On the different sorts of Lime used in Agriculture, 1799, p. 305. 5. On the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">Composition</a> of Emery, 1802, p. 398. 6. On two Metals found in the Black Powder remaining after the Solution of Platina, 1804, p. 411. 7. On an easier Mode of procuring Potassium than that which is now adopted, 1814, p. 578. 8. On the Means of producing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> Distillation by the same Heat, p. 587. 9. The analysis of A Volcanic Substance containing the Boracic Acid appeared in the Transactions of the Geological Society, Vol. I. 1811.\n\nMr Tennant was tall and slight in his person; his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a> was thin, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>; he resembled a little the portraits of Locke; he was general-\nly negligent in his dress, but, on the whole, agreeable in his appearance. He was distinguished for good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, for quickness of perception, and for penetration; but, as his friend and biographer Mr Whishaw observes, in the admirably energetic sketch that he has given of his character, he was one of those who, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> the words of Dr Johnson, \"without much labour, have obtained a high reputation, and are mentioned with reverence rather for the possession than the exertion of uncommon abilities.\"\n\n\"His curiosity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> were incessant; he had a vigilance of observation which suffered nothing to escape him, and was continually gaining new information from a variety of interesting sources. But although the knowledge thus acquired was remarkable for its correctness, and complete for the purposes of its possessor, yet the industry and perseverance, by which it ought to have been embodied and made permanent for the benefit of others, were too often altogether wanting. The ardour and energy of Mr Tennant's mind co-operated unfortunately, in this respect, with his want of method and of systematic habits of application; since he was constantly pressing on to new discoveries, instead of arranging and bringing to perfection those which he had already made. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> was a great storehouse of discoveries, and hints for discovery, of ascertained facts, probable conjectures, and ingenious trains of reasoning relative to the various important subjects upon which he had at any time been engaged. These he was continually treasuring up, with the intention of reducing them to order, and preparing them for use at a more convenient season. But that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> rarely arrived. In the carelessness of intellectual wealth, he neglected those stores of knowledge which he had accumulated, and suffered them to remain useless and unproductive, till his attention was recalled to them, perhaps after a long course of years, by some new fact or discovery, some remark in conversation, or other accidental occurrence.\"\n\nThe effect of his peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a> was heightened by a perfect gravity of countenance, a quiet familiar manner, and a characteristic simplicity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>. He was firmly attached to the general principles of freedom, being fully convinced \"of their influence in promoting the wealth and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> of nations; a due regard to these principles, he considered as the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> foundation of the most important blessings of social life, and as the peculiar cause of that distinguished superiority, which our own country so happily enjoys among the nations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>.\" \"The cheerful activity of a populous town, the improvements in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEAM_ENGINE\">steam-engine</a>, the great galvanic experiments, and above all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of the prospects afforded by that revolution in chemical science which has illustrated our own age and country; these magnificent objects, when presented to Mr Tennant's mind, excited in him the liveliest emotions, and called for the most animated expressions of admiration and delight.\"\n\n\"He thought himself passionate and irascible; and certainly his feelings were quick; but they were transitory.\" He possessed a strong sense of high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a>, as well as of duty; and his liberality and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a> were evinced by some practical occurrences in which he had occasion to exercise them: his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEWARD\">steward</a> had defrauded him, and when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> of reckoning came, had destroyed himself: he not only forgave the debt, but provided also for the widow and her family.\n\n\"His amiable temper and unaffected desire of giving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>, no less than his superior knowledge and talents, had rendered him highly acceptable to a numerous and distinguished circle of society, by whom he was justly valued, and by whom his premature death was sincerely lamented. But the real extent of his private worth, the genuine simplicity and virtuous independence of his character, and the sincerity, warmth, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTANCY\">constancy</a> of his friendship, can only be felt and estimated by those to whom he was long and intimately known, and to whom the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOLLECTION\">recollection</a> of his talents and virtues must always remain a pleasing though melancholy bond of union.\"\n\n[Whishaw in] Thomson's Annals, Vol. VI. 1815. p. 1, 80.","sp":711,"ep":714},{"h":"THIS COUNTY IS BY NO","t":"s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> is by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> means uniformly beautiful. On the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>, the absence of hedges, which are supplied by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> walls, gives a dreary appearance to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. In the centre, it is generally flat and woody, affording few pleasing prospects, though its trees and verdure give it the semblance of wealth. The southern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a>, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>, the gentle swelling of its hills, the verdant meadows between them, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of highly embellished residences of rich proprietors, is a district abounding with rural charms. The Chiltern Hills, the highest range in England south of the river <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRENT\">Trent</a>, form a part of this portion. They are in many parts adorned with beech woods, and in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> of these woods cultivated quite to their summits.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> of the county varies according to the elevation and exposure. In the north, where no hedges impede the winter winds, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> is somewhat severe, and the Chiltern Hills are frequently enveloped in damp fogs, especially in the more woody parts of them. Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTHUR\">Arthur</a> Young, in his Agricultural Survey of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OXFORDSHIRE\">Oxfordshire</a>, has formed a classification of the soils in the different districts of the county, which, like all similar estimates, must be received with hesitation, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> at least with many exceptions. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, found chiefly in the north, and by far the most fertile, he estimates at 79,635 acres. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, provincially called stone brash, found in the centre, and whose surface is often covered with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, amounts to 164,023 acres. The Chiltern lands, whose soil is a loam resting everywhere on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a> of chalk, and covered with flint stones, are 64,778 acres. To these are added 166,400 acres under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of miscellaneous, which comprehends all sorts of soil, from loose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> to the heaviest clay, and includes the rich meadows on the banks of the rivers.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">Agriculture</a>. Though this is wholly an agricultural county, and though much progress in improvement has been made of late years, yet the general practices are by no means equal to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> of those of the rest of England. The most beneficial husbandry is founded upon the valuable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> meadows on the banks of the different streams. These are naturally so fertile, that they appear to have prevented that care which would render them still more productive. Little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> is paid to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-DRAINING\">draining</a>, and still less to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IRRIGATION\">irrigation</a>, though the good effects of both these practices are obvious, and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCOMPLISHMENT\">accomplishment</a> easy in many circumstances. Some few oxen are fattened, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a> and cheese made in the dairies, but the facility of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a> induces the farmers to make more hay than is consumed by their stock, and to send it to distant and higher <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARKETS\">markets</a> than their own\u2014nearer to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a>. On the arable fields, especially on the stony lands near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BURFORD\">Burford</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of oxen for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLOUGH\">plough</a> is very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEREFORDSHIRE\">Herefordshire</a> breed is generally preferred for that purpose. The practice of paring and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> the surface prevails in many parts of the county, and in the newly inclosed lands the application of lime as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANURE\">manure</a> is highly beneficial, whilst on the Chiltern lands it is not found to produce a good effect equal to the expense which attends it.\n\nWhere the soils are so various, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROTATION\">rotation</a> of crops must necessarily vary with them. On the red Crops soils, the most usual course is, 1st, turnips; 2d, barley, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>-wheat; 3d, clover; 4th, wheat; 5th, peas, or beans; and, 6th, oats. On the stone-brash lands, the usual rotation is, 1st, turnips; 2d, barley; 3d, clover, to stand two years; 4th, wheat; and, 5th, oats, peas, or sometimes, but rarely, beans. On the Chiltern lands, the rotations are the same, with only slight variations. On both these last tracts of country, the cultivation of sanfoin is very extensive; on most farms occupying from one-seventh to one-eighth of the whole. This valuable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> grass produces heavy crops. When it was first introduced, it would remain productive for fifteen or sixteen years; but since it has become more familiarised to the soil, it seldom lasts more than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> years so as to be fit to make hay, but yields food for sheep for one or two years afterwards. The sheep, which were formerly almost all of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BERKSHIRE\">Berkshire</a> breed, have of late years been superseded by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of the South <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWNS\">Downs</a>.\n\nOxfordshire is not a manufacturing district. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WITNEY\">Witney</a> was celebrated for its blankets, and they still retain their superiority; but the cheapness with which similar goods are made by machinery in the northern counties has reduced the demand; and though machinery has been introduced, the trade is still on the decline. On the eastern side of the county, some females find occupation in making bone <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LACE\">lace</a>, but that, too, is on the decline. At <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANBURY\">Banbury</a> there is a manufactory of plushes, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>-shaggs, and some bindings, and other haberdashery wares; and at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOODSTOCK\">Woodstock</a>, the making of gloves gives employment to many of the inhabitants. There are no minerals and no coals found in this county.\n\nThe rivers all empty themselves into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THAMES\">Thames</a>. Rivers and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CANALS\">Canals</a>. They are formed by the numerous small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a> which are everywhere to be seen; and before they join the Thames are called the Windrush, coming from Burford and Witney, the Evenlode, from Wichwood and Charlbury, and the Cherwell, from the vicinity of Banbury. The Thames, composed of the stream of that name and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISIS\">Isis</a> (on which a strange confusion has arisen), is navigable from near one of its sources, not far from Letchlode, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>. The barges navigating it are from seventy-five to one hundred tons burden, but the larger ones ascend no higher than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a>. From the frequent recurrence of shoals, from the floods in winter, and the scarcity of water in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, it is a dilatory navigation; so that frequently the passage from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> occupies less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> than from Letchlode to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a>. The scarcity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a> was severely experienced till within these last few years; but the completion of a canal, which connects the city of Oxford with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COLLIERIES\">collieries</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAFFORDSHIRE\">Staffordshire</a>, has removed the evil, and proved <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>-\nly profitable to the proprietors of that important <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>.\n\nWe forbear to say anything of that which is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> of this county and of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>\u2014the city of Oxford. It is described in the Encyclopaedia in a moderate compass, and a farther expansion of that description, by enumerating the works of art and the repositories of everything valuable in literature, would be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a> with the limits prescribed to this work.\n\nAntiquities. The antiquities of this county have been accurately described, and are deserving of the closest inspection. Among them are the traces of the various <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a> formed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> station was at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DORCHESTER\">Dorchester</a>, many funereal mounds, and the Vallum called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEVIL\">Devil</a>'s Ditch. The Priory of Godstow, and the ruins of many other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> houses, exhibit the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a> of different and remote ages.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">Population</a>. The population of this county had increased, between the years 1801 and 1811, by 9586 individuals. In the last mentioned year, the numbers were, 119,204; of whom the males were 59,140, and the females 60,064. The number of houses were 21,598, inhabited by 24,749 families. Of these persons, 36,409 were employed in agriculture, 17,946 in trade and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a>, and 64,849 derived their subsistence from neither of these employments. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> and their population are as follows, viz.\u2014\n\n| Town                | Population |\n|---------------------|------------|\n| Oxford city         | 12,931     |\n| Henley-upon-Thames  | 3,111      |\n| Banbury             | 2,840      |\n| Witney              | 2,722      |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THAME\">Thame</a>               | 2,328      |\n\nThe county is in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIOCESE\">diocese</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> city, which gives the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARL\">Earl</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> of Harley.

We may form an idea what the progress in the improvement of chronometers has been, when a public reward was offered by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a> in the year 1814 to the first who should determine the longitude at sea within a degree, and in 1820, three chronometers, after remaining in the Arctic regions for eighteen months, returned to England without altering their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATES\">rates</a> more than a few seconds of time.\n\nThe officers of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> Navy are much more generally versed in the sciences of late years than heretofore. In fact, it is now necessary for a young man to be well acquainted with a certain portion of mathematical and astronomical knowledge, to enable him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>, without which he cannot be qualified for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">lieutenant</a>.

The examinations also of the several warrant officers and their qualifications for their respective stations, are more strictly attended to than heretofore; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> is, that a much better system of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a> without rigour, is established throughout the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a>, and more comfort in every respect to every class of officers and men employed.\n\nThe encouragement given to the navy from its Pay and first regular establishment, has marked it as a favourite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> in the minds of the public.

But the first regular establishment of half-pay for all flag-officers, captains, first-lieutenants, and masters, was, by King William, in the year 1693, provided they had served a year in their respective qualities, or had been in a general engagement with the enemy. A regular established half-pay was further sanctioned by Order in Council of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANNE\">Anne</a> in 1700; the conditions of which were, that no officer should enjoy the benefit thereof who shall absent himself without permission of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">High</a> Admiral or Lords Commissioners of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMIRALTY\">Admiralty</a>, or who shall be dismissed for any misdemeanour, or by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COURT_MARTIAL\"><a class=\"xre</a>f\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">court</a>-martial, or who shall not behave himself to the\nNavy.\n\nsatisfaction of the Lord High Admiral, or who shall have leave to go out of his Majesty's dominions, if employed in the merchant service or otherwise, or if he enjoys the benefit of any public employment. Since the above <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> the rate of half-pay to the several officers of the navy has undergone various modifications. At present, it stands as under:\n\n### Rates of Half-Pay\n\n#### Flag-Officers\n\n| Per Diem |\n|----------|\n| Admirals of the Fleet | L 3 3 0 |\n| Admirals | 2 2 0 |\n| Vice-Admirals | 1 12 6 |\n| Rear ditto | 1 5 0 |\n\n#### Captains\n\n| Per Diem |\n|----------|\n| To each of the first 100 as they stand on the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of officers in seniority | 0 14 6 |\n| To each of the next 150 | 0 12 6 |\n| To the rest | 0 10 6 |\n\n#### Commanders\n\n| Per Diem |\n|----------|\n| To each of the first 150 on the list | 0 10 0 |\n| To the remainder | 0 8 6 |\n\n#### Lieutenants\n\n| Per Diem |\n|----------|\n| To each of the first 300 on the list | 0 7 0 |\n| To each of the next 700 | 0 6 0 |\n| To the remainder | 0 5 0 |\n\n#### Royal Marines\n\n| Per Diem |\n|----------|\n| Colonels | 0 14 6 |\n| Lieutenant-Colonels | 0 11 0 |\n| Majors | 0 9 6 |\n| Captains | 0 7 0 |\n| First Lieutenants of 7 years standing | 0 4 6 |\n| The rest | 0 4 0 |\n| Second Lieutenants | 0 3 0 |\n\n#### Masters\n\n| Per Diem |\n|----------|\n| To the first 100 on the list (being qualified for first or second rates) | 0 7 0 |\n| To the next 200 (being qualified for third or fourth rates) | 0 6 0 |\n| The remainder having served 5 years in the navy, 2 of which as acting or second master, or as master's mate or midshipman | 0 5 0 |\n\n#### Medical Officers\n\n| Per Diem |\n|----------|\n| Physicians\u2014After 10 years service | 1 1 0 |\n| 3 years | 0 15 0 |\n| Under that time | 0 10 6 |\n\n#### Surgeons\n\n| Per Diem |\n|----------|\n| Six years service | 0 6 0 |\n| Under that time | 0 5 0 |\n\n#### Assistant Surgeons\n\n| Per Diem |\n|----------|\n| Three years service | 0 3 0 |\n| Two years | 0 2 0 |\n| Dispensers | 0 5 0 |\n\n#### Chaplains\n\n| Per Diem |\n|----------|\n| After eight years service at sea, or ten in harbour | L 0 5 0 |\n| For less service, not under 3 years | a proportion of the above |\n| For each year's longer service than ten years, 6d. per diem additional till it reach | 0 10 0 |\n\n#### Pursers\n\n| Payable Quarterly |\n|-------------------|\n| To the first 100 on the list | 0 5 0 |\n| Do. next 200 do. | 0 4 0 |\n| The remainder | 0 3 0 |\n\nThe boatswains, gunners, and carpenters of the navy, have pensions or superannuations, in lieu of half-pay, according to the following scale; formed on a consideration of the total length of service as warrant officers, with the length of service in commission.\n\n| Total Service | Commissioned Service | Pension |\n|---------------|----------------------|---------|\n| YEARS | YEARS | L. |\n| 30 | 20 | 85 |\n| 30 | 15 | 75 |\n| 30 | 10 | 65 |\n| 30 | 5 | 55 |\n| 20 | 20 | 75 |\n| 20 | 15 | 65 |\n| 20 | 10 | 55 |\n| 20 | 5 | 45 |\n| 15 | 15 | 60 |\n| 15 | 10 | 50 |\n| 15 | 5 | 40 |\n| 10 | 10 | 40 |\n| 10 | 5 | 35 |\n\nIn point of half-pay and other pecuniary emoluments, the navy has much the advantage over the army, more particularly in the chance of prize-money, which but seldom falls to the share of the army, except on some conjoint expedition. On the commencement of a war a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROCLAMATION\">proclamation</a> is issued by the King, directing that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">net</a> produce of all prizes taken by any of his ships of war, shall be for the entire benefit and encouragement of the flag-officers, captains, commanders, and other commissioned officers, and of the seamen, marines, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> on board at the time of the capture; and directing also in what manner the distribution shall be made. Many very handsome and, in some instances, very splendid fortunes have been made by captures of the enemy's ships.\n\nAnother great encouragement for young men to enter the naval service arises from the honours bestowed by the Sovereign for any brilliant exploit. Thus, in consequence of the skill and bravery which were exhibited in the great and glorious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the 1st of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 1794, his Majesty was graciously pleased to confer on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARL\">Earl</a> Howe the Order of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GARTER\">Garter</a>; Vice-Admirals Graves and Sir Alexander Hood were made Barons of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">Kingdom</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>; and Rear-Admirals Bowyer, Gardner, and Pasley, together with Sir Roger Curtis, Captain of the Queen Charlotte, were created Baronets. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">Gold</a> medals and...\nchains were also distributed to such admirals, and gold medals to such captains, as were particularized in Lord Howe's dispatches. The first lieutenants of each ship were promoted to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of commanders; and pensions of L.1000 per annum were granted to Rear-Admirals Bowyer and Pasley.\n\nFor the action of 14th February 1797, Lord St Vincent was advanced to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> of an Earl, and a pension granted to him of L.3000 a-year; Vice-Admirals Thompson and Parker were created Baronets; Commodore Nelson received the Order of the Bath, and Captain Calder of the Victory, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-KNIGHTHOOD\">Knighthood</a>; and gold medals were distributed to the admirals and captains.\n\nFor the action of the 11th October 1797, Admiral Duncan was created a Viscount, with a pension of L.2000 a-year; Vice-Admiral Onslow made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARONET\">Baronet</a>, and Captain Fairfax had the honour of Knighthood. Gold medals were also distributed to the admirals and captains.\n\nFor the action of the 1st August 1798, his Majesty was pleased to testify his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of the importance of this brilliant achievement, by raising Sir Horatio Nelson to the dignity of the Peerage, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARON\">Baron</a> Nelson of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NILE\">Nile</a>; and by directing medals to be distributed to the captains. The first lieutenant of the Majestic was made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POST\">post</a>-captain, and the first lieutenants of the other ships were promoted to the rank of commanders. And for the attack of the Danish fleet at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COPENHAGEN\">Copenhagen</a>, Lord Nelson was raised to the dignity of a Viscount, and on Admiral Graves was conferred the Order of the Bath.\n\nFor the ever memorable action of Trafalgar, in which Lord Nelson fell in the arms of victory, his Majesty was pleased to confer on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> the rank of an Earl, with a pension of L.5000 a-year; and the sum of L.120,000 was voted by Parliament for the purchase of an estate to be annexed to the title. Admiral Collingwood was raised to the dignity of a Baron; Lord Northesk was honoured with the Order of the Bath, and Captain Hardy was created a Baronet. The captains had medals; five lieutenants were made post-captains; 24 lieutenants, commanders; 22 midshipmen were made lieutenants; and the senior captain of marines made brevet-major.\n\nBy this last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of Lord Nelson's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> was annihilated the last remaining hope of the combined navies of France and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, and a blow given to the naval power of the enemies of Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, which they never recovered during the remainder of the war.\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINOR\">minor</a> victories of Sir John Warren, Sir John Duckworth, Sir Robert Calder, Sir Richard Strachan, Lord Gambier, and Lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXMOUTH\">Exmouth</a>, and even for brilliant actions of single ships, appropriate distinctions have never been withheld. Exclusive of peerages and baronetcies, the honours bestowed for gallant conduct in the naval service consist of 25 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">Grand</a> Crosses of the Bath, 70 Knights Commanders, and 130 Companions of the Bath.\n\nThe provision which is made for officers, in the event of losing a limb, or being so severely wounded in the service, as to be of equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of body with the loss of a limb, is another encouragement for entering the naval service.\n\nFor an admiral, from L.300 to L.700 per annum. A post-captain, wounds, L.250, loss of a limb, L.300. Commander, do. L.150, do. L.200. Lieutenant, do. L.91, 5s. do. L.91, 5s. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">Marine</a> officers the same as in the army.\n\nA provision is likewise made for the widows of the widows' commission and warrant officers of his Majesty's navy, under the title of the \"Widow's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CHARITY\">Charity</a>,\" the management of which is vested in a Court of Assistants annually chosen, consisting chiefly of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty (the First Lord being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">President</a>), and the flag-officers of the navy, making in the whole eighteen.\n\nThe funds arise from, 1. A deduction of three-pence in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> from the pay, half-pay, and pensions of the commission and warrant officers of the navy. 2. The amount of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WAGES\">wages</a> and value of the victuals of one fictitious man in every 100, borne on the books of ships in sea-pay. And, 3. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">Interest</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> vested in the funds. During the late war, the amount of the revenue from these sources was from L.90,000 to L.100,000; and the amount of pensions were about L.70,000 a-year. The pensions are allowed according to the following scale, being similar in most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> to the widows of officers in the army of corresponding ranks: the latter are provided for by an annual vote of Parliament.\n\n**Scale of Pensions.**\n\n| Officer Title | Pension |\n|---------------|---------|\n| Flag-Officer   | L.120   |\n| Captain       |         |\n| Rear-Admiral  | 100     |\n| Post-Captain  | 90      |\n| Post-Captain  | 80      |\n| Commander     | 70      |\n| Lieutenant    | 60      |\n| Commander     | 50      |\n| Master        | 40      |\n| Surgeon       | 40      |\n| Purser        | 30      |\n| Boatswain     | 25      |\n| Gunner        | 25      |\n| Carpenter     | 25      |\n| Second Master | 25      |\n\nAnd the widows of officers of the Royal Marines are entitled to the following pensions:\n\n| Officer Title | Pension |\n|---------------|---------|\n| General Officer | L.120 |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLONEL\">Colonel</a>       | 90     |\n| Lieutenant-Colonel | 80 |\n| Major         | 70     |\n| Captain       | 50     |\n| First Lieutenant and Surgeon | 40 |\n| Second Lieutenant and Assistant Surgeon | 30 |\n\nIn addition to these pensions, there has recently been a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUND\">Fund</a>.\nbeen established a *Compassionate Fund*, for the relief of such widows and orphan children as may appear to be objects of compassion. The sums annually required are voted by Parliament, and at present do not exceed from L6,000 to L7,000 a-year.\n\nNo provision, however, had been made for the brave seamen who fought the battles of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, excepting for such as had been wounded in fight with the enemy. In the year 1588, after the memorable defeat of the Spanish Armada, the wounded seamen petitioned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a> for relief, upon which, with the advice of the Lord High Admiral and the Commissioners of the Navy, and with the consent of the inferior officers and seamen, the sum of sixpence a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> was deducted out of the wages of warrant officers and seamen, for the relief and maintenance of such as were hurt or maimed in the service. The money so raised was deposited at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHATHAM\">Chatham</a> in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEST\">chest</a>, under the superintendence of the Yard Officers and the Warrant Officers of the Navy. As the funds increased, the management of them was transferred to certain Commissioners and Governors; and in order to do away in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> the inconvenience of compelling seamen from the western ports to go to Chatham for their pensions, the chest was removed, by the 43rd Geo. III., to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREENWICH\">Greenwich</a> Hospital; and the power and authorities of the former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-TRUSTEES\">trustees</a> were vested in the First Lord of the Admiralty, the Comptroller of the Navy, the Governor of Greenwich Hospital, and the Auditor of the same hospital, all for the time being, who, by this act, are created a body politic and corporate, by the name of the *Supervisors of the Chest of Greenwich*; the said supervisors to appoint five *Directors* from the officers of Greenwich Hospital, to have the immediate management of the business.\n\nIn the course of the late war the funded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> amounted to nearly L1,000,000 in the 3 per cents. the monthly sixpences, medals, &c. to nearly L70,000 per annum; and the \u00a7 of 5 per cent. on the net proceeds of prizes to about L40,000; making a net annual income of about L130,000.\n\nThe annual allowances made to pensioners were regulated according to the following scale:\n\n| Condition                                      | Allowance |\n|------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Total <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BLINDNESS\">blindness</a>                                 | L20       |\n| Loss of sight of one eye, the other impaired, according to the degree of blindness | L8 to L18 |\n| Loss of sight of one eye; the other not impaired | 6         |\n| Loss of arm, taken out of the socket, each      | 20        |\n| Loss of arm above the elbow, each               | 16        |\n| Loss of arm below the elbow, each               | 14        |\n| Loss of leg above the knee, each                | 14        |\n| Loss of leg below the knee, each                | 12        |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">Double</a> rupture                                  | 12        |\n| Single ditto, retainable by a truss             | 4         |\n| Single rupture, not retainable, or very bad, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the injury, from | L6 to L10 |\n| Loss of thumb, or fore finger, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> | 6         |\n| Loss of thumb, or fore finger, first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> remaining | 4         |\n\nIn all cases of wounds, fractures, &c. for which no positive scale could be affixed, an allowance was made from the examining surgeon's report of the injury sustained, and a pension was granted for life, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> of years, according to circumstances.\n\nWhen the wound or hurt was not thought of sufficient consequence to entitle the party to a pension, a sum of money was given as a full compensation.\n\nEvery man, at time of entry on the list, was paid the amount of half a year's pension, as present relief, which money was not deducted from growing pension.\n\nSince the conclusion of the late war, the funds of the chest of Greenwich have been amalgamated with those of Greenwich Hospital, both of which are now under one and the same management.\n\nThe establishment of Greenwich Hospital embraced more extensive objects. The first idea of this noble <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> and ornament of this kingdom, has been ascribed, with every appearance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>, the consort of William III. Being desirous that our gallant seamen, worn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> or infirmities, as well as suffering from wounds, should not be left destitute, she made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a>, jointly with King William, of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PALACE\">Palace</a> of Greenwich, and certain lands adjoining, to be appropriated to this purpose, in order, as stated in the King's commission, to \"the making some competent provision that seamen, who, by age, wounds, or other accidents, shall become disabled for further service at sea, and shall not be in a condition to maintain themselves comfortably, may not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> under hardships and miseries, but may be supported at the public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a>; and that the children of such disabled seamen, and also the widows and children of such seamen as shall happen to be slain in sea service, may, in some reasonable manner, be provided for, and educated.\" In 1695 the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMITTEE\">committee</a> appointed to examine and report on the premises, recommended an additional wing to King Charles's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>, which being approved by the King, Sir Christopher Wren undertook the conduct of the new erections without any pay or reward. Since that time various additions and improvements have been made to this magnificent pile of building, which was completed very nearly as it now appears, in the year 1778.\n\nThe King granted L2,000 a-year towards the carrying on, perfecting, and endowing this hospital. The great Officers of State and wealthy individuals also subscribed liberally to the undertaking. It was at the same time enacted by Parliament, that a deduction of sixpence per man per month should be made out of the wages of all mariners for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of the hospital; and power was given to the Lord High Admiral to appoint commissioners for receiving the said duty, whose office is situated on Tower Hill. In 1699 his Majesty contributed the sum of L19,500, being fines laid by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">House</a> of Lords on certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> convicted of smuggling. In 1705 Queen Anne assigned to the use of the hospital the effects of Kid the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIRATE\">pirate</a>, amounting to upwards of L6,000. In 1707 Robert Osboldiston, Esq. devised by will half of his estate, which was valued at L20,000. In the same year Anthony Bowyer gave the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVERSION\">reversion</a> of a considerable estate for the use of the hospital.\nBy several statutes, the forfeited and unclaimed shares of prize-money were given to the hospital, and various grants, from time to time, continued to be made by Parliament. But the most substantial grant was that made by the Commons of the rents and profits of the forfeited estates of the Earl of Derwentwater, amounting at that time to about L. 6000 a-year, and at present to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> rental of L. 60,000, of which, after payment of all expenses for improvements, repairs, collections, and incumbrances, the annual receipt may be estimated from L. 30,000 to L. 40,000.\n\nAt present the permanent revenues of the hospital consist of the following heads:\n\n1. Sixpence per man per month for all seamen and marines belonging to his Majesty's naval service, and sixpence which was formerly paid to the chest at Chatham.\n\n2. The same from all seamen employed in the merchants' service.\n\n3. The duties arising from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">North</a> and South Foreland <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>-houses.\n\n4. The rents and profits of the Derwentwater estates, including the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINES\">mines</a>.\n\n5. Rents of the market of Greenwich, and of certain houses there and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>.\n\n6. Interest of money invested in the public funds.\n\n7. Forfeited and unclaimed shares of prize-money.\n\n8. Fines for various offences.\n\nIt is evident that the funds of the establishment must vary considerably in times of war and peace; being lowest in the latter period, when the demands are heaviest upon it, especially for a certain number of years after the closing of a war.\n\nThe rental of the estates belonging to the hospital in the counties of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTHUMBERLAND\">Northumberland</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUMBERLAND\">Cumberland</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURHAM\">Durham</a>, have risen from L. 23,000 in 1805, to L. 43,000 in 1816. The present gross rental of these estates and the lead mines, as above stated, amounts to about L. 60,000. The merchant seamen's sixpences amount to about L. 20,000 a-year; the naval seamen and marines to L. 15,000; the North and South Foreland lights to L. 7000; the interest of funded property to L. 50,000, making, with other contingencies, an annual revenue of about L. 150,000; the whole of which is expended on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSEHOLD\">household</a> establishment, the clothing, maintenance, and allowances to pensioners and other attendants, repairs, taxes, and contingencies.\n\nDuring the war, and for a few years after the war, the funds of the hospital were adequate to the payment of the out-pensioners, which, taken at 35,000, the greatest number they ever reached, and allowing to each, on an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a>, L. 11 a-year, must have amounted to the sum of L. 385,000. Their numbers may now have decreased to 30,000, and the amount of their pensions to L. 330,000, to be voted by Parliament; the funds of the hospital no longer affording a surplus beyond its own support, from which only, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, the out-pensioners had any claim.\n\nThe establishment of this noble institution consists of a governor, who is a flag-officer in the navy, lieutenant-governor, four captains, eight lieutenants, all resident within the hospital. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURER\">treasurer</a>, auditor, paymaster of pensions, secretary, clerk of the check, two chaplains, two physicians, three surgeons, two dispensers, steward, clerk of the works, and several clerks. The number of in-pensioners is about 3000, and the number of nurses 180, all of whom must be the widows of naval seamen, and under the age of 45 years at the time of admission.\n\nUnder the naval administration of Earl Grey, the following officers were added to the out-pensions of Greenwich Hospital, to be selected by the Admiralty according to their respective claims on the service:\n\n| Officer                  | Per Year |\n|--------------------------|----------|\n| Post-Captains            | L. 80    |\n| Commanders               |          |\n| Lieutenants              |          |\n\nin addition to their half-pay.\n\nThe out-pensions to seamen were first established in 1763, by act of 3d Geo. III. ch. 16, in consequence of which 1400 out-pensioners were appointed, at L. 7 per annum each, after undergoing an examination at the Admiralty as to their claims.\n\nAt the close of the long revolutionary war, the applications became so numerous, and the claims of the seamen who had been wounded, or worn out in the service, so strongly grounded in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a> and justice, that it became necessary to adopt a scale of pensions, and to establish certain rules and regulations, by which seamen of his Majesty's fleet and royal marines should be remunerated for wounds or hurts, debility, and length of service. The following are the regulations:\n\n**For Wounds, Hurts, or Debility.**\n\nEvery seaman, landman, boy, or royal marine, wounded or hurt in his Majesty's service, is to receive a sum of money from the Chest of Chatham in the nature of smart money, as heretofore; and also be entitled to a pension proportioned to his wounds or hurts, of not less than sixpence a day, and not more than one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHILLING\">shilling</a> and sixpence a day. For sickness or debility, after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> years' service (and under special circumstances before that period), of not less than fivepence a day, nor more than threepence, according as he may appear capable of assisting himself. Beyond fourteen, and less than twenty-one years' service, not less than eightpence, nor more than one shilling and threepence. After twenty-one years' service, one shilling and sixpence a day.\n\n**For Length of Service.**\n\nEvery able seaman, discharged on the reduction of the fleet, who has served faithfully fourteen years, and less than twenty-one, is entitled to a pension of one halfpenny a day for every year of such service. Twenty-one years' service entitles him to a free discharge, and a pension of one shilling a day; and if he may choose to continue in the service, one halfpenny a day in addition for every additional year of service.\n\nOrdinary seamen and landmen, entitled to four-fifths and three-fifths of able seamen's pensions. The privates of royal marines are considered as ordinary\nseamen. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> petty officers, in addition to the above rates of pension, are entitled to one half-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PENNY\">penny</a> a day for the number of years' service; the inferior petty officers to one farthing.\n\nAll the above mentioned pensions may be forfeited by misconduct, by desertion, and by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> of a Court-Martial. Also, by neglecting, or omitting, to attend at such port, or place, and at such time as shall, in time of war, or in prospect of a war, be appointed for the assembling of the pensioners, by the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty.\n\nTo this noble institution is appended an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASYLUM\">asylum</a>, for the maintenance and education of the children of officers and seamen of his Majesty's naval service.\n\nThe Naval Asylum was originally instituted by the Patriotic Fund and private subscriptions, and afterwards established at Greenwich, by warrant under the King's sign-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANUAL\">manual</a>, dated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1818, appointing the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to be commissioners and governors, who, with twenty-four directors, were to superintend and manage the same. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> was, the maintenance and education of a certain number of orphans and other children of the non-commissioned officers, seamen, and marines of the royal navy. As it was manifest, however, that this establishment, so contiguous to the hospital of Greenwich, could be managed without inconvenience by the commissioners and directors of that hospital, under a more effective and economical system, his Majesty was pleased, by his warrant of January 1821, to annul the former warrant, and to vest the superintendence and internal management of the said asylum in the commissioners and governors of Greenwich Hospital.\n\nThe two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a> of Greenwich Hospital, and the Naval Asylum, and the funds thereof, are now therefore incorporated. The internal management is confided to the Board of Directors, and one of the captains of the hospital is intrusted with the general superintendence. A chaplain, and proper schoolmasters, schoolmistresses, matron, with inferior assistants, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a>, with moderate salaries, reside in the building. The number of children maintained and educated in the Institution are:\n\n| In the Boys' Upper School | 200 |\n|---------------------------|----|\n| Ditto, Lower School       | 600 |\n| Girls                     | 200 |\n\nIn the whole, 1000\n\nTo the upper school no boys are admitted but the sons of seamen and marines, slain, drowned, or dead; of pensioners in the hospital; of seamen disabled, past their labour, or otherwise objects of charity; of officers in the navy and marines, on the production of a required certificate of poverty. The age of admission from eleven to twelve; the continuance in the school three years, when they are bound apprentices to the merchant service. Presentations by the directors in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROTATION\">rotation</a>.\n\nThe boys and girls of the lower school are the children of seamen and marines of the naval service, admitted by the Board of Directors, giving a preference to orphans.

A clergyman named Bernard showed him great kindness, and taught him some of the higher <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a> at an early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, so that at fourteen he was able to calculate and delineate an eclipse of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>. He had been intended for some commercial employment; but he preferred the pursuit of literature in any form: he attended the lectures of Dr Williams, and afterwards those of Dr Winthrop, the astronomer, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">College</a> of \"Harvard;\" and while he was still a stripling, he was established in the temporary occupation of a village schoolmaster; hoping, however, for an early opportunity to engage in some more agreeable employment: and at nineteen, he was fortunate enough to obtain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> of Mrs Rolfe, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of Mr Walker, a clergyman, who had been employed with considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> in conducting some public business. For a year <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> two he lived retired and happy: but having obtained a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJOR\">Major</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITIA\">Militia</a> from the Governor of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a>, together with some other distinctions, of a civil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, he was consequently led to adhere to the party of the Royalists, and he was soon obliged, by the success of the Independent forces, to take refuge at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOSTON\">Boston</a>, then occupied by the English troops. It was in November 1779 that he secretly quitted his residence, leaving his wife, whom he never <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> again, and his infant daughter, who joined him twenty years after in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>.\n\nHe was employed to raise a regiment for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">King</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>; but when Boston was evacuated, in 1776, he was sent with some important dispatches to England. Here he soon acquired the confidence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> George Germaine, then Colonial Secretary of State, and was appointed Secretary of the province.\nThompson of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEORGIA\">Georgia</a>, though he never exercised the office; but he remained attached to that department of the public service.\n\nIn 1777 he commenced his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAREER\">career</a> as an experimental philosopher, by employing his leisure hours, during a visit to Bath, in making some experiments on the cohesive strength of different substances: and upon his return to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, he communicated them to Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a> Banks, with whom he formed an intimate acquaintance, which he kept up throughout the remainder of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. In 1778 he was admitted a Fellow of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a>, and he made in that year his first experiments on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a>. In order to pursue these experiments, he went, in 1779, on board of the Victory of 110 guns, commanded by his friend Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> Hardy. He passed the whole of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAMPAIGN\">campaign</a> on board of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a>; and the results of the observations, that he then made, furnished the materials of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> which he contributed to Stalkart's Treatise on Naval <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">Architecture</a>. He added to it a code of signals for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">Navy</a>, which was not published. In 1780 he was appointed Under Secretary of State, and he was constantly employed, for some little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, in the office on the business of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>. He succeeded, by means of his American friends and agents, in raising a regiment of cavalry, called the King's American Dragoons, of which he was appointed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">Lieutenant</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLONEL\">Colonel</a> Commandant; and this success induced him to go to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a> to serve with it. At <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARLESTOWN\">Charlestown</a> he was entrusted with the command of the remains of the cavalry of the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>;\u2014he speedily restored the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a> of the corps, and gained its confidence and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a>: he often led it on against the enemy, and frequently with considerable success. He proceeded, in 1782, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NEW_YORK\">New <a c</a>lass=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a>, where he assumed the command of his own regiment, having received the colours from the hand of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">Prince</a> William Henry, now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">Duke</a> of Clarence. In the autumn, General Clinton was succeeded by Sir Guy Carleton, whose friendship and confidence he speedily obtained: his regiment was recruited from the fragments of several others, and he was sent for the winter to Huntingdon in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">Long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">Island</a>. He was chosen, in 1783, to conduct the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of Jamaica, which was then threatened by the enemy: but the general peace superseded the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of the intended expedition.\n\nAfter his return to England, he made great efforts in the cause of the loyalist officers, and he was successful in persuading the Ministry to make a proper provision for them: he was himself made a full Colonel, upon the recommendation of General Carleton, only two years after his appointment as Lieutenant-Colonel. He had acquired a strong predilection for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> life, and was desirous of being sent with his regiment to the East Indies: and when the regiment was reduced, he wished to serve with the Austrians in a war which was then meditated against the Turks.\n\nWith this view he left England in September 1783, and on his passage to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOULOGNE\">Boulogne</a>, he had an agreeable ship-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATE\">mate</a> in the person of Gibbon, the historian, who did <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> to his merits as a \"soldier, philosopher, and statesman.\" At Strasburg, his appearance on the parade in his uniform excited the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of the present King of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAVARIA\">Bavaria</a>, then Prince Maximilian of Deux Ponts, who invited him to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>, and being delighted with the accuracy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of his military knowledge, gave him a strong recommendation to his uncle, then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTOR\">Elector</a>: and instead of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> or two, as he had intended, he staid a fortnight at Munich. He was also very cordially received at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIENNA\">Vienna</a>, and passed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the winter there; but the war against the Turks not taking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, he went by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a> and the Tyrol again to Munich, where he arrived in the winter of 1784; and being formally invited by the Elector to enter his service, he went to London to ask leave to accept the proposal; and it was granted him, together with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-KNIGHTHOOD\">Knighthood</a>. On his return to Bavaria, he was made a Colonel of cavalry, and Aide-de-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAMP\">Camp</a>-General to the Elector. The first four years of his residence at Munich were principally employed in acquiring information, and in preparing his plans of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REFORM\">reform</a>: and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> his physical researches. He made his first experiments on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> in 1786, during a journey to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANNHEIM\">Mannheim</a>. In 1785 he was made Chamberlain to the Elector, and member of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ACADEMIES\">Academies</a> of Munich and of Mannheim: in 1786 he received from the King of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLAND\">Poland</a> the Order of St Stanislaus; in 1787 he took a journey to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BERLIN\">Berlin</a>, and was made a member of the Academy of Sciences of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a>: in 1788 he was appointed Major-General of the Bavarian cavalry, and Privy Counsellor of State; and he was placed at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of the War Department, in order to pursue his plans for the improvement of the army.\n\nIt was in 1789 that he established the House of Industry at Mannheim: he founded also the Military Academy of Munich; he improved the military <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-POLICE\">Police</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>; he formed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">Schools</a> of Industry for the wives and children of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a>; and he embellished the city by a new arrangement of the public gardens. The House of Industry at Munich, which he has described at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> in his Essays, was founded in 1790: and from this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> may be dated the total abolition of mendicity in Bavaria. His exertions were rewarded by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of Lieutenant-General of the Bavarian armies, and by a regiment of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTILLERY\">artillery</a>. In 1791 he was created a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> of the Holy Roman Empire, and obtained the Order of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">White</a> Eagle.\n\nHis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> having suffered from constant application, he obtained permission to take a journey into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWITZERLAND\">Switzerland</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, and he returned to Bavaria in 1794. He had a severe illness at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPLES\">Naples</a>, and he was not sufficiently recovered, upon his return, to resume his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> duties; but he employed himself in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> the first five of his Essays. In 1795, he came to England in order to publish the Essays, and in hopes of exciting the public attention to the importance of attempting a similar reform among the lowest orders in Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>. He went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUBLIN\">Dublin</a> in 1796, to pay a visit to Lord Pelham, now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARL\">Earl</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHICHESTER\">Chichester</a>, then Secretary of State for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>; and he was of essential service in the arrangement of several of the public institutions of that country. He\nwas made a Member of the Royal Irish Academy, and of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts; and he received, after having left the country, the public thanks of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">Grand</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JURY\">Jury</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> of Dublin, and of the Lord Mayor of that city, as well as of the Lord Lieutenant at the head of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">Government</a>. Upon his return to London, he superintended some improvements at the Foundling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">Hospital</a>, and presented several models of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACHINES\">machines</a> and implements to the Board of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">Agriculture</a>: and he established two prizes, for discoveries relating to Heat and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">Light</a>, by placing two sums of L.1000 in the British and in the American funds, to be adjudged biennially, for Europe by the Royal Society of London, and for America by the American Academy of Sciences.\n\nHe was recalled to Bavaria by the exigencies of the moment, which were such as to cause the Elector to take refuge in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAXONY\">Saxony</a>; General Moreau having advanced with his army to the confines of Bavaria. After the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> of Friedberg, Count Rumford was left in command of the Bavarian army, with instructions to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> according to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-DISCRETION\">discretion</a> under the circumstances that might occur; and his firmness was such, as to prevent either the Austrians or the French from entering Munich. On the Elector's return, he was placed at the head of the department of the general police of Bavaria. His exertions in this office were such, as to impair the state of his health, and by way of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> retirement, he was sent to England in the capacity of Envoy Extraordinary and Minister <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PLENIPOTENTIARY\">Plenipotentiary</a>: but being a subject of the King of England, he was judged incapable of being received as the diplomatic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a> of a foreign <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">court</a>, and he, therefore, continued to live in England as a private individual.\n\nHe was very active about this time in projecting and superintending the establishment of the Royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">Institution</a> of Great Britain, which was more particularly intended for the application of science to the conveniences and comforts of civil and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> life, but which has been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> less successful in giving opportunity and facility to some of the most refined researches in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">chemistry</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\">natural <a class=\"</a>xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> that have distinguished the age, than in serving as a medium for making the treasures of science accessible to the less studious part of the public, and as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> for a variety of other similar undertakings in different parts of the world.\n\nCount Rumford was soon afterwards officially invited to America by the government of the United <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">States</a>, with an offer of an honourable establishment in a public situation; but he considered it as inconsistent with his engagements in Europe to accept the proposal. In the autumn of 1800, when he went to Scotland, a visit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a> was paid him by the magistrates of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>: he was consulted respecting the abolition of mendicity, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> that he recommended were speedily executed with complete success. He was made an honorary member of the Royal Society, and of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh; and he received a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> snuff box as a compliment for his assistance in reforming the culinary establishment of Heriot's Hospital.\n\nAfter so active and diversified a career, it was not to be expected that he would be satisfied with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONOTONY\">monotony</a> of a permanent residence in London: he was so accustomed to labour for the attainment of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>, that when the object itself was completely within his reach, and the labour was ended, the prospect, which ought to have been uniformly bright, became spontaneously clouded, or even the serenity became unenjoyable for want of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">clouds</a> to afford a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTRAST\">contrast</a>. He had fitted up a small house at Brompton, with every contrivance for comfort and convenience that could render it fit for the abode of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITALITY\">hospitality</a> and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a>; and the arrangements are fully described in the Biblioth\u00e8que Britannique of his friend, Professor Pictet; but after all he never was known to give a single entertainment in it. The enthusiasm excited by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a> of some of his inventions had subsided, and he was even mortified by becoming, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> with the most elevated personages of the country, the object of the impertinent attacks of a popular satirist. It was partly, however, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> not entirely, the superiority of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> of France, that determined him to remove to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> of 1802: he went in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> to Munich, and the following year he made a tour in Switzerland and in Bavaria, accompanied by Mr. Lavoisier, whom he married soon after their return: but their habits were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a> with matrimonial comfort, and they separated soon after; Count Rumford retiring to Auteuil, about four miles from Paris, where he occupied a house which had formerly belonged to Helvetius and to Cabanis, while his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a> continued to live in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a>. His latter years were passed almost wholly in solitude; he saw only his neighbour Mr Caneleux, Mr Underwood, and a Mr Parker, an American: he did not even attend the sittings of the Institute, though he had been made one of its eight foreign associates some time before, and always retained a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> esteem for its secretary Cuvier, and for some others of its members. His income was abundantly sufficient for his own expenses, having obtained from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> of the King of Bavaria a pension of L.1200 a year; and he was allowed by Bonaparte to remain unmolested, though a British subject, when it was found that he had no intercourse with society, amusing himself principally in walking about his garden, and in a solitary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAME\">game</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BILLIARDS\">billiards</a>. He had so completely persuaded himself, in the latter part of his life, of the great superiority of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHEELS\">wheels</a> above narrow ones, that he drove about the streets of Paris in a broad wheel-ed chariot; and having rediscovered, after Professor Leslie, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> bodies radiate more heat than others, he wore, in the winter, a white hat and a white coat, in order to economize the heat of his person. \"These peculiarities, and a peremptory unyielding disposition,\" says one of his biographers, \"were the causes that set him apart from social intercourse, and in all his connexions in life, seem to have rendered him less the object of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> attachment than of esteem for his talents and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a>.\" He was about to return to England when he died, the 21st August 1814, leaving only one daughter, who still resides in his house at Brompton.\n\n1. Count Rumford's first publication appears to have\nbeen the chapter on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">Marine</a> Artillery that he furnished to Stalkart's Treatise on Naval Architecture, 1780.\n\n2. New Experiments on Gunpowder, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">Description</a> of an Epronvette. Phil. Trans. 1781. P. 230. The effect of the powder on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> was measured by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOIL\">recoil</a> of the piece, with a correction deduced from the recoil when the piece was empty. It was observed to be sooner heated when fired without ball than with it. The force of the powder is made at least 1300 atmospheres, upon Robins's principles.\n\n3. New Experiments upon Heat. Phil. Trans. 1786. P. 273. These experiments relate principally to the conducting powers of various mediums for heat; but the results are unavoidably complicated with the effects of radiation, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VACUUM\">vacuum</a> is supposed to possess a conducting power more than half as great as that of common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>.\n\n4. Experiments on the Production of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEPHLOGISTICATED\">Dephlogisticated</a> Air from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">Water</a> with various Substances. Phil. Trans. 1787. P. 84. These experiments tend to show that the air obtained, by Priestley and Ingenhousz, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> under water, was derived rather from the water itself than from the substances immersed in it.\n\n5. Experiments made to determine the Positive and Relative Quantities of Moisture absorbed from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">Atmosphere</a> by Various Substances. P. 240. He finds that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a> is more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSORBENT\">absorbent</a> of moisture than any other substance compared with it; and hence explains the supposed advantage of woollen worn next the skin.\n\n6. Experiments on Heat. Phil. Trans. 1792. P. 48. The author attributes the effect of loose substances in obstructing the passage of heat to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> for air, and to their impeding its circulation; and he supposes this to be the only manner in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a> communicate heat.\n\n7.

This force he supposes to amount to between 20,000 and 50,000 atmospheres, instead of 10,000, as Bernoulli computed it; but he makes a great mistake in supposing that the whole of the water which can possibly be contained in the gunpowder would be sufficient to furnish as much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEAM\">steam</a> as would be required, since steam, under a pressure of 20,000 atmospheres, must be considerably more dense than water itself.

The capacity of the chips of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> afforded by friction in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BORING\">boring</a> a cannon, was found not to differ from that of the iron in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> state: hence it is inferred, that the heat could not have been furnished by them, and that it must probably have been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a>. Mr Thompson Haldalt afterwards repeated the experiment under circumstances still more decisive; and Sir Humphry Davy showed that two pieces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ICE\">ice</a> rubbed together, in a room below the freezing temperature, would melt each other.\n\n11. Inquiry concerning the Chemical Properties that have been attributed to Light. P. 449.

It implies, first, a knowledge of the laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAVITATION\">gravitation</a>, concerned in the determination of the forces immediately acting on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, and of the periods and distances of the celestial bodies, which modify the magnitudes and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a> of these forces; and secondly, of the hydraulic theories of the resistances of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a>, and of the motions of waves and undulations of all kinds, and of the theoretical determination of the form and density of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, as well as of the geographical observation of the breadth and depth of the seas and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>, which occupy a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of its surface; so that the whole subject affords abundant scope for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of mathematical skill, and still more for the employment of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> and contrivance, which enables its possessor to supersede the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of prolix computations, wherever they can be avoided.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of the tides is naturally divided into several periods in which its different departments have been progressively cultivated. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>, from the times of Posidonius and Pytheas, and the moderns before Newton, were contented with observing the general dependence of the tides on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>, as following her transit at an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> of about two hours, and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> increase and decrease not only every fortnight, but also in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUNAR\">lunar</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of about eight years; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> step consisted in the determination of the magnitude and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of the solar and lunar forces, by which the general effects of the tides were shown, in the Principia, to be the necessary consequences of these forces; the third great point was the demonstration of Maclaurin, that the form of an elliptic spheroid affords an equilibrium under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the disturbing forces concerned; while the further <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">contemporary</a> illustrations of the subject by Euler and Bernoulli, though they afforded some useful details, involved <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> new principle that can be put in competition with Maclaurin's demonstration: the fourth important step was made by Laplace, who separated the consideration of the form, affording <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> equilibrium, from that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> occasioned by the continual change of that form, while former theorists had taken it for granted, that the surface of the sea very speedily assumed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of a fluid acted by similar forces, but remaining perfectly at rest, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> assuming instantly the form in question. Laplace's computation is however limited to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of an imaginary ocean, of a certain variable depth,\nassumed for the convenience of calculation, rather than for any other reason. Dr Thomas Young has extended Laplace's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of considering the phenomena to the more general case of an ocean covering a part only of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-EARTH_S\">earth's</a> surface, and more or less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> in its form; he has also attempted to comprehend in his calculations the precise effects of hydraulic friction on the times and magnitudes of the tides. As far as the resistance may be supposed to vary in the simple ratio of the velocity, Dr Young's theory is sufficiently complete, and explains several of the peculiarities which are otherwise paradoxical in their appearance; but there still remains a difficulty to be combated with respect to the effects of a resistance <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> of the velocity, and this, it is hoped, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be in great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> removed in the present article, which, however, from the space that is allotted to it, must be considered rather as a supplementary fragment than as a complete treatise. It will be divided into four sections: The first relating to the contemporaneous progress of the tides through the different seas and oceans, as collected from observation only; the second to the magnitude of the disturbing forces tending to change the form of the surface of the earth and sea: the third to the theory of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> vibrations with resistance; and the fourth to the application of this theory to the progress and successive magnitudes of the tides, as observable at any one port.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">Sect</a>. I.\u2014Of the Progress of Contemporary Tides, as inferred from the times of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">High</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">Water</a> in Different Ports.\n\nThe least theoretical consideration, relating to the tides, is that of their progress through the different parts of the ocean, and of its dependent seas. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a> of these ought to be very completely attainable from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> observation, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of high water had been accurately observed at a sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of ports throughout the world; and, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, if the earth were covered in all parts with a fluid of great and nearly uniform depth, the tides of this fluid would be so regular, that a very few observations would be sufficient to enable us to deduce the whole of the phenomena from theory, and to trace the great waves, which would follow the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> and moon round the globe, so as to make its circuit in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, without any material deviation from uniformity of motion and succession. Having collected, for the actual state of the sea and continents, an abundant store of accurate observations of the precise time of high water with regard to the sun and moon, for every part of the surface, and having arranged them in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> according to the order of their occurrence, as expressed in the time of any one meridian, we might then suppose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> to be drawn on a terrestrial globe, through all the places of observation, in the same order; and these lines would indicate, supposing the places to be sufficiently numerous, so as to furnish a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of tides very nearly contemporary, the directions of the great waves, to which that of the progress of the tides in succession must be perpendicular. If, however, we actually make such an attempt, we shall soon find how utterly inadequate the observations that have been recorded are, for the purpose of tracing the forms of the lines of contemporary high water with accuracy or with certainty, although they are abundantly sufficient to show the impossibility of deducing the time of high water at any given <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> from the Newtonian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>, or even from that of Laplace, without some direct observation. It might at least be supposed very easy to enumerate the existing observations, scanty as they may be, in a correct order; but there are a number of instances in which it is wholly uncertain whether the time observed at a given port relates to the tide of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> in the open ocean, or to that of the preceding evening; this inconvenience may, however, in some measure be remedied, by inserting such places in two different parts of the table, at the distance of 12\u00bd hours from each other. The following Table is the result of the best approximation that could be obtained in this manner, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> lines having been partially traced on a map of the world, in order to afford some little direction to the correct insertion of the times of high water without the material <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> of half a day. The three great natural divisions of the Atlantic, the Pacific, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> Oceans, are distinguished into different columns, and some of the places, which seem to form separate systems of tides, are still further subdivided in a similar manner; but this arrangement may easily be neglected by those who are inclined to question its propriety.

Secondly, That the southern extremity of the line advances as it passes the Cape of Good Hope, so that it turns up towards the Atlantic, which it enters obliquely, so as to arrive, nearly at the same moment, at the Island of Ascension, and at the Island of Martin Vaz, or of the Trinity. Thirdly, After several irregularities about the Cape Verd <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">Islands</a>, and in the West Indies, the line appears to run nearly east and west from St Domingo to Cape Blanco, the tides proceeding due northwards; and then, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> still more to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>, the line seems to run N. W. and S. E., till at last the tide runs almost due east up the British Channel, and round the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> of Scotland into the Northern Ocean, sending off a branch <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the North Sea to meet the succeeding tide at the mouth of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THAMES\">Thames</a>. Fourthly, Towards Cape <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORN\">Horn</a> again there is a good deal of irregularity; the hour lines are much compressed between South Georgia and Terra del <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUEGO\">Fuego</a>, perhaps on account of the shallower water about the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol9.html#article-FALKLAND_ISLANDS\"><a class=\"xref\" </a>href=\"vol8.html#article-FALKLAND\">Falkland</a> Islands and South Shetland.\n\nIn the fifth place, At the entrance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PACIFIC_OCEAN\">Pacific Ocean</a>, the tides seem to advance very rapidly to New Zealand and Easter Island; but here it appears to be uncertain whether the line of contemporary tide should be drawn nearly N. and S. from the Gallapagos to Terra del Fuego, or N. E. and S. W. from Easter Island to New Zealand; or whether both these partial directions are correct: but on each side of this line there are great irregularities, and many more observations are wanting before the progress of the tide can be traced with any tolerable accuracy, among the multitudinous islands of the Pacific Ocean, where it might have been hoped that the phenomena would have been observed in their greatest simplicity, and in their most genuine form.\n\nLastly, Of the Indian Ocean the northern parts exhibit great irregularities, and among the rest they afford the singular phenomenon observed by Halley in the Port of Tonkin, and explained by Newton in the Principia: the southern parts are only remarkable for having the hour lines of contemporary tides considerably crowded between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NEW_HOLLAND\">New <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a> and the Cape of Good Hope, as if the seas of these parts were shallower than elsewhere.\n\nThese inferences respecting the progress of the tides are not advanced as the result of any particular theory, nor even as the only ones that might possibly be deduced from the table: thus the supposition that the direction in which the tides advance must be perpendicular to the hour lines of contemporary tides, is not by any means absolutely without exception, since a quadrangular lake, with steep shores in the direction of the meridian, would have the times of high water the same for every point of its eastern or western halves respectively, and there could be no correctly defined direction of the hour lines in such a case. But if any portion of the sea could be considered as constituting such a lake, its properties would be detected by a sufficient number of observations of high water, and the existing table does not appear to indicate any such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> that require to be otherwise distinguished than as partial irregularities. There may also be some doubt respecting the propriety of the addition of 12\u00bd hours that has been made to the time of high water in the north eastern parts of the Atlantic: but it seems extremely improbable that the same tide should travel north easterly into the English Channel and into the Northern Ocean, and at the same time westerly across the Atlantic, as it must be supposed to do, if it were considered as primarily originating in the neighbourhood of the Bay of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISCAY\">Biscay</a>; on the other hand, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENDING\">bending</a> of the great wave round the continents of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> seems to be very like the sort of refraction which takes place on every shelving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> with respect to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> waves, which, whatever may have been their primitive origin, acquire always, as they spread, a direction more and more nearly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to that of the coast which they are approaching: and the suppositions which have been here advanced respecting the succession of the tides in different ports, allowing for the effect of a multitude of irregularities proceeding from partial causes, appear to be by far the most probable that can be immediately inferred from the table, at least in its present state of imperfection.\nSect. II.\u2014Of the Disturbing Forces that occasion the Tides.\n\nSince the phenomena of the tides, with regard to their progress through the different oceans and seas, as they exist in the actual state of the earth's surface, appear to be too complicated to allow us to hope to reduce them to computation by means of any general theory, we must, in the next place, confine our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to the order in which the successive changes occur in any single port, and having determined the exact magnitude of the forces, that tend to change the form of the surface of the ocean at different periods, and having also examined the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the vibratory motions, of which the sea, or any given portion of it, would be susceptible, in the simplest cases, after the cessation of the disturbing forces; we must afterwards endeavour to combine these causes, so as to adapt the result to the successive phenomena, which are observed at different times in any one port.\n\nTheorem A. (\"E.\"\u2014Nich. Journ. Jul. 1813.) The disturbing force of a distant attractive body, urging a particle of a fluid in the direction of the surface of a sphere, varies as the sine of twice the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ALTITUDE\">altitude</a> of the body.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a>, exerted by the sun and moon on all the separate particles composing the earth, is exactly compensated by the centrifugal force derived from the earth's annual revolution round the sun, and from its monthly revolution round the common centre of gravity of the earth and moon: but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of the attractions, exerted at different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of the earth, must necessarily produce a disturbing force, depending on the angular position of the point with regard to the sun or moon, since the centrifugal force is the same for them all; the disturbing force being constantly variable for any one point, and depending partly on the difference of the distance of the point from the mean distance, and partly on the difference of the direction of the luminary, from its direction with respect to the centre, or, in other words, on its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARALLAX\">parallax</a>.\n\nIt will be most convenient for computation to consider both these forces, for a sphere covered with a fluid, as referred to the direction of the circumference of the sphere, which will differ but little from that of the fluid; and it will appear that both of them, when reduced to this direction, will vary as the product of the sine and cosine of the distance from the diameter pointing to the luminary, that is as half the sine of twice the altitude: for the difference of gravitation, which depends on the difference of the distance, will always vary as the sine of the distance from the bisecting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> perpendicular to that diameter, and will be reduced to the direction of the surface, by diminishing it in the ratio of the cosine to the radius: and the effect of the difference of direction will be originally proportional to the sine of the distance from the diameter, and will in like manner be expressed, when reduced, by the product of the sine and cosine; and each force, thus reduced, will be equal, where it is greatest, to half of its primitive magnitude, since $\\sin \\cos 45^\\circ = \\frac{1}{2}$. \"Thus, the gravitation towards the moon at the earth's surface, is to the gravitation towards the earth as 1 to 70 times the square of 60, or to 256 217: and the former disturbing force is to the whole of this as 2 to 60 at the point nearest the moon, and the second as 1 to 60 at the equatorial plane; and the sum of both, reduced to the direction of the circumference, where greatest, as 3 to 121; that is, to the whole force of the earth's gravitation, as 1 to 10 334 000; and in a similar manner we find, that the whole disturbing force of the sun is to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of the particles as 1 to 25 736 000.\" Or, if we call the moon's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> parallax $p$, and substitute $\\frac{1}{p}$ for the distance, the whole of the lunar disturbing force in the direction of the surface will be $\\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{F^2}{70} = \\frac{3}{140} F^2$; or, if $z$ be the moon's zenith distance from any point of the surface, $f = \\frac{3}{70} F^2 \\sin \\cos z$.\n\nTheorem B. [F]. The inclination of the surface of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a> spheroid, slightly elliptical, to that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSCRIBED\">inscribed</a> sphere, varies as the sine of twice the distance from the circle of contact; and a particle resting on any part of it, without friction, may be held in equilibrium by the attraction of a distant body, [situated in the direction of the axis.]\n\nIf a sphere be inscribed in an oblong spheroid, the elevation of the spheroid above the sphere must obviously be proportional, when measured in a direction parallel to the axis of the spheroid, to the ordinate of the sphere, that is, to the sine of the distance from its equator, and when reduced to a direction perpendicular to the surface of the sphere, it must be proportional to the square of that sine; and the tangent of the inclination to the surface of the sphere, which is equal to the fluxion of the elevation divided by that of the circumference, must be expressed by twice the continual product of the sine, the cosine, and the ellipticity, or rather the greater elevation, $e$, the radius being considered as unity: so that the elevation $e$ will also express the tangent of the inclination where it is greatest, since $2 \\sin \\cos 45^\\circ = 1$; and the inclination will be everywhere as the product of the sine and cosine.\n\nIf, therefore, the density of the elevated parts be considered as evanescent, and their attraction be neglected, there will be an equilibrium, when the ellipticity is to the radius as the disturbing force to the whole force of gravitation: for each particle, situated on the surface, will be actuated by a disturbing force tending towards the pole of the spheroid, precisely equal and contrary to that portion of the force of gravitation which urges it in the opposite direction down the inclined surface. Hence, if the density of the sea were supposed inconsiderable, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> with that of the earth, the radius being 20 839 000 feet, the greatest height of a lunar tide in equilibrium would be 2.0166 feet, and that of a solar tide .8097: that is, supposing the moon's horizontal parallax about 57', and her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> $\\frac{1}{12}$ of that of the earth.\nTheorem C. [G]. The disturbing attraction of the thin shell, contained between a spheroidal surface and its inscribed sphere, varies in the same proportion as the inclination of the surface, and is to the relative force of gravity depending on that inclination, as three times the density of the shell, to five times that of the sphere.\n\nWe may imagine the surface of the sphere to be divided by an infinite number of parallel and equidistant circles, beginning from any point at which a gravitating particle is situated, and we may suppose all these circles to be divided by a plane perpendicular to the meridian of the point, and consequently bisecting the equatorial plane of the spheroid: it is obvious, that, if the elevations on the opposite sides of the plane be equal at the corresponding points of each circle, no lateral force will be produced; but when they are unequal, the excess of the elevated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> on one side above that of the other side will produce a disturbing or lateral force. Now, the elevation being everywhere as the square of the distance \\( x \\) from the equatorial plane, we may call it \\( e^2x^2 \\), and the difference, corresponding to any point of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEMICIRCLE\">semicircle</a>, which is the nearer to the pole of the spheroid, will be \\( e(x-x') = e(x+x')(x-x') \\). But \\( x+x' \\) is always twice the distance of the centre of the supposed circle from the equatorial plane; and the distance of this centre from that of the sphere will be \\( c \\cos \\psi \\), if \\( \\psi \\) be the angular distance of the circle from its pole; and calling \\( \\phi \\) the distance of this pole, from the equatorial plane of the spheroid, the distance in question will be \\( \\cos \\psi \\sin \\phi \\), and \\( x+x'=2\\cos \\psi \\sin \\phi \\); and the difference \\( x-x' \\) is twice the actual sine of the arc \\( \\psi \\) in the supposed circle, that is, twice the natural sine, reduced in the ratio of unit to the radius of this circle, which is \\( \\sin \\psi \\), reduced again to a direction perpendicular to the equatorial plane; whence \\( x-x'=2\\sin \\psi \\cos \\psi \\cos \\phi \\): and \\( x^2-x'^2=4\\sin \\psi \\cos \\psi \\sin \\phi \\cos \\phi \\). Hence it follows, that in different positions of the gravitating particle, the effective elevation at each point of the surface, similarly situated with respect to it, is as the product of the sine and cosine of its angular distance \\( \\phi \\) from the equatorial plane, the other quantities concerned remaining the same in all positions. But the inclination of the surface of the spheroid, as well as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> disturbing force, varies in the same proportion of the product of the sine and cosine of the distance \\( \\phi \\): consequently, the sum of this disturbing attraction and the original force will also vary as the inclination of the surface, and may be in equilibrium with the tendency to descend towards the centre, provided that the ellipticity be duly commensurate to the density of the elevated parts.\n\nNow, in order to find the actual magnitude of the disturbing attraction for a shell of given density, we must compute the fluent of \\( \\frac{4}{3}e \\sin \\psi d\\psi \\sin \\cos \\psi \\sin \\phi \\), reduced first according to the distance and direction of each particle from the given gravitating particle; and we must compare the fluent with \\( \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\), the attraction of the whole sphere at the distance of the radius or unity. But for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> \\( \\psi \\), the portion of the force acting in the common direction of \\( \\sin \\psi \\) is to the whole attraction at the same distance as \\( \\sin \\psi \\) to 1, so that the attractive force of any point of the semicircle will be \\( 4e \\sin \\psi \\cos \\psi \\sin \\phi \\), and its fluxion will be as \\( \\sin \\psi \\cos \\phi \\), of which the fluent is \\( \\frac{4}{3}e \\sin \\psi \\cos \\phi \\), or when \\( \\psi=180^\\circ \\), \\( \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\), and \\( \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\sin \\psi \\) will express the effect of the disturbing attraction of the semicircles, of which \\( \\sin \\psi \\) is the radius, reduced to the direction of the middle point, of which the distance is \\( 2\\sin \\psi \\): the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> for this distance is as its square to 1; and for the direction, as the distance to \\( \\sin \\psi \\), together making the ratio of \\( \\frac{\\sin \\psi}{8\\sin \\psi} \\), and the ultimate fluxion of the force will be \\( 2e\\pi \\sin \\psi \\cos \\phi \\sin \\cos \\phi \\)\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\sin \\psi}{8\\sin \\psi} \\cdot d\\psi = 2e\\pi \\frac{\\sin \\psi \\cos \\phi}{8\\sin \\psi} \\sin \\cos \\phi \\]\n\nbut \\( \\sin \\psi = 2\\sin \\cos \\phi \\), and the fraction becomes\n\n\\[ \\frac{8\\sin \\psi \\cos \\phi}{8\\sin \\psi} \\cdot \\cos \\phi = \\cos \\phi \\cdot \\cos \\phi = \\cos \\phi \\cdot \\cos \\phi \\cdot (\\cos^2 \\phi - \\sin^2 \\phi) = \\cos^2 \\phi - \\cos^2 \\phi = 2\\cos^2 \\phi \\]\n\nNow, taking the fluent from \\( \\psi=0 \\) to \\( \\psi=180^\\circ \\), we have \\( 2f \\cos \\phi \\cdot 2d\\psi = \\frac{8}{3} \\cdot \\frac{4}{5} \\)\n\nand \\( f \\cos \\phi \\cdot 2d\\psi = \\frac{4}{3} \\cdot \\frac{4}{5} \\) (Art. Fluents, n. 361, 359): the difference being \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\cdot \\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{4}{5} \\), whence the fluent of the force is found \\( 2e\\pi \\sin \\cos \\phi \\times \\frac{4}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{n} \\), calling the density of the fluid \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\); or, where it is greatest, \\( \\sin \\cos \\phi \\) being \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\cdot \\frac{4}{5} \\), while the attraction of the sphere itself is \\( \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\), which is to \\( \\frac{4}{5}\\pi \\) as 1 to \\( \\frac{3}{5}\\pi \\); and since the elevation \\( e \\) expresses also the maximum of the relative force of gravity depending on the tangent of the inclination (Theorem B), it is obvious that the disturbing attraction \\( \\frac{3}{5}e \\) must be to the relative force \\( e \\), as \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) to 5.\n\nCorollary 1. If \\( n=1 \\), as in a homogeneous fluid sphere or spheroid, the disturbing attraction becomes \\( \\frac{3}{5}e \\), and this attraction, together with the primitive force \\( f \\), must express the actual elevation \\( e \\), or \\( \\frac{3}{5}e + f = e \\), whence \\( f = \\frac{2}{5}e \\), and \\( e = \\frac{5}{2}f \\), giving 2.024 and 5.042 for the magnitude of the solar and lunar tides, when \\( f=.8097 \\) and 2.0166 respectively. But this is obviously far from the actual state of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a>.\nCorollary 2. Supposing \\( n = 5.4 \\) (See Journ. R. I. Apr. 1820), we have \\( \\frac{3e}{27} + f = e \\), and \\( c = \\frac{27}{24}f = \\frac{9}{8}f \\); so that the height of the primitive tides of an ocean of water, covering the whole surface of the earth, such as it actually is, ought to be .911 for the solar, and 2.27 for the lunar disturbing force; that is, supposing the sea to be without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INERTIA\">inertia</a>, so as to accommodate itself at once to the form of equilibrium. But, in the actual state of the irregularities of the seas and continents, it is impossible to pay any regard to this secondary force, since the phenomena do not justify us in supposing the general form of the surface of the ocean such as to give rise to it.\n\nTheorem D. [H]. When the horizontal surface of a liquid is elevated or depressed a little at a given point, the effect will be propagated in the manner of a wave, with a velocity equal to that of a heavy body which has fallen through a space equal to half the depth of the fluid, the form of the wave remaining similar to that of the original elevation or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPRESSION\">depression</a>.\n\nIllustr. Celest. Mech. 378. p. 318.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCHOLIUM\">Scholium</a>. The demonstration of this theorem implies that water is incompressible, and that the pressure of each particle placed on the surface is instantaneously communicated through the whole depth of the fluid to the bottom. These suppositions are not indeed strictly accurate in any case, but they introduce no sensible error when the surface of the wave similarly affected is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> in comparison with the depth of the fluid. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> author, of celebrity, seems to have taken it for granted, that the pressure is propagated with the same velocity downwards and laterally; at least, if such is not his meaning, he has been somewhat unfortunate in the choice of his expressions; but there seems no reason whatever, why water should communicate force more slowly when it is perfectly confined, than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ICE\">ice</a> would do; and the divergence of the pressure of a certain portion of the surface of water, elevated a little, for example, above the rest, may be compared to the divergence of a sound entering into a detached chamber by an aperture of the same size with the given surface, which is probably small in comparison with its direct motion, but equally rapid, and in both cases depending on the modulus of the elasticity of the medium.\n\nTheorem E. [I]. A wave of a symmetrical form, with a depression equal and similar to its elevation, striking against a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> vertical obstacle, will be reflected, so as to cause a part of the surface, at the distance of one fourth of its whole breadth, to remain at rest; and if there be another opposite obstacle at twice that distance, there may be a perpetual vibration between the surfaces, the middle point having no vertical motion. Nat. Phil. I. p. 289. 777.\n\nScholium 1. The elevation and depression of a spheroid, compared with the surface of the sphere of equal magnitude, exhibits a symmetrical wave in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of the proposition: and it is not necessary, that the shores should be very rocky or perpendicular, in order to produce a strong reflection; for, even the vibration of the water in the bottom of a common hemispherical basin is considerably permanent.\n\nCorollary 2. The vibrations of the water supposed to be contained in a canal, following the direction of the equator, and 90\u00b0 in length, would be synchronous with the passage of a wave 180\u00b0 in breadth, over any point of a canal of the same depth, and surrounding the whole globe.\n\nScholium 2. It has been usual to consider the elevation of the tides, as identical with that of an oblong spheroid, measured at its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERTEX\">vertex</a>, and therefore as amounting to twice as much as the depression of the same spheroid at the equator, considered in relation to the mean height belonging to a sphere of the same magnitude: but, the supposition is by no means applicable to the case of a globe, covered partially and irregularly with water, so that in almost all cases of actual tides, the elevation must be considered as little if at all greater than the depression, as far as this cause only is concerned; there are, however, some other reasons to expect, that the elevation of the great wave might often arrive at a distant port in somewhat greater force than the depression.\n\nTheorem F. [K]. The oscillations of the sea and of lakes, constituting the tides, are subject to laws exactly similar to those of pendulums capable of performing vibrations in the same time, and suspended from points which are subjected to compound regular vibrations, of which the constituent periods are completed in half a lunar, and half a solar day [or in some particular cases a whole day].\n\nSupposing the surface of the sea to remain at rest, each point of it would become alternately elevated and depressed, in comparison with the situation in which it might remain in equilibrium; its distance from this situation varying according to the regular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PENDULUM\">pendulum</a> (see Theorem B); and like all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> vibrations, it will be actuated by forces indirectly dependent on, and proportional to, this distance; so that it may be compared to a pendulous body remaining at rest in the vertical line, about which its point of suspension vibrates, and will consequently follow the motion of the temporary horizon, in the same manner as the pendulum follows the vibration of its point of suspension, either with a direct or a retrograde motion, according to circumstances, which will be hereafter explained: the operation of the forces concerned being perfectly analogous, whether we consider the simple hydrostatic pressure depending on the elevation, or the horizontal pressure, derived from the inclination of the surface, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENTIAL\">differential</a> force immediately producing elevation and depression, depending on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> of the horizontal pressure, and proportional to the curvature of the surface. It becomes therefore necessary for the theory of the tides, to investigate minutely the laws of these compound and compulsory vibrations; which, together with the resistances affecting them, will be the subject of the next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">section</a>.\n\nSect. III.\u2014Of the Effects of Resistance in Vibrating Motions, whether Simple or Compound.\n\nTheorem G. If \\( dw + Ads + Bsds + Dwds = 0 \\); we have \\( e^{\\left(\\frac{B}{D} + \\frac{<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-AD\">AD</a> - B}{DD}\\right)} = c \\); ble being = 1.\nScholium. For the better understanding of the mode of investigation which will be employed in these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a>, it will be proper to premise some remarks on the investigation of fluxional equations, by means of multipliers. A person, unacquainted with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of modern mathematicians, would naturally understand, by a \"criterion of integrability,\" some mode of distinguishing an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> that would be integrated, from one that was untractable; while, in fact, this celebrated criterion relates only to the accidental form in which the expression occurs, and not to its essential nature. If we take, for instance, the well known case of the fluxion of \\( \\frac{h}{y} \\) \\( \\frac{dx}{dy} = y \\frac{dx}{xy} - x \\frac{dy}{xy} \\), and making this \\( = 0 \\), we have also \\( y \\frac{dx}{xy} - x \\frac{dy}{xy} = 0 \\); and this expression no longer fulfils the conditions of integrability, until we multiply it again by \\( \\frac{1}{xy} \\), and restore it to its perfect form. The direct investigation of such a multiplier is generally attended by insuperable difficulties; and the best expedient, in practical cases, is to examine the results of the employment of such multipliers, as are most likely to be concerned in the problem, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDETERMINATE\">indeterminate</a> coefficients, and to compare them with the equations proposed. In common cases, the finding of fluents, when only one variable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> is concerned, requires little more than the employment of a Table such as that of Meier Hirsch, or that which constitutes the Article Fluents in this Supplement; and the demonstration of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of the solution is in general furnished at once, for each case, by taking the fluxion of the quantity inserted in the Table as the fluent: but for the separation of different variable quantities, where they are involved with each other, the employment of proper multipliers is one of the most effectual expedients; and it is still more essential to the solution of equations between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLUXIONS\">fluxions</a> of different orders, or their coefficients. Such equations require in general to be compared with some multiple of the exponential quantity \\( e^{mt} \\), which affords fluxions of successive orders, that have simple relations to each other, especially when \\( dt \\) is considered as constant. The multiples of \\( \\sin Ct \\) and \\( \\cos Ct \\), are also very useful in such investigations, and for a similar reason; but the solutions that they afford are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> less comprehensive than the former; though they are often simpler, and more easily obtained. It is not, however, necessary that the exponent of the multiplier should flow uniformly, as will appear from the first example of a problem which has been solved by Euler in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICS\">Mechanics</a>: the subsequent examples will possess somewhat more of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a>.\n\nDemonstration. The fluxion of \\( e^{nt} (w + ps + q) \\) is \\( e^{nt} (dw + pds + (nw + nps + ng) ds) = e^{nt} dw + (p + ng) ds + ndsds + nds \\); and comparing with this \\( e^{nt} (dw + Ads + Bds + Dws) \\), we have \\( w = D \\), \\( np = B \\), and\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{B}{n} = \\frac{B}{D}; \\text{ and, lastly, } p + nq = A, q = \\frac{A - p}{n} = \\frac{AD - B}{DD};\n\\]\n\nconsequently the fluxion of \\( e^{Ds} \\left( w + \\frac{B}{D} \\right) + \\frac{AD - B}{DD} \\) is equal to nothing, and that quantity is constant, or equal to \\( c \\).\n\nExample. Let the given equation be that of a cycloidal pendulum, moving with a resistance proportional to the square of the velocity, or \\( \\frac{d^2 s}{dt^2} + Bs - D \\frac{ds^2}{dt^2} = 0 \\).\n\nScholium 2. The space \\( s \\) being supposed to begin at the lowest point of the curve, the fluxion \\( ds \\) is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a> during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> on the positive side, and the force \\( dds \\) is consequently negative, and equal, when there is no resistance, to \\( Bs \\), \\( B \\) being a positive coefficient, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a>, in the case of gravitation, to \\( \\frac{2g}{l} \\) or \\( \\frac{32}{l} \\), \\( l \\) being the length of the pendulum, and \\( g \\) the descent of a falling body in the first second. The coefficient \\( -D \\) is negative, because the resistance acts in a contrary direction to that of the force \\( Bs \\), as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> as \\( s \\) remains positive, and coincides with it on the negative side. But in the return of the pendulum the signs are changed; so that the equation can only be applied to a single vibration: since the two forces in question oppose each other in the same points of the curve in which they before agreed, while the square \\( \\frac{ds^2}{dt^2} \\) must always remain positive.\n\nSolution. If we multiply the given equation by \\( ds \\), and make the square of the velocity, or \\( v = w = \\frac{d^2 s}{dt^2} \\), we have \\( ds \\frac{dds}{dt^2} + Bsds - D \\frac{ds^2}{dt^2} ds = 0 = \\frac{1}{2} dw + Bsds - Dwds \\), and \\( dw + 2Bsds - 2Dwds = 0 \\); which, compared with the theorem, gives us \\( 0 \\) for \\( A \\), \\( 2B \\) for \\( B \\), and \\( -2D \\) for \\( D \\); and the solution becomes\n\n\\[\ne^{-2Ds} \\left( w + \\frac{B}{D} - \\frac{B}{2DD} \\right) = c, \\text{ or } w = \\frac{B}{D} + \\frac{B}{2DD} + \\frac{2Ds}{ce} \\text{; and if } w = 0 \\text{ when } s = \\lambda, \\text{ we have } \\frac{B}{D} + \\frac{B}{2DD} + \\frac{2Ds}{ce} = 0, \\text{ or, putting } \\frac{B}{D} + \\frac{B}{2DD} = \\beta, \\beta + ce^{2Ds} = 0,\n\\]\n\nand \\( c = -\\beta e^{-2Ds} \\); \\( \\beta \\) being also \\( \\frac{B}{2DD} \\) if \\( \\gamma = 1 + 2D \\). We may also substitute \\( \\sigma \\) for \\( \\lambda - s \\), and \\( ce^{2Ds} = -\\beta e^{2D(\\sigma - \\lambda)} \\), will become \\( -\\beta e^{-2Ds} \\), and\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{B}{D} + \\frac{B}{2DD} - \\beta e^{-2Ds} = \\frac{B}{2DD} (1 - \\gamma e^{-2Ds}) + 2Ds).\n\\]\n\nNow \\( e^{-2Ds} = 1 - 2Ds + 2D^2s^2 - \\frac{1}{2}D^3s^3 + \\ldots \\).\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{2}D^4\\sigma^4 - \\ldots; \\quad \\text{and } (1 + 2D\\lambda)e^{-2D\\sigma} = 1 + 2D\\lambda - 2D\\sigma - 4D^2\\sigma^2 + 2D^3\\sigma^3 - D^4\\sigma^4 - \\ldots;\n\\]\nwhence \\(w = \\frac{B}{2DD}(2D\\sigma - 2D(\\lambda - \\sigma) + 4D^2\\sigma - 2D^3\\sigma^3 - \\ldots)\\)\n\\[= B(2\\sigma - \\gamma\\sigma^2 + \\frac{2}{3}D^2\\sigma^3 - \\frac{1}{3}D^3\\sigma^4 + \\ldots).\\]\n\nCorollary 1. From this solution we obtain the point at which the velocity is greatest; and, by reversing the equation, we may also find the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of the vibration. For when \\(w = 0\\), we have \\(B\\sigma = D\\sigma\\), and \\(B = D\\sigma\\), which is the obvious expression of the equality of the resistance to the propelling force. Putting the greatest value of \\(w = x\\), and the corresponding value of \\(s = s\\), we have \\(x = \\frac{B}{D^2} + \\frac{B}{2DD} + \\frac{2D\\sigma}{D^5}\\), since \\(B = D\\sigma\\), and \\(\\frac{B}{2DD} = -ce = \\frac{B\\gamma}{2DD}e^{2D(\\sigma - \\lambda)}\\); whence \\(\\frac{1}{\\gamma} = e^{2D(\\sigma - \\lambda)}\\), and \\(\\gamma = e^{2D(\\lambda - \\sigma)}\\); consequently \\(hl\\gamma = 2D(\\lambda - \\sigma) = hl(1 + 2D\\lambda)\\), and \\(2D\\sigma = 2D\\lambda - hl(1 + 2D\\lambda)\\), and \\(s = \\frac{1}{2D}\\left(2D^2\\sigma^3 - \\frac{8}{3}D^3\\sigma^4 + \\ldots\\right) = D^2\\sigma^3 - \\frac{4}{3}D^3\\sigma^4 + \\ldots\\)\n\nAnd since \\(x = \\frac{B}{D^2}\\), we have \\(x = \\frac{B}{2DD}(2D\\lambda - hl[1 + 2D\\lambda])\\).\n\nLemma.

He then became an usher in a school at Blackheath, kept by Mr Jennings; but he was soon after induced by his father to take deacon's orders, and obtained a curacy in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KENT\">Kent</a>. His own preference, however, was so much in favour of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, that in 1756 he entered as a student of the Middle Temple; but in 1760 he was persuaded to return to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, and to receive ordination as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a>; and he officiated for three years in the chapelry of New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRENTFORD\">Brentford</a>, which his father had purchased for him; performing his duties with decency, and taking some pains to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> the elements of medicine for the sake of the poorer members of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONGREGATION\">congregation</a>.

He had altogether laid aside his clerical character in these excursions, but he resumed it for a short time after his return: soon, however, he relap-\nsed into his political amusements; exerting himself, with some success, in various elections, as a partisan of his friend Wilkes, and taking up the cause of a Mrs Bigby, in the pursuit of an \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> of blood,\" against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDERERS\">murderers</a> of her husband, who were supposed to have obtained a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARDON\">pardon</a> through corrupt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">court</a>; though the widow at last disappointed him by accepting a pecuniary compensation for her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> of appeal. He was, however, successful, on his own behalf, in repelling a prosecution for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIBEL\">libel</a> on Mr Onslow; and he gained some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> with a party in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> by suggesting to Beckford, then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Mayor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, the reply which he made to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">King</a>'s answer to their remonstrance, and which may still be seen, engraved on the pedestal of Beckford's statue in Guildhall.

The next year, Mr Tooke completed his academical course at Cambridge, by taking the degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">Master</a> of Arts, though not without some opposition. He exerted himself greatly about this time, in procuring the publication of the debates of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">House</a> of Commons in the daily papers, notwithstanding the well-known standing Orders of the House; and so far as he was instrumental in carrying this point, he appears to have rendered at least one very essential <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>; but Wilkes, and especially Almon, the bookseller, are said to have a still stronger claim to the merit of this transaction, whatever may have been its character.\n\nHe had also a sharp contest with the anonymous \"Junius,\" against whose hasty attack he defended himself with great spirit and energy, and with unexampled success. In 1773, he made a formal resignation of his living, and meant at the same time completely to lay aside his clerical character, though <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> person seems to have felt himself authorised to accept this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his resignation; and he began to study the law very diligently, intending to make it the occupation of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. He adopted soon after a singular method of forcing himself upon the notice of the public, and of the House of Commons in particular: an inclosure bill being about to be hurried, as was reported, a little too rapidly through the House, he wrote some paragraphs in a newspaper, which reflected very severely on the conduct of the Speaker, on purpose that he might be summoned to appear before the House; and being placed at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a>, he gave such reasons for his conduct as produced some animated discussions, and in the end was supposed, though probably without foundation, to have caused the bill to be modified in some oppressive clauses. By these means he obtained the favour of Mr Tooke of Purley, who thought himself aggrieved by the bill in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> state, and received from him such assurances of testamentary favours as induced his nephew, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLONEL\">Colonel</a> Harwood, to agree upon a partition of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> interest in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVERSION\">reversion</a> of his estate; though Mr Horne never received, first and last, more than L.8000 from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>, notwithstanding the subsequent change of his name about the year 1782, in acknowledgment of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a>'s kindness, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> intimacy and frequent residence at Purley; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> legatee, after all, being a Mr Beaseley.\n\nMr Horne Tooke was, of course, a strenuous opposer of the American <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>; and in 1777, he published a very offensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ADVERTISEMENT\">advertisement</a>, in which the sufferers in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> of Lexington were described as having been murdered by the King's troops. For this attack on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">Government</a>, he was tried at Guildhall, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> 1777; he conducted his own defence, but he was found guilty of the libel, and sentenced to a year's imprisonment in the King's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENCH\">Bench</a>, and a fine of L.200. It was on this occasion that he first appeared before the public as a grammarian, in the criticisms which constitute his celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">Letter</a> to Mr Dunning. The next year he suffered a still severer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>, in the refusal of the society of the Inner Temple to admit him to the bar, on account of his having taken orders; so that his prospects of professional advancement were utterly annihilated. This occurrence made him still more bitter against the existing Government, and in 1780 he printed some severe remarks upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> of Lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">North</a>. He attempted to establish himself as a practical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">farmer</a> in Huntingdonshire; but he caught an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGUE\">ague</a>, and soon became disgusted with an agricultural life; he returned to London, and occupied for some years a house near Soho <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">Square</a>. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of Parliamentary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REFORM\">reform</a>, contained in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> letter addressed to Mr Dunning, were by no means extravagant, and he continued to adhere, in this respect, rather to the party of Mr Pitt than to that of Mr Fox.\n\nThe publication of his grammatical dissertations, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of the Diversions of Purley, afforded but a slight and imperfect intermission of his political pursuits, for his etymological works are as replete with the politics of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> as his speeches and his pamphlets; another of which appeared in 1788, under the title of Two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">Pair</a> of Portraits, being intended to serve the cause of Pitt's party in their elections. But in 1790 he became himself a candidate for the representation of Westminster, in opposition to Mr Fox and to Lord Hood; and he distinguished himself sufficiently as a popular orator, though he was not successful in the contest.\n\nHe was tried, in 1794, for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">High</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASON\">Treason</a>, together with several other members of the Corresponding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">Societies</a>, who had been active in attempting to introduce some imitations of the French Revolution in the plans of reform which they brought forward. He exhibited on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> somewhat more of firmness than of good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>: one of his associates had before been acquitted, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JURY\">jury</a> speedily returned a similar verdict with respect to himself. He after-\nTooke. wards dedicated the second <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of his *Diversions of Purley* to his counsel, Gibbs and Erskine, and to the jury who tried him.\n\nIn 1796, he again became a candidate for the representation of Westminster; but again without success: and, notwithstanding his strong opinions respecting a reform in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a>, he afterwards condescended to accept from Lord Camelford, in 1801, a seat for the nominal burgh of Old Sarum. It was then to be determined <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> a clergyman could sit in the House of Commons; but the ministry, instead of contesting the point with respect to his particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, brought in a bill to decide the question in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a> for the future, and he remained in the House till the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a> of the Parliament in the next year, but without particularly distinguishing himself in its proceedings.\n\nHis last public effort, as a party <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, was made in espousing for a short time the cause of Mr Paull, as candidate for Westminster; but, he abandoned this gentleman in a subsequent contest. The later years of his life were chiefly passed in the society of a select circle of friends, who frequently partook of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITALITY\">hospitality</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WIMBLEDON\">Wimbledon</a>. He died in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 1822, leaving his property to some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> daughters; for he had never been married. He was buried in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EALING\">Ealing</a> church, and not in his garden, as he had directed; his executors thinking themselves the less bound by these instructions, as a literal compliance with them might have been unfavourable to the \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a>\" of the property.\n\n1. His earliest publication was a pamphlet entitled *The Petition of an Englishman*, 1765. It consisted principally of apologies, for the private conduct and immoral writings of Wilken.\n\n2. He also published *A Sermon* while he continued in the church, that is, before the year 1773: but it attracted little notice.\n\n3. *A Letter to Mr Dunning*, 1778. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> of his grammatical system, arising out of remarks on the particles employed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTORNEY_GENERAL\">Attorney-General</a> in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDICTMENT\">indictment</a>, and by the judges in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a>: it was afterwards incorporated into the *Diversions of Purley*.\n\n4. *Facts*, 1780: consisting of remarks on the administration of Lord North; with some additions relating to finance, by Dr Price.\n\n5. *A Letter on Parliamentary Reform*, 1782: addressed to Mr Dunning, afterwards Lord Ashburton.\n\n6. *Epea Pteroenta, or Diversions of Purley*, 8. 1786. Ed. 2. 4. Part I. 1798. Part II. 1802. His great and celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>: rich indeed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ETYMOLOGY\">etymology</a> and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WIT\">wit</a>, but meagre in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METAPHYSICS\">metaphysics</a>.\n\n7. *A Letter to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">Prince</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a>*, 1787: relating to the supposed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> with a Catholic.\n\n8. *Two Pair of Portraits*, 8. 1788. The two Pitts contrasted, in opposite columns, with the two Foxes, in colours by no means favourable to the latter.\n\n9. Many of his *Letters* have been printed in Stephens's *Life of Tooke*, 2 v. 8. Lond. 1813.\n\nIt is from the last mentioned publication, that this historical sketch of Mr Tooke's life has principally been extracted: it now becomes necessary to add some remarks on his literary and moral qualifications; and in both these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of view, the subject has been treated in so masterly a manner by the author of an article in the Quarterly Review, who is supposed to be a near relation of Tooke's most intimate friend, the late Colonel Bosville, that it would be presumption in any man to go over the same ground, without adopting very nearly the eloquent and energetic expressions, which that noble and learned person has employed.\n\n\"Mr Tooke,\" says the accomplished Reviewer of the *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> of his Life* (Q.R. Vol. VII. No. xiv. p. 325), \"was possessed of considerable learning, as indeed his writings sufficiently show. To other more casual acquirements, he united a very extensive acquaintance with the Gothic dialects, of which he has so copiously and so judiciously availed himself in his etymological researches.\" But it must be remarked, that a person more intimately acquainted with the \"Gothic dialects\" as living languages <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> easily discover, that his knowledge of them was in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> but superficial, or that he was indebted for it more to grammars and dictionaries, than to any extensive study of the authors who had written in those languages, or to any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of speaking them; and such a person will easily find a variety of instances, in which a very different etymon to that which he has assigned, will naturally suggest itself as the true origin of the word in question.\n\n(P. 320.) \"Though Mr Tooke's philosophical works are the results of no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a> and industry, yet they are neither written in a truly philosophical spirit, nor do they display traces of a mind, which, even if it had been wholly dedicated to the study of metaphysics, would have much enlarged the bounds of our knowledge in that nice and intricate branch of science. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> seems to have been rather to retard, than to advance the progress of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, by recalling us from those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> conclusions as to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> and operations of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> mind, which are built upon observation and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, to vague speculations, drawn from the imperfect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> existing between the moral and the physical world. There can be no doubt, that the proposition, which he has succeeded in establishing, is highly interesting and important; and that, in the illustration of it, he has shown great learning, ingenuity, and research. But then, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, he has so monstrously exaggerated its importance, and so widely mistaken its tendency, and has attempted to raise so vast a superstructure upon such a narrow, slippery, and inadequate foundation, that we are quite lost in amazement, when we recollect how completely the sagacity, which guided him so well in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> of his principal fact, appears to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a> him, when he comes to apply that fact to the purposes of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a>. The distance between what he has proved, and what he wishes us to believe that he has proved, is enormous. What he has proved is, that all words, even those that are expressive of the nicest operations of our minds, were originally borrowed from the objects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> perception; a circumstance highly curious in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, consequently in the\nhistory of the human mind itself, and the complete demonstration of which, of course, reflects great credit upon its author. What he thinks he has proved is, that this etymological history of words is our true guide, both as to the present import of the words themselves, and as to the nature of those things, which they are intended to signify: a proposition so monstrous, that he has nowhere ventured to enunciate it in its general form, but has rather left it to be collected from the tenor of his remarks upon particular instances. In truth, the inferences at which Mr Tooke arrived, far from being warranted by his facts, are directly the contrary of those to which he ought naturally to have been led by the result of his own studies, when they were most successful. In tracing upwards, through all the mazes of etymology, the origin of words, he ought to have seen more clearly, if possible, than any body else, that their real present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> is not to be sought for in their primitive signification, or in the elements of which they were originally composed, but that, on the contrary, their actual import, with which alone in reasoning we have to do, hardly ever corresponds with their etymological meaning, although the one always bears to the other a certain resemblance, more or less accurate, according to the greater or less effect of time and accident. One could without difficulty understand, how a person, unaccustomed to such considerations, and misled by a few instances partially chosen, should adopt a theory like that which Mr Tooke was desirous to establish; but how a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>, minutely acquainted with the whole subject, and proceeding upon a most copious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDUCTION\">induction</a> of particulars, should not have perceived that, in ninety-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> instances out of a hundred, such a doctrine would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> absurdity, is, to us at least, inconceivable.\"\n\nThe Reviewer then follows Mr Dugald Stewart in some very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> criticisms, which this acute metaphysician had already made on several of Mr Tooke's examples, fully proving the complete fallacy of the system which so completely confounds the definition of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> with its etymology. Mr Tooke has, indeed, the merit of having demonstrated pretty clearly that all the parts of speech, including those which grammarians had often considered as expletives and unmeaning particles, may be resolved more or less completely into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOUNS\">nouns</a> and verbs: but on the one hand it has been observed, that the very same doctrine may be clearly traced back to the works of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>; and on the other, it may be asserted with equal truth, if we wish to carry the theory to its utmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, that language consists only of nouns and one verb; since all verbs may in fact be resolved into participles, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol8.html#article-ADJECTIVES\">adjectives</a>, compounded with auxiliary verbs, as well as those which exhibit this complication in their exterior form.\n\n\"In the ordinary intercourse of life,\" Mr Tooke \"was kind, friendly, and hospitable.\"\u2014(P. 325.)\n\n\"We doubt whether his temper was naturally good; but if it was not, he had a merit the more; for he had so completely subdued it by care and self-control, as never to betray, under any provocation, the slightest mark of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRRITABILITY\">irritability</a> which often accompanies talent, and which gains so rapidly upon those who know not how to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> against its approaches. Indeed, the aspect under which he appeared in private was by no means such as the stern cynicism and ferocious turbulence of his public conduct would have led one to expect; and those, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of him has been formed exclusively upon his political character and his writings, will have some difficulty in believing that the curate of Brentford was one of the best bred gentlemen of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>. In this respect he was a sort of phenomenon. He was born in a low station: at no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> did he appear to have possessed any remarkable advantages for the study of good breeding; on the contrary, the greater part of his life was spent in constant intercourse with coarse, vulgar, and uneducated men; yet his natural taste was so good, and he had profited so judiciously by whatever opportunities he enjoyed, that courts and high stations have seldom produced a better example of polite and elegant behaviour, than was exhibited by the associate of Messrs Hardy and Thelwall. Indeed, his manner had almost every excellence that manner can display: <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a>, vivacity, frankness, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>. Perhaps, indeed, in its outward forms, and in that which is purely conventional, his courtesy wore the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> of the 'vieille cour,' and was rather more elaborate, than is consistent with the practice of this lounging unceremonious age; but it was never forced or constrained, and it sat not ungracefully upon an old man.\" It may, however, deserve to be remarked, in contemplating this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARADOX\">paradox</a>, though rather as a collateral coincidence than as a satisfactory explanation, that even from his infancy Tooke had actually seen something of the very highest society, having been admitted once or twice a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEICESTER\">Leicester</a> House as a play-fellow to the late King: and though he may have learned but little from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of the manners of the young Prince, yet the early habit of self-restraint, imposed by such a presence, may easily have imprinted some courtly traces on his character, which were not easily effaced, and which an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">association</a> with the heirs of the first families of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>, throughout his boyhood, at Westminster and at Eton, must naturally have made still more distinct and permanent.\n\n\"He never appeared to greater advantage than in conversation.\" \"He possessed an inexhaustible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUND\">fund</a> of anecdotes, which he introduced with great skill, and related with neatness, grace, rapidity, and pleasantry: he had a quick sense of the ridiculous, and was a great master of the whole art of raillery, a dangerous talent, though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of it in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> was always tempered by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITENESS\">politeness</a> and good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a>.\"\n\n\"In spite of labour and dissipation (p. 328), his life was protracted to a period which indicated an originally sound and vigorous frame. For the last twenty years, however, he was subject to several severe, distressing, and incurable infirmities. These he bore with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a> and firmness which it was impossible not to admire: to the very last he never suffered himself to be beaten <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> by them, nor ever for one moment indulged in complaint, or gave way to despondency. In the intervals of pain, nay, even when actually suffering under it, he preserved a self-command, which enabled him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONVERSE\">converse</a>, not\nonly with spirit and vigour, but with all his accustomed cheerfulness and pleasantry, never making any demand upon the sympathy of his friends, or mentioning his own situation at all, except when occasionally, and by a very pardonable exercise of his sophistry, he amused himself in exalting its comforts, and explaining away its disadvantages; displaying, in this respect, a manly spirit and a practical philosophy, which, if they had been brought to bear upon his moral, as well as upon his physical condition, if they had been employed with as much effect in reconciling him to his political <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCLUSION\">exclusion</a> as to his bodily sufferings, might have produced, not the very imperfect character we have been attempting to delineate, in which the unfavourable traits bear so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> a proportion to those of a nobler and more benign <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a>, but the venerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PORTRAIT\">portrait</a> of a truly wise and virtuous man.\"\n\nReid's Memoirs, 8.

Although this empire has undergone but slight alterations since the account of it contained in the Encyclopaedia was written, yet, as its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATISTICS\">statistics</a> have had some new light thrown on them by recent publications, we shall give a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIEF\">brief</a> sketch of its present state.\n\nThe extent of this empire has been variously estimated by different writers; and, after consulting them, we rather concur in the calculations made by Hassel, the latest of them, founded on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CHARTS\">charts</a> of Reichart and Niedls, because they are corroborated by the last map constructed by Arrowsmith, and by that of Lapless. In this account of the extent of the empire we have included all those countries over which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TURKEY\">Turkey</a> claims the sovereignty, although in many of them that sovereignty is either not acknowledged or very feebly exercised.\n\n| Square Miles |\n|--------------|\n| Turkey in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> contains | 180,074 |\n| Turkey in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a> on the Continent | 436,629 |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">Islands</a> of Turkey in Asia | 11,050 |\n| The African Dominions | 276,480 |\n| **Total** | **904,233** |\n\nIn countries where no censuses have been taken in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> times, in which no registers of births or deaths are preserved, where no general conscription has been introduced, and where even the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of houses is not known, the accounts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> must be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> estimates or rather conjectures; and, therefore, it is not extraordinary that different writers should have presented results so distant from each other as those we have examined. Two censuses have, indeed, been instituted; one in the middle of the sixteenth, and the other at the beginning of the seventeenth century. Their results are not, however, now known; and if they were, they would scarcely be tolerable guides at this day, when the whole state of affairs has undergone such great alterations. Hassel, in 1816, calculated the whole number of Turkish subjects at 24,070,000; and, in 1819, Lichtenstern estimated them at 24,880,000, whilst Gr\u00e4berreck reckoned them to be in round numbers 23,000,000. Though these industrious writers thus approached nearly to each other in their totals, they differ most widely in the component parts. Thus, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASIA_MINOR\">Asia <a cl</a>ass=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINOR\">Minor</a>, they disagree to the extent of five or six millions; and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a> and its dependencies to the extent of three or four.\n\nThe financial affairs of the Turkish empire are involved in still greater obscurity than the state of the population. From the system, which uniformly prevails, by which every governor of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> collects imposts, and expends them on the local objects under his management\u2014that which is received into the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURY\">treasury</a> bears no proportion to that which is extracted from the subject. Many of the provinces are compelled to deliver contributions in their productions, which productions are appropriated to some specific public department. Thus Egypt was required to deliver to the arsenal 1000 quintals of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEMP\">hemp</a>, 200 jars of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>, 2000 pieces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a>, and 140 quintals of linen yarn; and to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERAGLIO\">Seraglio</a> 36,000 measures of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICE\">rice</a>, 45,000 okas of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>, 2000 measures of pease, besides stipulated quantities of ginger, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CINNAMON\">cinnamon</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEPPER\">pepper</a>, and other smaller <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a>. The other provinces are required in a similar manner to contribute to the demands of the Imperial Government. The annual sum which flows into the treasury has been estimated, by Contemir and Thornton, at about L3,000,000 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">Sterling</a>, and by Eton at near L4,000,000. Whatever may be the amount of the public income, it is distinct from the revenues which accrue to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">Emperor</a> personally, of which no account can be obtained; but it is imagined that they amount to much more than the expenditure of the imperial establishment, and that vast sums have been accumulated in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSEHOLD\">household</a> treasury. These <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> revenues arise from domains, from confiscations, from presents, and from the sale of governments and other offices. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> Marcellus, in a work published at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAGUE\">Hague</a> in 1732 (Stato Militare de Imperio Ottomanno), asserts, that, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Ibrahim in 1639, his successor, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONRAD\">Conrad</a> IV., found L33,000,000 Sterling in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>; and that, as, by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> law, every Emperor is bound to increase this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURE\">treasure</a>, during his reign, it had been vastly augmented at the time he wrote.\n\nThis accumulation of private treasure is deemed an indispensable part of the state policy of Turkey, where, as in every despotic government, the individual filling the throne is exposed to sudden insurrections and interior revolutions. Meusel thinks that this treasure was much reduced by the war with Russia, which terminated in 1812, when the private hoods were compelled to come forth in aid of the national treasury to a very great, but unknown, extent; as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> was then paid with coins of very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> dates. The expenses of the government are involved in as much obscurity as the income from which they are defrayed. The greater part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> costs but little in time of peace; being fur-\nnished with necessaries by the several provinces in which they are quartered, and which are collected from their feudatories by the governors of them.\n\nThe debt of the state, which, in 1803, amounted to only L.3,500,000 Sterling, has been increased by the various unfortunate events that have occurred since that period to upwards of L.70,000,000; and, in spite of forced loans, to which the government has had recourse, and of large contributions from the religious establishments, the state-obligations pay an interest at the rate of 12 per cent.\n\nUnder a government, where all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> is held on the condition of military service, the number of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> must be great in proportion to the population; but in Turkey the numbers have been kept down by the want of means to provide the necessary arms and equipments. According to the most recent accounts, the regular army amounts to 125,000 infantry, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTILLERY\">artillery</a>, artificers, sappers, miners, and armourers, included; and 12,500 cavalry; but to the latter may be added 100,000 feudal horsemen, who may be made available for internal defence. The Janisaries make 80,000 of the infantry; and these are rather garrison <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITIA\">militia</a>, for the most part, than regular troops. The best corps consist of those called the new regulars, amounting to 24,000 men, who, as well as the artillery, are armed and disciplined after European models. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">navy</a> of Turkey has of late declined. It now consists of 15 ships of the line, the same number of frigates, and about 30 smaller vessels. Very few of these ships are fit for service; and the naval arsenal is so destitute of stores that fewer still can be equipped. At all times the best seamen in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a> consisted of Greeks; and, since the insurrection of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, greater difficulties than before have been found in working and fighting their ships. This accounts for the different disasters which the Turkish navy has experienced during the course of the existing contests with their Greek subjects.\n\nAs the greater part of the inhabitants of the Turkish dominions are collected in and around the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> for security, the intervals of land between these towns are almost wholly uncultivated. Where any cultivation is practised, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> is highly grateful, and produces abundant returns for the labour bestowed on it in corn, wine, oil, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAX\">flax</a>, hemp, cotton, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a>, madder, and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DYEING\">dyeing</a> materials. The woods afford excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a> in abundance. Horses, cows, sheep, goats, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAME\">game</a>, are plentifully reared. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FISHERIES\">fisheries</a>, both in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> and seas, are much neglected, except by the Greeks, who have occasion for them from the numerous fasts prescribed by their religious tenets. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONEY\">Honey</a> and wax are liberally supplied; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a> is collected in all the provinces south of the Danube. The mineral products are now almost wholly confined to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, though <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> and silver were formerly worked in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> of Bosnia, and those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOLDAVIA\">Moldavia</a> and Wallachia are rich in minerals.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a> in Turkey are neither numerous nor abundant. The best of them is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a> of various colours and qualities. Dyes of several kinds, but especially that made from madder, and universally known through Europe by the name of Turkey-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>, are supplied. Cottons are made in several places, as are coarse woollen cloths and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CARPETS\">carpets</a>. Silks and silk gaizes, of a very delicate texture, are made at Constantinople, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SALONICA\">Salonica</a>, and at Scio. Iron, and especially <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a> wares, are furnished from several parts of the empire. Besides these, the smaller articles, snuff, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOAP\">soap</a>, sail-cloth, glass <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARE\">ware</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PORCELAIN\">porcelain</a>, are produced, but not in quantities equal to the demand.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> of Turkey is almost exclusively in commerce. The hands of the Greek and Armenian subjects, or of Europeans established in the commercial cities, who are collectively distinguished by the name of Franks. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> exports consist of cotton wool, silk, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOBACCO\">tobacco</a>, oil, currants, rosin, wine, horses, cows, skins and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HIDES\">hides</a>, leather, linseed, corn, cheese, Turkish yarn, and carpets. The chief imports are\u2014cloths of wool, silk, and cotton, colonial wares, glass, watches, hardware, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, paints, cabinet ware, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUREMBERG\">Nuremberg</a> wares, precious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, jewellery, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> slaves from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEORGIA\">Georgia</a>, and the Caucasian territory. The greatest traffic is with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUSTRIA\">Austria</a>, partly by land. The next in amount is with England, and then follows that with France, Italy, and Russia. The internal trade of Turkey is extensive, chiefly in the hands of Armenians, who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a> the productions of Europe for those of Asia, including <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHINA\">China</a>. Nearly the whole mercantile shipping belongs to the Greek subjects of the empire, whose resistance to its authority has an injurious effect on its general commerce. The chief trading cities in European Turkey are Constantinople, Salonica, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GALLIPOLI\">Gallipoli</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GALATZ\">Galatz</a>.\n\nThe Turkish divisions of the empire are purely military, founded on feudal principles, and even retaining the military names. The whole dominion is divided into twenty-five districts, which are subdivided into sandshaks (Standards); each sandshak contains a number of tracts, called tiamars or siamets (Sabres). Besides these, there are other divisions, used purely for the civil and financial purposes of the government.\n\nThe European part of Turkey comprehends the four provinces of Roumelia, Bosnia, the Islands, and the principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia.\n\nRoumelia is subdivided into sandshaks or standards, and contains about 6,000,000 inhabitants. The most populous cities, and their estimated inhabitants, as calculated by Andreossy in the year 1815, according to the consumption of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>, were the following:\n\n- Constantinople, 597,000; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-ADRIANOPLE\">Adrianople</a>, 100,000;\n- Salonica, 60,000; Sofia, 46,000; Ruschak, 30,000;\n- Philopopolis, 30,000; Ionina, 30,000; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LARISSA\">Larissa</a>, 25,000;\n- Sistove, 21,000; Varma, 16,000; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MISITRA\">Misitra</a>, 16,000;\n- Scutori, 16,000; Tripoliza, 12,000; Sillistra, 10,000;\n- and Baba, Nicopoli, Stovi, or Uskub, and Pristina, from 9000 to 10,000 each.\n\nBosnia contains about 850,000 inhabitants. The cities are Bosna-Serai, with 65,000; Banjaluka, with 15,000; Zwornick, with 14,000; and Trebon, with 10,000 souls.\n\nThe Ejalet Dschesair, or Province of the Islands, according to Lichtenstern, contained in 1819 about\nTurkish Empire.\n\n525,000 inhabitants, chiefly Greeks, and the following cities: <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALIPOLI\">Galipoli</a>, with 17,000; Castorea, with 18,000; Betagela, with 15,000; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HYDRA\">Hydra</a>, with 40,000; Candia, with 15,000; Negroponte, with 16,000; Canes, with 12,000; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a> and Levadia, with 10,000 inhabitants each.\n\nWallachia and Moldavia are rather under the nominal than the real government of Turkey, though the Waiwode is nominated by the Porte. He is always appointed from some of the noble Greek families, generally for a short period, and uniformly by means of bribery. Wallachia contains about 1,000,000 inhabitants, chiefly of the Greek church, and they are governed by ancient feudal laws, which are corruptly administered by magistrates who owe their authority to barefaced corruption. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUCHAREST\">Bucharest</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a>, contains from 50,000 to 60,000 inhabitants.\n\nMoldavia has been contracted by cessions to Russia, and now contains about 500,000 inhabitants, who are of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, and under a government similar to that of Wallachia. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JASSY\">Jassy</a>, the capital, contains 27,500 inhabitants. Galatz, a trading city on the Danube, has about 8000 regular inhabitants, and a vast number of strangers, who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a> to it for commercial purposes.\n\nTurkish Asia comprehends the following countries: 1st, The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENINSULA\">peninsula</a> of Asia Minor, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of Cyprus, and some smaller islands in the Egean and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a> seas, and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> of Marmora. 2d, That part of Georgia which has remained to Turkey since the last peace with Russia. 3d, A portion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMENIA\">Armenia</a>. 4th, The whole country of Mesopotamia, that of the Curdo, and a part of Irack. 5th, The whole of Soristan or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYRIA\">Syria</a>, with which the Turks include the district of Yemen in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARABIA\">Arabia</a>, over which they have no actual power, and the cities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECCA\">Mecca</a>, Medina, and Jeddo, which have been lately again taken by them from the Wahabees, but which properly form a part of Arabia. These natural or ancient divisions are now scarcely regarded by the Turks. The whole dominion is, for purposes of administration, divided into twenty-one governments, viz.\n\n1st, Anatolia, including that portion of Asia Minor which comprehends the provinces of Bithynia, Paphlagonia, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GALATIA\">Galatia</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHRYGIA\">Phrygia</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MYSIA\">Mysia</a>, Lydia, Lycia, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARIA\">Caria</a>, and Pisidia. The chief cities are, Kukatia, or Cotyaum, with, according to Malte-Brun, 50,000 inhabitants; Brussa, with, according to Kinneir, 50,000; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BERGAMO\">Bergamo</a>, the ancient Pergamos, Anatolia, with, according to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEAUFORT\">Beaufort</a>, 8000; Kara-hissa, with 60,000; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGORA\">Angora</a>, with 20,000; Kastimuni, with 13,000; Sinope, with 10,000; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMYRNA\">Smyrna</a>, with 100,000; Scalamuwo, with, according to Galt, 20,000; Scio, in the island of that name, with 25,000, according to Galt, 20,000; to Wittman, 25,000; and to Olivier, 30,000; almost wholly Greeks, and lately destroyed.\n\n2d, Kibris, or the island of Cyprus, with about 120,000 inhabitants, of whom 16,000 are in the city of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NICOSIA\">Nicosia</a>.\n\n3d, Itschill, a part of Asia Minor, comprehend-\n\ning the ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CILICIA\">Cilicia</a>, Isauria, and Pamphylia. Its chief cities are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADANA\">Adana</a>, with 30,000 inhabitants; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TARSUS\">Tarsus</a>, with 30,000.\n\n4th, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARAMANIA\">Caramania</a>, comprehending a portion of Asia Minor, which was formerly Cappadocia, and parts of Galatia, and Phrygia <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJOR\">Major</a>. Its chief cities are, Konia, or Iconium, with 30,000 inhabitants; La-renda, or Caraman, with, according to Kinneir, 15,000; and Aschier, or Antioch, with 60,000.\n\n5th, Merash, extending over part of Cappadocia, of Armenia Minor, and of Cilicia Campestris. The principal cities are, Merash, with 9000 or 10,000 souls; Aintab, with 20,000; and Melitene, with 8000.\n\n6th, Sewas, including the greater portion of the ancient Pontus, whose principal cities are, Oskal, with 16,000 inhabitants; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMASIA\">Amasia</a>, with 35,000.\n\n7th, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-TREBISOND\">Trebisond</a>, comprehending, to the eastern of the ancient Pontus, a portion of Armenia on the border of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLACK_SEA\"><a class=</a>\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">Black</a> Sea. The capital of the same name contains, according to Kinneir, 15,000 inhabitants; and Rise, or Irisch, not lately visited, but in the middle of the last century, a flourishing, manufacturing, and commercial city, has 30,000 inhabitants.\n\n8th, Tschalder, or Chaldea, a part of Armenia, with which what remains to the Turks of Georgia is comprehended. The only city is Akhirssa, or Akalzike, on the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> to the passes through the mountains, which lead to the ports on the Black Sea, supposed to contain from 12,000 to 15,000 souls of all descriptions and nations.\n\n9th, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KARS\">Kars</a>, a part of Armenia. The chief city in lat. 40\u00b0 56', and long. 43\u00b0 23', of the same name, as well as the other towns, have not been recently visited, and their population is not ascertained.\n\n10th, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERZERUM\">Erzerum</a>, also a part of Armenia, supposed, by Morier, to contain from 500,000 to 600,000 inhabitants, and represented by him to be both fertile and beautiful. The capital of the same name is variously described by Tournefort, Morier, Gardanne, Kinneir, and Von Hammer; the lowest estimation making the inhabitants amount to 80,000; the highest (Morier) to 250,000. Karahissar contains 10,000, and Hamischkane 7000 souls.\n\n11th, Wan, a part of Armenia and of Kurdistan. The capital, from which the province derives its name, has not been recently visited; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BETLIS\">Betlis</a> is stated by Kinneir to contain 12,000 inhabitants.\n\n12th, Schersur, a part of Kurdistan. This province is so called from its capital, in lat. 35\u00b0 46', and long. 45\u00b0 21', which, with all the other places, are of small consideration.\n\n13th, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAGDAD\">Bagdad</a>, a part of Mesopotamia, and the ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BABYLON\">Babylon</a>, with a portion of Kurdistan. This extensive province is very thinly peopled, and recent travellers represent it as fast going to decay. Bagdad, the city which gives its name to the province, is stated by De Sacy to contain 95,000 inhabitants, or more than one-fifth of the whole population; the other towns are small.\n\n14th, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BASRA\">Basra</a>, or Bussora, a part of Chaldea, and of Arabia. The capital of the same name contains from 45,000 to 80,000 inhabitants, according to the differing accounts of Neibuhr, De Sacy, and Von Hammer. Korna, at the junction of the Tigris with\nthe Frat, is a commercial city of some importance; but its population is not ascertained.\n\n15th, Mossul, a part of Mesopotamia, and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASSYRIA\">Assyria</a>. The capital which gives its name to the province is on a fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, watered by the Tigris, and contains, according to Kinneir, 35,000; according to Olivier, 65,000 inhabitants.\n\n16th, Diarbekr, that part of Mesopotamia which was called Bekr formerly. The capital from which the province derives its name contains, according to Gardanne, 80,000 inhabitants; but according to Gardanne, 80,000. Siwerh, a trading city on the river Frat, has a population of 10,000. The other towns are very small.\n\n17th, Racca, the western part of Mesopotamia, and a part of Syria. The inhabitants live more in tents than in towns. The capital of the same name, though known in Europe more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> by the names of Nicephorium or Kallinicum, is represented, by recent travellers, to contain from 30,000 to 40,000 inhabitants. Biredschik, a trading town on the Frat, has about 6000, and no other place more than 2000 inhabitants.\n\n18th, Haleb, the northern part of ancient Syria. It is represented as a fertile, manufacturing, and commercial province, with 500,000 industrious inhabitants. Haleb, the capital, the ancient Berea, now called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALEPPO\">Aleppo</a>, has a population of, according to Volney, 100,000; to Setzen, 150,000; to Rosseau, 200,000; to Arvieuze, 280,000; and to Dr Russel, 235,000. It has a great trade carried on by the numerous Franks established there. Killis contains 12,000; Antokia 15,000 inhabitants. The population of Scanderoon and Latakia are not ascertained.\n\n19th, Tarablos, the middle part of Syria, westward of Lebanon. The name of this province is derived from that of its capital, known to Europeans as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIPOLI\">Tripoli</a>; which, according to Browne, contains about 16,000 souls. No other town is noticed by travellers.\n\n20th, Akka, the ancient Phoenicia, and a part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PALESTINE\">Palestine</a>. The capital of the province, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACRE\">Acre</a>, or St John's d'Acre, the ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMAIS\">Ptolemais</a>, contains about 16,000 souls. The population of the other cities, except Bairut, or Beritus, which has 7000 inhabitants, is not ascertained.\n\n21st, Damas, this includes the greater part of ancient Syria, extends over 26,850 square miles, and has a population of 1,250,000 souls. The province takes the name of its capital, Damas, or Damascus, which has about 200,000 inhabitants. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAMAH\">Hamah</a> has, according to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALI\">Ali</a> Bey, 100,000; Emessa, 30,000; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a>, according to the same traveller, 30,000 to 40,000; Razza, the ancient Gaza, 5000; Ramla, or Arimathea, 10,000; and Jaffa, or Joppa, 5000 inhabitants.\n\nThe Turkish government claims a kind of authority over some very large portions of Africa; but the local authorities can scarcely be considered as subjects of the Porte. The most important of these, Egypt, has been largely treated of in Part I, Vol. IV. of this Supplement. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> of Barbary, Algiers, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TUNIS\">Tunis</a>; and Tripoli, pay, when it suits them, some tribute as acknowledgment of dependance. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUBIA\">Nubia</a> has been recently subjected to the Pasha of Egypt; but it is hard to define how far that country can be considered as a branch of the Turkish empire, when the conqueror of it scarcely acknowledges his dependance. The limits allotted to this article will not allow us to draw up, even in a compressed form, such particulars as have reached us respecting the northern parts of Africa; and, indeed, they more properly belong to other articles.\n\nSee Present State of Turkey, &c. by William Thornton, London, 1815; Moeurs, Usages, Costumes, &c. de la Turque, Paris, 1812, par A.

That great continent, which had been hid from the eyes of civilized nations for so many ages, comprises nearly one-third of the habitable globe. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, it rivals the best parts of the old continent. It is not, like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>, infested by the larger and more dangerous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of wild animals, nor deformed by vast deserts, which present insuperable obstacles to civilization. But its great and peculiar advantage lies in the unrivalled magnitude and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of its navigable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>, which enable its most remote inland parts to hold commercial intercourse with each other, and with foreign <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, with unparalleled ease and rapidity. The position of these great rivers, whose estuaries all open to the east, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> out the western side of the old continent as the region with which it is destined by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> to be most closely connected. Two great classes of colonists, widely dissimilar in character and circumstances, came from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> to occupy this new world. The Spaniards, who were first in order of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, took possession of the most populous and fertile regions; but their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> advantages were rendered abortive by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> and moral evils,\u2014a rapacious spirit, a corrupt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, and a vicious system of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>. The English, the other great class of colonists, owed their better fortunes in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> disadvantages. Having neither <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, nor wealthy Indians to rob, they cultivated with greater diligence the natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a> of the soil, and laid the foundation of future prosperity in habits of order and industry. Neglected by the government as a band of destitute refugees, they enjoyed what was then an unusual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of civil and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>. Their industry flourished, because it was unfettered and unburdened. They were well governed, because they were left to govern themselves. And <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they wanted the aid of the mother <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> when that aid might sometimes have been useful, they were, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, exempted from those incessant exactions and vexations to which the Spanish colonists were exposed, from the ignorant, meddling, grasping, bigoted spirit of their European rulers. The troubles they experienced from the hostility of the Indians diminished as their own numbers increased, and, except at first, were never extremely detrimental. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> dangers served in some measure as a bond of union among themselves, and perhaps favoured their social improvement, by acting as a slightly compressing force to prevent the indefinite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFUSION\">diffusion</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> over a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> surface. To their free spirit, virtuous habits, intelligence, and industry, the English colonists certainly owed much of their early success; but we must not forget that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of fortunate changes, not directly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of their own exertions, have greatly contributed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> them in the enviable situation they now occupy. Had the Dutch, French, Danish, and Swedish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a> planted in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">North</a> America spread as fast and as far as those of England, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> separate and independent, we should have seen, in the space between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MISSISSIPPI\">Mississippi</a> and the Atlantic, the same medley of nations and languages, with the same diversity of manners, religion, institutions, and clashing interests, which foster everlasting feuds and jealousies in Europe, endanger desolating wars, load the people with oppressive taxes and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> tyrannies, and present a formidable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARRIER\">barrier</a> to the circulation of knowledge and the progress of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>. The conquests of England, which blended all these colonies into one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, have secured to the United States an exemption from half the evils which afflict civil society in Europe, and prepared for them a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAREER\">career</a> of peaceful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a> and growing prosperity, which divided Europe cannot hope to enjoy, and which has had no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> in the history of mankind. The people of the United States find themselves in a condition to devote their whole energies to the cultivation of their vast natural resources, undistracted by wars, unburdened by oppressive taxes, unfettered by old prejudices and corruptions. Enjoying the united advantages of an infant and a mature society, they are able to apply the highly refined science and art of Europe to the improvement of the virgin soil and unoccupied natural riches of America. They start unencumbered by a thousand evils, political and moral, which weigh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the energies of the old world. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of our history lies before them: they may adopt our improvements, avoid our errors, take warning from our sufferings, and with the combined lights of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> and their own, build up a more perfect form of society. Even already, they have given some momentous and some salutary truths to the world. It is their rapid growth which has first developed the astonishing results of the productive powers of population. We can now calculate with considerable certainty, that America, which yet presents to the eye, generally, the aspect of an untrodden forest, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a>, in the short space of one century, surpass Europe in the number of its inhabitants. We even hazard little in predicting, that, before the tide of civilization has rolled back to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> seats, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASSYRIA\">Assyria</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PALESTINE\">Palestine</a>, an intelligent population of two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> three hundred millions will have overspread the new world, and extended the empire of knowledge and the arts from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORN\">Horn</a> to Alayaska. Among this vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of civilized men, there will be but two languages spoken. The effect of this single circumstance in accelerating the progress of society can scarcely be calculated. What a field will then be opened to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of science, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a>, the popular writer, who addresses a hundred millions of educated persons?\u2014what a stimulus given to mental energy and social improvement, when every new idea, and every useful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIS\">dis</a>-\ncovery, will be communicated instantaneously to so great a mass of intelligent beings, by the electric agency of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POST\">post</a> and the press? With the united intellect and resources of a society framed on such a gigantic scale, what mighty designs will then be practicable? <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">Imagination</a> is lost in attempting to estimate the effects of such accumulated means and powers. One result, however, may be anticipated. America must then become the centre of knowledge, civilization, and power; and the present leading states of Europe (Russia perhaps excepted), placed on the arena amidst such colossal associates as the American Republics, will sink to a subordinate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>, and cease to exert any greater influence on the fate of the world than the Swiss Cantons do at the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>.\n\nThe territory of the United States is situated between the 25th and 49th degrees of north latitude, and between the 67th and 124th degrees of west <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a> from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>. Its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> length east and west is 2780 miles, its greatest breadth north and south 1230 miles, and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a>, according to Mr Mellish, 2,076,410 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> English miles. It is bounded on the east by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATLANTIC_OCEAN\">Atlantic Ocean</a>, on the north by the British possessions, on the west by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PACIFIC_OCEAN\">Pacific Ocean</a>, and on the south by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEXICO\">Mexico</a> and the Mexican <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GULF\">Gulf</a>. The Mississippi divides it into two parts nearly equal in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>. In the north-east <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> of this territory, there is a space of more than 100 miles square, of very barren ground, interposed between New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRUNSWICK\">Brunswick</a> and Lower <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CANADA\">Canada</a>, the possession of which has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> been the subject of negotiation between the British and American Governments. On the west <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> the Americans have an unquestioned claim to the country, between the 42d and 47th parallels; but Russia disputes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> of possession with them to the tract of country between the 49th and 60th parallel. As the admitted boundaries are in general very distinctly marked on the common maps, we shall not describe them in detail.\n\nTwo chains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> separate this extensive territory into three great natural divisions. 1. The Atlantic region, or the country lying east of the Alleghany mountains. 2. The valley of the Mississippi, or the country watered by the Mississippi, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MISSOURI\">Missouri</a>, and their numerous branches. 3. The Pacific region, or the country lying west of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROCKY_MOUNTAINS\">Rocky mountains</a>.\n\nThe Alleghany mountains commence in Lower Canada, below Quebec, and passing along the northern boundary of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAINE\">Maine</a>, and through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NEW_HAMPSHIRE\">New <a class=</a>\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAMPSHIRE\">Hampshire</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERMONT\">Vermont</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NEW_YORK\">New <a c</a>lass=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PENNSYLVANIA\">Pennsylvania</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGINIA\">Virginia</a>, and the two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAROLINAS\">Carolinas</a>, they terminate in the upper parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEORGIA\">Georgia</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALABAMA\">Alabama</a>, preserving a southwest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> throughout. They consist of three, four, five, or more distinct ridges, with wide and fertile valleys interposed. Their entire length is 1100 miles, their breadth varies from 110 to 150. In the northern half their height is greatest, but most unequal, detached peaks are numerous, and the ridges indistinctly marked. In the south, the ridges are lower, but better defined, and their summits are often distinguished by a very uniform continuous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a>. They attain their greatest height in New Hampshire, where Mount <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WASHINGTON\">Washington</a> has an elevation of 6600 feet. Their greatest height in New York is 3800, in Pennsylvania 2500, in Virginia 3900, in South Carolina 4000. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> height is said by Mr Mellish to be from 1000 to 1800 feet, but his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> is undoubtedly formed on wrong principles. That of the highest chain cannot be less than from 2000 to 2500 feet.*\n\nThe Rocky mountains, known but imperfectly, are a continuation of the Mexican Cordilleras, and extend to the Polar Ocean. They <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> through the territory of the United States, at the distance of 500 miles from the Pacific Ocean, and consist of several elevated chains, occupying a breadth of 300 miles, with deep valleys between them. They rise abruptly from their base, and are supposed to reach the elevation of 12,000 feet in their highest summits, many of which are covered with perpetual snow. There are, however, several passes through them, which, with a little improvement, might be traversed by loaded waggons.\u2020\n\nThe Atlantic Region was the first settled, and is the most populous and improved portion of the United States, but not the most favoured as to soil and climate. It may be considered as the eastern slope of the Alleghanies. Including all the countries watered by rivers flowing into the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico, east of the Mississippi, it is about 1700 miles in length, with an average breadth of 250, and embraces an area of 400,000 square miles. It includes three well marked varieties of soil and surface. 1. The alluvial district, consisting of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>, gravel, and clay, comprising a stripe of level <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, extending along the coast from New York southward, with a breadth varying from 20 miles to 100. The surface is level or slightly undulating; and it embraces large tracts of marsh near the coast. The soil is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a>, producing almost nothing but pines, except in the alluvial tracts which skirt the rivers. About one-half of the surface of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-NEW_JERSEY\">New <a cla</a>ss=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERSEY\">Jersey</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DELAWARE\">Delaware</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARYLAND\">Maryland</a>, one-fifth of Virginia, one-third of the Carolinas, Georgia, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLORIDA\">Florida</a>, and Alabama, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> under this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>. 2. The upland country, extending from the alluvial tract to the foot of the mountains, with a breadth varying from 20 to 200 miles. The soil here is chiefly formed from the detritus of the primitive rocks, and is generally fertile, and well adapted for tillage. 3. The ridges of the Alleghanies, and the valleys between them, which bear a strong growth of natural wood, have generally a rich soil capable of tillage, wherever the surface is not rocky or too steep; and are almost free from marshes. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of Pennsylvania, New York, and in\n\n---\n\n* Mellish's Geographical Description of United States, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILADELPHIA\">Philadelphia</a>, 1822, p. 20. Warden's Statistical, Political, and Historical Account of United States, 1819. Introduction.\n\u2020 Mellish, p. 21. James's Account of an Expedition from Pittsburg to the Rocky Mountains in 1819, 1820, Vol. III, p. 238. Warden, III. 161.\nthe six New England States, where the Alleghanies spread out into an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> broken surface, the soil possesses a mixed character. The northern parts of New England are mountainous, the southern hilly or uneven. The soil, comparatively speaking, is rocky, has little depth, and is better adapted for pasture than tillage, and improves generally as we advance inwards from the coast. The south-east <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> of New York corresponds in character with New England. But Pennsylvania contains the largest portion of good soil on the east side of the mountains, of all the old States. The woods originally covered all this Atlantic region, except some tracts called by the Americans prairies, on which, from causes not well explained, no natural growth of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a> exists. These are not meadows or wet grounds, as the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> might be supposed to indicate; but lands bare of wood, whether wet or dry, level or uneven. As the population thickens, the forests disappear; but even in the most densely peopled parts, the woodlands occupy so large a proportion of the surface, that the country generally presents, to the eye of a European, the aspect of a natural wilderness, but broken by patches of cultivation, which are numerous round the great cities, but grow less frequent as we recede from the shore, till they terminate in the boundless forests of the Alleghanies.\n\nThe basin or Valley of the Mississippi, which extends from the Alleghanies to the Rocky mountains, is not so large as the basin of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMAZON\">Amazon</a> by one-third, but being situated in the best part of the temperate zone, it may be pronounced the finest valley in the world. Its breadth east and west is 1400 miles; its length in the opposite direction 1200, and its area 1,400,000 square miles. It comprehends a great diversity of soil, surface, and climate. 1. The basin of the Ohio, including the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUMBERLAND\">Cumberland</a>, 700 miles long and 300 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, is a rich and beautiful country; the garden of the United States. The lower parts of the surface are from 500 to 800 feet above the level of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, and are finely diversified with round topped arable hills, rising 400 or 500 feet above their base. The rivers generally run in deep hollows, sometimes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> ravines, but often spreading out into valleys, which include lands of exuberant fertility. This district includes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KENTUCKY\">Kentucky</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TENNESSEE\">Tennessee</a>, with part of Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDIANA\">Indiana</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ILLINOIS\">Illinois</a>. 2. The territory extending from the basin of the Ohio north-westward to Lake Superior, including the country between the Missouri and Upper Mississippi. The surface is sometimes undulating, sometimes so level that the waters stagnate on it, till carried off by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a>; and it is not broken by any notable elevations, except one long ridge extending between the Missouri and Mississippi, and two low eminences called the Ocouch and Smoky mountains. The soil is naturally rich, and covered with luxuriant herbage; but the climate is severe, and the woods so thin, that the bare ground or prairies occupy three-fourths of the surface on the east side of the Mississippi, and nineteen-twentieths on the west. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> elevation of the northern parts is probably not under 1560 feet, for Cassina lake, 30 miles below the sources of the Mississippi, is 1330 feet above the sea. (Mellish, p. 32. James's Expedition, III. 204.) 3. The last and largest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of this great valley, extending from the Mississippi and Missouri to the Rocky mountains, consists of two very different qualities of soil, which graduate into each other, but, on the great scale, may be conceived to form two parallel tracts of nearly equal extent, parted by the 98th meridian. In the middle of the eastern section, and, as it were, in the very bottom of the great basin of the Mississippi, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> the Ozark mountains, a chain like the Alleghanies, of great length and breadth and small height, rising only from 1000 to 2000 feet above the sea. (James's Expedition, III. p. 313.) Mr Mellish erroneously calls the height 3500 feet. Their breadth is from 100 to 150 miles; their sides, which slope with gentle declivities, are deeply furrowed with streams, and partly covered with small timber. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol3.html#article-ARKANSAS\">Arkansas</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-RED_RIVER\"><a class=</a>\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">Red</a> River are the only streams which cut their way through this chain. On the east side of the Ozark chain is the Great Swamp, 200 miles long and 20 broad, which is converted into a lake by the annual overflow of the Mississippi, but is dry during the heats of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, and rendered impenetrable at all times by a thick growth of cypress. The country round it is rich bottom or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEADOW\">meadow</a> land, clothed with excellent timber. The country for one or two hundred miles west of the Ozarks is also good, but less wooded; and in the eastern section, taken altogether, the open ground occupies nineteen-twentieths of the surface. The western section, extending from the meridian of 98\u00b0 to the Rocky mountains, is comparatively dry and sterile, and much of it an absolute <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a>, destitute of herbage, and unfit for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> habitation. As we approach the mountains, the ground, which is at first hilly, subsides into smaller undulations, and these terminate in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> lands, nearly flat on the top, with steep, and sometimes precipitous sides, and rising 600 or 800 feet above the common level. These table lands, consisting of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> beds of sandstone and breccia, increase in number and diminish in extent, as we approach the base of the mountains, which is believed to have an elevation of 3000 feet above the sea. The desert aspect of the country, however, is not the effect of its elevation, but more probably of its aridity; for valleys among the mountains, which are still higher, are fertile. The rivers in this frightful solitude often spread out to a breadth of one or two miles, and dry up in the warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">Salt</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a> are numerous, and salt incrustations cover many square miles.

Of the basin of the Mississippi altogether, it may be observed, that the western side is a barren desert; the middle contains much good lands, but abounds in swamps; the east side, comprehending the basin of the Ohio, is the richest, and the most eligible for human habitation. The woods, in their natural state, increase continually as we advance from the Rocky mountains to the Atlantic, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a>, perhaps, that the summer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of atmospheric moisture, follow a similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a>.*\n\nThe Pacific Region extends from the Rocky mountains to the ocean, and (exclusive of disputed ground) from latitude 42\u00b0 to 49\u00b0, embracing an area of 300,000 square miles. It consists almost entirely of the basin of the Columbia river. A chain of mountains runs through it from south to north, about 150 miles from the coast, between which and the Rocky mountains there is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> valley, 300 miles broad, intersected by smaller chains, but well wooded and watered, and enjoying a pure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> and a fruitful soil. The land between the outer chain and the coast is nearly of the same description, but much lower, and overcharged with moisture from frequent and heavy rains. The climate is remarkably mild and equable, resembling that of France and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a> much more than that of the Atlantic coast. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FROST\">Frost</a> is rarely seen in winter at the mouth of Columbia river, though it is in the same latitude as Quebec, where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ICE\">ice</a> lasts five or six months.\u2020\n\nThe United States, whose territories almost touch the tropic on the one side, and reach to districts where frost lasts five or six months on the other, embrace greater varieties of climate than any other single state in the world. Generally speaking, the climate of the United States is distinguished from that of Europe by three peculiarities. 1. It is absolutely colder for the corresponding degrees of latitude, the mean temperature of the year, according to Humboldt, being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> degrees of Fahrenheit lower on the east coast of America than on the west coast of Europe at the latitude of 40\u00b0, and 12\u00bd\u00b0 lower at the latitude of 50\u00b0. 2. The thermometer has a greater range, as the heat of summer and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> of winter reach greater extremes. 3. The climate changes more rapidly as we proceed from south to north, or a greater variety of climates is comprised within the same range of latitude. The mean temperature of Quebec, at one extremity, is 42\u00b0, and of Cape Sable, at the other, 72.7\u00b0. Between the parallels of 38 and 50, a degree of latitude which make a change of 1.13\u00b0 (Fahrenheit) in Europe, makes a change of 1.57\u00b0 in the United States; and the same annual temperature which is found at a given degree of latitude in the United States, is found <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> degrees farther north in Europe. The seasons are also very differently distributed. Philadelphia, for instance, has the summers of Rome and the winters of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIENNA\">Vienna</a>. In Florida, at New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORLEANS\">Orleans</a>, and at St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>'s in Georgia, snow is never seen; but in Pennsylvania snow lasts three months, in Massachusetts four, and in Maine five.\u2021 In the two latter states, the ice bears loaded waggons, and the sea is sometimes frozen to a considerable distance from the coast. In all the low country, from Florida to the St Lawrence, the extreme summer heat is nearly the same, from 90\u00b0 to 98\u00b0, and the varieties of climate are marked chiefly by the intensity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> of the winter's cold. The climate in the basin of the Ohio, compared with that of the Atlantic coast, possesses no very striking peculiarities, but seems, on the whole, to have its mean annual heat a little higher, to be rather more steady and equable, to be less frequently visited by the frigorific northwest winds, and to have fits of cold weather almost equally severe, but more transitory. The great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a> appear to mitigate the winter cold in the country immediately around them, and probably in the basin of the Ohio too, for on the west and north-west of this district the climate is much more rigorous. At <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNCIL\">Council</a> Bluffs, on the Missouri, in latitude 41\u00bd\u00b0, the thermometer descends to \u201422\u00b0 in winter, and rises to 105\u00b0 in summer. At St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a>'s Fort, on the Mississippi, in latitude 45\u00b0, it ranges from 92\u00b0 to \u201430\u00b0, and the mean temperature of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> is about Zero. The absolute height of the fort, which cannot exceed 1000 feet, does not account for this excessive cold. We have already mentioned the equable temperature of the basin of the Columbia; and, from the observations made on the Missouri and Upper Mississippi, we have reason to believe that the mildest and the most rigorous winters known in any similar latitude are to be found at once on the opposite sides of the great rampart of the Rocky mountains. (On the subject of Climate, see Mellish, p. 59\u201477.)\n\nSo many local circumstances affect the annual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> and depth of rain, that little confidence can be put in general estimates. We find that it was 42 inches at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARLESTOWN\">Charlestown</a>, on an average of some years, 40 at Natchez, 30 at Philadelphia, 26 at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CINCINNATI\">Cincinnati</a>. The mean fall of rain for the inhabited part of the United States (latitude 41\u00b0) should be about 34 inches. (See the Article PHYSICAL <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">GEOGRAPHY</a>.) The frequent failure of the streams, and the scarcity of verdure in the country near the Rocky mountains, indicates a deficiency of atmospheric moisture in that region. Snow falls to the greatest depth on the borders of the great lakes. On the sea coast it is rarely seen farther south than Northfolk, latitude 37\u00b0; but in the interior, it is found four or five degrees farther south. Compared with the middle countries of Europe, the United States, occupying a more southern position, have rains more regular and heavy,\n\n* This account of the basin of the Mississippi is entirely taken from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJOR\">Major</a> Long's Memoir, published in the third volume of James's Account of the Expedition to the Rocky Mountains.\n\n\u2020 Morse's American <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">Universal</a> Geography, 7th edition, 1819, Vol. I. p. 671.

A moist and warm south or south-west <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>, which is supposed to be a branch of the trade-wind, and is felt all over the Atlantic States as far as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POTOMAC\">Potomac</a>, and occasionally in New England. 2. Another wind, possessing the same qualities, and believed also to be a branch of the trade-wind; it blows from the Mexican Gulf up the course of the Mississippi, and seems to send off subordinate branches, which ascend the courses of the Ohio and Missouri. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOUISIANA\">Louisiana</a> and Arkansas, it is a south wind; at Council Bluffs, on Missouri, it is a southeast; and in Ohio and Kentucky, a south-west wind. It is the prevailing wind in all these districts. 3. The north-west blows occasionally on the west side of the Alleghanies, but more frequently on the east side, and is most prevalent in New England. It everywhere produces intense cold, depressing the thermometer to $-7\u00b0$ or $-8\u00b0$ in Ohio, and sometimes to $-29\u00b0$ in Massachusetts. 4. The north-east is a cold wind, which, transporting the fogs of the Newfoundland <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a>, occasions showers of snow. Various facts observed in the United States seem to show, what some meteorologists have doubted, that clearing and cultivation improve the climate, at least so far as regards the growth of the cerealia.*\n\nIf we draw a line from New York to the east end of Lake <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ONTARIO\">Ontario</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENINSULA\">peninsula</a> lying north-eastward between the St Lawrence and the sea consists of primitive rocks, interspersed with some patches of secondary. From this line southward, the country has a different geological character. A belt of alluvial soil, beginning at Long Island, extends along the shore of all the southern states to Natchez on the Mississippi, having an average breadth of a hundred miles, and including, probably, all Florida, except some high ground in the interior. It is everywhere penetrated by the tide <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> in the rivers. On the west side of this is a region of primitive rocks, from 100 to 200 miles broad, in which gneiss predominates. It embraces the eastern ridges of the Alleghanies, with the rolling country at their foot. On the west side of this, again, is a long narrow zone of transition rocks, including the western ridges of the Alleghanies, and extending from Lake Champlain to the north-west angle of Georgia. From this transition formation, which forms, as it were, the eastern edge of the basin of the Mississippi, immense beds of secondary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">limestone</a>, sandstone, and shale, cover the country to the Rocky mountains, interrupted only by the alluvial formations on the banks of the rivers, and by the Ozark mountains. These mountains are formed, like the Alleghanies, of the same formations, disposed in the same order. The Rocky mountains, so far as they have been explored, consist of primitive rocks, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANITE\">granite</a>, gneiss, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTZ\">quartz</a> rock, &c., covered on the east side by an extensive formation of old red sandstone.\u2020\n\nThat important mineral, coal, is found on both sides of the Alleghanies. The two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> formations on the east side are, 1. On the river Apomatox, above <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RICHMOND\">Richmond</a> (Virginia), where a seam of excellent coal, which occupies a basin 20 miles long and 10 broad, has been long worked, and employs 5000 persons; 2. At various spots along a narrow tract of country, from the sources of the Juniata and western Susquehannah to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">Providence</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">Bay</a>. At Lehigh, and other parts within this district, the coal is worked. On the western side of the Alleghanies, an immense formation of coal, probably the largest in the world, extends from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> waters of the Ohio southward to those of the Tombigbee, and westward, with some interruptions, beyond the Mississippi. A similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a> appears on the west side of the Ozarks, which is also traced far up the course of the Missouri; and there is a third bed, of unknown extent, on the east side of the Rocky mountains.\u2021\n\nSalt, another mineral of primary importance, is distributed in considerable abundance over the United States territory, especially those parts that are remote from the sea. A great formation of rock salt (and gypsum), indicated by numerous salt springs, is believed to accompany the coal formation over a great part of the basin of the Mississippi. Salt springs are numerous at the foot of the Rocky mountains, and extensive plains occur covered with salt, one of which, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">Grand</a> Saline, is 30 miles in circumference, and in hot weather is covered with a crust of clear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> salt, from two to six inches deep, and superior in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> to manufactured salt. On the east side of the Alleghanies, salt is generally obtained from the ocean, or imported.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">Iron</a> is found in nearly all the States, and is worked to such an extent, that of 50,000 tons consumed, according to computation, in the country, only 10,000 are imported. (Morse, I. 236.) A bed of magnetic iron ore, from eight to twelve feet thick in gneiss, and another from two to twenty feet, extend, with some interruptions, from the White mountains, on the one side, and from Lake Champlain, on the other, to the northern limits of New Jersey. Iron ore, of various kinds, is also met with in Maryland and Virginia. On the west side of the Alleghanies it is abundant, and is extensively worked at Pittsburgh, and in Kentucky and Tennessee. The whole number of furnaces, forges, and bloomeries, in 1810, was 530. Ores of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a> are smelted in New Jersey, and are found in various other parts of the Union. Native copper is said to exist in great quantities near the river St Croix, in the north-west territory; but at present, the United States are supplied with this metal chiefly from Mexico. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">Lead</a> is\n\n* Warden, Vol. I. p. 289, 355.

(Mellish, 366.) Gold and silver are met with, but only in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> quantities. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">Mercury</a> and tin have not been found. Cobalt, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTIMONY\">antimony</a>, manganese, and ores of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZINC\">zinc</a>, occur in some few spots. Nitre is obtained in vast quantities from the limestone caves in Kentucky. On a general view, it may be said that the United States, so far as explored, are nearly destitute of the precious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a>, but have a supply of coal, salt, iron, lead, and probably copper, adequate to their own consumption.\n\nThe United States have no considerable lake, entirely within their territory, except <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MICHIGAN\">Michigan</a>. But a series of fresh water lakes, by far the largest in the world (for the Caspian Sea is salt), and connected with one another by the St Lawrence, extend along their northern frontier. The following is their extent, and their elevation above the level of the sea:\n\n| Lakes     | Length | Breadth | Area   | Height in Feet |\n|-----------|--------|---------|--------|----------------|\n| Superior  | 350    | 150     | 35,000 | 642            |\n| Huron     | 220    | 150     | 17,000 | 589            |\n| Michigan  | 310    | 70      | 18,000 | \u2014              |\n| St Clair  | 30     | 30      | 900    | 570            |\n| Erie      | 230    | 55      | 10,300 | 560            |\n| Ontario   | 170    | 50      | 7,200  | 110            |\n\nReckoning from Quebec to the western extremity of Superior, these lakes afford a line of 1550 miles of inland <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a>, which will be increased to 4500 miles if we include the whole extent of their shores. But Quebec is far from the open sea, and the shortest and best route to the Atlantic from Lake Erie and the waters above will be by the New York canal. Lake Erie is about twenty fathoms in average depth, Ontario eighty, and Lakes Huron, Michigan, and Superior, are said to be still deeper. All these inland waters can be navigated with advantage; and will be crowded with vessels at some future <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, when an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> population covers the north-west territory. The principal interruptions at present are, 1st, At the rapids between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTREAL\">Montreal</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KINGSTON\">Kingston</a>, where it is proposed to cut a canal. 2d, At the rapids and the great fall of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NIAGARA\">Niagara</a>, where a canal is also projected. 3d, In the stream of the river between Lakes Huron and Erie, where there are also rapids, and in Lake St Clair, which is full of shallows. 4th, At the falls of St Mary, between Huron and Superior, amounting to twenty-three feet in half a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILE\">mile</a>. All these obstructions, it is believed, can be surmounted by art. These various lakes evidently occupy the bottom of a raised plateau, the outer sides of which are not very distant; and hence they receive very few rivers of any magnitude. Their shores are beset with ice for two, three, or four months in the year.\n\nLake George, 36 miles long and 7 broad, pours its waters into Lake Champlain, which is 160 miles long and 18 broad, and communicates by the River Sorelle with the St Lawrence. A canal, 22 miles long, now nearly finished, connects Lake Champlain with the Hudson. We pass over the other lakes of smaller size.\n\nThe rivers of the United States belong to four different systems; 1st, Those which water the Atlantic region. 2d, The Mississippi and its branches, which water the great central valley of North America. 3d, Those which flow into the St Lawrence; and, 4th, The Columbia and its tributaries, which flow into the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe rivers which fall into the Atlantic, and the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, from Maine to the eastern boundary of Louisiana, all rise in the Alleghanies, except the Susquehannah and the Hudson, which pass entirely through the principal chains. Their length varies from 200 to 450 miles, increasing gradually with the breadth of the level country, as we advance southward. The tide-water ascends in all these rivers to the outer boundary of the primitive formations, where falls regularly occur, except on the Hudson. In this river, the tide reaches to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALBANY\">Albany</a>, 160 miles from its mouth, to which point there is an uninterrupted navigation for sloops of 80 tons. This peculiar advantage has made the Hudson the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of a more active inland trade than any river, perhaps, in the world, of the same magnitude. Tide navigation reaches a very short way up the great rivers in the northern states generally; but in those south of the Susquehannah, it reaches generally from 100 to 130 miles. Boats ply on these rivers much farther up, but the navigation is seldom uninterrupted. The following are the principal rivers on the Atlantic side, with their approximate lengths.\n\n| Miles | Miles |\n|-------|-------|\n| Connecticu | 290   |\n| Hudson    | 300   |\n| Delaware  | 270   |\n| Susquehannah | 350 |\n| Potowmac  | 260   |\n| James' River | 200 |\n| Roanoke   | 230   |\n| Pedee     | 290   |\n| Santee    | 300   |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVANNAH\">Savannah</a>  | 280   |\n| Catahouche| 400   |\n| Alabama   | 440   |\n\nThe rivers that fall into the St Lawrence, and its lakes, are comparatively small, and probably do not carry off one-tenth part of the water that falls on the east side of the Mississippi. The most considerable are the Fox River, which falls into Lake Michigan, the Miami of Lake Erie, the Genesee, and Seneca of Lake Ontario, and the Sorelre or Richlieu, which joins the St Lawrence below Montreal.\n\nThe majestic Mississippi <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAINS\">drains</a> a greater surface than any river in the world, except the Amazon, and in the magnitude of its stream is only surpassed by the Amazon and the Plata. It has been computed to convey to the Mexican Gulf $\\frac{1}{3}$ of all the water which the ocean receives from the dry land. (See Physical Geography.) The extreme length of the Mississippi Proper, including all its sinuosities, is generally computed to be 2500 miles, but reckoning to the head of the Missouri, which is the largest branch, it is nearly 4000. It has three bars at its mouth, the deepest of which affords only 17 feet of water. (Warden, I. 114.)\nSloops of this draught can navigate to Natchez, 350 miles from its mouth. There is depth sufficient at all times for sloops <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> six feet to the Ohio, and for vessels drawing three feet to the junction with the Missouri. (James's Expedition, III. 258.) But, during the floods in May, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a>, the waters rise 50 feet, and are then navigable by vessels of any size. The Mississippi, from its junction with the Ohio to the sea, is about 1000 yards, or two-thirds of a mile in width, and below Red River it is about 120 feet deep. From the junction of the Arkansas, its banks form an elevated ridge or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATFORM\">platform</a>, which support the stream at the height of ten or twenty feet above the level of the adjacent lands. In its floods, it sometimes bursts the barriers which confine it, and inundates the flat country below. Of the two great branches, the Missouri, and Mississippi Proper, the former stream is the larger, and more rapid, and also more turbid, from the quantity of travelled soil it transports. But its waters, generally occupying a wider channel, are more loaded with bars and sand-banks, and the navigation is more intricate. (James's Expedition, III. 259.) The Platte, Kansas, and some other tributaries of the Missouri, often spread out to a breadth of one or two miles, and during the warm season, dry up entirely. But these, and all the branches of both rivers, generally admit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a> navigation for nine-tenths of their course, during a longer or shorter period every year. In the Ohio, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOATING\">boating</a> season is from 20th February to the middle of June. Before this period the waters are ice-bound; after it, they are too shallow, except for very small craft. The length of the Mississippi, from its mouth to the junction of the Ohio, is about 1200 miles, and to its junction with the Missouri, 1300. The length of the Missouri, above the junction to its remotest branch, is, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEWIS\">Lewis</a>' and Clarke's measurement, 2575 miles. The length of the Ohio, above the point of confluence, is 1188 miles. The other large branches of the Mississippi are the Red River and Arkansas, in the lower part of its course. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> tributaries of the Missouri are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OSAGE\">Osage</a>, Platte, Kansas, and Yellowstone; of the Ohio, the Tennessee, Cumberland, and Wabash. The whole extent of the navigable waters above the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi has been estimated at 23,000 miles, to which, if we add 12,000 for the Ohio, Arkansas, Red River, &c. and their branches, we shall have 35,000 miles of boat navigation in the basin of the Mississippi. To this we may add 10,000 miles more for the eastern section of the States, with 5000 for the lakes and their tributary streams, and 2000 for the River Columbia, making altogether 51,000 miles of river navigation, which is probably three times greater than all the rivers of Europe afford. Except in New England, Pennsylvania, and New York, the rivers of the United States flow over a surface which has rather a small declivity. Of the two sides of the great central valley, the western in the steepest. The base of the Rocky mountains is computed to have an elevation of 3000 feet. That of the beds of the rivers, where they begin to be navigable, may be about 2000; and estimating their average length of course to the sea to be about 2500 miles, the mean fall will be about nine or ten inches per mile. The Mississippi Proper, at 2500 miles from the sea, has a height of 1330 feet, or a mean fall of six or seven inches per mile. The Ohio, at Pittsburgh, 2200 miles from the sea, has a height of 600 feet, or a mean fall of four inches. In the Amazon and the Ganges, from the point where they leave the mountains, and in the Wolga, from its source, the average rate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> is from four to five inches per mile. In the middle and south of Europe, generally, the fall of the rivers is probably twice as great.\n\nThe variety of cultivated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> in North America corresponds to the diversity of its climates. At one extremity, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANE\">cane</a> of the tropical regions thrives, and at the other, oats and barley, the staple crops of the Arctic regions, are leading <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of cultivation. The high summer heat, however, in all parts of the United States, makes some plants, which cannot be raised in England, succeed in the coldest districts of the north. Of this description is maize, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> corn, an indigenous American plant, which is cultivated from Maine to Louisiana. It is a vegetable in universal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> in the United States, yields generally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> the produce of wheat, and is adapted to a greater variety of situations. The maple tree, which grows in all the States, yields a juice from which sugar is made. Nearly ten millions of pounds of maple sugar were made in 1810. Wheat is raised from one extremity of the Union to the other, but succeeds best in the middle and western States, and in the uplands of the southern. The cultivation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOBACCO\">tobacco</a> begins in Maryland, about the parallel of 39\u00b0 or 40\u00b0, and continues through all the southern States, and through those in the west, south of the Ohio. The climate favourable for cotton is not found farther north than about the latitude of 37\u00b0, though it can be raised as far north as 39\u00b0 on both sides of the mountains. The best grows in South Carolina and Georgia, in dry situations upon the sea coast. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICE\">rice</a> crops, which require a marshy soil, and a great heat, commence about the same parallel with cotton, and have nearly the same geographical range. The sugar cane grows in low and warm situations, as high as the latitude of 33\u00b0, but the climate favourable for its cultivation does not extend beyond 31\u00bd\u00b0. Oats, barley, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEMP\">hemp</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAX\">flax</a>, succeed well, except in the low grounds of the southern States. The vine can be advantageously raised as far north as Pennsylvania. The olive, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">orange</a>, lemon, and fig, are injured by the frost in South Carolina, but it is believed, that these trees, as well as the banana, will succeed in Florida.\u2020 The forest trees of the United States com-\n\n* Physical Geog. in this Supplement. Warden, I. 115. Mellish, 32. Major Long's Memoir in James's Expedition, with the Sectional Maps.\n\u2020 Warden's Introduction, 27. II. 399. III. 222. Humboldt, Proleg. 156.\nThe United States contain about one-fourth of the known species of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRUPEDS\">quadrupeds</a>. Some are common to both continents, others are peculiar to the western. Comparing individuals of the same species, some are perfectly similar; between others there is some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> in size, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, or other circumstances. In a few instances, the animal of the eastern continent is larger than the American; in most the reverse is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>. The following is a catalogue of the quadrupeds of the United States.\n\nMammoth (an extinct species), Kineagou, Bison or Buffalo, Weasel, Moose Deer, Ermine, Caribou, Martin, Red Deer, Mink, Fallow Deer, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OTTER\">Otter</a>, Roe, Fisher, Bear, Skunk, Wolverine, Opossum, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WOLF\">Wolf</a>, Wood-Chuck, Fox, Urchin, Catamount, Hare, Spotted Tiger, Raccoon, Sallow Cougar, Fox Squirrel, Gray Cougar, Gray Squirrel, Mountain Cat, Red Squirrel,\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">Flying</a> Squirrel, Field Mouse, \u2014 Bat, Ground Mouse, Wood Cat, American <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-RAT\">Rat</a>, Shrew Mouse, Purple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MOLE\">Mole</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">Black</a> Mole, Water Rat, Beaver, Musquash, Morse, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEAL\">Seal</a>, Manati, Sapajou, Sagoin.\n\nNine-tenths of these animals yield a fur, which is used for dress or in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a>. The bison, or wild ox (improperly called the buffalo), is, according to some American naturalists, of the same species with the common neat cattle of the United States, the difference being the effect of the domestication of the latter. Buffon, however, thinks otherwise. The bison is larger than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> ox, has a fleshy or grisly substance extending along his shoulders and back, and has on his neck and shoulders a woolly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>, which admits of being spun or wrought into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-HATS\">hats</a>. The moose-deer, now rare, is a gigantic animal, one variety sometimes reaching the height of 12 feet. The caribou is probably the reindeer of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCANDINAVIA\">Scandinavia</a>. The bear is of two species. The short-legged lives chiefly on vegetable food, and is probably not carnivorous. He dozes away the winter in a torpid state, sucking his paws, and expending the fat he had previously acquired. The ranging bear is larger, but more lean. He destroys calves, sheep, pigs, and sometimes children, and in winter migrates southward. The wolf, like the bear, is found in all the States. It is a voracious animal, stealing into sheepfolds at night, attacking deer, hogs, and small cattle, and sometimes hunting in packs. The catamount is of the size of a large dog, and extremely ferocious, but it is rarely seen. The spotted tiger is scarcely seen, except near Louisiana. It is from five to six feet long. The United States, cougar or American <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-PANTHER\">panther</a> is about the same size, but more common. It destroys sheep, calves, and hogs, and, when hungry, will attack large cattle. The urchin differs in several respects from the European hedgehog. The lion, leopard, striped or true tiger, hyena, elephant, rhinoceros, hippopotamus, camelopard, are unknown in the New World. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>, the ass, the sheep, the goat, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HOG\">hog</a>, and the camel, did not originally exist there, but have been naturalized. The latter, however, are not numerous, and have never been introduced into the United States. Of the birds and reptiles our limits will not allow us to speak in detail. The eagle, pheasant, grouse, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PARTRIDGE\">partridge</a>, swan, Canadian goose, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PTARMIGAN\">ptarmigan</a>, are less or more numerous. In general, the small birds of America surpass those of Europe in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> of their plumage; but are much inferior to them in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MELODY\">melody</a> of their notes. Among the reptiles, the most remarkable is the alligator or American crocodile, from 12 to 25 feet long, very strong and active. Of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERPENTS\">serpents</a>, the rattlesnake, from four to six feet long, is the most formidable.*\n\nPerhaps no single circumstance connected with the United States has attracted so much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> as the rapid growth of their population. Philosophers had shown, from the laws which govern propagation, that the human species might double its numbers in a short period. But this was only known as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, applicable, it was supposed, to small tribes under extraordinary circumstances, but not to a great nation of many millions. The Spanish colonies, planted a hundred years earlier than the United States, should have made this principle familiar to the world long ago, but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> and misgovernment, intercepting the bounty of nature, inflicted all the vices and evils of old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a> upon these colonies, and a jealous policy threw a veil of secrecy over their condition.\n\nThe first European emigrants settled in the United States in 1607. From that period, colonists continued to flock to the country in small parties or large bodies. The last new settlement on a considerable scale was in 1733, when, by means of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> of L 10,000 from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a>, and various sums raised by private contributions, 618 persons were sent out from England to Georgia.\u2020 The growth of the colonies was rapid and obvious; but much more of it was probably attributed to the influx of settlers from the mother country than was consistent with the truth. No accurate enumeration of the inhabitants was made till the first census was taken in 1790. That for the year 1753, in Marshall's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">Life</a> of Washington, is undoubtedly erroneous. The ratio of increase being ascertained by the four separate enumerations, and having continued remarkably uniform for forty years, we can now, by calculating backwards, obtain results more deserving of confidence than the rude guesses made from uncertain\n\n---\n\n* Morse, Vol. I. p. 263, &c. Warden, Chap. 6. Buffon's Quadrupeds, Vol. II. London edit. 1775.\n\u2020 For an account of this and the earlier settlements, the reader may consult the History of the British Empire in America, 2 vols. 8vo, Lond. 1741.\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATA\">data</a>. The period of doubling at present is 24\u00bd years; but, taking it at 25 years, and reckoning backwards from 1790, we find the population at the under mentioned periods would be\u2014\n\n| Year | Population |\n|------|------------|\n| 1790 | 3,921,000  |\n| 1765 | 1,980,000  |\n| 1740 | 980,000    |\n\nBeyond the last mentioned period we cannot, for obvious reasons, carry our calculation. If we suppose 1000 settlers to have come from Europe annually for the first 33 years, these, by natural multiplication, would amount to about 60,000 at the time alluded to, that is, in 1640. The following Table, constructed from documents afforded by Seybert and Mellish, with several new calculations, gives an interesting view of the progressive changes in the different states, and in the two great classes of the population.\n\n| States or Territories | Population including Slaves | In 30 Years each 100 Inhabitants increased to | Slaves | For each 100 Free Inhabitants the number of

unequal for the different sections of the Union. The older states of Connecticut and Massachusetts have only added one-fifth to their population, in the same period in which the new states of Kentucky and Ohio have quadrupled theirs. The reason obviously is, that the more densely peopled parts of the Union, and, in particular, New England, serve as a nursery to the new states, to which they are continually sending out large draughts of emigrants. There is thus a constant stream of population pouring across the Alleghenies, from the east side to the west, to occupy the vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> of the Mississippi; and by this gradual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a> of a mighty people, as it were from a central stock, a uniformity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, manners, and institutions, is diffused over the whole, which will cement their union, in spite of local diversities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>, and which promises to make the countless millions, who will by and by cover North America, from sea to sea, more truly one people than the inhabitants of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUSTRIA\">Austria</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUSSIA\">Prussia</a>, France, Spain, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, are at this day.\n\nIf we calculate prospectively from the present rate...\nof increase, assuming that it will continue permanent for some time, the population, at the undermentioned periods, will be,\n\n1845 ... 20,000,000, 1895 ... 80,000,000,\n1870 ... 40,000,000, 1920 ... 160,000,000.\n\nBefore this last result is realized, some retardation will probably take place in the rate of increase. But even were the vast population alluded to in existence, the average density for the whole territory would not be greater than it is at this day in Massachusetts, and only half as great as in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, France, and the British Isles.\n\nThe rapid growth of the population in America becomes much more striking when we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTRAST\">contrast</a> it with the scarcely perceptible progress of communities in the Old World. France, which had 19,094,000 inhabitants in 1700, according to the enumeration of Marshal Vauban, had 26,363,000 in 1791. Now, according to the rate of increase which this indicates, that country would have doubled its population in 195 years; but the population of the United States in the same period would have increased to 220 times its first amount. The following table, which we have calculated from the best data to be obtained, shows the comparative rate of increase in different countries.\n\n| Annual Increase on each 10,000 Persons | Period of Doubling |\n|----------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| United States (according to census of 1810 and 1820) | 291 | 211/2 years |\n| France, from 1700 to 1791, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DITTO\">Ditto</a> \u2014\u2014 1791 to 1821, England \u2014\u2014 1801 to 1821, Europe for the last 30 years | 34 | 195 |\n| | 48 | 144 |\n| | 137 | 51 |\n| | 76 | 90 |\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SLAVERY\">Slavery</a> is nearly extinguished in all the New England States, and is hastening to its extinction in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, and Delaware. In Ohio it does not exist. In Indiana and Illinois it will soon cease. In Maryland, though there has been a small absolute increase in the slave population, their number, compared with that of the whites, has diminished. In two important circumstances there is a wide difference between slavery as it exists in North America, and in the West Indies. In the former, the number of slaves nowhere equals that of the free inhabitants, except in South Carolina, where there is a trifling excess of the former,\u2014and in the States where slavery exists, taken altogether (excluding those northward of Kentucky and Delaware), the blacks form only one-third of the population. But in the West <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">Islands</a>, the blacks are ten, or sometimes twenty times more numerous than the whites.* In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> place, it is well known that the slaves in the West Indies continually decrease, and would speedily die out, unless kept up by new importations; but, in the United States, they double their numbers in 29\u00bd years, without any importation whatever. It may be safely said, that the superior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a> of the Americans in the treatment of the blacks is the greatest obstacle to that abolition of slavery which they so ardently wish to accomplish, and that, were their slaves worked and fed like those in the West Indies, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of blacks, instead of multiplying tenfold in the course of one century, would be entirely extinguished. The existence of slavery is a bequest from Britain; it is not the crime of the Americans, but their misfortune. It is an evil which they deplore, and of which they would gladly rid themselves if they knew how. The difficulty is, how to dispose of the slaves, whom many would be willing to manumit. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of carrying them back to a colony on the African coast seems absolutely chimerical; and the strong distinction of colour, with the rooted prejudices of the whites, form an insuperable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> to such an amalgamation of the two races as took place when the serfs of Western Europe were incorporated with the freemen in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Time alone promises a certain alleviation of the evil, though not an absolute cure. If we separate the white and black races, the former double their numbers in 23\u00bd years, and the latter in 29\u00bd, a difference apparently trifling, but which produces important results, if we reckon forwards. Supposing the ratio of increase to remain steady, in 118 years the slaves will have multiplied to 16 times, and the whites to 32 times their present numbers. And in this period, the relative proportions of the two races would be so changed, that the slaves, who form at present 1/9 of the population, would then form only 3/4 or 1/12th. If we add the free blacks, indeed, the increase is more rapid than here assumed, but we throw these out as a compensation for the mulatto or mixed race, who are the progeny, not of blacks alone, but of blacks and whites, and a large part of whom must ultimately melt into the mass of the white population.\n\nIn France and England, and probably in Europe at large, the females exceed the males by 2 or 3 per cent.; but, in the United States generally, the males exceed the females by nearly 4 per cent. In the newest States, the excess is as high as 19 per cent. (Seybert, p. 42.) The difference is still more striking in what relates to ages. In the United States, children form a much greater, and aged persons a much smaller, proportion of the population than in Europe. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a>, according to Wargentin's Tables, the persons under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of 16 form 36 per cent. of the population; in Britain, according to the last census, 40, and in the United States 50 per cent. The persons aged above 45 form 22 per cent. of the whole population in Sweden, 18 per cent. in Britain, and 12 per cent. in the United States. This peculiarity arises from the rapidly progressive state of the population. Since the inhabitants of the United States quadruple their numbers in 50 years, a person born half a century ago belongs by his birth to a society of two millions and a half of persons, but now lives in a society of ten millions, which will fur-\n\n* Colquhoun's Wealth, Power, and Resources of the British Empire, p. 40.\nnish four times as many old men to a future and equidistant period. The annual amount of immigration (to borrow an American word) is very variable, and its effects have been greatly overrated. The whole number of passengers who arrived, in 1817, at the ten principal ports, was 22,240, including citizens and persons on business who did not mean to remain in the country. In 1816, it was estimated at 20,000; in 1818 and 1819, at 28,000 each, not more than one-half of whom, very probably, were strangers come to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a>. In 1820, the true number of immigrants, according to the National <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-CALENDAR\">Calendar</a>, was 7001, of whom 5042 were males, consisting of 997 agricultural persons, 1461 commercial, 1407 manufacturers, artisans, &c. Dr Seybert thinks the average number of foreigners who come to settle in the United States does not exceed 6000 per annum; but assuming it to be 8000 or 9000, this is only from $\\frac{3}{10}$ to $\\frac{3}{5}$ of the whole annual increment, which must amount to 290,000 persons to make the population double in 24 years.*\n\nThis rapid increase does not greatly affect the rate of the annual mortality, which is proportionally rather greater among the persons under 25 than among those of all ages. In the absence of proper data for ascertaining the annual mortality of the whole country, or of any single state, we can only refer to a single fact. The average number of deaths in Philadelphia, for eight years (1807 to 1814), was found to be about $\\frac{1}{5}$ of the contemporaneous population. (Seybert, p. 50.) In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BIRMINGHAM\">Birmingham</a>, in the ten years ending 1811, it was about $\\frac{1}{5}$, in London $\\frac{1}{5}$, and in all England, including the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">navy</a>, about $\\frac{1}{5}$ or $\\frac{1}{5}$. (Milne's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ANNUITIES\">Annuities</a>, p. 456.) This single fact, therefore, so far as it goes, bears testimony to the salubrity of the climate, and to the comfortable condition of the inhabitants of the United States.\n\nThe active population in the United States is proportionally greater, and the idle population less than in any other country. They have few public functionaries, preachers, or auxiliaries, and a very small army and navy. According to a table which will be found farther on, the active population amounts to 27 per cent. of the whole, or 2 per cent. more than the number of males above the age of 16. The proportions employed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>, manufactures, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>, according to the census of 1820 were\u2014\n\n- Agriculture, .................. 83.7 per cent.\n- Manufactures, .................. 13.5\n- Commerce, .................. 2.8\n\nBut the number assigned to commerce evidently does not include mariners, or includes only those who resided on shore at the time the census was taken.

The average wages of a labourer were estimated at 75 cents a day by Mr Blodget, and more recently at 80 cents by Mr Niles, wheat being 1\u00bd dollar per bushel. (Warden, Introduction.) In such circumstances, a very moderate degree of industry suffices to place a man above want, and pauperism can only be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOT\">lot</a> of those who are debilitated by old age or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>. Accordingly, it is a proud distinction for North America, that this moral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEFORMITY\">deformity</a>, except so far as it is the consequence of natural and unavoidable misfortunes, is almost unknown within her borders. It is not there as in the old countries of Europe, where a person, who is able to provide comfortably for his own wants, has still his feelings exposed to daily laceration from the sight of multitudes of miserable beings, who exhibit human nature in its most loathsome and degraded state, and whose wretchedness it is beyond his power to relieve. It is Rochefoucault, we think, who remarks, that he had seen only one beggar in the United States. Mendicity does exist, but except in the large cities where foreigners are often found in a state of destitution, it rarely obtrudes itself on the eye, and may be said generally to be as rare in that country as it is abundant everywhere else. In Europe, the paupers have been supped, on a rough calculation, to amount to one-twentieth part of the population. In the United States, they were estimated by Mr Niles, some years ago, at one person in 250 on the Atlantic coast, and one in 350 in the interior. But, in times of great public calamity, the proportion is much higher. In the New England States, and in some of the others, though not the whole, each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> is obliged to provide for the support of its own poor, according to the humane spirit of the English laws. (Morse, Vol. I. 293. Warden, passim.)\n\nThe North American Union comprehends at present twenty-four distinct States, each governed by its own constitution; three territories, in which civil governments are established, without constitutions; and\nthree other territories, which are yet unoccupied by a civilized population. To these we must add the district of Columbia, comprising a space of ten miles square round Washington, which is placed under the exclusive authority of that Federal Government.\n\nThe following Table gives a view of the extent, population, and representation of each State, and of the proportion of its inhabitants engaged respectively in agriculture, manufactures, and commerce, according to the census of 1820.\n\n| States and Territories | Square Miles | Population | Agriculture | Manufactures | Commerce | Population in each Square Mile | Senators | Representatives

New York, Pennsylvania, and the New States generally, are each larger than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a> or Scotland; while Virginia, Georgia, Missouri, and Illinois, severally exceed England in extent. The density of the population varies from one person per square mile to 67. It diminishes pretty regularly in every direction as we recede from Massachusetts, and in that State, where it is greatest, it rather exceeds that of Spain, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLAND\">Poland</a>, or Europe, taken altogether. The mean density for all the States east of the Mississippi, and including Louisiana, is 13 persons to the square mile, which rather exceeds that of Sweden and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORWAY\">Norway</a>.\n\nSome writers, who derive their political <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> from the old institutions of Europe, disapprove strongly of the division into states, with distinct local governments. But this arrangement, though originally the effect of accident, is admirably adapted to the circumstances of the country, and deserves to rank as an improvement in the science of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEGISLATION\">legislation</a>. It is\nthe only system by which the great advantages of union could be combined, in such a gigantic empire, with a due attention to the separate interests of all the parts. The federal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a>, by preserving peace and friendship among states that would otherwise be rivals and enemies, exempts them from the scourge of frequent wars, gives unbounded freedom to their internal trade, and, while it enables them to dispense with that sort of strong government which is scarcely compatible with liberty, it gives them an aggregate strength, which secures them against <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> attacks. On the other hand, each separate district, acting by its own legislature, is invested with the entire regulation of its local concerns, which can never be entrusted to others without the certainty of mismanagement. No single legislative body, even were its sessions perpetual, could properly conduct the local business of such an empire as that now forming in North America. In our own Parliament, it is notorious, that, from the multiplicity of business transacted, the general style of legislation is most slovenly, and bills of all kinds, but especially local bills, are often grossly mismanaged. How great an impediment is it felt to be to the redress of grievances, or the promotion of improvements, in the remote parts of Scotland and Ireland, that witnesses, parties, and agents, must be carried six or seven hundred miles at a vast expense, and that, when at the seat of legislation, their success must greatly depend on the votes of persons who either understand their business imperfectly or not at all, and who are only prevailed upon to bestow a slight attention upon it by private solicitation. The division into states supplies the only remedy to this great evil. It encourages local improvements by uniting those whose situation gives them a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a> of interest as to certain objects. It lessens corruption in the general government, by subdividing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRONAGE\">patronage</a>. In times of public frenzy, it multiplies the securities against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSECUTION\">persecution</a> of individuals, because such persons will always find protectors in some one of the state governments. It has, indeed, one disadvantage; the state legislatures may become the strong-holds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACTION\">faction</a>, as exemplified in Massachusetts during the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>. But, as the number of States increases, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of each in the confederacy, and its power to disturb the union is diminished. Even out of this danger a security arises against another. The existence of the separate state governments forms a strong barrier against despotism, because it creates so many distinct centres of power, from which resistance might be made, if a military <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRANT\">tyrant</a> should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> the general government, as Cromwell mastered that of England, and Bonaparte that of France. Some inconvenience, no doubt, arises from the unavoidable diversity of laws in such an aggregation of republics; but the evil is not much felt or complained of practically, and it is the necessary concomitant of a union producing boundless advantages. An iron despotism may subject all its slaves to the same laws without regard to the distinctions of climate, character, or situation; but freemen will not associate voluntarily on such a principle. Liberty consists, not in being governed by the laws that are absolutely best, but by those which are deemed best by the people who obey them. No wise and liberal statesman will hold it necessary that the fishermen of Massachusetts, the husbandmen of Pennsylvania, and the sugar planters of Louisiana, should live under one perfectly uniform system of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JURISPRUDENCE\">jurisprudence</a>. Such a uniformity could not be enforced without rending asunder the union. And let it be recollected, that the diversity of laws, such as it exists, is much less than it would be if the federal compact were dissolved, and the several States entirely independent. In short, if it is possible by any device to reconcile freedom with extensive empire; to unite all the parts of a vast continent together in the bonds of peace and commercial intercourse; and yet not to trench materially on the natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> of each part, or the free use of its natural powers and advantages; it must be by a federative system similar in its essential <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> to that of the United States. The experiment is by far the most interesting that has ever been made in the science of legislation, and the steadiness and success with which it has hitherto proceeded opens up the most encouraging prospects as to the future <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESTINY\">destiny</a> of mankind.\n\nThe federal government, of which we shall speak afterwards, possesses merely those specific powers which are vested in it by the Constitution. All other powers and rights remain with the state governments, in whom the sovereignty essentially resides. The territory of each state is not the territory of the Union, but of that particular State. The people and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITIA\">militia</a> are the people and militia of the several States, not of the Union. Lands are held under the laws of the States; descents, contracts, and all the concerns of private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>, the administration of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, and the whole criminal code, except in the case of breaches of the laws of the federal body, are regulated by state laws.* All the twenty-four States have written constitutions, formed subsequently to the Revolution, except Rhode Island, which is still governed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARTER\">charter</a> granted by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> II. in 1663. These constitutions are purely republican, though the right of suffrage (for the term franchise is inapplicable and odious where voting is a general right, not a special privilege) is restricted in one or two States, and unequally divided in one or two others. In every one of the States the legislature consists of two chambers, both chosen by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> popular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a>, except in Maryland, where the senators are chosen by delegates. In nineteen States out of the twenty-four, the representatives (or members of the Lower <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">House</a>, according to our phraseology) are elected annually, and in five triennially, viz. in South Carolina, Tennessee, Louisiana, Illinois, and Missouri. The period of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> in the senates (or Upper Houses) varies from one to four years, except in Maryland, where it is five; in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> one-third\n\n* Views of the President of the United States on the subject of Internal Improvements, laid before Congress, 4th May 1822.\nor one-fourth, in others one-half of the members are renewed every year; in others, one-half every two years. In some of the States the right of suffrage was formerly limited to freeholders or corporations, but by amendments in most of the old constitutions, these odious and really impolitic restrictions have been abolished; and the right of suffrage, though variously defined in the different States, is substantially universal in them all, except in New Jersey and Virginia. In these two States, the possession of a small amount of property still constitutes the citizen's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> to vote. In many of the States there are certain qualifications prescribed for the persons elected. A senator must, in general, be a freeholder, and not under 30 years of age; a representative not under 25. The governors <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a>, in some cases with, in others without a council, and hold their offices, some for one year, some for two, some for three, but none for more than four years. In all the constitutions recently framed an express provision is introduced for adopting amendments. The rule generally is, that if any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> is judged necessary and approved of by two successive legislatures, it may then be submitted to the people, who appoint a special convention to decide upon it. In some cases it is provided that a convention shall meet periodically to revise the constitution. The existing legislature is always considered as exercising a trust, in the terms of which it has no power to make the smallest change. By this principle, legislation is founded on a clear and rational basis. It gives stability to institutions that might otherwise be the foot-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> of domineering factions; it checks the growth of sinister interests, and, while it affords a safe and easy remedy for grievances, it is so far from being an inlet to rash innovations, that it is the best guarantee against them; as the history of the United States demonstrates. To suffer those who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> the supreme power of a country to change at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> the conditions by which they hold it, is equally as absurd as to suffer the judge to make the laws he administers, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEWARD\">steward</a> to fix the terms of the engagement which invests him with the management of an estate. Under such a system, the steward unavoidably becomes a speculator, the judge a tyrant, and the legislature a junto of conspirators against the public weal.\n\nAgriculture. The agriculture of the United States varies according to the climate, soil, and situation, of the several divisions of the country; but, taken altogether, it differs materially from that of Britain,\u2014in the nature of the productions cultivated, in the condition of those who are engaged in it, and in the general principles by which it is conducted. Besides our staple productions, wheat, barley, oats, peas, beans, turnips, and potatoes, the soil of the United States yields rice, Indian corn, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIGO\">indigo</a>, cotton, sugar, tobacco, the wine; and Florida will probably add to these the olive and the banana, which scarcely succeed in the other States. The staple produce of New England is Indian corn; that of the middle States, wheat and tobacco; that of the southern, cotton, rice, and, to a limited extent, sugar. Dr Morse indicates the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> quantity of each species of produce raised, by naming them in the following order, the greatest being first: In New England, Indian corn, grass, rye, oats, flax, wheat, buck-wheat, barley, and hemp; in the middle States, wheat, Indian corn, tobacco, grass, oats, buck-wheat, flax, barley, potatoes, spelts, rye; in the southern States, cotton, wheat, tobacco, Indian corn, rice, indigo (formerly), barley, and hemp. The western States, along the Ohio, correspond in their productions to the middle States, on the Atlantic. Good soils, carefully cultivated, in the United States, yield 100 bushels of Indian corn, or 50 of wheat per <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACRE\">acre</a>. But the average produce of the cultivated land in Ohio and Kentucky, districts not inferior in soil to any in the Union, is estimated as follows: maize 40 bushels per acre, wheat 22, rye 26, oats 35, barley 30, tobacco 12 to 15 cwt., cotton 5 to 7 cwt. in the seed, or from 150 to 200 pounds cleaned. (James, Vol. III. p. 199.) An acre sown in rice yields from 1200 to 1500 pounds on what are called tide lands, and from 600 to 1200 on inland plantations. An acre planted in canes yields about 1000 or 1200 pounds of sugar, with an equal quantity of molasses. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of renewing the canes annually by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTING\">planting</a>, in consequence of the winter's frost, renders the cultivation less advantageous than in the West Indies. In 1817, however, it was calculated that 20,000,000 of pounds of sugar were made in Louisiana alone, which was estimated to be about \u00bc of the whole annual consumption of the United States. (Warden, II. p. 483, 541. Morse, I. p. 668.)\n\nThe rural population of the United States presents an extraordinary contrast in its constituent parts to that of every country in Europe. The class of extensive proprietors living on their rents, and the class of peasants living merely by their labour, are almost equally unknown. The great bulk of the inhabitants consists of farmers, who are the owners of the lands they occupy, and the greater proportion of whom work with their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>. \"The number of those who are mere labourers,\" says Dwight, \"is almost nothing, except in a few populous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>, and almost all these are collected from the shiftless, the idle, and the vicious. A great part of them are foreigners. Every young man hired to work upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARM\">farm</a> aims steadily to acquire a farm for himself, and hardly once fails of the acquisition.\" (Dwight's Travels, Vol. IV. p. 335.) Except in some few spots near large towns, there is scarcely any land rented. The price is generally so low, that a small addition to the sum necessary for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STOCKING\">stocking</a> a farm suffices to purchase it; and even where the value is higher, an individual who has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> enough to stock a large farm will prefer buying one of half the size. Of the State of New York, only one-fifth, and of the whole inhabited country east of the Mississippi (excluding Michigan and Florida), only about one-tenth part is yet cleared and cultivated. Of course, the best soils are first used, and, till population thickens and produce rises, soils of the second and third quality will not repay the expense of culture; and as a necessary consequence, those of the first quality yield no rent. The farms occupied by the owners are seldom large, because, where wages are high, agriculture cannot be advantageously conducted on an extensive scale; and the large property in land occasionally acquired by an individual is soon broken up by division among\nhis children. Thus situated, the rural population certainly enjoy a greater share of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> in the United States than in any other country in the world. They are exempted from the fluctuations incident to the commercial and manufacturing classes; they feel none of the evils of dependence, and are far above want; without possessing that wealth which engenders idleness and vanity, and often becomes a snare to its possessor. They have the means of settling their families well, without making great sacrifices; they live in the enjoyment of all the substantial comforts of life, and can look forward to old age with less anxiety and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> than any class of men in any other country.\n\nThe system of agriculture is necessarily less perfect in the United States than in Britain. Where prime soils can be had for almost nothing, where the price of labour is high, and that of produce low, the elaborate and costly modes of cultivation adopted in Britain cannot be advantageously applied. Some English farmers, who have gone out to America with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> that large gains might be made by introducing our improved system of husbandry, have found themselves disappointed. Something the Americans may learn from us; but, till the country is more densely peopled, it will be more profitable to cultivate a large surface rudely than a small one laboriously. In the middle and eastern States, however, where produce brings a considerable price, farming is carried on with care and skill. In Pennsylvania, which holds the first rank as an agricultural state, in New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Jersey, agricultural societies exist, and much attention is paid to the cultivation of the indigenous grasses and to the use of manures. Grazing is well understood in New England, where it is considered the most profitable species of farming. Much care has been bestowed on the breeding of sheep, and Merinos are now spread over all the northern, middle, and western States.\n\nHutchins reckoned that 1/3ths of the land east of the Mississippi was covered with a strong fertile soil. The remaining 2/3ths were occupied by lakes and rivers, or consisted of land too poor or too steep for cultivation. In 1811, Mr Blodget estimated the land under \"actual improvement\" to be 49,950,000 acres, or 5\u00bd acres for each inhabitant, a proportion which is found to be near the truth. In 1798, when a census was taken for the imposition of a tax, the quantity of land valued and taxed in sixteen States was one hundred and sixty-three millions of acres out of three hundred and eight millions, the estimated value of which was four hundred and seventy-nine millions of dollars. The value per acre varied widely. In Connecticut it was fifteen dollars per acre, in Pennsylvania six, in Georgia three-fourths; but the average for the whole was about three dollars. The value of the houses was estimated at a hundred and forty millions of dollars, or two-sevenths of that of the land. When new returns were procured in 1814, the value of lands and houses conjointly had risen from six hundred and twenty to one thousand six hundred and thirty millions of dollars. From these two documents, which afford a curious view of the state and growth of property in the republic, we find that, in the sixteen States organized, in 1798, rather more than one-half of the surface was the property of individuals. In the old States, such as Massachusetts and Connecticut, the appropriated land embraced nearly the whole surface; in New York, it embraced about four-sevenths, in Georgia one-third. The number of acres appropriated for each individual of the population was about thirty, of which five and one-half or six acres were cleared or \"improved.\" The estimated value of the houses and lands was at the rate of 125 dollars for each individual of the contemporaneous population in 1798, but had risen to 200 dollars in 1814. Supposing every other species of property to have grown as rapidly, the rate of increase would be about 6\u00bd per cent. per annum, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of the country must double itself in 11\u00bd years, or it increases twice as rapidly as the population. With a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a> population, the rate of increase would be 5\u00be per cent., and the period of doubling 13\u00bd years. We have no similar data for other countries to found a comparison on, but we are certain that such a velocity of accumulation is unknown anywhere else.\n\nThe value of houses, lands, and slaves, in 1814, was, according to the returns, 1902 millions of dollars. If we add one-eighth for omissions and underestimates, and for Louisiana, which was not included, with 50 millions for state lands, and two-thirds additional for all other species of property (this being nearly the proportion in Colquhoun's estimate for Britain); namely, agricultural stock, manufactured goods on hand or in progress, ships, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HARBOURS\">harbours</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CANALS\">canals</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a>, public buildings, &c.\u2014the whole will be 3550 millions of dollars, equal to 780 millions <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">Sterling</a>, or about L.95 for each individual of the contemporaneous population. Colquhoun's estimate for Britain was 2700 millions Sterling, or L.150 for each inhabitant. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> amount, increasing at the rate of 6 per cent. would become 1400 millions Sterling in 1824, and the annual increment, or the value added to the national capital every year, should be about 80 millions Sterling. The whole annual produce of the national industry, which affords a saving of 80 millions, cannot be less than four times as much, or 320 millions, that is, L.32 per head on the population. Colquhoun's estimate for the British Isles in 1812, was 430 millions, or L.24 per head on the population. (Colquhoun, p.55, 65.) These calculations are founded on the returns taken as they stand. It is probable, however, that the second census would be more accurately taken than the first, and that the growth of the national capital is not quite so great as it appears.\n\nThe large profits which farming yields, and the high price of labour, are discouragements to manufactures and facturing industry in the United States. The arts in which they have made the greatest progress, are cabinet and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COACH\">coach</a> making, shoemaking, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEAM\">steam</a>-boat and ship <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of mill machinery and wooden bridges, and bank-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> engraving. Piano-fortes are respectably made. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> gin for cleaning cotton from the husks, and the nail-making machine, are American inventions. The woollen manufacture is almost entirely domestic, being carried on in the houses of the farmers; but the cotton manufac-\nture is partly conducted in large works. This last, as well as several other manufactures, received a great stimulus during the late war with Britain, but they have declined since the peace, though a few of the works then established are still carried on with advantage. It was computed by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMITTEE\">Committee</a> of Congress, that the cotton manufactures, which consumed only 10,000 bales of the raw material in 1810, consumed 90,000 in 1815; employed 100,000 hands (10,000 men, 66,000 women and girls, 24,000 boys), and produced 81,000,000 yards of cloth, valued at 24 millions of dollars. The value of the woollen manufacture was estimated at 17 millions of dollars, and was supposed to employ 50,000 hands constantly, and as many more occasionally. (Reports of 13th February and 6th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 1816.) According to the returns made in the census of 1810, the whole annual value of the manufactures of the United States was 127,694,602 dollars. But Mr Tenche Coxe calculated, that, making allowance for articles omitted or under-estimated, the true value would not be less than 172,700,000 dollars (\u00a337,500,000.) If the increase in this branch of industry has kept pace with the growth of the population, it should now amount to 240 millions (\u00a352,000,000.) But the value of the manufactured goods imported in 1821 was only 32 millions of dollars, and deducting five millions re-exported, the quantity which remains for home consumption is only 27 millions, or one-ninth part of the whole. It is against this small fraction of the annual consumption that such an outcry is made; and that the Americans, borrowing our exploded maxims, are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FENCING\">fencing</a> themselves by such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> of protecting duties, prohibitions, and restrictions. For the purpose of comparison we may mention, that Chaptal estimated the annual value of the French manufactures, in 1820, at L72,800,000, which is probably a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> under the truth; and that Colquhoun estimated that of the British manufactures at L116,000,000 in 1812, exclusive of the raw material. Of the manufactures returned in the census of 1810, valued at 127,694,602 dollars, the following were the most considerable:\n\nGoods manufactured by the loom 39,500,000 dollars.\nMachinery of various kinds..............6,100,000\nHats........................................4,300,000\nIron manufactures..........................14,360,000\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEATHER\">Leather</a>.......................................17,900,000\nDistilled and fermented liquors..........16,530,000\nWooden articles.............................5,540,000\n\nAccording to the returns, there were 153 iron furnaces, 34 rolling and slitting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MILLS\">mills</a>, 325,392 looms, 122,647 spindles for yarn, 141,191 distilleries, producing 22,977,167 gallons of spirits from grain, and 2,827,625 from molasses, 132 breweries, 208 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a> mills. Nearly one-fourth of the manufactures were in Pennsylvania; Massachusetts ranks next, then New York, Virginia, Maryland, Connecticut, North Carolina, New Jersey, Vermont, Kentucky. It may be remarked, that the effect of the high price of labour in discouraging manufactures is counteracted by three circumstances. 1. The United States being far distant from Europe, the expense of freight, and still more that of inland carriage, makes a material addition to the prime cost of all bulky or heavy articles. 2. As the use of machinery comes to be substituted more and more for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANUAL\">manual</a> labour, the disadvantage of high wages gradually vanishes; and the Americans, who possess great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> genius, have the means of procuring steam and water power to an unlimited extent. 3. The American women prefer working in factories to domestic service, which they consider degrading; and hence <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> labourers are not scarce, and may be procured at moderate wages.*\n\nThe commerce of the United States has made much greater progress than their manufactures. The wars and convulsions of Europe, consequent on the French Revolution, threw a great proportion of the general carrying trade into their hands; and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a>, from 1790 to 1807, their exports increased from 20 millions to 108 millions of dollars. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BERLIN\">Berlin</a> Decrees and the British Orders in Council gave a sudden check to this growing prosperity, and the foreign trade of the United States has never since reached so great a height. The following table shows the amount of exports, distinguishing foreign from domestic produce, from 1800 to 1821:\n\n| Years | Exports | Domestic Growth, Produce, or Manufacture | Foreign |\n|-------|---------|------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1800  | 70,971,780 | 31,840,903 | 39,120,877 |\n| 1801  | 94,115,923 | 46,377,792 | 46,642,723 |\n| 1802  | 72,483,160 | 26,182,173 | 35,774,971 |\n| 1803  | 55,800,083 | 42,205,961 | 13,594,072 |\n| 1804  | 77,699,074 | 41,467,477 | 36,231,597 |\n| 1805  | 95,566,021 | 42,387,002 | 53,179,019 |\n| 1806  | 101,536,963 | 41,253,727 | 60,283,236 |\n| 1807  | 108,843,150 | 48,699,692 | 59,643,558 |\n| 1808  | 22,430,960 | 9,433,546 | 12,997,414 |\n| 1809  | 52,203,283 | 31,405,702 | 20,797,581 |\n| 1810  | 66,757,970 | 42,366,675 | 24,391,295 |\n| 1811  | 61,316,833 | 45,294,043 | 16,022,790 |\n| 1812  | 38,527,236 | 30,082,109 | 8,495,127 |\n| 1813  | 27,855,997 | 25,008,152 | 2,847,845 |\n| 1814  | 6,927,441 | 6,782,273 | 145,169 |\n| 1815  | 52,557,753 | 45,974,403 | 6,583,350 |\n| 1816  | 81,920,452 | 64,781,896 | 17,138,556 |\n| 1817  | 87,671,566 | 68,313,500 | 19,358,069 |\n| 1818  | 93,281,133 | 73,854,437 | 19,426,696 |\n| 1819  | 70,142,521 | 50,976,838 | 19,165,683 |\n| 1820  | 69,691,669 | 51,683,640 | 18,008,029 |\n| 1821  | 64,974,382 | 43,671,894 | 21,302,488 |\n\nThe imports have not been regularly published.

The leading articles are raw produce. Cotton forms about 46 per cent. of the domestic exports; wheat, Indian corn, and other breadstuffs, 15 per cent.; tobacco, 13 per cent.; lumber, bark, &c., 6 per cent.; horses, beef, &c. 5 per cent. The leading imports are the fine products of the loom in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a>, cotton, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a>, or articles not raised in the country, such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEA\">tea</a>, coffee, sugar, wine. In hemp, iron, and leather, the imports are small. About four tenths of the whole imports come from Britain, and only about one-tenth from France.\n\nThe internal and coasting trade of the United States has increased more rapidly than their foreign commerce, and is undoubtedly far greater than that of any other state with an equal population. The enrolled and licensed tonnage, which was only 184,000 tons in 1795, had risen to 588,000 in 1821. It is now equal to the registered tonnage, of which it formed only one-third in 1795, and it has more than tripled in the period in which the population has doubled. The Hudson, which is the great channel of inland trade, for districts containing nearly two millions of inhabitants, has, according to Palmer and other recent travellers, 2000 sloops and schooners plying upon it,\u2014a greater number than belonged to all Scotland in 1810. The Delaware, Susquehanna, Potowmac, and other large rivers farther south, are all the scene of an active and growing traffic. The majestic Mississippi, though it does not yet rival the Hudson, must in time far surpass it. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of steam-vessels has done for the navigation of rivers what the invention of sails did for that of the ocean. The United States had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of introducing this admirable improvement; and they make a more extensive use of it than any other country in the world. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> given by Mr Perkins of New York before a Committee of Parliament in 1822, he stated there were about 300 steam-boats employed in the United States, and of these about one-half used high pressure engines. On the Mississippi alone, according to a recent American <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, there were 78 in 1823, measuring 14,938 tons, or about 184 tons on average.\n\nThe great facilities for inland navigation which nature has bestowed on the United States, have been improved by art; and considering the sparseness of the population, the number of canals which have already been formed is truly surprising. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MIDDLESEX\">Middlesex</a> Canal, in Massachusetts, completed many years ago, is 31 miles long and four feet deep, and cost 700,000 dollars. The Lake Champlain Canal, which joins the Hudson at Fort Edward, is 22 miles long, and four feet deep, and was to be finished in 1823. A canal, 22 miles long, connects Chesapeake Bay with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALBEMARLE\">Albemarle</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUND\">Sound</a>. Another of the same length joins Santee and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COOPER\">Cooper</a> Rivers in South Carolina. Besides these, ten or twelve canals, from one mile long to seven or eight, either finished or in progress, are enumerated by American writers. Many others are projected, among which are one of 28 and another of 22 miles in length, to connect the Rariton and Delaware rivers with Chesapeake Bay. If these were completed, an uninterrupted inland navigation...\nwould exist for nearly 500 miles, from New York to Pamlico Sound. But the greatest work of the kind in the United States, and perhaps in the world, is the Great Canal which unites the Hudson with Lake Erie. It begins in the neighbourhood of Albany, passes along the course of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOHAWK\">Mohawk</a> River to Rome, then proceeds westward, keeping at a variable distance of 10, 15, or 20 miles from Lake Ontario, and terminates in Lake Erie at Black Rock, a mile from Buffalo. It is 362 miles long, 40 feet wide at top, 28 at bottom, and four in depth. Its termination in Lake Erie is 564 feet above its origin in the Hudson; but the aggregate rise and fall is 654 feet, and is effected by 81 locks. The canal, which is the property of the State, was begun in 1817, and finished in 1823, except about 30 miles, which will be completed in 1824. It is believed the whole expense will rather fall short of the estimate, which was five millions of dollars (\u00a31,100,000). The freight is about a dollar per ton, each 100 miles, to which is to be added tolls at the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATES\">rates</a>: for salt and gypsum 50 cents\u2014grain, flour, &c. 150 cents\u2014and merchandise, 300 cents per ton for each 100 miles. This great undertaking, almost equaling in magnitude, and far surpassing in utility, the most magnificent works of Imperial Rome,\u2014executed by a State with a million and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of inhabitants, affords a gratifying proof of the energy and enterprise <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> by free institutions.\n\nNo country has suffered so much from the mania for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BANKING\">banking</a>, or been so deluged with depreciated and worthless paper money, as the United States. There were 400 banks in existence in 1819, three-fourths of which probably had only fictitious capital. They were got up generally by knots of speculating tradesmen and lawyers, often without depositing a dollar beyond what was necessary to pay for paper and engraving. Even the respectable banks <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> notes for a single dollar; but in the western country, where these establishments were on the worst footing, notes were issued for a half, a quarter, an eighth, and even a sixteenth of a dollar! The immense mass of worthless paper money they put into circulation created a transient and hollow prosperity, which was followed by a degree of embarrassment and distress that had almost the character of a general bankruptcy. The paper bubbles burst, one after another, with extraordinary celerity, and involved multitudes in ruin. Of a hundred banks in Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Indiana, there were only two whose notes were received at the land offices. In some of these States acts were passed by the legislature suspending legal proceedings to compel payment of debts. It may be imagined what an extraordinary derangement was produced in the state of property, when the circulating medium was reduced in three years (1815 to 1819) from 110 to 45 millions of dollars.*\n\nThe United States present the singular spectacle of a government supported without internal taxes. The public revenue is derived entirely from the customs and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a> of public lands; for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POST_OFFICE\">post-office</a> merely defrays its own expense, and the sums that stand in their accounts as bank dividends, are but the produce of money previously invested. Small imposts, indeed, are levied for the support of the state governments, but these on an average probably do not exceed one dollar for each inhabitant, or ten million of dollars for the whole Union. The public revenue of the federal government amounted to 14,254,000 dollars in 1821, and to 20,232,427 for 1822. For 1823 they were estimated at 20,444,035 dollars, and for 1824 at 18,550,000, composed of the following items\u2014\n\n| Item                  | Dollars   | In British Money |\n|-----------------------|-----------|------------------|\n| Customs               | 16,500,000| L. 3,630,000     |\n| Public lands          | 1,600,000 | 350,000          |\n| Bank dividends        | 350,000   | 77,000           |\n| Arrears & repayments  | 100,000   | 22,000           |\n| **Total**             | **18,550,000** | **L. 4,079,000** |\n\nThe estimated expenditure for 1824 was\u2014\n\n| Item                  | Dollars   | In British Money |\n|-----------------------|-----------|------------------|\n| Civil, Diplomatic, and Miscellaneous, Military department, including Fortifications, Ordnance, Pensions, Army, Militia, and Indian department, Naval service, including gradual increase of the Navy, Public debt, | 1,814,057 | L. 399,000 |\n|                       | 5,122,268 | 1,127,000        |\n|                       | 2,973,927 | 654,000          |\n|                       | 5,314,000 | 1,169,000        |\n| **Total**             | **15,224,252** | **L. 3,349,000** |\n\nThe public debt, which amounted to 123,630,000 dollars in 1816, was reduced to 90,177,962 dollars (\u00a319,800,000 Sterling) at the 1st January 1824; one-fourth of the whole having been paid off in the intervening eight years. A farther <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> of ten millions will, it is supposed, take place at the 1st January 1825, from an accumulating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> or surplus in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURY\">Treasury</a>. The Democratic party, however, would have acted more wisely, had they availed themselves of the existence of this debt to repair their great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>\u2014the abolition of internal taxes\u2014by keeping up some of the duties imposed during the late war, till the whole amount was discharged. When peace brings an entire exemption from taxes, the burdens, which even a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> and necessary war imposes, will be borne very impatiently, and the government will not receive the support necessary to carry it through an arduous struggle. During the last short war in 1813 and 1814, the clamours of the people, in consequence of burdens and embarrassments not half so serious as are patiently borne in Europe, had almost compelled the government to sacrifice the national honour by accepting peace on shameful terms.\n\nThe free spirit of the Americans, and still more, army.\n\n* Report of Secretary of Treasury on Currency, 1820. Flint's Letters from America, Nos. 16 and 17.\ntheir parsimonious habits in public matters, make them averse to the existence of a large standing army. In this, as in some other things, they, perhaps, carry their opposition to the practice of the European States too far. Regular troops can be effectually opposed only by regular troops; and, in the present condition of the world, the state which deduces itself of efficient defensive weapons, may be said to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">court</a> disaster and disgrace. To supply the want of a small number of regular troops by masses of raw militia six times as numerous, who leave their homes under great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> and pecuniary sacrifices, is not economy, but the reverse,\u2014to say nothing of the certain losses it occasions, and the humiliations these produce to natural feeling. After the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of the late war, the Congress, by act of 3d March 1815, fixed the strength of the regular army at 9980 men, but it has since been reduced, and its actual strength, as reported to Congress in March 1822, was\u2014\n\n| Engineers | 23 |\n|-----------|----|\n| Regiments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTILLERY\">Artillery</a> | 4 | 1977 |\n| Do. of Infantry | 7 | 3967 |\n| Ordnance men | 53 |\n\nThe army is distributed at about fifty posts and places along the sea-coast and inland frontier. The pay of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLONEL\">colonel</a> of infantry is seventy-five dollars (\u00a316, 10s.) per <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>, and six rations a day\u2014of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">captain</a>, forty dollars and three rations\u2014of a first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">lieutenant</a>, thirty dollars and three rations\u2014of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERGEANT\">sergeant</a>, eight dollars and one ration\u2014of a private, five dollars and one ration. The aggregate expense of the army in 1822 was 1,929,179 dollars, and the average <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> for each man 299 dollars (\u00a36.66). The Americans have a well conducted military academy at West Point, on the Hudson, where 230 cadets, between the ages of fourteen and twenty-one, are instructed in the branches of knowledge necessary to form engineers. The period of service is five years, and the expense for each pupil is about 500 dollars per annum. But the chief military force of the United States is the militia, consisting properly of all the males between eighteen and forty-five, but always less or more deficient. A return at the close of 1823 makes the number amount to 993,281. When called out to the field they have the same allowances as the regular army, and their period of service is limited to six months. The American militia are under the charge of the State governments. They generally, if not universally, elect their own officers, and are said to be very indifferently disciplined.*\n\nThe exploits performed by the American ships in the last war have made the navy extremely popular. The United States had not a single ship of the line ready for sea till near the close of the contest, and they have now twelve built, or building. In 1816, Congress appropriated a million of dollars per annum for eight years to increase the navy. In 1821, the grant was reduced to 500,000 dollars, and continued till 1825. A small number of vessels are kept always in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a>, and stationed partly in the West Indies, and partly in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a>. According to an American journal, the strength of the navy in November 1823 was as follows:\n\n| Ships of the Line | 1 |\n|------------------|---|\n| Frigates         | 3 |\n| Smaller Vessels  | 12|\n| Steam Frigates   | \u2014 |\n\nTo these must be added vessels on the lakes, viz. two of 74 guns on the stocks, one of 44, one of 36, one of 32, one of 26; two of 24, with eleven smaller vessels, and fourteen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUN\">gun</a>-boats, some of which are much decayed. The American vessels are built larger than ours of the same class, and carry heavier guns. Their steam frigates are an improvement yet untried in actual service, but which may probably lead to an important change in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARITIME\">maritime</a> war. The navy is managed by a Board of three commissioners, and a secretary. A small tax of twenty cents per month is paid by all officers and seamen, both in the navy and merchant service, for the relief of sick and disabled mariners, part of whom are lodged in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOSPITALS\">hospitals</a>.\n\nThe American Federal Government is a genuine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEMOCRACY\">democracy</a>, admirable for the simplicity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a> of its principles, and supposed by many to produce a greater amount of public good and private happiness than any political <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> that ever existed. Its establishment was an experiment which was deemed doubtful and hazardous, even by the enlightened men who were its founders; but, to use the words of Mr Monroe, \u201cit has succeeded beyond any calculation that could have been formed of any human institution;\u201d and it now exhibits a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> in the science of government, which approaches more nearly to ideal perfection than statesmen or sages had dreamed of.\n\nThe legislative power is vested in a Congress, consisting of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SENATE\">Senate</a> and House of Representatives. The senate is composed of two members from each State, chosen for six years, by the respective State legislatures, and the seats of one-third are vacated every two years. A Senator must be thirty years of age, an inhabitant of the State for which he is chosen, and he must have been a citizen of the United States for nine years. The members of the House of Representatives are chosen every second year by the people, in the proportion of 1 for every 40,000 inhabitants, excluding the Indians, and two-fifths of the people of colour. The electors being the same as for the most numerous branch of the State legislature, the right of suffrage may be described as universal. A representative must be an inhabitant of the State for which he is chosen, of twenty-five years of age, and he must have been seven years a citizen.\n\n* Warden, III. 402, &c. Nile\u2019s Register, 16th and 30th March 1822, and American Papers.\nof the United States. No law can be passed without the concurrence of both Houses. When that is obtained, it is presented to the President, who, if he approves, signs it; if not, he returns it, with his objections, for the reconsideration of Congress, and it cannot in that case become a law without the concurrence of two-thirds of the members. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-EXECUTIVE_POWER\">executive power</a> is vested in a President, who is elected for four years, by a number of electors chosen for the purpose by the people, distinct from the senators and representatives each State sends to Congress, but equal to them in number. The President must be a native born citizen of the United States, and not under thirty-five years of age. His salary is $25,000 dollars (L5500) per annum.\n\nThe Congress has power to impose taxes and duties to pay the debts and provide for the defense of the republic; to borrow money; to regulate commerce; to establish uniform laws of bankruptcy and naturalization; to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COIN\">coin</a> money, and fix the standard of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-WEIGHTS_AND_MEASURES\">weights and <a class</a>=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a>; to establish post offices; to constitute tribunals; to declare war, raise and support an army and navy; to call forth the militia; and to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining it. The President is commander-in-chief of the army, navy, and the militia, when in active service. By and with the advice of the Senate (two-thirds concurring), he makes treaties, and nominates ambassadors, ministers, consuls, and judges.\n\nThe Federal Judiciary consists of the Supreme Court (formed of a chief judge and six associate judges), which sits at Washington, and a District Court in each State, in which one judge sits. The chief judge has $4000 dollars a year, an associate judge $3500, and a district judge from $800 to $2000. The Supreme Court, deriving its authority from the Constitution, is not bound by the proceedings of the legislature farther than they are consistent with that charter. It has, accordingly, set aside several acts of the State legislatures, and even of Congress itself, on the ground that they contravened an express provision of the Constitution, by nullifying or impairing the validity of contracts. The laws of the United States are substantially the same with the laws of England, but differently modified in each State by causes springing out of the physical, moral, and political situation of the people.\n\nThere is no national <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> in the United States; each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONGREGATION\">congregation</a> pays its own minister, and each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">sect</a> regulates its own concerns. Notwithstanding this, wherever the population is dense, the means of religious instruction are as ample as in any country in Europe. It is computed that there are above 8000 churches, or religious societies, of which about 3000 belong to the Baptists, 2000 to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHODISTS\">Methodists</a>, 1200 to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONGREGATIONALISTS\">Congregationalists</a>, 900 to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRESBYTERIANS\">Presbyterians</a>, 600 to the Episcopalians, and a small number to the Catholics, Dutch Lutherans, Universalists, and other sects.","sp":744,"ep":764},{"h":"VACCINATION","t":"The Encyclopaedia contains <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> separate article on the subject of Vaccination; but Small-pox, in the article Medicine (221), is concluded, with a notice of its introduction. We now propose to give a condensed view of the subject, and of the present state of medical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> on the merits of Vaccination.\n\nOn the 14th of May 1796, Edward Jenner, a physician in Berkeley, near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GLOUCESTER\">Gloucester</a>, first applied to the arm of a healthy boy of eight years, by means of two superficial incisions, the morbid fluid secreted by a sore on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAIRY\">dairy</a>-maid, who had contracted Cow-pox from the udders of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>'s cows. The seventh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> after the operation he had uneasiness in the arm-pit; on the ninth, became chill, had headache, lost appetite, was otherwise indisposed, and spent a restless night; but the following day, was free from complaint. Of the appearances of the local sore, we have no particular information, but that it resembled a bluish pustule, was surrounded by an erysipelasous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> circle, and afterwards formed scabs and eschars without producing other inconvenience. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of this operation, which was chiefly experimental, was to ascertain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of immunity from small-pox contagion thus obtained; and on the 1st of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a>, therefore, various <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> was inserted by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INOCULATION\">inoculation</a>, but without being attended with the usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>; and when this was repeated some months after, the same effect was observed. Further inquiry was prevented, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the disease disappearing till the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> of 1798, when it once more made its appearance among the dairies of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GLOUCESTERSHIRE\">Gloucestershire</a>. On the 16th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a>, a child of five and a half years was inoculated with matter taken from the teat of an infected cow. On the 6th day after the operation, he was unwell, and vomited; but on the 8th appeared to be in his usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>. The progress of the local vesicle was similar to that of the former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, except in the absence of the livid or bluish tint observed. On the 28th of March, the disease was transferred from the arm of this patient to that of William Pead, a boy of eight, with the usual appearances, and especially the red circle, quite similar to that which is observed after variolous inoculation. To this redness Dr Jenner first applied the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> areola. From the fluid produced in this case, several patients, both young and adult, were infected, and in all, the phenomena appear to have been pretty uniform; or, at least, with deviations so trifling, that they do not require particular notice. From the previous conclusions derived from persons who had been affected with cow-pox, and who resisted the variolous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, it might be presumed to be unnecessary to try how far those who had been artificially subjected to cow-pox could resist small-pox. To render his conclusions more certain, however, Dr Jenner tried it without effect on his first vaccinated patient; and with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> and last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, his nephew was equally unsuccessful.\n\nSuch were the first trials of the effect of vaccine fluid on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> subject; and so far as they were carried by Dr Jenner, the results appeared to warrant the main conclusion, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of vaccination renders the human body unsusceptible of being acted on by the infection of small-pox. We must not omit to remark, however, that the Inquiry of Dr Jenner shows that he had formed, in the year 1798, no very distinct idea of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> and phenomena of the vaccine disease, or, at most, that he imagined it to be identical with small-pox. It is evident, that, in his early researches, Dr Jenner believed that the origin of small-pox could be traced to the heel of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>; and that though cow-pox was a disease transmitted from the horse, and modified by the system of the cow, it was specially identical with, or allied to variola, and differed in variety only. On this principle, he applied to it the denomination of variola vaccinae; and it is obvious that he was confirmed in this opinion by observing, that a person who had suffered the vaccine disease is not liable to be affected with small-pox contagion.\n\nThe singular facts announced in the Inquiry, and their more extraordinary application, recommended by Dr Jenner, attracted much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>; and shortly after its publication, Dr Pearson of St George's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">Hospital</a> commenced an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>, in which he collected many facts tending to render its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> more complete, and to demonstrate its power in enabling the human body to resist the contagion of small-pox. In one point only did he disagree with Dr Jenner,\u2014the origin of the cow-pox from the heel of the horse; in denying which, he was supported by the arguments of Dr Parr, and the experiments of Mr Simmons of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANCHESTER\">Manchester</a>.\n\nDr Pearson's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of this subject was followed at no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> with Further Observations by Dr Jenner, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> purpose of which was to confirm the conclusions delivered in the Inquiry, and to establish the leading fact, that vaccination renders the human system unsusceptible of small-pox. As some cases had come to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> of this disease occurring in the persons of those who had undergone the vaccine disease, Dr Jenner, by ascribing these to a spurious form of cow-pox, conceived he had removed any exception to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> or general accuracy of his doctrine. Of the spurious form, he conceived there were four sources: The 1st, From pustules on the nipples or udder of the cow, without specific virus. 2d, From matter, which, though originally specific, had undergone decomposition. 3d, From an ulcer proceeding from the genuine disease, but at an advanced stage. 4th, From matter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> by the human skin, after contact with peculiar morbid matter, formed in the system of a horse. These various positions Dr Jenner illustrated or proved by arguments, either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> or analogical, derived chiefly from similar phenomena, exhibited in the progress of various <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POISON\">poison</a>. Of these arguments, the most import-\nVaccination <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANT\">ant</a> are those which relate to differences or variations induced in the genuine poison by elementary decomposition, or by the process of ulceration, after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of the proper lymph was passed. The propriety of admitting the 4th cause as a source of infective vaccination is intimately connected with the origin assigned to cow-pox by Dr Jenner; for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> a modifying effect on equine matter be assigned to the udder, it is impossible to suppose that the former can have a genuine influence on the human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>, or on the small-pox.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> excited by the singular facts disclosed in Dr Jenner's writings, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> which they derived from Dr Pearson's inquiry, quickly gave rise to the wish of bringing the truth of the doctrines thus advanced to the test of experiment; and men were eager to ascertain what practical advantage was likely to result from the introduction of cow-pox artificially excited, and the substitution of a mild disease, derived from a brute animal, for a human malady, which, even in the most favourable circumstances, was liable to be attended with much danger. The merit of this practical application was reserved for Dr Woodville, who, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1799, introduced into the Small-pox Hospital of which he had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a>, vaccine matter derived from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>-cows in Gray's Inn Lane. On the 21st January 1799, Dr Woodville applied, by a single puncture, to the arms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> persons, matter in a purulent state, obtained from the teats of a cow labouring under the disease; and on the 24th he infected three persons with vaccine matter taken from the sores of Sarah <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICE\">Rice</a>, a young woman who had contracted the disease in the course of milking. From these two sources, this physician affected 600 persons, of various ages, with the vaccine disease; of whom the circumstances of 200 are recorded in the Reports of his practice.\n\nIn most of these patients, inoculation of small-pox matter was performed at various periods after the application of the vaccine disease, with a view to ascertain the genuine power of the latter, and to discover what influence it could <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> in deranging or modifying the progress of the variolous disease. The general result of these experimental cases may be given in the following terms:\n\n1st, In about three-fifths of the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, the operation was followed, at intervals of various length, by an eruption of pustules, more or less numerous, over the cutaneous surface. (P. 151.) In one case, in which these pustular eruptions appeared about the seventh day, and was attended with convulsive motions, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> took <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> on the eleventh day after insertion of matter. (P. 149.)\n\n2d, In persons on whom vaccine matter and variolous matter are inserted at different arms, but at the same time, the local affections resulting from each application preserved their characteristic appearances through the whole course of the disease. (P. 139.)\n\n3d, When the two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a> (variolous and vaccine) are rubbed together, and inserted by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANCET\">lancet</a> dipped into the mixture, sometimes the vaccine pock, sometimes a variolous pustule, has been produced, the respective characteristics being in either case retained throughout; and in some rare instances, both diseases are thus produced. (P. 104.)\n\n4th, If inoculation be performed alternately with variolous and with vaccine matter every day till fever take place, both inoculations make progress; and as soon as the whole system is disordered, they appear to be all equally advanced in maturation. (P. 145.)\n\nIt cannot now be doubted, that, though the experiments of Dr Woodville have thrown much light on the nature of the vaccine disease, and on its true influence over the poison of Small-pox, yet they were conducted without due regard to the legitimate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of ascertaining the truth. 1st, The patients on whom Dr Woodville operated were exposed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a> of a small-pox hospital, where, of all other places, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> was most likely to be thoroughly impregnated with variolous effluvia. 2d, In the greater number of the patients vaccinated by this physician, inoculation with variolous matter was performed at a period a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> too early to ascertain the counteracting force of the vaccine disease. 3d, It is doubtful whether, in his selection of vaccine matter, he chose the proper period; for he informs us that the matter was taken from the animal in a purulent state, which we now know is very unfavourable to the success of the vaccinating process. (Jenner, p. 118.)\n\n4th, Dr Woodville formed a very erroneous notion of the nature and distinctive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> of the vaccine and variolous diseases; not only in considering, like Dr Jenner, \"the vaccine variola,\" and the human variola, to be only varieties of the same disease, rather than distinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>\" (p. 152, 153); but in the further <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> of supposing Cow-pock capable of exciting a general affection of the skin. Our more perfect knowledge of Cow-pock has shown, that its action on the skin is confined to those spots only to which it is applied, and that it never hitherto has been known to produce general eruptions similar to itself. This error is intimately connected with another committed by Dr Woodville, in believing cow-pox capable of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> by effluvia, or by any other manner than that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> contact.*\n\nThe results of Dr Woodville's experiments, so different from those obtained by Dr Jenner, were communicated to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> at first apparently in a private manner (p. 129); and, in order to submit the matter to a fair <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> vaccine fluid was transmitted to Dr Jenner, who inoculated several persons, (twenty,\u2014eighteen at the manufactory, two previously, p. 133), without any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of effect than a greater degree of local inflammation, and with an eruption of a few red spots, which quickly disappeared without maturing.\n\nIt was in a subsequent publication, however, that Dr Jenner undertook the task of examining the experiments of Dr Woodville, and showing the circumstances from which the different results proceeded. The anomalous appearances he here ascribed to the action of variolous matter which had crept into the constitution with the vaccine; 1st, Because a great\n\n* Jenner, p. 86. Further Observations. Pearson, p. 50, Proposition VI.\nwere inoculated on the 3d or 5th day with variolous matter; 2d, Because, in the Gloucestershire dairies, where cow-pox had been known time out of mind, no pustular eruptions had ever been known to appear on the general cutaneous surface; and 3d, Because, though the proportion of pustular cases was at first 3 out of 5, they afterwards diminished so much, that of the last 100 persons inoculated, only seven had pustular eruptions.\n\nTo bring this matter to a more satisfactory determination, Dr Jenner procured fluid from an affected cow belonging to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">farmer</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KENTISH_TOWN\">Kentish Town</a>, and transmitted it to Dr Marshall, who was then extensively engaged in vaccination in Gloucestershire. Under his care 423 persons had undergone, in the course of some weeks, the process of vaccination; and of this number it appears that 127 were infected with the matter sent by Dr Jenner from London; yet Dr Marshall positively <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, that neither in the first set of cases, nor in those thus vaccinated, had any pustular eruption occurred, or been observed. (P. 158, 159.) In one case only did a pustule appear in the elbow of the inoculated arm, and it matured. The same result was obtained in the vaccinations conducted by Dr Jenner personally, and in those by his relation, Mr Henry Jenner. (P. 162.) From these facts, therefore, Dr Jenner concluded, that the vaccine matter obtained from an animal reared in the neighbourhood of London was not different, at least in its effects, from that which was obtained from animals affected with the disease in Gloucestershire. It is proper to notice, however, that Dr Jenner acknowledged that some of his correspondents had mentioned the appearance of eruptions at the commencement of their vaccinating operations; but, \"in these cases,\" he remarks, \"the matter was derived from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> stock at the small-pox Hospital.\"\n\nAnother point in this inquiry, viz., the immunity from subsequent small-pox afforded by vaccination, came under the investigation of Dr Jenner at this period. Although the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> upon this point had been already conclusive, yet, as various facts were constantly coming to the knowledge of Dr Jenner to prove the protecting power of vaccination, and its influence in counteracting small-pox, even when the system is under variolous action, he published several of these proofs, in order to show the true power of the vaccine disease. These cases are in every respect similar to many others which have since occurred, and it is unnecessary to bestow further notice on them. Shortly after, a second Tract appeared from Dr Woodville; and though his object was to refute the assertion of Dr Jenner regarding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADULTERATION\">adulteration</a> of the vaccine matter of the Small-pox Hospital in London, his testimony was of the utmost advantage to the anti-variolous power of vaccination. It <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be remembered, that, towards the conclusion of Dr Woodville's vaccinations, the varioloid or pustular eruptions which had been so frequent at the beginning, began gradually to diminish, and finally almost to disappear; and in the further prosecution of this physician's experimental investigation, we find that these eruptions were found almost never to succeed the process of vaccination.\n\nIn his Observations on the Cow-pox, which appeared in July 1800, many important facts were disclosed, which tended directly to unfold the true properties of the vaccine disease, and the relation which subsists between its action and that of small-pox. It is unnecessary, at this distance of time, to enter into the merits of the charge which Dr Woodville conceived Dr Jenner brought against the vaccine matter of the Small-pox Hospital, and of the mode in which Dr Woodville attempted to repel it; and as we do not conceive it tended, in the slightest degree, to illustrate the question, of the cause of the pustular appearances after vaccination in that Hospital, it may be passed over in silence. The more important and not less interesting subjects of Dr Woodville's pamphlet were the fact of the disappearance of these pustular eruptions, and the circumstances under which they disappeared. 1. The vaccine matter of the Small-pox Hospital, after which pustular eruptions had so generally appeared, was employed in two situations in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, vaccinating more than 1000 persons, in two of whom only did any pustules, resembling those of small-pox, appear. 2. Though Dr Woodville denied adulteration of the vaccine matter with matter of small-pox, he was, however, obliged to admit, that the cases of vaccination in the Hospital \"had been, and still <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to be, influenced by some adventitious cause, independent of cow-pox.\" This was proved by the results of vaccination practised in the hospital by matter obtained from many different animals: by the results of vaccination practised on persons at their own houses, in various districts of London, by Dr Woodville and other medical gentlemen who employed the matter from the same stock; and more decidedly by the result of vaccination practised on three patients at Hospital, with matter obtained from the same cow, from which Dr Jenner took the matter employed in the vaccinations of Dr Marshall. In one of these patients no fewer than 100 varioloid pustules appeared; and other instances, equally conclusive, appear to have taken place. 3. Among many children residing in various parts of London, to whom Dr Woodville transferred the disease, through the medium of the Hospital matter, no instance of matured pustules had occurred during the twelve months succeeding to the introduction of the practice. 4. The pustular eruptions which had been so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> after vaccination, at the early period of the practice, became much less frequent. Of 310 cases of vaccination, after the publication of the first Reports, 39 were attended with pustular eruptions in the following order:\u2014In the first 100, 19; in the second 100, 13; and in the last 110, only 7; and at a later period they appeared in the proportion of 3 or 4 only in the 100.\n\nFrom these various facts, Dr Woodville very justly drew the inference, that the cases vaccinated at the hospital differed from those vaccinated elsewhere, in being placed in the centre of a variolated atmosphere, to the operation of which the pustular eruptions were to be ascribed. In forming this conclusion, however, he committed the singular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALOGISM\">paralogism</a> of supposing that the cow-pock excited these pustules, or was, in\nother words, the direct cause of the varioloid disease; and he, therefore, imagined that the variolated atmosphere of the Hospital, the existence of which he willingly admitted, was only a co-operating cause. It is obvious that this extraordinary doctrine owed its birth to the previous opinion which, we have already remarked, he formed of the nature of the vaccine disease,\u2014that it was not confined to the spot to which lymph is applied, but was capable of extending its action over the whole cutaneous surface. Had Dr Woodville not allowed himself to be misled by this erroneous principle, there is a strong presumption, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> in which he expresses himself, that he would have arrived at the true conclusion which recent and accurate observation have at length succeeded in establishing.\n\nWhen the facts above noticed are considered, we conceive it will not be difficult for our readers, if they keep in mind the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> originally ascertained by Dr Jenner, respecting the local action of the vaccine disease, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of its being communicated by application of its proper fluid, to comprehend, that the pustular eruptions over the cutaneous surface of the vaccinated were not excited, as Dr Woodville concluded, by cow-pox, nor arose, as Dr Jenner suspected, from mixture of various matter with vaccine, but were the immediate results of the variolous atmosphere in which the individuals were placed. The different degree in which they appeared in the early and more recent period of Dr Woodville's vaccinations, will form no valid objection to this conclusion, when it is remembered, that the frequency of pustular eruptions in the first vaccinations, depended on the abundance of variolous effluvia necessarily existing in a small-pox Hospital, or the saturation of its air with this matter;\u2014while their subsequent rarity was the effect of its gradual diminution by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> or diminution of its cause, and of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> extinction by the substitution of another disease. That admixture of variolous matter had not taken place, there is every reason to conclude; as we know, from the experiments of Dr Woodville, that it is impossible to produce in this manner a mixed or neutral disease, but that each preserves its distinctive and appropriate characters. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POST\">post</a>-vaccine pustular eruptions should have suggested another conclusion,\u2014that the vaccine disease does not entirely extinguish the variolous, or prevent its appearance, but renders it milder, less tedious, and, to a certainty, destroys the chance of its fatality. That this conclusion escaped Dr Woodville is by no means wonderful, especially when it is remembered, that the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> of the profession was, that a second attack of small-pox was an occurrence so rare, as to be considered next to impossible. \"Happy is it for mankind,\" says Dr Jenner, \"that the appearance of the small-pox a second time on the same person beyond a trivial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, is so extremely rare, that it is looked upon as a phenomenon. Indeed, since the publication of Dr Heberden's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> on the Varicella or chicken-pox, the idea of such an occurrence, in deference to authority so truly respectable, has been generally relinquished.\" It is worthy of remark, also, that Dr Woodville not only admitted this inference in its fullest extent, but applied it, in the same unlimited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a>, to the immunity afforded by vaccination against the variolous disease. \"This circumstance, then,\" says he, (that is, the immunity afforded by cow-pox,) \"appears to be as much a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of the system, as that a person having had the small-pox, is thereby rendered unsusceptible of receiving the disease a second time.\" (Reports, 155.) On this subject it is only necessary to remark, that Dr Thomson of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> has shown, in the most convincing manner, that the non-recurrence of smallpox has been admitted on far too slender grounds; and that the writings of physicians contain sufficient evidence, that small-pox may occur at least twice, if not three times, in the person of the same individual. Had this important proposition been known, or admitted to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> extent, at the period when vaccination was introduced, there is reason to believe, that the appearance of pustules on the persons of those who had been vaccinated, would not have occasioned so much perplexity to the friends of the practice, or triumph to its enemies, and that its true merit would have been more justly, and not less quickly appreciated.\n\nDuring the progress of Dr Woodville's experimental inquiries, the merits of vaccination began to be understood, and the practice had been coming into general and extensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>, both in London and in the more remote counties of England. The publication of Dr Woodville's second Tract may be regarded as marking the epoch of its general admission; and announcing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADOPTION\">adoption</a> of it in Public Charities, and in the practice of the most eminent surgeons. The united efforts of Drs Pearson, Lettsom, MM. Moore, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">Ring</a>, &c. and other philanthropic or professional individuals, contributed powerfully to its general introduction; and though opposition was at first shown, the more candid and intelligent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the profession at length admitted the advantages of vaccination over <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> variolation. It is unnecessary to bestow any notice on the objections which were urged by writers of a certain class, and which, as they were founded on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> have now sunk into a well merited oblivion. The efficacy of vaccination, as an anti-variolous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a>, was, indeed, so generally admitted, and the practice was so widely introduced, that its benefits were extended, in the course of a few months, to many thousand persons, in different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>; and were conveyed by different channels to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIENNA\">Vienna</a>, to most of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a>, and to the United States of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>. In the meantime, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> created at first by the appearance of pustules in the vaccinations of Pearson, Woodville, Ring, Dunning, Goldson, and others, seemed to have worn off completely, or to have been forgotten; and the great bulk both of the profession and of the public considered the occurrence of small-pox eruptions, after vaccination, either impossible or so rare as to be regarded as a physiological anomaly. The general credence of this maxim did not arise from the complete absence of pustular eruptions after vaccination, as we shall see, but evidently depended on the idea of the distinctive nature of chicken-pox, or the inaccurate notions of small-pox itself then prevalent; and also on the great\nexpectations formed of the powers of the vaccine disease in counteracting or extinguishing the poison of small-pox.\n\nThe truth of these assertions is abundantly confirmed by the subsequent history of vaccination, and of small-pox eruptions occurring either sporadically or epidemically in various parts of the country. We have already seen, that Dr Jenner was led to infer the absolute immunity from small-pox conferred by the process of vaccination, and to consider the vaccine disease so similar to small-pox, that when the human body had undergone the former, it was no longer liable to attacks of the latter. This doctrine was admitted by many professional persons in terms much more unlimited, if possible, than those in which it had been understood, even by its first promulgator. Dr Jenner was, indeed, inclined to qualify it in some degree; but the professed partizans of vaccination, from a well-meant idea, perhaps, that it would weaken public confidence, and render the adoption of vaccination less easy than was consistent with public safety, opposed every approach to such an opinion, and defended strenuously the anti-variolous properties of the vaccine disease.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to mention here, that, since the time of Dr Heberden, a vesicular, or vesiculo-pustular disease, not unlike small-pox in its local appearances and constitutional symptoms, had been distinguished from it as a separate affection under the name of Chicken-pox. Almost all the instances of pustular or small-pox-like eruptions which were observed after vaccination, were referred to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of chicken-pox; or if they were not sufficiently similar to this disease, to be referred to it, they were admitted to be small-pox, but occurring only in persons on whom vaccination had been imperfect in action, or improperly performed. In other instances, the appearances of the eruption were so fallacious, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of the observers so little precise, that of those who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> them some contended that they were chicken-pox, and others small-pox.\n\nAlthough cases were not unfrequent in which practitioners of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> and knowledge were obliged to admit the occurrence of small-pox, in the persons of those who had undergone vaccination, Dr Willan appears to have been the first who had courage and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a> sufficient to examine the matter coolly, and to show the exact <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of evidence by which it was supported. In the fourth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> of his interesting treatise on Vaccine Inoculation, this physician has collected several cases which occurred to himself, or within his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> observation, and referred to those collected by authors since the introduction of the practice of vaccination. As many of these were thought by several physicians and surgeons to have been chicken-pox, and as this indicated want of precision in the characteristics of the disease, Dr Willan, in his seventh section, gave an account of those marks by which he conceived chicken-pox in three different forms could be recognised. And it is by no means unimportant to observe, that the distinctions which Dr Willan established among the various forms of cutaneous inflammation, and the precision with which he expected the eruptive diseases to observe those characters, prevented him from taking those general and more just views of post-vaccine small-pox in which physicians have since coincided. Little change, therefore, appears to have taken place in the opinions of professional men, farther than to admit the occurrence of chicken-pox, and of a modified small-pox after vaccination; or, if the appearances were too strong for this construction, to consider the vaccination as imperfect and ineffectual. Such, in general, was the tenor of the Reports of the Vaccine Institutions, of our various public charities, and in some instances of scientific Colleges; and so unanimous and decided was the language of those bodies, that individuals were unable to form their own opinions on objects of daily observation, or were prevented from expressing them by the fear of being regarded as either incapable of observing, or unable to communicate the genuine and perfect form of the vaccine disease; or, in short, as enemies to a practice, the pious object of which was to counteract a foul and fatal disease, and to increase the probable chances of human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>.\n\nThe publication of these Reports did not, however, cause the complete extinction of post-vaccine small-pox, or prevent the appearance of the disease; and cases continued to occur even after the process of vaccination was admitted to be satisfactory, and in the observations of physicians, whose knowledge and experience gave no ground for doubting the fact. It cannot be expected, that all these cases have been published, or that their full extent can now be ascertained; for it is easy to see, that they would be often disregarded, and sometimes studiously concealed. To understand, however, the merits of vaccination, and its influence in controlling small-pox, sporadic or epidemic, it is indispensably necessary, for the unbiased inquirer, to be aware of the evidence which may be obtained from the cases of variolous or varioloid eruptions in the persons of the vaccinated already recorded. It was to Dr Thomson of Edinburgh that was reserved the merit of ascertaining the true powers of vaccination, and of placing in a just point of view the benefits conferred on mankind by the introduction of the practice. The cases of pustular eruption, in the persons of the vaccinated, were scattered in various works, their evidence was neglected and overlooked, and the inferences which they tended to establish were not understood, or they were disregarded. It was only by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> with those afforded by subsequent observation, that real advantage could be derived from them. An opportunity for this investigation occurred in 1816, when small-pox began to appear in one or two points of the country, and eventually spread over a considerable extent. Had the appearance of small-pox been confined to one or two towns or villages, it is not unlikely that they might have been viewed in the same indifferent light in which they had been since 1800, and that they would have continued to give rise to the same doubts, and similar imperfect explanations, which they had previously done. Appearing, however, as they did in many different points of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">Island</a>, successively or simultaneously, and, as was afterwards learnt, in several countries of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, the public mind became alarmed, professional curiosity was\nVaccination awakened, and physicians resumed the task of investigating a disease which, it had been fondly but prematurely hoped, vaccination would render practically unknown. In the year 1816, accounts of smallpox\u2014occurring in persons of all kinds, those exposed to contagion and those not exposed,\u2014the vaccinated, the unvaccinated, the imperfectly vaccinated,\u2014and even in those who had previously undergone the disease, began to be transmitted to the various periodical publications; and during the four subsequent years, the epidemic continued to appear or subside at intervals, and to furnish matter for the observation and reasoning of physicians, whether vaccinators or inoculators. In Edinburgh, and various parts of Scotland, they prevailed to a very considerable extent, attended with a mortality of 1 in 4 to the unvaccinated and unvariolated, and affecting the vaccinated in the rate of 1 to 2 nearly. Though the individual cases have been observed and collected by many different professional gentlemen, it is to Dr Thomson almost entirely that we owe the thorough investigation which the subject has at length undergone, and from whose researches have been derived the certain and satisfactory results which we now possess. This physician, equally distinguished by acuteness of reasoning, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> judgment, and habits of accurate observation, examined personally the whole of the cases almost that occurred in Edinburgh and its vicinity; and where the distance rendered personal examination inconvenient, procured, from intelligent correspondents, correct accounts of the phenomena. It was in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> addressed to the Editor of the Medical and Surgical Journal in September 1818, that Dr Thomson first expressed his opinion of the incorrectness of the prevalent doctrines on the effects of the vaccine disease, and of the common doctrines on small-pox, chicken-pox, and modified small-pox, with which these opinions were intimately connected.\n\nIn consequence of the publication of this letter, and a subsequent one containing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of queries tending to illustrate or ascertain the doubtful points of the subject, a great body of evidence was in a short time collected, and in various forms laid before the profession. The results, with those of Dr Thomson's very extended observation of the disease, may be found in the two works which he has recently published; and in which he has canvassed, with the greatest judgment, and in the most liberal manner, all the problematical and assumed points of the subject.\n\nThe circumstances, however, which merit particular attention, in this recent epidemic, are the strong confirmation of the truth of many of the earliest observations since the introduction of vaccination; and especially of those views which we have already shown, the experimental inquiry of Dr Woodville, if properly understood, would have suggested. The varioloid disease, at least in Edinburgh and its vicinity, and so far as can be discovered, throughout Scotland, occurred in three classes of persons; those who had undergone neither small-pox nor cow-pox, those who passed through small-pox, and those who had undergone, in a satisfactory manner, the process of vaccination.\n\nIn these several classes of patients, it was found that the different forms of varioloid eruptions described as pure small-pox, modified small-pox, and chicken-pox, co-existed during the epidemic, and were capable of producing each other. It was observed, for example, that individuals who, after vaccination, presented eruptions termed modified small-pox or chicken-pox, were capable of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> to those who had neither undergone vaccination, nor had been affected with small-pox, an eruptive disease which could not be distinguished by competent judges from small-pox. (Thomson, Varioloid Disease, p. 45, and p. 207.) It was also found, that the same contagion or the same infecting source, produced cases of coherent or confluent small-pox in the unprotected; and cases of chicken-pox, or modified small-pox in the vaccinated, or even in persons who had many years before passed through smallpox. The obvious conclusion from these facts is, that if small-pox and its modifications, and chicken-pox be admitted to derive their origin from a contagious source, that contagion must be one and the same for all; and that whatever opinion be formed as to the nosological differences of small-pox and chicken-pox, as pustular or vesicular eruptions, it must be granted, that they spring from the same generating cause; and that the variations in appearance depend on something totally unconnected with the contagious agent which causes their formation. There is no means of accounting for this relation of diseases, Dr Thomson has justly remarked, unless in supposing two contagious causes, specifically distinct, existing at the same time, and in the same place, and producing their respective effects on the persons of those exposed. But, independent of the general improbability of this doctrine, it might be easily shown, that of two such distinct contagious causes as we have supposed, not only would one or other have produced its characteristic effects on a much greater proportion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a>; but these effects could not possibly have been so frequently interchanged, or so uniformly have appeared in place of each other, as the experience of the recent epidemic has shown. To render this point, which is liable to be misunderstood, especially by our general readers, more obvious and intelligible, let it be supposed, as was done after the time of the elder Heberden, that chicken-pox arose from one morbid cause, and small-pox from another, utterly different; and let it also be admitted, that both contagions are occasionally found to appear in a community epidemically; then it must follow, that the disease which depends on chicken-pox contagion ought at all times, and in all cases, to preserve distinctive characters, and that small-pox should likewise preserve the same unvarying peculiarity of appearance. No approach of characteristic features, much less complete interchange, ought to take place; and the phenomena of chicken-pox ought to be as distinct from those of small-pox, as they are from those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAGUE\">plague</a>, of itch, or of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEPROSY\">leprosy</a>. These results, however, which unquestionably flow directly from the admission which we have made of distinct contagious agents, were completely contradicted by everything observed in the variolous epidemic of 1817-\nVaccination.\n\nand the subsequent years; and it is impossible to resist or deny the conclusion, that small-pox, chicken-pox, and modified small-pox, owe their birth to the same source, are children of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a>, and members of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>.\n\nIt may be expected, since we adopt the conclusions to which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a> and good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of Dr Thomson induce him to apply the name of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> only, that we ought to prove, by direct arguments, the nosological error committed by Dr Heberden, in separating chicken-pox as a distinct genus from small-pox. To this we reply, that it is not by direct arguments that the point can be proved; for, without subjecting to strict <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCRUTINY\">scrutiny</a> the characters on which Dr Heberden assigned a separate place to chicken pox, it is now agreed that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> distinctions of Dr Willan completely failed in establishing a satisfactory difference in the generating causes of chicken-pox and small-pox. Had Dr Willan indeed given a due degree of weight to the fact which he states in the very outset of his 7th section, that he had seen since 1800 no fewer than 74 cases of varicella, which were by many persons deemed small-pox after vaccination, and the remarkable counterpart of this fact, that the eruptions described in his 4th section were at first regarded as chicken-pox by several physicians and surgeons, he must have been convinced of the impossibility of establishing a difference between these diseases on no other ground than that of their vesicular or pustular character. We adhere in this case to the acknowledged maxim in philosophical inquiry, to admit no more causes than are adequate to account for the effect; and while we allow the excellence of the distinctions introduced by Dr Willan as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> terms for characteristic appearances, we deny the inference that has been drawn, that these are adequate to establish a nosological difference. It is, indeed, with those who contend for the specific or generic difference of small-pox and chicken-pox, that the task of proving this rests; and it is incumbent on them to bring forward more substantial proofs and arguments than those on which the distinction has been admitted, and which are undoubtedly inconclusive.\n\nThough the hypothesis to which we have here adverted, evidently does not require to be supported by different arguments derived from other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>, yet it is equally due to the merit of Dr Thomson, and to that of other physicians, whose observations have led them to similar researches, to remark, that the identical origin of small-pox and chicken-pox is an opinion at length adopted by others, both in this country and on the Continent. Our limits prevent us from entering largely or particularly into this division of our subject; but we must not leave it, without adverting to the opinions expressed by MM. Berard and De Lavit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONTPELLIER\">Montpellier</a>, and Dr Hodenpyl of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROTTERDAM\">Rotterdam</a>. Small-pox prevailed epidemically in the former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> in 1816, and in the latter, and various parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, in 1817 and 1818; and in both situations, not only were chicken-pox at the same time extensively prevalent, but the phenomena of both diseases were found to be frequently and generally interchanged; and they were, in other respects, so similar to those observed in Edinburgh and various parts of Scotland, that the conclusions which we have above noticed were irresistible. It is interesting to observe, not only as a confirmation of the accuracy of Dr Thomson's views, but as an example of different observers, unconsciously and unknown to each other, forming the same conclusions from similar researches, that MM. Berard and De Lavit were led to announce, in 1818, at Montpellier, an opinion which Dr Thomson first published in September 1818, at Edinburgh; and that Dr Hodenpyl of Rotterdam, in the course of the same year, was led to express his opinion, that chicken-pox was the primitive form of small-pox, and could be shown to originate from the same parent stock.\n\nThe view which the hypothesis of Dr Thomson enables us to take of varioloid and varicellous eruptions, and of the relation in which they stand to the vaccine disease, suggests a more satisfactory explanation of the phenomena which these eruptions present, and of the sequences, as we may name them, which they observe, than either denying the anti-variolous efficacy of vaccination, or supposing it imperfect, or improperly performed; or, indeed, than any other explanation hitherto adopted by physicians. It has been a prevalent error with medical observers to attach a degree of mathematical precision to the phenomena of eruptive diseases, and especially to those of the several forms of variolous or varicellous eruptions; and to imagine that their appearance and effects in the human body were regulated by laws of the utmost precision. The mixture of truth and of error exhibited in this doctrine is the reason of its admission without question, and its propagation without resistance. For while it is certain that extended observation proves that small-pox may affect the same individual more frequently than once, and that its first occurrence by no means secures the individual from a second attack, it is undeniable that the maxim is so far correct in general terms, that the disease is rarely known to appear twice with the very same characters, or with the same severity in the same individual. While, therefore, the first appearance of the disease does affect some change in the susceptibility of the frame to a second attack, it is obvious that this change is neither so marked nor so uniform, nor so absolute as the opinions of physicians had hitherto represented it to be. (Thomson's Varioloid Epidemic, p.201.) It is precisely this error which has given rise to mistakes so general on the anti-variolous power of vaccination. It was the same mode of thinking that led the more zealous partizans of vaccination to expect a form of action more absolute and determinate, and an immunity more complete than the laws of organic motions ever sanctioned. It may be urged, indeed, that to predicate what the laws of organic motions are, or what they sanction, is a mere petitio principii, a sort of assumed principle, unless we adduce facts or arguments to prove what we advance; but is it to be doubted, that the actions of living bodies, and the influence exercised on living objects by exterior agents, are not regulated by laws mathematically exact? Has the most sedulous observer ever been able to trace or to demonstrate that certainty of action, or regularity of effect, which is exem-\nVaccination plified in matter endowed with properties merely physical? Has attentive observation of the phenomena of living bodies, and, above all, of those of the human frame, not shown, that the results of every process are influenced by numerous circumstances, and modified by causes too complicated to allow their operation to be appreciated? Such, we may now conclude, has it been with the practical application of the vaccine disease, and such will it be with every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> which is adopted in medicine, with too little regard to the character of those objects on which the physician has to operate.\n\nIt must now be obvious, that vaccination is not the positive and exact action, which it was thought to be at the moment of its introduction; and, that it does not effect on the human body that absolute change which it was originally represented to do. That it does effect a change of some kind must be inferred, not only from the phenomena of those forms of small-pox which occur in the persons of the vaccinated, but also, in a more conspicuous and forcible manner, from the phenomena of vaccination performed a second time on the same individual. The vesicle produced in Mr Bryce's test-vaccination, or even any vesicle thus produced at a period subsequent to the first one is evidently a modified cow-pock (vaccinella), and bears the same relation to the first cow-pock, that modified small-pox or chicken-pox bear to the first attack of small-pox.* But the occurrence of this vaccinelline vesicle must be regarded as a direct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> that the change is not absolute, but limited; and the occurrence of pustular eruptions, whether variolous or varicellous, in the vaccinated, must be admitted in evidence to establish the same conclusion. It may, indeed, be regarded as the genuine result of extensive observation, conducted in the most accurate manner, that the process of vaccination is not exempted from those uncertainties which have long formed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-IMPEDIMENTS\">impediments</a> to exact principles and positive rules in medicine; and that it does not render the human body universally or absolutely unsusceptible of subsequent attacks of small-pox in various degrees of severity.\n\nNor will the results to which we have cursorily adverted, admit of more easy explanation by the objection which has so often been sought in the interruption or imperfection of the process of vaccination. It is not to be denied that vaccination has been sometimes rendered imperfect by one or other of the ordinary causes, and that it is reasonable to think that persons thus vaccinated are more likely to be subsequently affected with small-pox than those in whom the vaccine process has been regular and complete; but no proof has been afforded that post-vaccine small-pox was confined to those in whom vaccination was imperfect; and in innumerable instances in which small-pox succeeded vaccination, the latter process was ascertained to be as perfect as in those who were not subsequently the subjects of varioloid eruptions. Had there been any force in the circumstance, it was reasonably to be expected that the degree of modification should be in the inverse ratio of the perfection of the vaccine process, and in the direct ratio of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> between the period of vaccination and the appearance of varioloid disease. No result of this kind has been observed either in the Edinburgh epidemic, or in those described by Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CROSS\">Cross</a> and MM. Berard and De Lavit, or that of Holland, as described by Hodenpyl; nor has it appeared, that those affected with modified small-pox had been vaccinated with fluid taken at an improper time, or had cutaneous eruptions, or other disturbing causes, to a greater extent than those in whom varioloid eruptions never took place.\n\nThe experience of the recent epidemic has amply confirmed the conclusion, that vaccination, though quite regular, and performed in the most satisfactory manner, does not preclude a subsequent attack of small-pox, in one or other of its forms; and does not furnish a positive immunity any more than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> small-pox, or artificial variolation. And it is satisfactory to think that this inference has been substantially admitted by the unbiased <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECLARATION\">declaration</a> of the Board of the National Vaccine Establishment.\n\nBut while we are obliged to qualify the doctrines of the original vaccinators with these limitations, it cannot fail to be gratifying, not only to the lovers of truth, but also to the sincere and temperate friends of vaccination, to find that the great practical results are not materially affected; and to know that our experience has shown the benefits of the practice in as strong a point of view as its most sanguine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a> could wish. Though the process of vaccination does not positively prevent a subsequent attack of small-pox, it has been incontestibly proved, that it not only mitigates the severity of such future attacks, but diminishes the chance of their fatality almost to a fraction, or an infinitely small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a>. The clearest method of showing the truth of this proposition is, by contrasting the mortality of cases of secondary small-pox, that is, occurring either after the natural or artificial disease, with the mortality of cases of small-pox occurring after vaccination. According to the observations of Dr Thomson, the proportion of deaths in secondary small-pox, if two infections be admitted, is 1 in 25, and if one infecting source be admitted, 1 in 75 only (Varioloid Epidemic, p. 202); but death has taken place in small-pox after vaccination in one only of above 330 cases, which is between \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), or, in exact terms, \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) less frequently than it occurs in iterated small-pox. If to this statement be added the allowance that must be made for the numbers of the vaccinated who were not at all affected with subsequent varioloid eruptions, the rate of post-vaccine eruptions terminating fatally will be reduced to an infinitely small quantity. In the varioloid epidemic described by Mr Cross, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORWICH\">Norwich</a>, of 10,000 vaccinated persons, 329\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) were affected with\n\n* See Dr Thomson's remarks at the conclusion of Dr Stoker's Letter in No. 77 of Edin. Med. and Surg. Journal.\nVaccination variolous eruptions, of whom only one case appears to have terminated fatally. The coincidence of this proportion with that given by Dr Thomson induces us to place the greatest confidence in its accuracy; and we feel certain, that if observations be made on future cases, even this proportion will diminish. At present, in estimating the decided superiority of vaccination, in diminishing the chance both of danger and of death from small-pox, two elements must be kept in mind:\u20141st, That all the vaccinated are not affected with small-pox or varioloid eruptions, and even the proportion of these appears to be smaller than in instances of inoculation, or any other method except natural small-pox;\u2014and, 2dly, That of those so affected, not above one case in 330 terminates unfavourably. These results establish, in the most convincing manner, the powers of the vaccine disease as an antidote to the ravages of small-pox; and cannot fail to prove, to the satisfaction of its most sceptical opponents, that the strong and plausible objections to which the recent epidemic was at first calculated to give rise, have been of no other use than to place the merits of vaccination in a clearer and more forcible point of view.\n\nIt is in its power of diminishing the mortality of small-pox, therefore, that the superiority of vaccination consists; and it is on this strong ground only, that its partisans and true friends should defend its general adoption. Let the governors of charitable institutions, the guardians of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>, the parents of families, and the public at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>, be convinced of the facts which we have now stated, and the inferences derived from them, and it cannot be doubted that the practice of vaccination, instead of being opposed, or apprehended as a source of new and disastrous maladies, or ridiculed as a useless and inefficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a>, will be dispassionately estimated, and raised to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> among the benefits of science, to which its happy effects unquestionably entitle it. It is surely superfluous to show the duty incumbent on all ranks to extend vaccination as widely as possible, if for no other reason than to preserve the lives of their relatives during the prevalence of epidemic small-pox,\u2014and to say that, in proportion as vaccination is general, the infection of small-pox must be gradually limited and confined, until it is almost entirely expelled from the habitations of men. There cannot be a doubt, that every variolous epidemic, especially in large cities, is developed much more readily in consequence of the practice of variolous inoculation, or suffering children to be exposed to the infection of natural small-pox; and it is equally certain, that where vaccination is general, the introduction of variolous infection is either difficult, or when introduced, it is disarmed of its gigantic strength.\n\nTwo points connected with this subject have given rise to so much speculation, that we must not omit to notice them, however briefly. The introduction of vaccination, and its effects in diminishing the mortality of small-pox, have been naturally supposed by many writers to have a great influence on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a>, and to increase the numbers of the living at different periods of life. Some have gone so far as to imagine, that in this respect it would operate to an injurious extent, and increase the population of most countries beyond the limits of subsistence; while others have conceived, that an increase of different diseases would be necessarily occasioned by the extirpation of small-pox; and that this would be one of the great means employed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">Providence</a>, to keep the rate of population in due proportion to the means of procuring food.\n\nThere cannot be a doubt that one of the most salutary effects of the practice of vaccination is to diminish very much the mortality occasioned by small-pox, and consequently to augment, in a considerable degree, the numbers of the community in which it is practised. To understand distinctly, however, in what manner this diminution is operated, it is requisite to show the effect which unresisted small-pox exercises on the population of a community, and for this purpose we employ a familiar example derived from estimates formed in this country. In the year 1795, when the population of Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a> was estimated, according to the returns, at 14,724,000, it was calculated that the numbers annually destroyed by small-pox, according to one estimate, amounted to 34,260, and according to another, to 36,000. If we state it in round numbers at 35,000 as a medium, this mortality amounts to the enormous proportion of 1 in every 420; or, in other words, small-pox destroys annually 1/420th part of the whole population of the country. As it is obvious, that the population can be increased by the number of births only, as it is diminished by the number of deaths, it follows, that to obtain a just notion of the effect of small-pox in diminishing the population, we must deduct this 1/420th part from the numbers which are annually added by births. According to the most correct observations and calculations, it appears, that at the period which we have selected, the proportion of births to the whole population of the country was as 1 to 30, or for every 30 persons in the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, only one is annually added by births. (Malthus, Book II. chap. 9, and Additions.) It therefore follows, that as the proportion destroyed by small-pox must be taken out of this annual addition to the numbers of the country, the fraction of $\\frac{30}{420}$ or $\\frac{1}{14}$, annually, will represent the exact rate at which small-pox retards the increasing numbers of a country, or acts as a positive check on population. It is to be remarked, that the elements on which these calculations are\n\n---\n\n* Mr Cross nowhere gives this proportion exactly; but it is correctly deduced from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATA\">data</a> in the following manner:\u2014Dr Yellowly, from inquiries similar to those of Mr Cross, estimates the vaccinated in Norwich at $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the whole population, or 10,000; and of 603 persons under the personal observation of Mr Cross, 200 had small-pox, 91 had been vaccinated, 2 of whom had modified small-pox, and 1 chicken-pox; the remaining 312, who had small-pox formerly, had no subsequent eruption during the epidemic; consequently, we have the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> numbers, $91 : 3 :: 10,000 : 329 \\frac{1}{1}$.\nVaccination founded, are derived from that period at which it is generally admitted that small-pox inoculation was most favourably conducted, and at which the smallest number of deaths is supposed to have taken place from small-pox, since it first began to prevail as a destructive epidemic among the habitations of men.\n\nWe have given this familiar, and we trust quite intelligible view of the influence of small-pox on population, because we fear, if we had attempted to follow the circuitous, but very beautiful and accurate train of analytic calculation, by which Duvilleard has investigated the subject, we should have added much to the length of this article, without interesting our general readers, or affording information universally intelligible. This author, who has investigated the matter in the soundest manner, and with the most profound applications of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a>, has given formul\u00e6 and tables for almost every possible question which the inquiry can suggest. He appears, on the principles which he has adopted, to have made the destructive or depopulating power of small-pox greater even than we have shown it to be. He gives the following results of his analytic investigations, as applied to the population of France. According to the law of mortality, in the natural state, the\n\n| Entire population of France | Both sexes and all ages |\n|-----------------------------|------------------------|\n|                             | 28,763,192              |\n| Those already passed through small-pox | 23,212,998 |\n| Those not passed through it | 5,450,194 |\n| Those that die without passing through it | 667,749 |\n| Those who must have it at some period | 4,782,445 |\n| Those that take it and escape | 4,445,041 |\n| Those that die of it | 337,404 |\n\nThat is, 85,685 in the current year.\n\nNow, in the natural state, 85,685 children, add to the population of 28,763,194, only 337,404 individuals, and by immunity from small-pox, they furnish farther 3,492,583, which raises the population to the number of 32,255,776. If such be the influence of vaccination, in increasing the numbers of mankind, it might appear, a conclusion sufficiently natural to imagine, that the population of many nations would increase so rapidly, as to exceed the means of subsistence, and overcrowd the space allotted for occupation. In point of fact, however, notwithstanding the operation of this cause, for at least twenty years, in several countries of Europe and America, the result has not been realized; and, though the nations of Europe were perhaps never so populous as at the present moment, this evidently depends on other causes than that which prevents the mortality of small-pox.\n\nIt is a fact which has been said to be ascertained by many respectable observers, that while the destruction occasioned by small-pox has been much diminished, other diseases, equally fatal, have been found to be more prevalent. We will not question the correctness of this observation, or deny it absolutely, but we must have it established on more certain and unquestionable facts and documents before it be admitted. But whether this be the case or not, it is not difficult to see that vaccination cannot possibly render the human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> immortal; that children, and adults also, must die of other diseases besides small-pox; and that, as the numbers of a young community are increased by being snatched from one disease, a greater number must be preserved to become a prey to others.\n\nWe by no means, however, countenance the opinion that the mortality of other diseases will increase exactly in the ratio in which that of small-pox has been diminished; nor do we believe that this mortality is a necessary result of vaccination. It is found, on the best authority, that a perceptible diminution of mortality in children under ten years has taken place in every situation in which vaccination has been general; and it must therefore be concluded, that the number of individuals living at that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> is augmented. It is obvious, however, that, unless we lose sight of the most fixed principles in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of population, this will have but a trifling effect in increasing the numbers of mankind, when it is remembered that it is ready to be counteracted by the positive checks to which we already alluded, but especially by the preventive check on which the number of marriages and of births depends.\n\n(See various papers in the 6th, 7th, 8th, 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, and 18th Vols. of the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal; several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> in the London Medical and Physical Journal; Observations on Small-pox, &c. by Dr Monro, Edinburgh, 1818; Account of the Varioloid Epidemic which has lately prevailed in Edinburgh, and other parts of Scotland, &c. by Dr Thomson, Lond. 1820; Historical Sketch of the Opinions entertained by Medical men respecting the varieties and secondary occurrence of Small-pox, by Dr Thomson, Lond. 1822; A History of the Variolous Epidemic which occurred in Norwich, 1819, and destroyed 500 individuals, &c. by Mr Cross, Lond. 1820; Essai sur les Anomalies de la Variole et de la Varicelle, par MM.

At the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a>, he was sent to a free school at Nottingham, and remained there two years, chiefly under the tuition of Mr Beardmore, afterwards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of the Charterhouse; he was then sent to a school kept by the Reverend S. Pickthall, at Wilford, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> which seems to have been only distinguished by the regular imprisonment of the boys for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> less than eleven hours a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>. After this, when his father obtained the vicarage of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KINGSTON\">Kingston</a> in Surry, with the chapelry of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RICHMOND\">Richmond</a>, he was placed under the care of his curate, who kept a school at Richmond; he was, however, removed in 1769 to a better conducted establishment in the same neighbourhood, kept by the Reverend R. Wooddeson, of whom he speaks in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> approbation.\n\nAt sixteen he went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">College</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>, where his classical studies still <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, although he was so fortunate as to obtain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> wrangler at the termination of his academical studies in 1776. He has, indeed, the candour to observe, that the year was below mediocrity, with regard to the performances of the candidates in general; and that, when he obtained the second classical medal, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">Duke</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEWCASTLE\">Newcastle</a>'s foundation, he had only one competitor; still, it must not be denied, that to be both second wrangler and second medallist, in any year, implies no ordinary portion of application, as well as some considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a>. Mr Wakefield was however distinguished, throughout his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, by a singular mixture of opposite habits; and, in the midst of his studies, he confesses, that \"he sometimes felt himself almost incapable of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> a single page for months together,\" and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> especially, he could only wander about the fields in a state of perfect inactivity. On the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, he says, that, \"for five years, he rose, almost without exception, by five o'clock, winter and summer, but never breakfasted, drank <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEA\">tea</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> supped [supped],\" or of course dined, \"alone, half a dozen times during all that space, enjoying <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>, from the first, beyond <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>.\"\n\nHe became a Fellow of Jesus College in 1776, and he gained, in two successive years, the second Bachelor's prizes given by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">Chancellor</a>: in 1778, he was ordained, by the Bishop of Peterborough, though he did not subscribe the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">Articles</a> without great reluctance. He obtained a curacy first at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-STOCKPORT\">Stockport</a> in Cheshire, and then at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIVERPOOL\">Liverpool</a>. The year after, he married Miss Watson, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIECE\">niece</a> of the Rector of Stockport, and thus vacated his fellowship; his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> life appears to have been happy and harmonious, though the only merit of his wife, that he has left upon record, is the singular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> qualification, that her great grandfather and great grandmother had lived together as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> and wife for seventy-five years.\n\nSoon after his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a>, he became classical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TUTOR\">tutor</a> in the dissenting Academy at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WARRINGTON\">Warrington</a>, though he did not professedly unite with any specific <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a> of dissenters as adopting all their opinions; but he soon began openly to attack those of the established <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> in a multitude of controversial writings, and especially in the notes accompanying his new translations of some parts of the Scriptures; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> for which he had diligently laboured to prepare himself by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of various dialects of the Oriental languages.\n\nAfter the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a> of the Academy of Warrington, he lived at Bramcote in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOTTINGHAMSHIRE\">Nottinghamshire</a>, at Richmond, and at Nottingham; partly occupied in the instruction of a few pupils, and partly in pursuing his own studies and illustrations of antiquity. In 1786, and for two or three years after, he suffered greatly from an acute pain in his shoulder, which interfered materially with the prosecution of his theological investigations.\n\nIn the year 1790, he accepted the classical professorship at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HACKNEY\">Hackney</a>; here his lectures and instructions were generally approved and admired, but he carried his dissent from the articles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> of any established society of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> so much further than any of his colleagues, that he was thought too independent to continue in his situation, and he consequently left the institution in 1791; and for a similar reason he failed of obtaining the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of two private pupils whom he expected to have been placed with him.\n\nHe continued to reside at Hackney, employing himself partly as an author and editor, and partly in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> of his own children. Among his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> productions were several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLEMICAL\">polemical</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> pamphlets, relating to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> with France, and to the various controversies of the day; of these, the most remarkable for its consequences to himself was his Reply to the Bishop of Landaff's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADDRESS\">Address</a>, which occasioned a prosecution to be brought by the Attorney General against his publisher first, and then against himself; and he was sentenced to be confined for two years in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DORCHESTER\">Dorchester</a> jail; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> which was probably intended to be somewhat severe, but which was most fortunate in its operation on his subsequent comfort, since it was the cause of his obtaining, by the exertions of his friends and his partisans at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>, a subscription of about \u00a35,000; a sum which not only alleviated the rigour of his imprisonment, but also enabled him to leave his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> in a state of comparative affluence.\n\nHe was principally occupied during his confinement in continuing his literary labours for the press, and in preparing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of classical lectures, begin-\nning with the illustration of the second book of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGIL\">Virgil</a>'s *Enceid*, the first course of which he delivered in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> immediately after his liberation in May 1801. The effect of unusual exertions of body and mind, after so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> a cessation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a>, and in hot summer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, appears to have predisposed his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> to a typhous fever, of which he died, after a fortnight's illness, the 9th of September 1801, leaving a widow and six children, four sons and two daughters. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>, the Rev. Thomas Wakefield of Richmond, also survived him, and died in 1806.

To conclude the topic of [his] moral character, it was marked by an openness, a simplicity, a good faith, an affectionate ardour, a noble elevation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a>, which made way to the hearts of all who nearly approached him, and rendered him the object of their warmest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a>.\" But \"he wanted time or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a>,\" says Dr Parr very justly, \"for that discrimination which would have made his conjectures fewer indeed; but more probable, and his principles more exact: [yet] I shall ever think of him as one of the best scholars produced by my own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> in my own age.\" The compliments of Heyne, and of his pupil Jacobs, are still more elaborate: but it is well-known that when Porson was one day asked for a toast, with a sentiment from Shakespear, he gave \"Gilbert Wakefield, What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba?\" and there was quite as much of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> as there was of neatness in the application. A reviewer of his Life in the British Critic, by no means favourably disposed towards him, readily admits, that \"he was strictly and enthusiastically honest, and seems to have acquired even a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> for privations: these feelings, added to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a> of independent thinking, led him, we doubt not,\" he says, \"to abstain from wine; to have relinquished in part, and to be tending entirely to give up the use of animal food, with various other instances of peculiarity. Knowing his own assiduity, and giving himself ample <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> for sagacity, he thought that he was equal to the decision of every possible question: and thus he became bigotted to almost every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARADOX\">paradox</a> which had once possessed his very eccentric understanding. He was as violent against Greek accents as he was against the Trinity, and anathematized the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> n as strongly as Episcopacy. Whatever coincided not with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of rectitude, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, elegance, or whatever else it might be, was to give way at once, and to be rescinded at his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>, on pain of the most violent reprehension to all opponents; whether it were an article of faith, a principle of policy, a doctrine of morality, or a reading in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> author, away it must go, to the dogs and the vultures. These exterminating sentences were also given with such precipitancy, as not to allow even a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> for consideration. To the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, to the press, to the [public], all was given at once, frequently to the incurring of the most palpable absurdity. Thus the simple elegance of O beate Sexti, in Horace, was proposed, in an edition of that author, to be changed to O bea T\u0113 Sexti, though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a>, besides being most bald and tasteless, produced a blunder in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a>, that no boy, even in the middle part of a public school, would have been thought pardonable in committing it. By faults [either] original or habitual, his sincerity became offensive, his honesty haughty and uncharitable, his intrepidity factions, his acuteness delusive, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>, assisted by much diligence, a vast weapon which his judgment was totally unable to wield.\"\n\nIt is not impossible that Mr Wakefield might have been more successful in his studies, if he could have found sufficient motives for directing them rather to scientific than to philological pursuits: for he seems to have been fully impressed with the superior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> of science to that of any department of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>. \"Compared with the noble theories of mathematical philosophy,\" he says, \"our classical lucubrations are as the glimmering of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TAPER\">taper</a> to the meridian splendour of an equatorial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>.\" He would, however, scarcely have had perseverance enough to distinguish himself in that solitary labour which is required for the minute <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> phenomena: and it is seldom that any collateral encouragement is held out, in this country, for the continued cultivation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> science; while the classical scholar, though he is supposed to be principally occupied with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOUNS\">nouns</a>, and verbs, and particles, is, in fact, unconsciously, and, therefore, most effectually, learning the arts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHETORIC\">rhetoric</a>, and logic, which have furnished, in all ages, the spur and the reins for urging on and directing the mighty bulk of the body politic, in church and in state, at the will of its leaders. The young man, on the other hand, who commences the pursuit of science with ardour, obtains, if he is most successful, and untortmented by unnecessary scruples, a quiet fellowship, a comfortable apartment, and an excellent plain dinner for the remainder of his life: and if he falls of these, he may chance to be made an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXCISE\">excise</a>-man; or, in the improved arrangements of the present auspicious days, a computer or an assistant astronomer: but with respect to any influence that his pursuits might be supposed to have on the elevation of his rank in life, or in the independent provision for a family, he must lay no such flattering functions to his soul, but must at all times <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> his pride and his happiness in the reflection that AT MINI PLAUDO IPSE DOMI, which is, in truth, the best sublunary support of the wise and the good in every circumstance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> life.\n\n(A. L.)\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WALES\">WALES</a> (New South Wales). In the *Encyclopaedia*, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, New*, is given an account of this colony, including a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of its first settlement by a party of convicts conducted there by Governor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a>; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of the country, and of the natives, and such few slight notices on its internal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">geography</a>, and animal and vegetable productions, as the narrow limits which then bounded the excursions of the settlers had enabled them to make.\n\nIn this *Supplement*, under the Article *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUSTRALASIA\">Australasia</a>*, the accounts of the settlement are brought <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to the year 1814, and copious details given of the results of several expeditions undertaken for the purpose of internal discovery. Considerable discussions having been excited in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a>, and carried on in the diurnal and other periodical publications, respecting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of the distant settlements in the southern hemisphere, it was resolved by the Government to send a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSIONER\">Commissioner</a> with powers to examine every part of the administration; to report on the condition of the inhabitants in general, on their pursuits, their habits, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>, and their conduct; and to suggest, for the consideration of his Majesty's Ministers, such laws and regulations as might tend to make those settlements less burdensome to Great Britain, and more conducive to the improvement of those persons whose violations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a> had created a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> for their removal from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>.\n\nFrom the *Reports* of Commissioner Bigge, whose labours were closed in 1821, and from other papers laid before Parliament, the following accounts of the present state of New South Wales are chiefly extracted, and presented to our readers in a condensed form.\n\nThe increase of inhabitants by births, owing to the great disproportion between the males and females, has been very small since the commencement of the settlement, and must continue to be so till the sexes approach nearer to an equality than they do at present. The whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of convicts exported to New South Wales and to Van Dieman's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">Land</a>, from the year 1787 to 1820, was 22,217 males, and 3661 females; and the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> of all the settlements in the latter year amounted only to 29,407 persons. The inhabitants of New South Wales, amounting to 29,989, are classed in the following manner, viz.: 1307 are persons who came to the colony as free settlers; 1409 are persons born in the settlement; 3255 were become free by the expiry of the terms for which they had been sentenced; 159 had received <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> pardons; 962 had received conditional pardons; 1429 were convicts, but with tickets of leave, which enabled them to work on their own account; 220 were serving on board colonial vessels; 9451 were convicts in a state of servitude; and the remainder, 5668, consisted of children of both sexes. The whole number of females, of all classes and ages, in 1820, were 6310, viz. 3707 women, and 2603 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> children. It appears that in thirty-three years, from 1787 to 1820, during which the whole numbers transported have been 25,878 persons, the number of the convicts who have died, who have lawfully returned to Great Britain, or who have made their escape, amounts together to 7080. The greater part of the inhabitants reside either in the town of Sidney (the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a>), or in its immediate vicinity.\n\nThe returns from that place make the inhabitants to be 12,079, of whom 4457 are convicts.\n\nWhilst this colony has been increasing in numbers, there is reason to hope it has been instrumental in somewhat improving the moral character of the persons transported to it, or, at least, that their progeny is placed in circumstances less exposed to temptation than it would have been under the tuition of such parents in Europe. There has been a gradual, but general improvement in the moral condition of the society, by the children of convicts arriving at maturity; thus forming, with the free settlers, a nearer proportion to the convicts than was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> at the more early periods of the settlement. The remitted convicts, and those whose time has expired, seem, in some instances, to become useful members of society. Mr Bigge relates, that out of 4376 remitted convicts, including those whose time has expired, 369 may be considered as respectable in conduct and character.\n\nThe proportion of landed property acquired by those classes of inhabitants, may be considered as evidence of some improvement in their condition among the classes. The whole quantity of land granted was, in 1820, 389,288 acres. Of this portion, 29,317 belonged to remitted convicts, and 54,693 to convicts whose time has expired. Thus those classes seem to have a fair proportion of the landed property of the settlement; and we think it may be inferred from the Commissioner's *Reports*, that they possess a large share of the moveable property likewise, as they seem to be the principal persons who own vessels and carry on distant trade. Mr Bigge remarks, that \"though the free settlers have not, as a body, been the most successful improvers, either of their own condition or that of the colony, yet the best cultivated estates, and the greatest quantity of cattle, belong to them, though they have not lately engaged in mercantile operations.\" The large grants that have been recently made have rendered the quantity of land, held by classes of individuals, a less accurate criterion of property than it was before those grants were made. In the year 1810, the land cleared was to the land granted as 1\u00bd to 4; but in the year 1820, when the land granted was 389,000 acres, the portions returned as cleared were 54,898 acres, or as 1\u00bd to 7. Of the cleared land, in 1820, 16,706 acres were cultivated to yield wheat, 11,270 maize, 1230 barley, 379 rye and oats, 213 peas, and beans, 504 potatoes, and 1994 in orchards and garden ground.\n\nThe future progress of this colony must depend mainly on the productions raised from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, and hence the condition of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>, including the breeding of cattle, becomes a most interesting subject. The first land settled near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYDNEY\">Sydney</a>, though then moderately fertile, has been exhausted by over-cropping, so that a considerable expenditure in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANURE\">manure</a>, or in labour for fallowing, or in both, is indispensable to renew its productive powers. It has hence become necessary to pay attention to the production and proper application of manure, as well as to the cultivation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> food for the cattle.\nLucerne, sanfoin, and burnet, as well as rye-grass and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEADOW\">meadow</a> fescue, have been introduced and gradually assimilated to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>. It has been remarked of the grass seeds imported from Europe, that their first and second flowering is in conformity with the season in Europe; but that the next time they flower according to the season of New South Wales. The cost of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECLAIMING\">reclaiming</a> an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACRE\">acre</a> of forest land, of converting it into tillage, and of sowing it with wheat, is calculated to amount to L.6, 10s. The cost of the same operation to fit it for maize would be L.5, 8s. 6d. Mr Cox, the surveyor, has estimated, that on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARM\">farm</a> of 50 acres, when the government supplied subsistence for six months, the expense would exceed the produce L.5, 19s. the first year; that in the second year the produce would exceed the expenditure L.49, 10s., and in the third year L.36, 10s.; after which, recourse must be had to the renovating power of manure. Maize and wheat are grown on the same land in one year; the former when hoed well, and twice hilled up, being found a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> for the latter. Wheat is sowed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> or April, and harvested in November. Maize is sowed in November and gathered in April. The produce of wheat on the Hawkesbury settlement, from 1804 to 1814, was from 21 to 25 bushels to the acre, and since the last of those periods from 15 to 20 bushels. The land on the rising ground is inferior to that on the borders of the river, but the wheat grown on it, though yielding less in quantity, is of a superior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>. Mr Oxley, the Surveyor-General, thinks the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> produce of wheat on the colony does not exceed 10 bushels to the acre; whilst, on land of similar quality, the produce of maize is from 30 to 60 bushels. The price of wheat has been from 11s. to 12s. 6d.; of maize from 3s. to 7s. per bushel.\n\nBesides the grains, attempts have been directed to several articles whose cultivation appears suitable to the climate. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAX\">Flax</a> has been grown with success, but has not been extended from the very limited demand for it in the settlement. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOBACCO\">Tobacco</a> has been well produced, but from want of sufficient practice in curing the leaves, the tobacco of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRAZIL\">Brazil</a> has been so generally preferred, as to leave but little inducement to grow it in the colony; though of late, some improvements in drying offer a prospect of more success. Vines have not yet been prosperous, owing to blights which probably have arisen from improper exposure to prevailing winds. As this is an object of great importance, Mr J. Macarthur has paid much attention to rectify any errors, and hopes are entertained of more favourable results in future, than have hitherto been produced. The same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>, one of the earliest settlers, with his characteristic spirit, has been at pains to introduce the olive, and as far as can be judged from the trees, which are yet but in their infancy, with the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARNEST\">earnest</a> of success. All the finer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> of Europe are most profusely brought forth, and in some gardens, the choicer kinds of the tropics are successfully cultivated.\n\nThe breeding of cattle must, however, be the most sure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> to the prosperity of the colony for some years to come. The numbers of horned cattle have quintupled between the years 1810 and 1820. In the latter year they amounted to 54,103; besides those tame cattle, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> have grown up wild in the woods, derived from some stock which early strayed from the settlement, and which were supposed to have perished, till their offspring were discovered in large herds in the interior. The sheep have been tripled in ten years. In 1820, they amounted to 99,487. Mr Macarthur has a flock of 6800, of which about 300 are pure Merinos, and yield <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a> of excellent fineness. As the duty on wool from New South Wales has been reduced to 8d. per lb. in Great Britain, eager hopes are entertained of success, which will naturally tend to increase the numbers, and to improve the quality of the wool. The average <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of the fleeces of the New South Wales Merinos is about 2 lb. 7 oz. Some few bales of that wool have been sold in England at 5s. 6d. per lb.; and one at 10s. 4d.; but the far greater part have hitherto sold at about 2s. The importation into Great Britain has been, in 1819, 71,299 lbs.; 1820, 112,616 lbs.; 1821, 175,433 lbs. The increase of horses has been in nearly the same ratio as the sheep. In 1810, they were 1114; and in 1820, 3659. They are generally of the European breed, with a mixture of the Arabian brought from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>. Pigs and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POULTRY\">poultry</a> have increased in nearly the same proportion as other stock. The mineral productions of this settlement are yet but slightly ascertained. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">Iron</a> has been found about eight miles from Port-Dalrymple, which is said to be equal in quality to that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> have not yet been worked. There is abundance of coal at Hunter's River, about 50 miles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PORT_JACKSON\">Port-Jackson</a>. The vein is three feet thick, was worked by a passage from the river, but is now by a shaft 112 feet deep, and the labour of twenty-seven men can extract twenty tons per day. In this labour, the criminals from Sydney are destined to be employed. Lime, for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>, has hitherto been burnt from oyster-shells, as no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">limestone</a> has been discovered near the settled ports. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">Common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> has been extracted from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, but from the bitter not being accurately separated, the culinary salt of England, notwithstanding its price, is generally preferred.\n\nThe circumstances of the colony are not favourable to manufactories; but some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-HATS\">hats</a>, blankets, wool, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TARES\">tares</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> stockings, and coarse cloths, have been made from the native wool. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-POTTERY\">Pottery</a> wares, of different kinds, have also been made, but they have not yet acquired the art of glazing them. The most advantageous operation of manufacture is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TANNING\">tanning</a>; but, from want of sufficient practical knowledge, it has been hitherto badly performed. The bark of the mimosa, a tree that abounds in the interior, is found to contain the requisite properties for tanning <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HIDES\">hides</a>. With a little more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, and with some regulations to prevent damage to the hides on flaying them, the colony might supply itself with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a> from the cattle bred and slaughtered at home.\n\nThe foreign trade of the colony consists of the importations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>, spirits, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOAP\">soap</a>, and cotton goods, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENGAL\">Bengal</a>; of tea, sugar-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CANDY\">candy</a>, silks, and some clothing, made of English cloth, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHINA\">China</a>; of iron and hardware, cottons, millinery, wines, porter, cheese, and salted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>, from England; and of sugar, tobacco, and spirits, from Brazil. The exportations\nhave hitherto been but trifling. Wool has been already noticed; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEAL\">seal</a> skins and fish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> might have formed returns but for their being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> with higher duty in England, if taken by a colonial than by a British vessel. Exportations to China have been made of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDAL\">sandal</a>-wood, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEARL\">pearl</a> shells, previously collected at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">Islands</a>. Some attempts have been made to export flour to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> of Good Hope, and horses to Batavia; some coals have also been shipped for Bengal and for Batavia. The shipping of the colony consists of twenty-seven vessels, from 15 to 184 tons burden. This branch of industry is much retarded in its growth by the restrictions which are found necessary to prevent the escape of convicts by sea.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> trade has been assisted by the establishment of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a>; but the institution has been injured by having suffered its cashier to defraud it of nearly L. 10,000, being half the capital. The principal circulating medium is the bills of the Government, or receipts for stores received by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSARY\">Commissary</a>, which amount to about L. 40,000. The smaller operations are performed by means of the notes of the bank; which are issued for 2s., 6d., 5s., 10s., 20s., and five pounds. The legal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> in the colony was 8%, and is now raised to 10 per cent.\n\nBy the accounts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURER\">treasurer</a> for seven years, ending September 1821, it appears that the taxes collected in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> amounted to L. 174,310, 10s. and the expenditure to L. 163,790, 8s. The income is derived chiefly from port dues, import duties, licences, and tolls. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> expenditure has been on the establishments for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> and female orphans, and for public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a>\u2014for public buildings and works\u2014for salaries to officers\u2014and for public and judicial charges.\n\nIn all the grants, reservations of land have been made for the support of the clergy, and for the maintenance of schools. The clergy are under the inspection of one of their number, denominated senior chaplain. Some Roman Catholic chapels are building, and one for the Wesleyan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHODISTS\">Methodists</a>. The public services of religion are reported to be attentively observed. The administration of justice is executed in a court established by special <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of Parliament, in which the Chief is an English Barrister; and recently an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTORNEY_GENERAL\">Attorney-General</a> has been appointed, who is to be the general prosecutor of all offenses.\n\nSee Wentworth's New South Wales; Parliamentary Papers ordered, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">House</a>, to be printed at the following dates\u201419th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 1822, 19th April 1821, 13th March 1823, 9th March 1821.

He died in 1737, at an early age, leaving a\nSurvey of the River <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLYDE\">Clyde</a>, from Glasgow to the Point\nof Toward, which was published by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> several\nyears afterwards. James, his younger brother, of an\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a>, ingenious, and enterprising mind, became a\nmerchant in Greenock, and was for upwards of twenty\nyears a member of the Town-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNCIL\">Council</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a>,\nand a zealous promoter of the improvements of the\ntown. By his wife, Agnes Muirheid, he had two\nsons, James, the subject of the present article, and\nJohn, a youth of promising abilities, who was lost at\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> soon after he became of age. Misfortunes in\ntrade, and the decay of the faculties of his mind, oc-\ncasioned his retirement from business some years be-\nfore his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, which happened in 1782, in his eighty-\nfourth year.\n\nJames Watt, his eldest son, and only surviving\nchild, was born at Greenock, the 19th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1736.\nHe received the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> in the\npublic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a> of his native town; but from the ex-\ntreme delicacy of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>, was with difficulty\nenabled to attend the classes, and owed much of his\nacquirements to his studious habits at home. Little\nmore is known of his early years, than that, from the\nfirst, he manifested a partiality for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> con-\ntrivances and operations, and frequently employed\nhimself in that way. The desire of improvement in\nan art then little practised in Scotland, induced him\nto go to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> in his eighteenth year, and there to\nplace himself under the tuition of a mathematical in-\nstrument-maker; but he remained little more than\na twelvemonth, the infirm state of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> com-\npelling his return to the paternal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a>.\n\nIn that short period, he appears to have made great\nproficiency, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>, after his return to Scotland,\nto perfect himself in this art, both at home and on his\nvisits to his mother's relations at Glasgow, where it\nwas his wish to establish himself. But some opposi-\ntion being made by the corporations, who considered\nhim as an intruder upon their privileges, the Professors\nof the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">College</a> took him under their protection, and\naccommodated him with an apartment and premises\nfor carrying on his business within their precincts,\nwith the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> and office of Mathematical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">Instrument</a>-\nmaker to the University. This took place in 1757,\nwhen he was twenty-one years of age, and it must\nbe inferred, that he had already given satisfactory\nproofs of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a> to the eminent men who then adorn-\ned that seat of learning; of whom it is sufficient\nto mention the names of Robert Simpson, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADAM\">Adam</a>\nSmith, Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">Black</a>, and of Dr Dick, the Professor of\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\"><a class=\"xref\" hr</a>ef=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">Natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">Philosophy</a>. There Mr Watt applied sedu-\nlously to business, and in the few intervals which its\nconcerns, and ill-healthallowed, cultivated those various\ntalents which distinguished him in after life; and there\na lasting friendship was formed with the kindred\nminds of Dr Black, and of Mr, afterwards Dr John,\nRobison; then a student at the University, and nearly\nof his own age.\n\nHe remained in the College until some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> in the\nyear 1763, when he removed into the town previous\nto his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUSIN\">cousin</a>, Miss Miller, which\ntook place in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> of the following year.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEAM_ENGINE\"><a class=\"xr</a>ef\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEAM\">Steam</a>-Engine had been a frequent subject of\nconversation between Mr Robison and himself, and\n\n* He is there styled, Professor of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">Mathematics</a>.\nthe former had suggested the possibility of its application to the moving of wheel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARRIAGES\">carriages</a>. About the year 1761 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> 1762, Mr Watt had tried some experiments on the force of steam in a Papin's digester, and had constructed and worked with strong steam a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODEL\">model</a>, consisting of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERTED\">inverted</a> syringe; the bottom of the rod of which was loaded with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>, alternately admitting the steam below the piston, and letting it off to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>. Observing the imperfections of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a>, he soon abandoned it; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> necessary to be bestowed upon his business prevented his reconsidering it, until the winter of 1763-4, when he was employed by the Professor of Natural Philosophy to put in order a working model of a steam-engine upon Newcomen's construction. When he had repaired it and set it to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, he found that the boiler, though <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> in proportion to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a>, was barely able to supply it with steam for a few strokes per <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a>, and that a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INJECTION\">injection</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> was required, though it was but lightly loaded by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PUMP\">pump</a> attached to it. It soon occurred, that the cause lay in the little cylinder (two inches diameter, six inches stroke), <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> a greater surface to condense the steam than the cylinders of larger engines did, in proportion to their respective contents. By shortening the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> of water in the pump, less steam and less injection water were required, and the model worked at a proper speed. Thus the purpose for which it was put into his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> was accomplished; and with this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of accounting for the defect and this result, most artists would have been satisfied. Not so Mr Watt. He had now become aware of a great consumption of steam, and his curiosity was excited to a more accurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> of the causes, in which he proceeded in a truly philosophical manner. The cylinder of his small model being of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a>, he conceived that less steam would be condensed by substituting cylinders of some material which would transmit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> more slowly. He made a larger model with a cylinder (six inches diameter, and one foot stroke) of wood, soaked in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>, and baked to dryness. He ascertained, from experiments made with boilers of various constructions, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> water is neither in proportion to the evaporating surface, nor to the quantity of water, as had been supposed, but to the heat that enters it; and that the latter depended chiefly on the quantity of surface exposed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the fire. He likewise determined the weight of coal required for the evaporation of any given quantity of water. Being convinced that there existed a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> in the statement which had been previously given of the bulk of water when converted into steam, he proceeded to examine that point by experiment; and discovered, that water, converted into steam of the heat of boiling water, was expanded to 1800 times its bulk: or, as a rule for ready calculation, that a cubic inch of water produced a cubic foot of steam. He constructed a boiler to be applied to his model, which should show, by inspection, the quantity of water evaporated, and consequently, would enable him to calculate the quantity of steam used in every stroke of the engine. This he now proved to be several times the full of the cylinder. He also observed, that all attempts to improve the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VACUUM\">vacuum</a>, by throwing in more injection water, caused a disproportionate waste of steam: and it occurred to him, that the cause of this was the boiling of water in vacuo at very low heats (recently determined, by Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CULLEN\">Cullen</a>, to be under 100\u00b0); consequently, at greater heats, the injection water was converted into steam in the cylinder, and resisted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> of the piston. He now perceived clearly, that the great waste of steam proceeded from its being chilled, and condensed by the coldness of the cylinder before it was sufficiently heated to retain it in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> state; and that, to derive the greatest advantage, the cylinder should always be kept as hot as the steam that entered it, and that, when the steam was condensed, it should be cooled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to 100\u00b0, or lower, in order to make the vacuum complete. Early in 1765, the fortunate thought occurred to him of accomplishing this, by condensing the steam in a separate vessel, exhausted of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, and kept cool by injection, between which and the cylinder a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> was to be opened every time steam was to be condensed, while the cylinder itself was to be kept constantly hot. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a> sooner had this occurred to him, than the means of effecting it presented themselves in rapid succession. These have been in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> already described in the Encyclopaedia. A model was constructed, and the experiments made with it, placed the correctness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a>, and the advantages of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>, beyond the reach of doubt.\n\nIn the course of these trials, he was much struck by the great heat communicated to the injection water by a small quantity of steam, and proceeded by a very simple experiment to satisfy himself upon that subject, when he discovered that water converted into steam <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> heat about six times its own weight of water at 47\u00b0 or 48\u00b0 to 212\u00b0. He mentioned this extraordinary fact to Dr Black, who then explained to him his doctrine of latent heat, to the support of which, Mr Watt had afterwards the satisfaction of contributing his experiments. From some of these he was led to suppose the latent heat of steam to be above 100\u00b0, but he afterwards considered 960\u00b0 a more accurate determination. From others, he deduced the important conclusion, that the sum of the latent and sensible heat of steam, at different temperatures, is a constant quantity, the latent heat increasing as the sensible heat diminishes; or, in other words, that a given weight of water in the state of steam contains nearly the same quantity of heat, whatever may be the bulk or density of the steam.\n\nHe also, at this time, made experiments upon the capacities of different bodies for heat, and upon the heats at which water boils under various pressures; from which he ascertained, that where the heats proceeded in an arithmetical, the elasticities proceeded in a geometrical ratio, the curve of which he laid down. These he repeated some years after with more accuracy.\n\nWe have been thus minute in our details of the successive steps by which Mr Watt proceeded to his great improvement upon the principle of the steam-engine, in order to convey some idea of the sagacity, ingenuity, and science, with which he conducted the investigation. Our limits will oblige us to be more brief in our narrative of his subsequent improvements.\n\nFrom this period (the early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of 1765), his mind\nbecame very much engaged in contriving the machinery for executing his improvement upon a large scale; but the want of funds prevented his attempting it, until he was induced to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> himself to Dr Roebeck, who had a short time before completed his establishment of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARRON\">Carron</a> Ironworks, and who, in addition to his known qualities of ingenuity and enterprise, was considered to be possessed of ample means of introducing the invention to the public. He agreed to enter into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>, upon having the proceeds of two-thirds of the invention assigned to him; and an engine upon a large scale was then constructed by Mr Watt, at Kinnel, near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BORROWSTOUNNESS\">Borrowstounness</a>, where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">Doctor</a> then resided; the trials made with which gave satisfaction. But the introduction of the invention to the public was retarded, on the one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, by the pecuniary difficulties in which the Doctor became involved, by the failure of several of his multifarious undertakings; and on the other, by the employment, which the rising reputation of Mr Watt, for knowledge and skill in the line of a civil engineer, procured him.\n\nHe was employed, in 1767, to make a survey for a canal of junction between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> Forth and Clyde, by what was called the Lomond passage, and attended <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a> on the part of the subscribers, where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BILL\">bill</a> was lost. An offer was then made to him of undertaking the survey and estimate of an intended canal from the Monkland <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COLLIERIES\">Collieries</a> to Glasgow; and these proving satisfactory, the superintendence of the execution was confided to him. This was quickly followed by his being employed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-TRUSTEES\">Trustees</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FISHERIES\">Fisheries</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">Manufactures</a> in Scotland, to make a survey of a canal from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERTH\">Perth</a> to Forfar, through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STRATHMORE\">Strathmore</a>; and soon afterwards, by the Commissioners of the Annexed Estates, to furnish a report and estimate of the relative advantages of opening a communication between the Firth of Clyde and the Western Ocean, by means of a navigable canal across the isthmus of Crinan,* or that of Tarbert. Business of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> now crowded upon him; and surveys, plans, and estimates, were successively undertaken by him for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HARBOURS\">harbours</a> of Ayr, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PORT_GLASGOW\">Port-Glasgow</a>, and Greenock; the deepening of the river Clyde; the rendering navigable the rivers Forth and Devon, and the water of Leven; the making of a canal from Machrihanish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a> to Campbeltown, and of another between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">Grand</a> Canal and the harbour of Borrowstounness; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> of bridges at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAMILTON\">Hamilton</a> and at Rutherglen, &c. &c. In these surveys he made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of a new micrometer, and a machine for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSPECTIVE\">perspective</a>, which he had invented to facilitate his operations. Our limits do not allow us to go into the details of his Reports, which are remarkable for their perspicuity and accuracy, although the work of a self-taught engineer. The last and greatest work upon which he was employed was the survey and estimate of the line of a canal between Fort-William and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERNESS\">Inverness</a>, since executed by Mr Telford, upon a larger scale than was at that time proposed, under the name of the Caledonian Canal.\n\nWhilst engaged upon this survey, in the latter part of the year 1773, Mr Watt received the account of the death of his affectionate wife, leaving him a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> and a son. He appears soon after to have made up his mind to adopt the advice of his friend Dr Small of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BIRMINGHAM\">Birmingham</a>, and the invitation of Mr Boulton, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> in England. He had secured his title to his Improvements for saving Steam and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUEL\">Fuel</a> in Fire Engines, by patent, in the year 1769; but all hopes of carrying them into effect, by the assistance of Dr Roebeck, being at an end, he had induced that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> to agree, for certain considerations, to transfer his share of the patent to Mr Boulton of Soho, near Birmingham\u2014a gentleman equally distinguished by his knowledge of the arts, and his enterprising spirit, who had some years before established his manufactory upon a scale as unrivalled for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> and elegance, as for the variety and perfection of the processes carried on.\n\nIn conjunction with him an application was made to Parliament for an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> of the patent, and an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> prolonging it for twenty-five years was obtained in the year 1775, when the business of making steam-engines was commenced by the firm of Boulton and Watt.\n\nMr Watt now married for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> wife Miss Macgrigor, the daughter of an old friend, at Glasgow, and devoted himself to the improvement of the details of the engine with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of application and exertion not to be expected from his delicate and infirm state of health; and he found in his partner a zealous and able coadjutor.\n\nSome engines for pumping water were soon made upon a large scale, and the savings in fuel were demonstrated by repeated comparative trials to amount to three-fourths of the quantity consumed by those of the best construction before in use. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEPUTATION\">deputation</a> from the mining <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> of Cornwall was sent to ascertain the fact, and their report led to the introduction of the improved engines into that county, to which they have proved of such vast utility.\n\nThe immediate application of the powers of steam to giving a rotary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MILLS\">mills</a> had formed an early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of Mr Watt's attention, and he had deeply considered the various means of effecting this. One method of producing a continued movement in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> was by a steam wheel, described in his patent of 1769. Various others of a similar kind suggested themselves to him, of some of which drawings and models were made; but the difficulty of rendering them steam and air-tight, and the loss of power by friction, induced him to turn his thoughts to the adaptation of the reciprocating motion to the production of a continued regular rotary one. This he accomplished by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of improvements, the exclusive property of which he secured by successive patents in the years 1781, 1782, 1784, and 1785; including, among other inventions, the rotary motion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> and planet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHEELS\">wheels</a>,\u2020 the expansive principle, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> engine, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> motion, and the\n\n---\n\n* The Crinan Canal was executed several years afterwards, under the direction of his friend Mr Rennie, with some variations.\n\n\u2020 Mr Watt had originally intended to derive the rotary motion from the working beam by means of a connecting rod and crank; but the workman employed to make the model communicated it to a neighbour.\nsmokeless <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FURNACE\">furnace</a>. The application of the centrifugal regulating force of the governor gave the finishing stroke to the machine.\n\nThe invention of the separate condenser, and the contrivances necessary to give it full effect, would alone have established the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> of Mr Watt; but when to these are added the various inventions called forth to perfect his rotative engines, we are impressed by a union of philosophical research, of physical skill, and of mechanical ingenuity, which has, we believe, no parallel in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> times.\n\nThe perfection thus given to the rotative engine soon led to its general application for imparting motion to almost every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of mill-work and machinery; and gave an impulse, unexampled in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of inventions, to the extension of our manufactures, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a>, and wealth.\n\nNor were Mr Watt's inventive powers confined to the steam-engine. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of preserving accurate copies of his various drawings and of his letters, containing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> and important calculations; and the desire of avoiding that labour himself, which he did not think it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to entrust to others, led him, in the year 1780, to contrive a copying <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a>, the exclusive property in which he secured by Letters Patent, and commenced the manufactory of them in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARTNERSHIP\">partnership</a> with Mr Boulton, and his friend, Mr Keir, under the firm of James Watt and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">Company</a>\u2014a contrivance of great simplicity, and of which he reaped an ample benefit in the time, labour, and expense it saved to himself, to say nothing of its advantages to the public.\n\nIn the winter of 1784-5, he put up an apparatus for heating the room in which he drew and wrote by means of steam. The possibility of doing this we find suggested by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLONEL\">Colonel</a> Cooke in the Philosophical Transactions for 1745; but we know not whether this was known to Mr Watt when he made this first practical attempt, from which he deduced proportions of surface, &c., which afterwards served to guide his firm in the introduction of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> in larger buildings.\n\nChemical studies engaged much of his attention during his busiest time, and at the very period when he was most engaged in perfecting his rotative engines, and in managing a business become considerable, and, from its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a>, requiring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> attention, he entered deeply into the investigations then in progress relative to the constitution and properties of the different gases. Early in 1783, he was led, by the experiments of his friend and neighbour, Dr Priestley, to the important conclusion, that water is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEPHLOGISTICATED\">dephlogisticated</a> and inflammable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-AIRS\">airs</a> (as they were then called) deprived of their latent or elementary heat, and he was the first to make known this theory. This was done in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to Dr Priestley, dated the 28th April 1783, in which he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> the Doctor's experiments to have come in aid of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> notions of his own, and supports his conclusions by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> experiments. That letter Dr Priestley received in London; and, after showing it to several members of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> Society, he delivered it to Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a> Banks, with a request that it might be read at some of the public meetings of the Society; but before that could be complied with, Mr Watt, having heard of some new experiments made by Dr Priestley, begged that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> might be delayed. Those new experiments soon afterwards proved to have been delusive, and Mr Watt sent a revised edition of his letter to Mr De Luc on the 26th November of the same year, which was not read to the Society until the 29th April 1784, and appears in the Philosophical Transactions for that year, under the title of Thoughts on the Constituent Parts of Water and of Dephlogisticated Air, with an Account of some Experiments upon that Subject. In the interim, on the 15th January 1784, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> by Mr Cavendish had been read, containing his Experiments on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMBUSTION\">Combustion</a> of the Dephlogisticated and Inflammable Airs, and drawing the same inference as Mr Watt; with this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> only, that he did not admit elementary heat into his explanation. He refers in it to his knowledge of Mr Watt's paper, and states his own experiments to have been made in 1781, and mentioned to Dr Priestley; but he does not say at what period he formed his conclusions; he only mentions that a friend of his had given some account of his experiments in the summer of 1783 to Mr Lavoisier, as well as of the conclusion drawn from them. It is quite certain, that Mr Watt had never heard of them; and Dr Blagden has stated, that he mentioned at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> the opinions of both the English philosophers, which were not admitted without hesitation, nor until the French chemists had satisfied themselves by experiments of their own.*\n\nMr Watt also has the merit of being the first person to introduce into this country, and to carry into effect, on a practical scale, in any country, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLEACHING\">bleaching</a> of linens and cottons by oxymuriatic acid, the invention of his friend, Mr Berthollet. That gentleman had communicated his invention to Mr Watt at Paris in the winter of 1786-7, whither he had proceeded with Mr Boulton at the instance of the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, to suggest improvements in the mode of raising water at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARLY\">Marly</a>, and his mind was instantly alive to the extensive application of which it admitted. He advised Mr Berthollet to secure the property by an English patent; but that he declined, and left his friend to make such use of it\n\n* There is a confusion of dates in the accounts of this affair. Mr Watt's letter to Mr De Luc in the Philosophical Transactions appears dated 26th November 1784, which is evidently an error of the press. Mr Cavendish, in his letter, read 15th January 1784, speaks of Mr Watt's paper \"as lately read before the Society,\" whereas the paper itself purports to have been read on the 29th April 1784. This we cannot explain.\nas he thought proper. He, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, communicated it to his father-in-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, Mr Macgrigor, and gave directions for the construction of the proper vessels and machinery; and soon after himself superintended the first trials at his bleachfield near Glasgow, which proved eminently successful.\n\nSome years after this, Mr Watt was led, by the illness of the daughter, and some apprehensions entertained for the son, who were the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> of his second marriage, to consider the subject of the medical application of the factitious airs, and to contrive various apparatuses for that purpose, which were described by himself, in his friend Dr Beddoes's publications on Pneumatic Medicine.\n\nWe have not space to particularize other improvements introduced by Mr Watt, or at his suggestion, into various arts; for there were few arts with the details of which he was not intimately acquainted, and to the practical professors of which he was not able and willing to impart information. We shall only mention, that, before he left Glasgow to settle in England, he had assisted some of his friends in the establishment of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-POTTERY\">pottery</a> there, to the success of which his experiments and advice had greatly contributed, and in which he afterwards continued a partner. At a later period, he occupied himself much upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>, having the transparency, and nearly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a> of marble, from which he made many casts. This promoted, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> it did not create a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCULPTURE\">sculpture</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATUARY\">statuary</a>, and led to his employing himself, during the last years of his life, in the contrivance of a machine for multiplying busts and other carved work, which he left in a very forward state.\n\nMr Watt did not escape the common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOT\">lot</a> of eminent men, that of meeting with pirates of his inventions, and detractors from his merit. The latter, indeed, were but few, and their efforts transitory; but the former were numerous, and in proportion to the benefits expected to arise from an evasion of the patent dues claimed by Boulton and Watt; though these were established upon the liberal footing of receiving only one-third of the savings of fuel compared with the best steam-engines previously in use. In consequence, the attention both of Mr Watt and of Mr Boulton was greatly occupied, from the year 1792 to the year 1799, in defending their patent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> against numerous invaders, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> of whom were supported by a portion of the mining interest of Cornwall, although the respectable part of it refused to concur in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a>. The admission of their respective sons into the partnership, in 1794, infused vigour into their proceedings; and, after repeated verdicts, establishing the novelty and utility of Mr Watt's inventions, the validity of his claim was finally confirmed in the year 1799 by the unanimous decision of all the Judges of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">Court</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">King</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENCH\">Bench</a>.\n\nIn 1800, upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-EXPIRATION\">expiration</a> of the act of Parliament passed in his favour, he withdrew from business, resigning his shares to his two sons; of whom the youngest, Mr Gregory Watt, died soon after, having given splendid proofs of literary and philosophical talents, and left a durable record of the latter, in his paper On Basalt in the Philosophical Transactions. Mr Watt continued to the close of life to interest himself in the pursuits of his former associates, and to maintain an uninterrupted friendship with Mr Boulton, whom he survived several years.\n\nOn two occasions afterwards, in 1811 and 1812, he gave proofs of the undiminished powers of his mind in his former profession. In the one instance, he was induced, by his grateful recollections of his residence in Glasgow, to assist the proprietors of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER_WORKS\">water-works</a> there with a plan for supplying the town with better water, by means of a suction pipe, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEXIBLE\">flexible</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a>, laid across the bottom of the Clyde, accompanied with instructions for insuring the supply of water on the opposite side; a plan which answered completely, and for which the proprietors presented him with a handsome memorial of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a>. In the other instance, he was prevailed upon by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARNEST\">earnest</a> solicitation of the Lords Commissioners of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMIRALTY\">Admiralty</a>, to attend a deputation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">Navy</a> Board, and to give with his friend, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> Huddart, and Mr J. Jessop, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> upon the works then carrying on at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SHEERNESS\">Sheerness</a> Dockyard, and the farther ones projected by Messrs Rennie and Whidby; on which occasion, he no less gratified the gentlemen associated with him, by the clearness of his general views, than by his knowledge of the details, and received the thanks of the Admiralty.\n\nMr Watt, also, at a still later period, in 1814, yielded to the wishes of his friends in undertaking a revision of Professor Robison's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> on Steam and Steam-Engines in the Encyclopaedia Britannica; and enriched them with valuable notes, containing his own experiments upon steam, and a short history of his principal improvements upon the engine itself.\n\nHis originally infirm health had been subjected to severe trials by the great exertions of his mind, during the period of carrying into execution his improvements on the steam-engine, and had with difficulty resisted the cares and anxieties attending upon business, and those created by the subtleties of the law, during the protracted proceedings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> long years. There appears to have been an organic defect in his digestion, and its effects were intensely severe sick headaches; but, by continual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEMPERANCE\">temperance</a> and good management of his constitution, which he treated with much medical skill, it improved as he advanced in years; and with faculties little impaired he reached his 84th year, when, after a short illness, rather of debility than of pain, he expired in the bosom of his family at his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> at Heathfield, in the county of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAFFORD\">Stafford</a>, on the 25th August 1819.\n\nHis remains are deposited in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHANCEL\">chancel</a> of the adjoining parochial church of Handsworth, near those of Mr Boulton. An excellent bust had been made of him, some years before his death, by Mr Chantry, and a statue is now nearly finished by the same great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a>; intended by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FILIAL\">filial</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a> to be placed upon his tomb, and to convey to distant ages a faithful representation of those features in which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> of intense thought were blended with the mild <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a>.\n\nMr Watt was elected a member of the Royal Society of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> in 1784; of the Royal Society of London in 1785; and a corresponding member of the Batavian Society in 1787. In 1806, the hono-\nrary degree of Doctor of Laws was conferred upon him by the spontaneous and unanimous vote of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SENATE\">Senate</a> of the University of Glasgow; and in 1808, he was elected first a corresponding, and afterwards a foreign member of the Institute of France.\n\nIn this brief narrative of his long, busy, and useful life, we have endeavoured to confine ourselves to a statement of the principal facts, and shall now add the Character drawn up, soon after his death, by a distinguished writer, who knew him well, and enjoyed a large portion of his esteem.\n\n\"It is with pain that we find ourselves called upon, so soon after the loss of Mr Playfair, to record the decease of another of our illustrious countrymen, and one to whom mankind has been still more largely indebted\u2014Mr James Watt, the great improver of the steam-engine.\n\n\"This name fortunately needs no commemoration of ours; for he that bore it survived to see it crowned with undisputed and unenvied honours; and many generations will probably <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> away before it shall have 'gathered all its fame.' We have said that Mr Watt was the great improver of the steam-engine; but, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, as to all that is admirable in its structure, or vast in its utility, he should rather be described as its inventor. It was by his inventions that its action was so regulated as to make it capable of being applied to the finest and most delicate manufactures, and its power so increased as to set weight and solidity at defiance. By his admirable contrivances, it has become a thing stupendous alike for its force and its flexibility,\u2014for the prodigious power which it can exert, and the ease, and precision, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUCTILITY\">ductility</a>, with which it can be varied, distributed, and applied. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a> of an elephant that can pick up a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PIN\">pin</a> or rend an oak is as nothing to it. It can engrave a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEAL\">seal</a>, and crush masses of obdurate metal like wax before it,\u2014draw out, without breaking, a thread as fine as gossamer, and lift a ship of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> like a bauble in the air. It can embroider <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSLIN\">muslin</a> and forge anchors,\u2014cut <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a> into ribbands, and impel loaded vessels against the fury of the winds and waves.\n\n\"It would be difficult to estimate the value of the benefits which these inventions have conferred upon the country. There is no branch of industry that has not been indebted to them; and in all the most material, they have not only widened most magnificently the field of its exertions, but multiplied a thousandfold the amount of its productions. It is our improved steam-engine that has fought the battles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, and exalted and sustained, through the late tremendous contest, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> greatness of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a>. It is the same great power which now enables us to pay the interest of our debt, and to maintain the arduous struggle in which we are still engaged, with the skill and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of countries less oppressed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-TAXATION\">taxation</a>. But these are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> and narrow views of its importance. It has increased indefinitely the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> comforts and enjoyments, and rendered cheap and accessible all over the world the materials of wealth and prosperity. It has armed the feeble hand of man, in short, with a power to which no limits can be assigned, completed the dominion of mind over the most refractory qualities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, and laid a sure foundation for all those future <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MIRACLES\">miracles</a> of mechanic power which are to aid and reward the labours of after generations. It is to the genius of one man, too, that all this is mainly owing; and certainly no man ever before bestowed such a gift on his kind. The blessing is not only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a>, but unbounded; and the fabled inventors of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLOUGH\">plough</a> and the loom, who were deified by the erring gratitude of their rude contemporaries, conferred less important benefits on mankind than the inventor of our present steam-engine.\n\n\"This will be the fame of Watt with future generations; and it is sufficient for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> and his country. But to those to whom he more immediately belonged, who lived in his society, and enjoyed his conversation, it is not perhaps the character in which he will be most frequently recalled\u2014most deeply lamented\u2014or even most highly admired. Independently of his great attainments in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a>, Mr Watt was an extraordinary, and in many respects a wonderful man. Perhaps no individual in his age possessed so much and such varied and exact information,\u2014had read so much, or remembered what he had read so accurately and well. He had infinite quickness of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a>, a prodigious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>, and a certain rectifying and methodising power of understanding, which extracted something precious out of all that was presented to it. His stores of miscellaneous knowledge were immense,\u2014and yet less astonishing than the command he had at all times over them. It seemed as if every subject that was casually started in conversation with him, had been that which he had been last occupied in studying and exhausting;\u2014such was the copiousness, the precision, and the admirable clearness of the information which he poured out upon it without effort or hesitation. Nor was this promptitude and compass of knowledge confined in any degree to the studies connected with his ordinary pursuits. That he should have been minutely and extensively skilled in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">chemistry</a> and the arts, and in most of the branches of physical science, might perhaps have been conjectured; but it could not have been inferred from his usual occupations, and probably is not generally known, that he was curiously learned in many branches of antiquity, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METAPHYSICS\">metaphysics</a>, medicine, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ETYMOLOGY\">etymology</a>, and perfectly at home in all the details of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a>, music, and law. He was well acquainted, too, with most of the modern languages\u2014and familiar with their most recent literature. Nor was it at all extraordinary to hear the great mechanician and engineer detailing and expounding, for hours together, the metaphysical theories of the German logicians, or criticising the measures or the matter of the German <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a>.\n\n\"His astonishing memory was aided, no doubt, in a great measure, by a still higher and rarer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a>\u2014by his power of digesting and arranging in its proper place all the information he received, and of casting aside and rejecting, as it were instinctively, whatever was worthless or immaterial. Every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> that was suggested to his mind seemed instantly to take\nits place among its other rich furniture, and to be condensed into the smallest and most convenient form. He never appeared, therefore, to be at all encumbered or perplexed with the verbiage of the dull books he perused, or the idle talk to which he listened; but to have at once extracted, by a kind of intellectual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALCHEMY\">alchemy</a>, all that was worthy of attention, and to have reduced it for his own use, to its true value and to its simplest form. And thus it often happened that a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> more was learned from his brief and vigorous account of the theories and arguments of tedious writers, than an ordinary student could ever have derived from the most faithful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of the originals,\u2014and that errors and absurdities became manifest from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> clearness and plainness of his statement of them, which might have deluded and perplexed most of his hearers without that invaluable assistance.\n\n\"It is needless to say, that, with those vast resources, his conversation was at all times rich and instructive in no ordinary degree; but it was, if possible, still more pleasing than wise, and had all the charms of familiarity, with all the substantial treasures of knowledge. No man could be more social in his spirit, less assuming or fastidious in his manners, or more kind and indulgent towards all who approached him. He rather liked to talk,\u2014at least in his later years; but though he took a considerable share of the conversation, he rarely suggested the topics on which it was to turn, but readily and quietly took up whatever was presented by those around him, and astonished the idle and barren propounders of an ordinary theme, by the treasures which he drew from the mine they had unconsciously opened. He generally seemed, indeed, to have no choice or predilection for one subject of discourse rather than another; but allowed his mind, like a great cyclopedia, to be opened at any letter his associates might choose to turn up, and only endeavoured to select from his inexhaustible stores what might be best adapted to the taste of his present hearers. As to their capacity he gave himself no trouble; and, indeed, such was his singular talent for making all things <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, clear, and intelligible, that scarcely any one could be aware of such a deficiency in his presence. His talk, too, though overflowing with information, had no resemblance to lecturing or solemn discoursing, but, on the contrary, was full of colloquial spirit and pleasantry. He had a certain quiet and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a>, which ran through most of his conversation, and a vein of temperate jocularity, which gave infinite zest and effect to the condensed and inexhaustible information, which formed its main staple and characteristic. There was a little air of affected testiness, and a tone of pretended rebuke and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a>, with which he used to address his younger friends, that was always felt by them as an endearing mark of his kindness and familiarity,\u2014and prized accordingly, far beyond all the solemn compliments that ever proceeded from the lips of authority. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> was deep and powerful,\u2014though he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> spoke in a low and somewhat monotonous tone, which harmonised admirably with the weight and brevity of his observations, and set off to the greatest advantage the pleasant anecdotes which he delivered with the same grave brow and the same calm smile playing soberly on his lips. There was nothing of effort, indeed, or impatience, any more than of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a> or levity, in his demeanour; and there was a finer expression of reposing strength, and mild self-possession in his manner, than we ever recollect to have met with in any other person. He had in his character the utmost abhorrence for all sorts of forwardness, parade, and pretension; and, indeed, never failed to put all such impostors out of countenance, by the manly plainness and honest intrepidity of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> and deportment.\n\n\"In his temper and dispositions he was not only kind and affectionate, but generous, and considerate of the feelings of all around him, and gave the most liberal assistance and encouragement to all young persons who showed any indications of talent, or applied to him for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRONAGE\">patronage</a> or advice. His health, which was delicate from his youth upwards, seemed to become firmer as he advanced in years; and he preserved, up almost to the last moment of his existence, not only the full command of his extraordinary intellect, but all the alacrity of spirit, and the social gaiety which had illuminated his happiest days. His friends in this part of the country never <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> him more full of intellectual vigour and colloquial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANIMATION\">animation</a>,\u2014never more delightful or more instructive than in his last visit to Scotland in autumn 1817. Indeed, it was after that time that he applied himself, with all the ardour of early life, to the invention of a machine for mechanically copying all sorts of sculpture and statuary,\u2014and distributed among his friends some of its earliest performances, as the productions of a young artist <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> entering on his 83d year.\n\n\"This happy and useful life came at last to a gentle close. He had suffered some inconvenience through the summer; but was not seriously indisposed till within a few weeks from his death. He then became perfectly aware of the event which was approaching; and with his usual tranquillity and benevolence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, seemed only anxious to point out to the friends around him the many sources of consolation which were afforded by the circumstances under which it was about to take place. He expressed his sincere gratitude to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">Providence</a> for the length of days with which he had been blessed, and his exemption from most of the infirmities of age, as well as for the calm and cheerful evening of life that he had been permitted to enjoy, after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> labours of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> had been concluded. And thus, full of years and honours, in all calmness and tranquillity, he yielded up his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a>, without pang or struggle,\u2014and passed from the bosom of his family to that of his God!\n\n\"He was twice married, but has left no issue but one son, long associated with him in his business and studies, and two grandchildren by a daughter who predeceased him. He was a Fellow of the Royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">Societies</a> both of London and Edinburgh, and one of the few Englishmen who were elected members of the National Institute of France. All men of learning and science were his cordial friends; and such was the influence of his mild character and perfect fairness and liberality, even upon the pretenders to","sp":842,"ep":848},{"h":"WEIGHTS AND MEASURES","t":"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BILL\">bill</a> for ascertaining and establishing Uniformity of Weights and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">Measures</a>, which passed the Imperial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">House</a> of Commons in the Session of 1823, not having been carried through the House of Lords, the subject has less immediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> at the present moment than there has been every reason to suppose, for a few years past, that it would by this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> have acquired.

This presumption is founded on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> hasty view of the subject in question, but upon a laborious and somewhat painful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of the historical progress of the measures which have been taken respecting it, and especially of the laws of England respecting uniformity of practice in different parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>; a uniformity which, though generally esteemed by all governments a thing to be encouraged and enforced, has often proved to be no more subjected to the control of legislative enactment, than the introduction of a uniformity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> and a grammatical accuracy of speech would be found in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of an extensive empire.\n\nAugustus is said to have endeavoured in vain to force a new Latin word into the language of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Rome; the French, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, after all their labours to recommend a uniform system of measures, have ended in such a complication, that for the most simple purposes of practical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a> and civil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, it is become usual to carry in the pocket a little ruler, in the form of a triangular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRISM\">prism</a>, one of the sides containing the old established <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> and inches of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> foot, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> the millimetres, centimetres, and decimetres of the revolutionary school, and the third the new ultraroyal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of the Jacobin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, with the royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a>, the inches consisting each of the 36th part of a metre, or the four millionth of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of the meridian of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> such occurrences as these be calmly considered, they will make us more disposed to diminish than to increase the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of penal statutes intended to compel the inhabitants of the different parts of a country to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> their own convenience conjointly with that of their neighbours, and to spare themselves the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of a few arithmetical operations in the course of every market <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>; and we shall feel that it is more incumbent on a wise <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> to endeavour to facilitate both the attainment of correct and uniform standards of legal existing measures of all kinds, and the ready understanding of all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCIAL\">provincial</a> and local terms applied to measures, either regular or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a>, by the multiplication of glossaries and tables for the correct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of such terms.\n\nMeasures have apparently always been derived, in the first instance, from some part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> person; a foot, a pace, a fathom, the orgyia or stretch of the arms, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUBIT\">cubit</a>, a palm, and a finger; these have probably all been used in the earlier <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> by each individual from the magnitude of his own person; and afterwards a standard measure has been established by authority from the real or supposed magnitude of the person of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERO\">hero</a>, in order for the attainment of more perfect uniformity in practice; though it is said, that in some parts of the East the Arabs still measure the cubits of their cloth by the fore arm, with the addition of the breadth of the other hand, which serves to mark the end of the measure, as the thumb which was formerly added at the end of the yard by the English clothiers. It ought not, however, to be forgotten, that any one of these terms possesses an advantage, for popular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> and for the convenience of future ages and of remote countries, which would be lost by the introduction of any more arbitrary measurement; thus a hand's breadth, or a foot, is always sufficiently understood, without any definition, to enable us to form to ourselves a tolerable accurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> of the magnitude intended to be described; and there is scarcely an instance of the caprice of denomination having ever extended so far as to make the measure called a foot in any country so small as half a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> foot, or so great as two feet of an ordinary person, and certainly not of its amounting to three ordinary feet; while a metre, even to those who know that the word implies a measure, might as well have meant a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILE\">mile</a>, or an inch, or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUART\">quart</a>, as a length somewhat greater than a yard.\n\nThe idea of accurately verifying the standard of a country by any other means, than that of a comparison with some actually existing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a>, can scarcely have occurred, except in a very advanced <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of the progress of civilisation. It was indeed enacted, in the time of our Henry the Third, that an ounce should be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of 640 dry grains of wheat taken from the middle of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EAR\">ear</a>, that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> should be twelve ounces, a gallon of wine eight pounds, and eight gallons of wine a bushel of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>; but this seems rather a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> for making a single standard than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> intended for the continual verification of the standard in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> uncertainty. Again, in a statute of Henry the Seventh, a gallon of corn was mentioned as containing eight pounds of wheat; and this may, perhaps,\n\n---\n\n* The Editor has received this article from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> which entitles him to state, with the utmost confidence, that it contains an accurate and faithful account of Mr Watt. The brilliant eulogium with which it so properly concludes is known to have been written by Mr Jeffrey.\nWeights and serve to explain the origin of the two different gal-\nlions. But the substitution of an original standard,\nderived from an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of definite magnitude, exte-\nrior to the human person, seems to have been reserv-\ned for the days of the French Revolution, though it\nhas since been adopted, in an improved form, by the\nintroduction of a foot equal to $\\frac{3}{8}$ of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PENDULUM\">pendulum</a>\nvibrating seconds as a representative of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>-\nary foot of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DENMARK\">Denmark</a>. (Journal R. I.\n1821, Astr. Coll. N. V.)\n\nThe Royal Society, under the presidency of Mr\nFolkes, made some very accurate comparisons of the\nEnglish, and French, and old Roman standards,\nwhich are recorded in the Philosophical Transactions\nfor 1736, 1742, and 1743; and George Graham, the\nwatchmaker, determined, at the same time, the cor-\nrect length of the pendulum vibrating seconds to be\n39.130 inches, but the standard, with which he com-\npared it, requiring some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a>, it was afterwards\nascertained, that the length, as derived from these\nexperiments, ought to have been more nearly 39.14\ninches.\n\nA <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMITTEE\">Committee</a> of the House of Commons was ap-\npointed in 1758, of which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Carysfort was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a>-\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>; their Report contains some important informa-\ntion respecting the standards then in use. They\nfound that the customary ale and beer gallon of the\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXCISE\">Excise</a> was estimated at 282 cubical inches, while\nthe legal wine gallon of the Exchequer was comput-\ned at only 231, though the only existing standard of\nthe wine gallon, in 1688, which was kept at Guild-\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HALL\">hall</a>, contained no more than 224 cubical inches;\nthey suggested the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADOPTION\">adoption</a> of this smaller gallon for\nthe legal standard, perhaps as being more favourable\nto the revenue, though the gallon of 231 inches had\nbeen previously legalised by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of the fifth of\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANNE\">Anne</a>; and they employed the well known\nMr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BIRD\">Bird</a> to prepare two standards, which were to be\nexact copies of that which was made by Graham for\nthe Royal Society in 1742, from a very careful com-\nparison of the various yards and ells of Henry the\nSeventh and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a>, which were kept in the Ex-\nchequer. One of these copies was marked \"Stand-\nard Yard, 1758,\" and was presented by the Commit-\ntee to the House with the intention that it should\nbe adopted as the legal standard; the other was\nmade \"with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEEKS\">cheeks</a>,\" for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> use, and proposed\nto be kept in the Exchequer.\n\nA subsequent Report of a Committee, appointed in\n1759, consists principally of proposals for some le-\ngislative regulations, tending to facilitate the equal-\nisation of weights and measures by the establish-\nment of proper methods of checking and authorising\nthe standards to be employed. In 1765, two bills\nwere brought into the House of Commons by Lord\nCarysfort, in conformity with the reports of the Com-\nmittees; but, from some accidental circumstances,\nthey were not passed into laws.\n\nAnother Committee was appointed in 1790; but\nno minutes of their proceedings have been recorded.\nIn 1814, however, a very important Report was pre-\nsented to the House by a new Committee, who had\ncalled upon Dr W. Hyde Wollaston and Professor\nPlayfair for their opinions on the subject; and it was\nprincipally in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of these examinations\nthat the Committee stated that the length of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEN\">pen</a>-\ndulum vibrating seconds had been ascertained to be\n39.13047 inches, and that the metre of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLATINA\">platina</a> mea-\nsured, at the temperature of $55^\\circ$, 39.3828 English\ninches, representing, at $32^\\circ$, the ten millionth part of\nthe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRANT\">quadrant</a> of the meridian; they remarked, with\ngreat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, that, although in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a>, the original\nstandard of weight is best derived from the measure\nof capacity, yet, in common practice, it will gener-\nally be found more convenient to reverse this order;\nand they recommended, upon the suggestion of Dr\nWollaston, that a gallon, containing ten pounds of\npure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, should be adopted as a substitute for the\nale and corn gallons, which had become different ra-\nther from accident than from any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> legislative\nauthority, containing the one a little more than ten\npounds, the other a little less, though the standards\nof the latter were extremely discordant among them-\nselves. It seems to have been intended to abolish the\nwine gallon, which is also that of the apothecaries;\nthough it was recommended to retain the use of the\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-TROY_WEIGHT\"><a class=\"x</a>ref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TROY\">Troy</a> Weight of the goldsmiths employed also by the\napothecaries. It had before been observed, that\ntwelve wine gallons of distilled water weighed exact-\nly 100 pounds Avoirdupois; but Dr Wollaston's\nproposal, to make an ale gallon of exactly ten pounds,\nafforded a greater facility in the operation of adjust-\ning the measure, since it is not very easy to divide\n100 pounds into twelve equal parts, with the weights\nin common use.\n\nSome very important experiments on weights and\nmeasures had been made, a little before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a> of\nthis Committee, by Sir George Shuckburgh Evelyn,\nwho had published an elaborate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> on the subject\nin the Philosophical Transactions for 1798; and by\nthe ingenious Mr Whitehurst, who obtained the\nlength of the pendulum by measuring the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a>\nof two lengths affording vibrations of different fre-\nquency. There were still some minute discordan-\ncies between the various measurements which appear-\ned to be of the highest authority; and some particu-\nlars in the Report of the Committee of 1814 are ma-\nnifestly erroneous; thus the weight of a cubic foot\nof water is stated, from a mistake in computation, to\nbe 1000 ounces at $56^\\circ$ of Fahrenheit, while, in\nfact, it is less than this even at $59^\\circ$, the maximum of\ndensity; and again, the customary length of the\nEnglish foot, which has always been adjusted at the\nordinary temperature of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>, and rather\nat that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> than of the winter, as, for ex-\nample, in the great trigonometrical operations of Ge-\nneral Roy and his successors, at $62^\\circ$ of Fahrenheit,\nwas, in the experiments, copied by the Committee\nfrom Picquet, compared with the French standard,\nwhich was intended to be employed at the freezing\npoint of water, without any correction for this diver-\nsity; though Dr Young had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> before pointed\nout the omission both in the Journals of the Royal\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">Institution</a> and elsewhere, and had computed the true\nlength of the metre according to these operations of\nProfessor Picquet, confirmed by some earlier ones of\nBird, Maskelyne, and Lalande, to be 39.3710 Eng-\nlish inches, instead of 39.3828.\n\nIn order, therefore, to remove any doubt which\nmight still be reasonably entertained on the subject,\nMr Davies Gilbert moved the House of Commons,\nin the year 1816, to present an humble <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> to\nWeights and Measures.\n\nWeights and Measures.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> Kater, by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> care in combating every source of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>, has, in point of fact, apparently obviated all these difficulties, yet it cannot be expected that so rare a combination of qualifications should again be found, in case of a repetition of the experiments, and Dr Young's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> may still, at some future time, be employed with advantage, at least for a collateral check upon the results.\n\nThe obstacles which prevented the completion of the observations which were made for some time with this apparatus at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREENWICH\">Greenwich</a>, was the difficulty of obtaining a escapement so delicate as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNT\">count</a> the number of vibrations, without sensibly interfering with their frequency. A very ingenious clockmaker was employed to furnish a escapement, of which the intention was to strike the pendulum slightly and instantaneously at the lowest point of its vibration, and then to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOIL\">recoil</a> from it, so that even a considerable impulse might have little or no effect in altering the rate of the pendulum; but it was in fact observed, upon comparison with the clocks of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATORY\">observatory</a>, that the vibrations in larger arcs were more frequent than those which were performed in smaller; so that the escapement must have exerted a very considerable influence on the time of every vibration. It was therefore found necessary to abandon this method of making the experiment; but there would be no difficulty in conducting it very satisfactorily by means of a journeyman clock, with a wooden or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a> pendulum, capable of having its length altered, so as to become comparable with the vibrations of Dr Young's pendulum in its different states; and it might even be found sufficient to observe the pendulum, with the same escapement, so altered as not to give any impulse whatever, but merely to reckon the vibrations by means of the detent, during the spontaneous vibrations of the pendulum, which, on account of its great weight, would be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> for a considerable time in consequence of the first impulse, taking care that the detent should be struck exactly at the middle of the vibration, and that it should rebound in some measure from the pendulum at the moment of contact.\n\nBefore any attempt was made to introduce any legislative regulations upon the foundation of the various scientific experiments, which had been so accurately and satisfactorily conducted, it was thought advisable by his Majesty's Ministers that the subject at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> should be submitted to the deliberate consideration of some competent persons, who might discuss it more minutely than could be done with convenience before a Committee of either House of Parliament; and that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> should be appointed for this purpose by a writ of the Privy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEAL\">Seal</a>. The commissioners thus nominated in 1818 were the late Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a> Banks, Sir George Clerk, Mr Davies Gilbert, Dr W. Hyde Wollaston, Dr Thomas Young, and Captain Henry Kater. Some further operations for the comparison of the existing standards of length were undertaken by Captain Kater; Dr Wollaston examined some of the authorised measures of capacity, and Dr Young offered his services as secretary to the committee, with the assistance of a clerk who had studied the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, while Sir George Clerk and Mr Gilbert were employed in...\npreparations for carrying into effect, in their legislative capacity, such regulations as the commissioners at large might agree to propose. The first occupation of the clerk was to make copious extracts from the statutes at large, by means of which Dr Young drew up an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> of the present state of the laws relating to weights and measures, and afterwards to select from the Agricultural Reports of the different counties such materials, as afforded a glossary of all the terms employed in any part of Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> for denominating the irregular weights or measures, which have acquired a local currency in agricultural or other commercial transactions.\n\nAfter this sketch of the previous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of the subject, we may now proceed to extract from the Reports of the Commissioners, and from the bills founded on them, such statements as may either serve in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of canons for the regulation of weights and measures in general, or as documents respecting the actual value of the various standards possessing the highest degree of authenticity; and this article cannot be more properly concluded than by subjoining some further comparative tables of the standards of measures and weights adopted by different countries and at different periods.\n\nFirst Report.\u2014\"I. Upon a deliberate consideration of the whole of the system at present existing, we are impressed with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of the great difficulty of effecting any radical changes, to so considerable an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> as might in some respects be desirable; and we, therefore, wish to proceed with great caution, in the suggestions which we shall venture to propose.\n\nII. With respect to the actual magnitude of the standards of length, it does not appear to us, that there can be any sufficient reason for altering those which are at present generally employed. There is no practical advantage in having a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> commensurable to any original quantity existing, or which may be imagined to exist, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, except as affording some little encouragement to its common adoption by neighbouring nations. But it is scarcely possible that the departure from a standard, once universally established in a great country, should not produce much more labour and inconvenience in its internal relations, than it could ever be expected to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> in the operations of foreign <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> and correspondence, which always are, and always must be, conducted by persons to whom the difficulty of calculation is comparatively inconsiderable, and who are also remunerated for their trouble, either by the profits of their commercial concerns, or by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> of their scientific acquirements.\n\nIII. The subdivisions of weights and measures at present employed in this country, appear to be far more convenient for practical purposes than the decimal scale, which might perhaps be preferred by some persons for making calculations with quantities already determined. But the power of expressing a third, a fourth, and a sixth of a foot in inches, without a fraction, is a peculiar advantage in the duodecimal scale; and, for the operation of weighing and measuring capacities, the continual division by two renders it practicable to make up any given quantity, with the smallest possible number of standard weights or measures, and is far preferable in this respect to any decimal scale. We would therefore recommend, that all the multiples and subdivisions of the standard to be adopted should retain the same relative proportions to each other as are at present in general use.\n\nIV. The most authentic standards of length which are now in existence being found, upon a minute examination, to vary in a very slight degree from each other, although either of them might be preferred, without any difference that would become sensible in common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>; we beg leave to recommend, for the legal determination of the standard yard, that 'which was employed by General Roy, in the measurement of a base on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUNSLOW\">Hounslow</a> Heath, as a foundation for the trigonometrical operations that have been carried on by the Ordnance throughout the country, and a duplicate of which will probably be laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> on a standard scale, by the Committee of the Royal Society appointed for assisting the Astronomer Royal in the determination of the length of the pendulum,' the temperature being supposed to be 62 degrees of Fahrenheit, when the scale is employed.\n\nV. We propose also, upon the authority of the experiments made by the Committee of the Royal Society, that it should be declared, for the purpose of identifying or recovering the length of this standard, in case that it should ever be lost or impaired, that the length of a pendulum vibrating seconds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> solar time in London, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, and in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VACUUM\">vacuum</a>, is '39.1372' inches of this scale; and that the length of the metre employed in France, as the 10,000,000th part of the quadrantial arc of the meridian, has been found equal to '39.3694' inches.\n\nVI. The definitions of measures of capacity are obviously capable of being immediately deduced from their relations to measures of length; but since the readiest practical method of ascertaining the magnitude of any measure of capacity is to weigh the quantity of water which it is capable of containing, it would, in our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, be advisable in this instance to invert the more natural order of proceeding, and to define the measures of capacity rather from the weight of the water they are capable of containing, than from their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> content in space. It will therefore be convenient to begin with the definition of the standard of weight, by declaring that 'nineteen cubic inches of distilled water, at the temperature of 50\u00b0, must weigh exactly ten ounces Troy, or 4.800 grains; and that 7000 such grains make a pound avoirdupois; supposing, however, the cubic inches to relate to the measure of a portion of brass, adjusted by a standard scale of brass. This definition is deduced from some very accurate experiments of the late Sir George Shuckburgh on the weights and measures of Great Britain; but we propose at a future period to repeat such of them as appear to be the most important.\n\nVII. The definitions thus established are not calculated to introduce any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> from the existing standards of length and of weight, which may be considered as already sufficiently well ascertained.\nWeights and But, with respect to the measure of capacity, it appears, from the Report contained in the Appendix (A), that the legal standards of the highest authority are considerably at variance with each other; the standard gallon, quart, and pint of Queen Elizabeth, which are kept in the Exchequer, having been also apparently employed, almost indiscriminately, for adjusting the measures both of corn and of beer; between which, however, a difference has gradually, and, as it may be supposed, unintentionally crept into the practice of the Excise; the ale gallon being understood to contain about four and a half per cent more than the corn gallon, though we do not find any particular act of Parliament in which this excess is expressly recognised. We think it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to propose, that these measures should again be reduced to their original equality; and at the same time, on account of the great convenience which would be derived from the facility of determining a gallon and its parts, by the operation of weighing a certain quantity of water, amounting to an entire number of pounds and ounces without fractions, we venture strongly to recommend, that the standard ale and corn gallon should contain exactly ten pounds avoirdupois of distilled water, at 62\u00b0 of Fahrenheit, being nearly equal to 277.2 cubic inches, and agreeing with the standard pint in the Exchequer, which is found to contain exactly twenty ounces of water.\n\nVIII. We presume that very little inconvenience would be felt by the public from the introduction of this gallon, in the place of the customary ale gallon of 282 cubic inches, and of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WINCHESTER\">Winchester</a> corn gallon, directed by a statute of King William to contain 269, and by some later statutes estimated at 272 cubic inches; especially when it is considered that the standards, by which the quart and pint beer measures used in London are habitually adjusted, do not at present differ in a sensible degree from the standard proposed to be rendered general. We apprehend, also, that the slight excess of the new bushel above the common corn measure would be of the less importance, as the customary measures, employed in different parts of Great Britain are almost universally larger than the legal Winchester bushel.\n\nIX. Upon the question of the propriety of abolishing altogether the use of the wine gallon, and establishing the new gallon of ten pounds, as the only standard for all purposes, we have not yet been able to obtain sufficient grounds for coming to a conclusive determination; we can only suggest, that there would be a manifest advantage in the identification of all measures of the same name, provided that the change could be made without practical inconvenience; but how far the inconvenience might be more felt than the advantage, we must leave to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> of his Majesty's Government to decide.\"\n\nDated \"24th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 1819.\"\n\nAppendix (A).\n\nThe standards kept at the Exchequer, for the adjustment both of corn and beer measures, are a bushel, a gallon, and a quart, dated 1601, and a pint, dated 1602, all marked with an E and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CROWN\">Crown</a>. They were examined by Sir George Clerk and Dr Wollaston, and the weight of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THAMES\">Thames</a> water which they held, at the temperature of 52\u00b0, was found as in the subjoined <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>. Now, since, according to Sir George Shuckburgh's experiments, a cubic inch of distilled water, at 60\u00b0, weighs 252 grains, the specific gravity of the water being to that of distilled water as 1.00060 to 1, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> specific gravity of distilled water, in a vessel of brass at 52\u00b0, being to that of water at 62\u00b0 as 1.00046 to 1, it follows that the apparent specific gravity of the water employed was 1.00106, and that an ounce avoirdupois corresponded to 1.731 cubic inches. Hence we obtain the contents of the measures in cubic inches, which are compared, in the table, with the more direct measurement of Mr Bird and Mr Harris, reported to the House of Commons in 1758.\n\n| Oz. Avoir. | Cub. In. | Gallon. Rep. 1758 |\n|-----------|----------|------------------|\n| Pint      | 20.00    | 34.6 (\u00d78=) 276.9 34.8 |\n| Quart     | 40.35    | 69.8 (\u00d74=) 279.3 70.0 |\n| Gallon    | 156.25   | 270.4 (\u00d7 =) 270.4 271.0 |\n| Bushel    | 1229.85  | 2128.9 (\u00d7 =) 266.1 2124.0 |\n\n\"The Exchequer standard wine gallon is dated 1707, and was found to contain 133.4 ounces, answering to 230.9 cubic inches. An experiment of Dr Wollaston and Mr Carr, in 1814, gave 230.8, the mean being 230.85; while the measurement of 1758 made it 231.2. A duplicate of this measure, and of the same date, is kept at Guildhall.\n\n\"Dr Wollaston and Mr Carr examined also the three other wine gallons at Guildhall. The oldest of these seems to be the same that was measured by Halley and Flamsteed in 1688, and was said to contain 224 cubic inches; its actual capacity is 224.4. The wine gallon of 1773, which is in daily use for adjusting other measures, was probably in the first instance a correct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> of the Exchequer gallon, but has been reduced by a bruise, and by the wear of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIM\">brim</a>, to 230.0 cubic inches, having lost \u00bd of a cubic inch, or 3\u00bd of its whole capacity. The wine gallon of 1798 contains 230.8 cubic inches.\n\n\"The Excise wine gallon was found, by a similar experiment, to contain 230.1 cubic inches, having partaken of the progressive deficiency of the Guildhall gallon, from which it was derived.\"\n\nSecond Report. \"We have examined, since our last Report, the relation of the best authenticated standards of length at present in existence, to the instruments employed for measuring the base on Hounslow Heath, and in the late trigonometrical operations. But we have very unexpectedly discovered that an error has been committed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of some of those instruments: We are therefore obliged to recur to the originals which they were intended to represent, and we have found reason to prefer the Parliamentary standard executed by Bird in 1760, which we had not before received, both as being laid down in the most accurate manner, and as the best agreeing with the most extensive comparisons which have been hitherto executed by various observers, and circulated throughout <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>; and, in particular, with the scale employed by the late Sir George Shuckburgh.\n\n\"We have therefore now to propose, that this standard be considered as the foundation of all legal weights and measures, and that it be declared, that\nWeights and Measures.\n\nWeights and the length of a pendulum vibrating seconds in a vacuum, on the level of the sea, in London, is 39.13929 inches, and that of the French metre 39.37079 inches, the English standard being employed at 62\u00b0 of Fahrenheit.\"\n\nDated \"13th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> 1820.\"\n\nThird Report. \"The measurements which we have lately performed, upon the apparatus employed by the late Sir George Shuckburgh Evelyn, have enabled us to determine, with sufficient precision, the weight of a given bulk of water, with a view to the fixing the magnitude of the standard of weight; that of length being already determined by the experiments related in our former Reports: and we have found by the computations, which will be detailed in the Appendix, that the weight of a cubic inch of distilled water, at 62\u00b0 of Fahrenheit, is 252.722 grains of the Parliamentary standard pound of 1758, supposing it to be weighed in a vacuum.\"\n\nAppendix. The Commissioners having been furnished, by the kindness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONOURABLE\">Honourable</a> C. C. C. Jenkinson, with the apparatus employed by the late Sir George Shuckburgh Evelyn in the determination of the magnitude of the standard weights, and there being some doubt of the perfect accuracy of his method of measuring the capacity of the bodies employed, it was judged necessary to repeat that measurement with greater precautions; and the results of Captain Kater's experiments have afforded some slight corrections of the capacities in question.\n\n\"The sides of Sir George Shuckburgh's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUBE\">cube</a> were found by Captain Kater equal to 4.98911, 4.98934, and 4.98935 inches, the diameter of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a> 3.90713, and its length 5.99600 inches; and the diameter of the sphere 6.00759 inches. Hence the content of the cube appears to be 124.1969 inches; that of the cylinder 75.2398; and that of the sphere 113.5264 inches of Bird's Parliamentary standard of 1760, recommended in the last Report of the Commissioners, or of the standard made by Troughton for Sir George Shuckburgh.\n\n\"The difference of the weight of the cube in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> at 62\u00b0, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAROMETER\">barometer</a> at 29.0, and in water at 60.2\u00b0, was 31881.79 grains; and adding to this the weight of an equal bulk of the air at 62\u00b0, which is\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{834} \\times \\frac{29}{30} \\]\n\nof that of the water, or 36.26 grains, and subtracting from it\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{8.5} \\]\n\nof this, or 4.26 grains, the buoyancy of the brass weights, we obtain 31413.79 grains for the weight of the cube of water in a vacuum at 60.2\u00b0. Now this cube is less than the supposed measure, at the standard temperature of 62\u00b0, in the ratio of 1 to 1.0000567, on account of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a> of the brass, and the water is denser than at the standard temperature, according to Mr Gilpin's experiments, in the ratio of .99998 to .99981, or of 1.00017 to 1; the whole correction, for the difference of 1.8\u00b0, being .0001133, or 3.55 grains, making 31410.24 for the weight of the cube of water in a vacuum at 62\u00b0; which, divided by 124.1969, gives 252.907 for the weight of a cubic inch, in Sir George Shuckburgh's grains.\n\n\"In the same manner, we obtain for the cylinder, which was weighed in air under the same circumstances, and in water at 60.5\u00b0, the difference being 19006.83 grains, the correction\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{834} \\times \\frac{29}{30} \\times \\frac{7.5}{8.5} \\]\n\nfor the effect of buoyancy, amounting to 19.43 grains; and for the difference of temperature of the water and brass conjointly, the densities being .999955 and .999810, the correction .000145\u2014.000047 = .000095, or 1.80 grains, leaving +17.63 grains for the whole correction of the weight, as reduced to a vacuum at 62\u00b0, and making it 19024.46, which, divided by 75.2398, the content of the cylinder, affords us 252.851 for the cubic inch in a vacuum at 62\u00b0.\n\n\"The sphere was weighed in air at 67\u00b0, the barometer standing at 29.74; the correction for the buoyancy is here\n\n\\[ \\frac{7.5}{8.5} \\times \\frac{29.74}{30} \\times \\frac{1}{843} \\]\n\nor, for 28673.51 grains, 29.72; while the temperature of 66\u00b0 requires, for the difference between the expansion of brass and water, the addition of .00042\u2014.000126, or .000294 of the whole, that is +8.43 grains, making the whole correction 38.15, and the weight in a vacuum 28711.66; which, divided by 113.5264, gives us 252.907, for the cubic inch in a vacuum.\n\n\"The mean of these three measures is 252.888, giving for the three errors, +.019, \u2014.037, and +.019; and this mean, reduced to the Parliamentary standard, makes 252.7222 grains, for the cubic inch of distilled water at 62\u00b0, weighed in a vacuum, or 252.456 in air, under the common circumstances of the atmosphere, when weights of brass are employed. In a vacuum, at the maximum of density, that is, at 39\u00b0, the weight of a true cubic inch will be 253 grains, and of a cubic decimetre 15440.* The proposed imperial gallon, of ten pounds, or 70000 grains of water, will contain very nearly 277.3 cubic inches, under common circumstances.\n\nIn conformity with these Reports, a bill was brought into the House of Commons, in 1822, by Sir George Clerk, and again, with a few alterations, in 1823, which appears to be drawn up with great care and judgment, and which comprehends a statement of the true ground of the proposed measures, and of the determinations which are intended for their bases.\n\n\"Whereas notwithstanding it is provided by the Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARTER\">Charter</a>, that there shall be but one Measure and one Weight throughout the realm, and by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREATY\">Treaty</a> of Union between England and Scotland, that the same weights and measures should be used throughout Great Britain as were then established in England, yet different weights and measures, some larger and some less, are still in use in various places throughout the United Kingdom of Great Britain and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>, and the true measure of the present\n\n* It appears, however, from an official Report obligingly communicated to us by Dr Kelly, that the actual standard chilogramme has been found to contain only 15433 English grains.\nWeights and standards is not verily known, which is the cause of great confusion and of manifest frauds: Be it therefore enacted, That from and after the 1st <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1824, the straight line or distance between the centre of the two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> studs in the straight brass rod, now in the custody of the Clerk of the House of Commons, whereon the words and figures 'Standard Yard, 1760,' are engraved, shall be, and the same is hereby declared to be, the original and genuine standard of that measure of length or linear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> called a yard;

It extends from north to south 25 miles, and from east to west 24, and contains 592 English square miles, or 378,880 English acres. It is divided into 12 baronies and 62 parishes, the latter belonging to the Sees of Meath and Ardagh.\n\nThe surface of this district is exceedingly diversified with wood, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>, and streams, bogs, and rich grazing lands; in no part mountainous nor flat, but gently undulating or rising into hills of no great elevation, some of which are cultivated to their summits, and others covered with wood, presenting in several parts some of the finest scenery in Ireland. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> are the Shannon on the western boundary, which here expands into the noble lake called Lough Ree, full of wooded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>; the Inny, which has its source among some lakes on the north, and flowing south and south-west joins the Shannon, at Lough Ree, is a considerable stream which also spreads out into lakes in its course; and the Brosna, which rising in Lough Owell, passes into King's County. From this lake another stream also takes it rise, and flows in a direction opposite to that of the Brosna. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> lakes are Loughs Leign, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">Iron</a>, Derveragh, Hoyle or Owell, and Ennel, some of them surrounded by low wooded hills, and others by fertile and well cultivated fields. Most of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, lying upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">limestone</a>, yields very fine pastures.\n\nWestmeath contains few large estates, but it abounds with gentlemen of moderate fortunes from L. 2000 to L. 3000 a year, most of whom are resi-\ndent. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LEASES\">leases</a> are commonly for 21 years and a life, though in some instances for 31 years and three lives. A great many fine long-horned cattle and long-woolled sheep occupy the grazing grounds, which extend over much of the best part of the district. Tillage is accordingly upon a limited scale, though more corn is raised than the inhabitants consume; and besides the crops common in other places, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAX\">flax</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEMP\">hemp</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RAPE\">rape</a>, are cultivated, with clover and turnips, the two latter, however, not generally.\n\nThere are few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> here, and none of them large. The most considerable is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHLONE\">Athlone</a>, seated on both sides of the Shannon; so that part of it is in the county of Roscommon. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MULLINGAR\">Mullingar</a>, the county town, is noted for its great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-FAIRS\">fairs</a> for horses and for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a>. Moolgrenoguer, Kilbaggan and a few others, are very small places. Before the Union, the county, with the boroughs of Mullingar, Athlone, Kilbaggan, and the now miserable village of Fowre, sent ten members to Parliament; the number now is two for the county, and one for the town of Athlone. Notwithstanding its inland and central situation, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WESTMORELAND\">Westmoreland</a> enjoys the benefit of extensive water <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> by the Shannon on the west, and the Royal Canal from Dublin, which crosses it from east to west by Mullingar; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">Grand</a> Canal also passes near its northern boundary. Yet, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> manufacture is the only one which affords a surplus for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPORTATION\">exportation</a>, its trade consists chiefly in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a> of live stock and the raw produce of the land, for the commodities required for the consumption of its inhabitants. The land-owners here are almost all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROTESTANTS\">Protestants</a>, but the rest of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> is chiefly Catholic. In 1791, the number of inhabitants was computed to be 69,000; by the census of 1821, it was 128,042. The condition of the lower classes is better than in Meath, and some of the contiguous counties; they are not addicted to drinking, but industrious and provident. The women, who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> out of doors, are singularly hardy. Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WAKEFIELD\">Wakefield</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> them four days after they had lain in, carrying into the fields their husbands' dinner. The people are nevertheless very superstitious, and under great subjection to their priests, who sometimes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> them, which they submit to without grumbling. The same author was informed that indulgences were sold in 1809, at a friary at Multifarnham in this county.\n\nSee the general works quoted under the former Irish counties:","sp":848,"ep":861},{"h":"WHITAKER","t":"was born at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANCHESTER\">Manchester</a>\nabout the year 1735. Of his parentage, and of his\nfirst steps in learning, we find <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> memorials; but he\nwas sent at an early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> to the University of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a>,\nand in due <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> was elected a fellow of Corpus\nChristi <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">College</a>. He took the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of M.A. in\n1759, and that of B.D. in 1767. Here, we are in-\nformed, \"his uncommon vigour of intellect at once\ndisplayed itself among his acquaintance; but, whilst\nhis animated conversation drew many around him, a\nfew were repelled from the circle by his impatience\nof <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a> (a failing which almost ever ac-\ncompanies powers like his), and by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSCIOUSNESS\">consciousness</a>,\nit should seem, of their own inferiority.\" That his\nconversation must have displayed sufficient vivacity,\nand his temper sufficient warmth, may very easily be\nconceived; but through these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PANEGYRIC\">panegyric</a>, it\nis impossible not to discern a strong ray of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>;\nnamely, that, from the earliest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of his literary\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAREER\">career</a>, he was distinguished by a bold and dogmatical\nspirit, which could ill endure dissent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> opposition.\nThis may indeed be considered as his first and last\ncharacteristic; and although the zeal of a friend has,\nwith some degree of dexterity, endeavoured to con-\nvert it into a topic of praise, by representing it as the\nordinary mark of a superior mind, we are not very\nmuch inclined to regard it in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>. The\ndoctrine seems, indeed, to be of a somewhat danger-\nous tendency; to be calculated for misleading young\ncandidates for literary honours, who may thus be in-\nduced to supply, by arrogance and dogmatism, what\nis wanting in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> learning and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> judgment. It\nmay be asserted without much hazard of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONFUTATION\">confutation</a>,\nthat this overweening and dogmatical spirit is at\nleast as frequently the characteristic of those who\npossess but a very moderate stock of real merit;\nwho have perhaps made no uncommon progress in\nany branch of science or literature, and yet con-\nsider themselves as entitled to decide all controver-\nsies, and to adjust all claims to intellectual distinc-\ntion.\n\nWhile Mr Whitaker was still a fellow of his col-\nlege, he gave the first conspicuous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of his abili-\nties by the publication of The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> of Manchester.\nLond. 1771, 4to. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> followed in\nthe year 1775; but although four books were origi-\nnally promised, only two are thus completed; they\nembrace the Roman, British, and Saxon periods of\nthe history. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, which is perhaps the most\nremarkable of his publications, was immediately re-\ngarded as the production of no ordinary writer, but\nas more conspicuous for bold and ingenious specula-\ntion, than for cool and judicious discussion. Like\nthe other works of the same author, it is written in a\nlively and rambling manner. His impatience and\nvivacity rendered him incapable of selecting his to-\npics, and condensing his thoughts; and by adhering\nto his usual method of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> book may be\nproduced on almost any subject.\n\nBefore he had brought this work to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a>, he\npublished The Genuine History of the Britons as-\nserted. Lond. 1772, 8vo. This volume is chiefly\ndirected against the historical work of Mr Macpher-\nson, better known as the foster-father of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OSSIAN\">Ossian</a>; and\nboth publications have been considered by compe-\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TENT\">tent</a> judges as adding very little to the real stock of\ninformation.\n\nIn the course of the following year we find him re-\nsiding in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a>, and officiating as the morn-\ning preacher of Berkeley Chapel. For this appoint-\nment he was indebted to a Mr Hughes; but their\nconnection was of a very short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>, for he was\nremoved from his situation in less than two months.\nHe thought proper to communicate his grievances to\nthe public, in The State of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">Case</a> between Mr\nWhitaker and Mr Hughes, relative to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">Morning</a>\nPreachership of Berkeley Chapel. Lond. 1774, 4to.\nHis resentment was so strong, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-DISCRETION\">discretion</a> so\nweak, that he thus subjected himself to the vexation\nof a lawsuit, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">Court</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">King</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENCH\">Bench</a> held his\nprinted Case to be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIBEL\">libel</a>.\n\nAbout the year 1778 he resigned his fellowship,\non being presented by his college to the rectory of\nRuan-Lanyhorne, one of the most valuable livings in\nthe gift of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>. He now withdrew into\nCornwall, and took possession of his benefice; and\nhe afterwards married Miss Tregenna, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a> of an\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Cornish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>. For a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> time his retire-\nment was not attended with peace and studious ease.\nHis restless and domineering disposition soon involv-\ned him in a long train of contentions with his pa-\nrishioners; he proposed a tithe-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>, which\nhis friends represent as by no means unreasonable,\nbut of which his parishioners appear to have enter-\ntained a different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>; they refused to accede to\nhis proposal, and he demanded the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITHES\">tithes</a> in kind.\n\"Disputes,\" we are informed, \"arose upon disputes;\nanimosities were kindled; and litigations took <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>.\nThat Mr Whitaker was finally victorious, afforded\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> to the friends of the rector, and to the friends\nof <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> and truth; yet it was long before <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a>\nwas restored to Ruan-Lanyhorne.\" Let us here re-\nmark in passing, that this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of confounding the\ncause of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> with the cause of tithes is a pretty\nancient device. It is not certainly to be considered as\nwonderful, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a>, after all these contentions and litiga-\ntions, Mr Whitaker was subjected to the mortifica-\ntion of observing that his parishioners manifested an\naversion to his preaching, an indifference to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-AD\">ad</a>-\nmonitions, and a repugnance to his authority. This\nis indeed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> to\nwhich he resorted; they have an obvious tendency\nto excite or continue animosities, and to circumscribe\nthe utility of a clergyman, by rendering him obnoxio-\nus to almost every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> who has pro-\nperty enough to bring him within the circle of such\nlitigations. It may perhaps be regarded as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a>-\nly doubtful whether any clergyman, possessing a\nportion of the primitive spirit of Christianity, would\nbe tempted to engage, more especially with his own\nflock, in quarrels, disputes, and lawsuits, which there\nmight be any decent means of avoiding. We are informed, that after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAPSE\">lapse</a> of a few years, Mr Whitaker had the satisfaction of perceiving a visible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> in the behaviour of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> parishioners, and that a good understanding was at length established between the pastor and his flock. His manner was hearty and familiar; and notwithstanding the rabid spirit that sometimes animates his writings, he was possessed of many virtues, though meekness and humility were certainly not of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>.\n\nHis next publication was of a professional kind, namely, Sermons upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">Death</a>, Judgment, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAVEN\">Heaven</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HELL\">Hell</a>. Lond. 1783, 12mo. He afterwards engaged in the famous controversy respecting the character of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>, and produced an immense work under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of Mary Queen of Scots vindicated. Lond. 1787, 3 vols. 8vo. He published an enlarged edition in the year 1790; and he seems to have been not a little mortified that neither <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Hailes nor Dr Robertson could be induced to print a single page against him. This production, which is by no means eminent for coolness of reasoning, or sobriety of manner, has probably convinced very few competent judges of historical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a>, who have submitted to the labour of a patient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>. If Mary's innocence is so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> as some of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a> aver, is it not remarkable that so many bulky volumes should be required to display that innocence? Besides, if we suppose her to be innocent, we must at the same time suppose all the most distinguished of those who opposed her after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> of her husband, to be covered with an enormous load of infamy. And we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> only venture to add, that the uncontroverted history of her proceedings, from a short period preceding the murder, till her indecent nuptials with Bothwell, furnishes a degree of moral evidence which seems to be ineffectually opposed by all the persevering sophistry of her defenders.\n\nHaving again recurred to his theological studies, Mr Whitaker published a large volume, entitled The Origin of Arianism disclosed. Lond. 1791, 8vo. Whatever might be the opinion of others, it is clear that the author himself entertained a favourable enough opinion of this production; which he represents as \"a train of historical argumentation, at once <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVEL\">novel</a> in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>, comprehensive in its scope, and decisive in its efficacy.\" If he could not discuss a point of history without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> and violence, it is easy to conceive how he would be disposed to discuss a point of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERESY\">heresy</a>. As a proof of his zeal for orthodoxy, an anonymous friend presents us with the following anecdote: \"That the feeble Deist should have shrunk from his indignant eye, may well be conceived, when we see his Christian principle and his manly spirit uniting in the rejection of a living of considerable value, which was at this time offered him by an Unitarian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a>. He spurned at the temptation, and pitied the seducer.\" But in order to render this anecdote altogether intelligible, some further information seems to be required. Were his principles so pure and rigid that he could only accept of preferment from a patron of confirmed and approved orthodoxy? Or did this nameless patron offer him the living under the condition, expressed or implied, that he should become a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> to the Unitarian creed? With respect to the first question, it is quite evident that many pious divines have accepted of preferment from patrons who, to all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> appearance, had no religion whatsoever; and with respect to the second, it is equally evident, that no patron, if he possessed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, could expect a beneficed clergyman to make an open avowal of opinions which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> has formally condemned as heretical.\n\nMr Whitaker had contributed to the English Review a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> on Gibbon's history, which were now reprinted in a separate form, under the title of Gibbon's History of the Decline and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">Fall</a> of the Roman Empire, in Vols. IV. V. and VI. quarto, reviewed. Lond. 1791, 8vo. This work, which extends to a considerable volume, is written in his usual vein\u2014with sufficient acuteness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANIMATION\">animation</a>, but with little suavity of manner, or elegance of style. He certainly detects errors and exposes inconsistencies; but it may readily be supposed that a writer of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> of mind was not very likely to form an impartial estimate of Gibbon's real merits, which, after all the fair and necessary deductions are made, must still be allowed to be very great. Mr Whitaker is always an intrepid writer; he is never afraid to deliver a decided opinion; and whether the subject is very familiar or quite new to him, his tone of decision is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> the same. Thus, for example, in his animadversions on Gibbon's admirable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> relating to the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JURISPRUDENCE\">jurisprudence</a>, he is pleased to declare, that \"nothing can subdue the native barrenness of such a field as this.\" His censure refers to a subject of which he may be considered as in a state of almost total <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a>: he seems to have been alike unacquainted with this science, and incapable of appreciating the masterly manner in which it is here discussed. It may, indeed, be affirmed that there is no portion of Gibbon's work more remarkable than this very chapter: although his early studies had not prepared him for such a task, he has yet exhibited a rapid and powerful sketch of the Roman jurisprudence, to which it might be difficult to find a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> in the writings of the professed civilians. And it has accordingly been stamped with the approbation of some of the most distinguished civilians of the present age. It has been illustrated by Hugo and Warnkoeig, the former having published it in German, and the latter in French.\n\nAfter an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> of three years, Mr Whitaker produced a copious work on a subject which is certainly curious and interesting. This work he entitles, in his usual form, The Course of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HANNIBAL\">Hannibal</a> over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALPS\">Alps</a> ascertained. Lond. 1794, 2 vols. 8vo. Like some of his former publications, it attracted a considerable degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, and, like them, was thought to contain many hasty and erroneous opinions. On this ground he was encountered by the late Lord Woodhouselee, who published, but without his name, A Critical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">Examination</a> of Mr Whitaker's Course of Hannibal over the Alps ascertained. Lond. 1795, 8vo.\n\nIn the year 1795, he endeavoured to enlighten\nthe public by an octavo tract on *The real Origin of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">Government</a>*, which we have never had the pleasure of seeing, but which his friend, formerly quoted, describes as a very singular pamphlet. This information may, without scruple, be received as authentic; for it is not difficult to conjecture how the subject of civil government would be treated by such a writer at such a period.\n\nThe last work which Mr Whitaker lived to communicate to the public is *The Ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHEDRAL\">Cathedral</a> of Cornwall historically surveyed*. Lond. 1804, 2 vols. 4to. His vigour was still undiminished, and he had formed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of many other works, particularly a history of Oxford, and a history of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>: the former he intended to comprise in an octavo volume, the latter he contemplated as \"quite new and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a>, and fit to make a quarto.\" While he was prosecuting his ardent researches into the antiquities of the metropolis, his friends remarked the first indications of declining <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>. He had originally possessed a robust <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>, but his mind was restless, and his temper ardent; and during his last visit to London, his great exertions in procuring materials for his work, and his great efforts in supporting his usual tone of conversation in the literary circles, left him in a state of debility which was not at first considered as alarming. It was, however, followed by a stroke of palsy, from which his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a> was never so complete as to allow him to resume his occupations with his former vigour. During the last year of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, he lingered in a state of gradual decay; and he is said to have contemplated his approaching <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a> with the cheerful resignation of a Christian. On <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUNDAY\">Sunday</a> the 30th of October 1808, he sank as into a quiet slumber, without any indication of suffering, and with a smile on his countenance. He died at Ruan-Lanyhorne, at the age of about seventy-three, and left a widow and two daughters.\n\nHe had recently sent to the press an antiquarian volume, which was soon afterwards published under the title of *The Life of Saint Neot, the oldest of all the Brothers of King Alfred*. Lond. 1809, 8vo. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-PREFACE\">preface</a> is written by his publisher, Mr Stockdale. All his principal works have now been enumerated, but a few supplementary notices are still necessary. He wrote an introduction to Flindell's *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIBLE\">Bible</a>*, and a supplement to Polwhele's *Antiquities of Cornwall*, and was a contributor to *The Cornwall and Devon Poets*. His connection with the English Review has already been mentioned; but he likewise appears to have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENT\">lent</a> his aid to the British Critic and the Antijacobin Review; and his eulogist informs us, in a very solemn style, that \"the strength of his principles is no where more apparent than in those articles where he comes forward, armed with the panoply of truth, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of our civil and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> constitution. It was there he struck his adversaries with consternation, and we beheld the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOST\">host</a> of Jacobins shrinking away from before his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a>, and creeping into their caverns of darkness.\" The same tasteful and judicious writer avers, that at Whitaker's lucubrations \"a Gibbon trembled;\" but this panegyric is somewhat abated by another piece of information, namely, that Gibbon was a \"feeble Deist.\"\n\nWith what torrents of fiery indignation this worthy divine must, in his fugitive and anonymous writings, have overwhelmed Jacobins and heretics, may very easily be imagined by those who have inspected his more elaborate works, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> his name and addition, and intended for the benefit of posterity. Some persons of cooler tempers, and of more habitual candour, when they are fairly enveloped in the cover of a review, may now and then be tempted to speak in a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> and arrogant tone to men greatly elevated above their own standard, and of subjects of which they only possess a very casual and superficial knowledge.\n\nThis anonymous writer, whom we strongly suspect to be Mr Polwhele, has, in the following passage, discussed the character of Mr Whitaker with more sobriety and discrimination. \"It is true, to the same warmth of temper, together with a sense of good intentions, we must <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRRITABILITY\">irritability</a> at times destructive of social comfort, an impetuosity that brooked not opposition, and bore <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> all before it. This precipitation was in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> also to be traced to his ignorance of the world; to his simplicity in believing others like himself\u2014precisely what they seemed to be; and, on the detection of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a> at dissimulation or hypocrisy. But his general good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a>, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITALITY\">hospitality</a>, and his convivial pleasantry, were surely enough to atone for those sudden bursts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>, those flashes which betrayed his human frailty; but still argued genius. And they who knew how 'fearfully and wonderfully he was made,' could bear from a Whitaker what they could not so well have tolerated in another. In his family, Mr Whitaker was uniformly regular; nor did he suffer at any time his literary cares to trench on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> duties. The loss of such a man must be deemed, as it were, a chasm both in public and private life. But, for the latter, we may truly say, that if ever wife had cause to lament the kind and faithful husband, or children the affectionate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a>, or servants the indulgent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>, the family at Ruan-Lanyhorne must feel their loss irreparable.\" (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">Gentleman</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGAZINE\">Magazine</a>, vol. lxviii. p. 1037. See likewise Nichols's Literary Anecdotes of the Eighteenth Century, vol. iii. p. 105.)\n\n(W. W. W.)\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WICKLOW\">WICKLOW</a> is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEINSTER\">Leinster</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>, bounded by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUBLIN\">Dublin</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KILDARE\">Kildare</a> on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>; by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEXFORD\">Wexford</a> on the south; by St George's Channel on the east; and by Kildare, Dublin, and Carlow on the west. It extends about 40 English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">Extent</a> miles from north to south, and 33 from east to west, containing 781 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> miles, or nearly 500,000 English acres, and is divided into six baronies and half Divisions, baronies, and 58 parishes. Of these parishes, 49 are situated in the archbishopric of Dublin, six in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIOCESE\">diocese</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEIGHLIN\">Leighlin</a>, and three in that of Ferns.\n\nThe outline of this county is rendered very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> by a district on the south-west, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARONY\">barony</a> of Shillelagh, being almost detached from the rest of it, projecting between the counties of Carlow and Wexford. On the east, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> stretches almost in an unbroken line, except a little to the south of the town of Wicklow, where there is a promontory called Wicklow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">Head</a>. Bray Head, another point, is on the northern extremity. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">Mountains</a> and bogs oc-\nWicklow. occupy a great part of the interior, from the north along the centre of the district, to the barony of Shillelagh. Much of this tract is without inhabitants. To the north and west these mountains are bold and abrupt; but on the east they are penetrated by several beautiful glens, of which the Dargle, the glen of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWNS\">Downs</a>, the vale of Imalee, and Glendalough, are the most celebrated. Some of these are of considerable extent, finely wooded and watered, and, with the mountains which inclose them, exhibit a great variety of romantic scenery. In these glens much of the wood is oak, but not of a large size. Detached hills also abound on either side of this range, though on the east, south, and west, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> is in general low and fertile. It has been compared, not inaptly, to a frieze cloak with a laced border. In the central range, the prevailing rock is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANITE\">granite</a>, and argillaceous schist in the less elevated hills on the east and south. On the north, near the confines of Dublin county, is a remarkable chasm, called the Scalp, in a ridge of granite. Calcareous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRATA\">strata</a> occur on the west, and also on the east, from Wicklow to Bray; but no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">limestone</a> has been found in continuous rocks. In these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>, it is in the form of pebbles or gravel.\n\nWicklow is thought to be rich in metallic substances, particularly on the south, from the Croughan Mountain to the hill of Cronebane, about ten miles to the north-east. In this tract <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a> has been wrought at Cronebane and Ballymurtagh to a considerable extent. In 1809, the Cronebane <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> produced about 3000 tons of ore annually, at an expense of L. 8000; but at both places the works were soon after discontinued. Native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> has been found on the north-east side of the mountains Croughan Kinsheela, on the summit of which this county meets with that of Wexford, in a stream which falls into the Ovoca, and also on the south side of these mountains. In 1796, gold was obtained to the value of L.10,000, sometimes in pieces of considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>; one of them weighed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a>, a second eighteen, and a third eventwenty-two ounces. The search was then undertaken by Government, both in the mountains themselves and the streams which flow from them; but no veins were discovered, and the works have been long since abandoned. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">Lead</a> has been worked at Glennaher and in Glendalough, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">Seven</a> Churches. At the latter place, in 1809, there were three smelting houses, and about 180 bars, weighing one hundred weight each, were made per <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> are the Liffey, which has its rise on the north-west <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of this county, and passes into that of Dublin; the Oroca, which flows into the sea at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARKLOW\">Arklow</a>; and the Slaney, which, rising in the south-west, proceeds southward into the county of Carlow. None of these rivers are navigable in their course through this district. There are no extensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>; the most considerable are Lough Bray, Lough Tay, Lough Dan, and the loughs of the Seven Churches. Some of the streams precipitate themselves from considerable heights, forming beautiful cascades; the most remarkable one is at Powerscourt, where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> falls from a height of 360 feet.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> of this county is remarkably mild. Myrtle flourishes in such profusion as to have been sometimes used for making stable-brooms. The common laurel, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PORTUGAL\">Portugal</a> laurel, and arbutus, attain a great size, and can scarcely be recognized to be the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHRUBS\">shrubs</a>. Dublin is supplied with early potatoes and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>-lamb from the sea-coast of Wicklow, the climate of which, according to Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WAKEFIELD\">Wakefield</a>, is decidedly different from that of the rest of Ireland. This is the only part of that country where he ever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAPES\">grapes</a> growing out of doors.\n\nThere are several large estates in Wicklow. That of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARL\">Earl</a> Fitzwilliam extends to 66,000 Irish acres. The centre of the county, which consists of bogs and mountains, and is uninhabited, belongs chiefly to the see of Dublin. The district of the sea-coast, however, is much divided, and abounds with villas, the temporary residence of the wealthy citizens of Dublin. \"It appears to me,\" says Mr Wakefield, \"to contain more gentlemen's seats than the same space in the vicinity of London.\" The common period of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LEASES\">leases</a> is twenty-one years and a life. On the sea-coast, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> lets at from L.3 to L.5 per Irish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACRE\">acre</a>, or about 47s. the English acre, and on the north-east, near Dublin, it is considerably higher. Potatoes, and all the usual kinds of corn, are cultivated; but turnips, clover, and other ameliorating crops, only partially. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARL\">Marl</a> and limestone gravel are the principal manures. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IRRIGATION\">Irrigation</a> is practised according to the method common in England. A breed of fine-woolled sheep, peculiar to the mountains of this county, exhibit the only traces of a distinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of short-woolled sheep in Ireland.\n\nBesides the manufacture of coarse woollens for domestic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FLANNEL\">flannel</a> is made to a considerable amount for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a>; there is a Flannel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HALL\">Hall</a> at Rathdrum, at which, before 1808, from 5000 to 7000 pieces were sold annually. The cotton trade was, at that period, in a flourishing condition at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STRATFORD\">Stratford</a> on the western side of the county. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> manufacture, so general in other parts of Ireland, is carried on here only to a small extent. There are no good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HARBOURS\">harbours</a>, nor any canal or navigable river, in this district. Wicklow harbour has only from seven to eight feet of water on its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> at high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-TIDES\">tides</a>. Wicklow, the county town, with Baltinglass, Blessington, and Carysfort, were Parliamentary boroughs before the Union, though, excepting the first, none of them contained, at that time, 1000 inhabitants, and Wicklow itself not many more. The villages are Bray, Rathdrum, Arklow, Stratford-upon-Slaney, and a few others. Of these Arklow, the most considerable, contained about 2600 inhabitants. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> was fought there 9th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 1798, in which the rebels, computed to be about 31,000, were defeated, by General Needham, with a mixed force, said not to have exceeded 1500. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERRING\">herring</a>-fishery, in the Herringbay of Arklow, which, next to that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GALWAY\">Galway</a>, is considered the best in Ireland, employed, in 1816, from 100 to 150 boats, and has sometimes produced about L.25,000 yearly.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> of this county, in 1790, was about 58,000. According to the census taken in 1821, it was 115,162. Mr Wakefield computes the proportion of the Catholics to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROTESTANTS\">Protestants</a> to be as ten to one. In the parish of Arklow, according\nto the writer of that Article in the Parochial Survey, the proportion is only as three to one. The county sends two members to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a>, both of whom may be returned by the influence of Earl Fitzwilliam. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WAGES\">wages</a> of labour and the prices of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> being affected by the vicinity of Dublin, are higher than in most parts of Ireland, and the condition of the lower classes is said to be more comfortable.\n\nSee Frazer's General View of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">Agriculture</a>, &c. of the County of Wicklow, and the works of Beauchamp and Wakefield, as quoted under the former Irish counties.","sp":863,"ep":867},{"h":"WIGTOWNSHIRE","t":"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARITIME\">maritime</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> on the south-west extremity of Scotland, situated between 54\u00b0 35' and 55\u00b0 4' <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> latitude, and between 4\u00b0 16' and 5\u00b0 6' west <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a>. This, with the stewartry of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KIRKCUDBRIGHT\">Kirkcudbright</a>, now forms the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GALLOWAY\">Galloway</a>, which was once more extensive. It is bounded by the stewartry of Kirkcudbright on the east; by the Irish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">Sea</a> on the south and west, and by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AYRSHIRE\">Ayrshire</a> on the north, containing 485 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> miles, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> about 310,000 English acres, and is divided into seventeen parishes. About a third of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> is productive or cultivated, and the rest is in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> state, and comparatively of little value.\n\nThe district is of a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> form, the western side being almost cut off from the rest by two arms of the sea, Luce <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">Bay</a> on the south, and Lochryan on the north; while Wigtown Bay, which separates it from Kirkcudbright, penetrates it on the east. It is popularly divided into the Rhins, the Machers, and the Moors. The Rhins, which signifies <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> or promontories, consists principally of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENINSULA\">peninsula</a> lying west of Lochryan and the bay of Luce, being the nearest land in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>, and terminating on the south in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MULL\">Mull</a> of Galloway, the most southerly land in Scotland; from whence may be seen, in a fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLE\">Isle</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">Man</a> and the shores of England and Ireland. It is connected with the rest of Wigtownshire by an isthmus about six miles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, which seems to have been at one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> overflowed by the sea. The Machers is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> promontory, none of it much elevated, which runs out to the south-east between the bays of Wigtown and Luce; and the Moors are spread over the rest of the county, but chiefly on its northern side, where it is bounded by Ayrshire.\n\nThe surface of this county, except in the northern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>, where the hills rise to 1000 feet and upwards, is very little elevated above the sea; but, exclusive of a narrow tract of alluvial land near the bottom of the bay of Wigtown, there is very little that is flat or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a>. It consists, for the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a>, of a great many low hills and gently undulating grounds, often broken by detached rocks which rise a few feet above the surface, and interspersed with considerable tracts of mossy and moorish soils, even in the lower and more cultivated parts; being similar in this respect to the stewartry of Kirkcudbright, the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of Galloway. (See KIRKCUDBRIGHT in this Supplement.)\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, though moist, is mild and salubrious, especially in the low grounds, the prevailing winds being from the south-west. In the Rhins rains are more frequent than in the Machers on the south-east; but the winters on this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> are everywhere milder than on the eastern coast of Scotland; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> part of the county is more than ten or twelve miles from the sea. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, however, there is also less sunshine, and, for this reason, the crops of wheat and barley, particularly the former, are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> inferior in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> to those raised on the eastern side of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> of the arable land is, for the most part, soil of a hazel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> and shallow, but dry and not unfer tile, and well adapted to turnip husbandry. On the bay of Wigtown, there is a tract of rich alluvial land, fit for the growth of wheat and beans, similar to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARSE\">Carse</a> lands of Gowrie, and other tracts on the Forth and Tay; but this and every other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of clay land forms but a very small proportion of the whole. On the western side, between the bay of Luce and Lochryan, the soil is chiefly a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEPOSITION\">deposition</a> of sea <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>, interspersed with considerable tracts of flow moss. In this quarter, near Glenluce, there is an extensive rabbit-warren, said to yield about \u00a3400 a-year. Much of the higher grounds, or the Moors, is wet, spongy, and sterile, producing herbage very inferior to that of the hills on the south-east of Scotland, and depastured by a small kind of coarse-woollen heath-sheep, and an inferior variety of the native cattle.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> are, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CREE\">Cree</a>, the Bladenoch, and the Rivers Luce, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of smaller streams. The Cree, which rises among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARRICK\">Carrick</a> in Ayrshire, enters this county from the north, and, flowing along the boundary with Kirkcudbright, falls into the bay of Wigtown a little above the town of that name; and it is navigable upwards to the Carty a little below Newton-Stewart. The Bladenoch, after a circuitous course of about twenty-four miles, also enters the bay of Wigtown, and, by means of the tide, admits small vessels a little above its mouth. The Luce, the only other stream of any size, after a northern course, falls into Luce Bay at the town of Glenluce. These streams are frequented by salmon, of which there are one or two considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FISHERIES\">fisheries</a> on the bay of Wigtown. There are several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>, but none of them worthy of particular notice. Lochryan, though it has all the appearance of a lake, is an arm of the sea, and is of great importance as affording a safe and commodious harbour, with an inland <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a> for eight or ten miles, and occasionally a productive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERRING\">herring</a>-fishery.\n\nThe valued rent of Wigtownshire, as taken in Valuation 1642, is L. 67,641, 17s. Scots, and the real rent of the lands and houses, in 1812, was L. 131,778, 12s. 10d. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">Sterling</a>; the land rent being about 8s. an English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACRE\">acre</a>. This is divided among a few great proprietors, one of whom has a rental of upwards of L. 30,000, and several others have from L. 5000 to L. 10,000 and upwards. More than half the county is held under entail. The territory is further divided into farms of moderate size, on the arable lands seldom exceeding 200 or 300 acres, which are held on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LEASES\">leases</a> for 19 or 21 years, as in other parts of Scotland. It was formerly the practice to add the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> of the tenant; and some of these leases still subsist, but few are now granted but for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> of years certain. In no part of Scotland, perhaps, have rents risen more than in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">Agriculture</a> this quarter. \"A variety of instances,\" says the\nauthor of the Agricultural Survey, \"might be adduced where the present rents of farms are equal to the prices paid for them in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of persons still living.\" Yet an improved system of agriculture has not kept pace with this advance of rent, which has been chiefly occasioned by the increased demand of the English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARKETS\">markets</a> for their cattle, which are much esteemed in every part of the island. (See Agriculture in this Supplement.) The management of the arable land, though improved within these few years, is still very much inferior to that which prevails in the eastern and other lowland counties of Scotland. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> corn crops are oats and barley, or rather bear; the potatoe, which occupies a considerable portion of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARM\">farm</a>, is still a much greater favourite than the turnip; and where turnips are raised they are, with few exceptions, carried off the ground, instead of being consumed on it by sheep, according to the practice of the eastern counties. It is, therefore, to their cattle principally that the farmers trust for payment of their rents, and a great portion of even the best arable land is still appropriated to grazing. On the western side, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAIRY\">dairy</a> has been introduced within these few years by farmers from Ayrshire, and found to answer better, it is said, than the system <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> in other parts of the county. One of the largest dairies in Scotland is in this quarter. Almost all the land, even the higher grounds, is enclosed chiefly with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> fences, well known by the name of Galloway dykes; and of late, a considerable improvement has taken <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in the farm-houses and offices, many of which have been constructed in a substantial manner. There is very little natural wood; but considerable plantations have been formed by some of the principal proprietors. Among the trees found most able to endure the sea spray, and resist the westerly winds, are the pinaster and the Huntington willow, which thrive almost on the sea beach. On many parts of the coast large banks of shells have been formed, which are used as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANURE\">manure</a>, in place of lime, and in others sea-weeds are used for the same purpose; lime as well as coal must be imported from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUMBERLAND\">Cumberland</a> and the west of Scotland, there being none of either in the county. From the want of coal, the principal article of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a> used in the interior is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEAT\">peat</a> and turf.\n\nWigtownshire has three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> burghs; Wigtown, the county town, situated at the bottom of the bay of that name; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WHITHORN\">Whithorn</a>, near the south-eastern point of the Machers division; and Stranraer, at the bottom of Lochryan. In the elections for the Scottish burghs, these, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NEW_GALLOWAY\">New Galloway</a> in the stewartry of Kirkcudbright, send one member to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a>; the county, in which there are about sixty freeholders, being also represented by one. None of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>, however, are extensive or populous. The villages are Newton Stewart on the Cree, Garlieston, a small seaport on the bay of Wigtown, New Luce, an inland village a few miles east from Stranraer, Glenluce, at the bottom of Luce Bay, and Portpatrick, on the west side of the Rhinns division, on the great thoroughfare between Britain and Ireland; the Channel, between Portpatrick and Donaghadee on the Irish coast, being only about twenty miles broad. There are no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a> of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, and no other trade but what is carried on in small vessels with the nearest ports of England and Ireland and the west of Scotland, for the export of their raw produce, and the import of coal, lime, and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> required for consumption. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-WEIGHTS_AND_MEASURES\">weights and <a class</a>=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> used here, there is now less variety than in most other parts of Scotland, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WINCHESTER\">Winchester</a> bushel and the avoirdupois <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> being in general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>. By the former, all the corn, potatoes, &c. are measured, and the prices stated; the weight of the corn, however, being attended to, in estimating its value, as well as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>. Thus, a bushel of wheat weighing 60 lbs. is worth more than the same measure, of which the weight is only 56 lbs. It is to be wished that this practice were general in other parts of Scotland, where the great diversity of weights and measures, sometimes even in the same county, occasions so much inconvenience.\n\nWigtownshire is not rich in antiquities. The most noted ruins are those of Dunskey Castle, situated on the verge of a precipice, a little to the south of Portpatrick; Castle Kennedy, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> seat of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> of Cassillis, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> of Insch; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABBEY\">abbey</a> of Glenluce. But the most interesting remains of this kind, perhaps, are what are called the Standing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">Stones</a> of Torrhouse, in the parish of Wigtown; consisting of 19 erect pieces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANITE\">granite</a>, within a circle of 218 feet, and several large stones standing singly at a little distance to the south and east. There are also two cairns or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARROWS\">barrows</a> in the same quarter.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a>, according to the census of 1801, was 22,918; in 1811 it had increased to 26,891; and in 1821 to 33,240; of which 15,837 were males, and 17,403 were females. The families employed in agriculture were 3525; in trade and manufactures 2089, in all other occupations 1160. The increase of population from 1811 to 1821 was 6349.\n\nSee Smith's Survey of Galloway, and the general works quoted under the former Scottish counties.","sp":867,"ep":868},{"h":"WINE-MAKING","t":"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of wines is both curious and amusing; and their topography is not less so, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> we may apply this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> to the several kinds, to their enumeration, and to that of the countries where they grow, and to the variations followed in their manufacture.

The term wine is thus applied to the produce of currants, gooseberries, and many others; while that of cider is especially reserved for the liquor to be obtained from apples. That term would be a fitter one for many of the vinous liquors in question, and we shall here restrict the term wine to the produce of the vine.\n\nAll <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> consist of the following principles: <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>, a peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of sugar and extract, called the sweet principle by the French, tartartrate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POTASH\">potash</a>, malat of potash, and malic acid, superoxalate of potash, extractive matter analogous to mucilage, and vegetable gelatin, tannin, a principle of flavour, and a colouring principle. These, however, are not all found in any one fruit, and they also vary in their proportion in different ones. The essential ones to the making of wine are the tartaric acid, sugar, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> the sweet principle, extract, and water; and those which are useful, without being indispensable, are flavour, tannin, or astringency, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>. And it is by possessing these in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> proportions that the grape excels all other fruits for the purpose of making wine.\n\nTartaric acid, or its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a>, is especially indispensable; and hence it is that the grape, which contains it in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a>, produces wine; when the apple, and other fruits which contain the malic acid, produce cider. It is essential to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERMENTATION\">fermentation</a>, as well as to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of the produce; and it is decomposed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> so as to increase the quantity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALCOHOL\">alcohol</a>, which the sugar would otherwise yield. Where malic acid is also present, the quality of the wine is bad. Sugar must be considered the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> element, and as that from which the alcohol is chiefly derived. Thus the most saccharine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAPES\">grapes</a> produce the strongest wine. But it seldom exists in a pure state in the grape, or in any other vegetable. It appears to be most pure in the sugar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANE\">cane</a>; but even there it is combined with the extractive matter, and also with some acid, forming the sweet principle of the French. Pure sugar does not ferment in water, it crystallizes; and whenever fermentation occurs, some other vegetable matter is present. When sugar, again, has crystallized from a solution of the sweet principle, what remains runs still more readily into fermentation. In the produce of the cane, this is molasses. It is very important to keep this distinction in view, because the fabrication of sweet wines depends materially upon it. It explains many circumstances in the process of fermentation, and some that are often overlooked. It explains, among other things, why wine ferments in a cask when it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not ferment in bottles; because the sugar derives the necessary extractive matter from the wood. The chemical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the extractive matter is not known; but it is supposed to contain azote, as this is the produce of fermentation. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YEAST\">Yeast</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAVEN\">leaven</a>, contains the extractive principle in great abundance, and hence its power in inducing fermentation in a solution of pure sugar. All vegetables contain it; and it is most abundant in those juices which gelatinize in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a>. It is found in the grape, and it is thus the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> leaven of wine, whether existing in a separate state or united to sugar in the form of the sweet principle. Water is a much more essential ingredient than would at first be suspected. If over abundant, it is difficult to prevent the produce from running to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ACETOUS\">acetous</a> stage. Hence weak wines become sour. If deficient, it is difficult to establish the fermentation; and hence sweet wines. Thus, also, sweet wines are insured by drying the grapes, or evaporating their juice, both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> practices in the wine countries. Colour must be looked on in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> of an ornament, and is found in the husk of the grape. So is the tannin principle, which occasions astringency in Port wine. Of the principle of flavour <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">chemistry</a> knows nothing; it seems often the produce of fermentation, as in Claret and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BURGUNDY\">Burgundy</a> wines: in those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FRONTIGNAN\">Frontignan</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-MUSCAT\">Muscat</a> it is the natural flavour of the fruit.\n\nWhen the process is complete, the wine is dry, or on fermentation contains <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> sugar, so that sweet wines, which are compounds of wine and sugar, are the produce of an incomplete fermentation. When all the elements above described are in due proportion, the product is perfect, a dry wine; and the elements that require particularly to be balanced for this result are the extract, or leaven, and the sugar. If the former is in excess, the wine tends to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VINEGAR\">vinegar</a>, unless means are used to stop the fermentation by abstracting the leaven; if in defect, the process is imperfect, a sweet wine. Hence the perfection and management of the leaven are among the most important circumstances in the manufacture. It is coagulable partially by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>; and hence also it is, as well as by evaporating the water, that boiled wine produces sweet wine. It is also abstracted by precipitation, and by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of sulphurous acids; whence other processes in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> in wine-making.\n\nIn fermentation, the superfluous extract or leaven is separated in two forms, that of yeast and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LEES\">lees</a>;\nand these will excite that process in fresh solutions of sugar, or renew it, or continue it, in the mixture whence it was separated; whence racking and fining. There is, however, one important <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between the natural or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a>, and this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> or secondary leaven. The latter is soluble in hot water, and not in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>; and hence it is separated in fermentation. By restoring this separated matter to wine in the course of fabrication, the fermenting process is prolonged, or the wine rendered drier; by skimming, and fining, and racking, the process is checked; and hence the application of these practices to sweet wines. The rolling of wine, or returning on its lees to feed, is hence understood; and hence also the improvement which certain wines <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> voyages. But the same principle and process which improves <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MADEIRA\">Madeira</a> destroys Burgundy, and the reason must now be obvious. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of racking, fining, and sulphuring, is hence also <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a>; and, of the sulphurous acid, it is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> to combine with the leaven, and form an insoluble separable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a>. It is thus that it checks fermentation. Hence, also, it is that sweet wines do not turn sour: their leaven has been expended. Thus also we may see that the process of fermentation is not an unmanageable and a precarious one; but that the essential ingredients are in our power, and that we can modify them to the desired result. If it has been stopped prematurely, it may be renewed by fresh leaven; if in excess, it may be checked or suspended. And thus it is too, that dry wines, and fined wines, and wines in bottles, are durable, when they would perish in the cask.\n\nThe acid was shown to be also essential to the produce of wine. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">Mere</a> extract, or leaven, and sugar, produce beer, not wine. Tartarous acid cannot well be in excess in that compound in which it exists, viz. the supertartrate of potash; because it is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> of difficult solution, and the superfluity is precipitated; hence the tartar of wine-casks; hence, also, the crystals which are seen, in cold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, to float in Madeira wine. We noticed that it was decomposed in the fermentation, and was thought to contribute to the quantity of alcohol. The French chemists also assert that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of it is converted into the malic; hence the peculiar properties of some wines; hence also the practice of liming the vats, or of sprinkling the grapes with lime in the manufacture of Sherry wines; whence they acquire that peculiar dry and hard <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> which distinguishes them from the wines of Madeira. As the tartarous salt adds to the fermenting power of the fluid, hence we explain the facility with which the juice of green grapes runs into fermentation when compared with ripe ones; the immature fruit containing a much larger proportion of this salt than the mature. Thus also those wines continue to ferment longer, or to retain the power of fermenting; and hence the vivacity of Champagne wines, the most effervescent kinds of which are made from half ripened fruit.\n\nThe temperature of 54\u00b0 Fahrenheit is considered the most favourable to this process. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> heat it fails, as in extreme cold. Hence the difficulty of making wine in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>, and the West <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>. Hence also, in the temperate climates, we have it in our power to regulate fermentation by the use of heat or of cold. Hence, also, it is that wines which had ceased to ferment, recommence in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>; and hence, one of the processes essential to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a> of Champagne wines; namely, that of watching the spring fermentation, and bottling the wines in this stage.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">Air</a> is necessary to fermentation, rather than essential. The operation does not cease in closed vessels, but is retarded. Air is not absorbed in the vinous fermentation; although its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OXYGEN\">oxygen</a> is in the acetous. The wine is stronger in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> vessels, if the process is slower, because a portion of the alcohol escapes from the vats; and this is now understood in our malt distilleries. That alcohol is held in solution in the carbonic acid which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a>; and thus, it appears, to intoxicate more rapidly; as is well known in Champagne wines. Under pressure, this compound is united to the fluid; and, being disengaged, produces the well known effervescence. The practice of fermentation is partly regulated by this consideration. The violent stage of that process in wine-making is allowed to take <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in an open vat: the next is partially checked by an occasional bung, and, in the last of all, the vessel is completely closed. In strong still wines, the whole process may be conducted in open vessels: but, in light and brisk ones, it is absolutely necessary that the last part should take place in closed ones. Champagne wines are managed so as to ferment even in their bottles.\n\nThe volume of the fermenting fluid has a considerable effect on the process; a few days are sufficient to complete it when the quantity is large. When small, it is difficult to establish, and tedious in the progress, and the results are also different: wines of different qualities being thus produced from the very same materials. It is the same in the ultimate fermentation or ripening of wines. Champagne would be destroyed in a large cask: porter, an extreme <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, is ripened in enormous masses, as are many of the stronger wines. Bulk is peculiarly required for the strong and sweet wines; Champagne may be made in a gallon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>.\n\nThe first appearance is the production of air bubbles, terminating at length in a general ebullition. The liquor then becomes turbid, a variety of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> matters are disengaged, some falling to the bottom, and others rising to the top of the fluid. The leaven, before mentioned, is thus separated among other matters, while the bulk of the fluid is materially increased. It is in this stage that we have the power of regulating the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of the fermentation; by separating the floating leaven, or allowing it to return into the liquor. Hence, the process of fermenting in a full cask, ejecting that substance by the bung-hole.\n\nThe disengaged <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAS\">gas</a> is carbonic acid chiefly: but holding, as first remarked, some alcohol in solution. It appears, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a>, that this is the produce of part of the carbon of the sugar and of its oxygen; and this is the great change which leads to the production of the alcohol. But it also contains some obscure vegetable matter in suspension; because, if passed through water, it not only converts it into vinegar, but deposits that mucilage, which, in vinegar, is called the mother. It is possible, however, that this may itself be a new compound: and it is\none which, in certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, contains azote. That substance, which exists in yeast, has also been found in the disengaged gas, partly, it is said, in the form of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMMONIA\">ammonia</a>; and hence, possibly a nauseous ammoniacal taste, well known in bad wines, and very remarkable in those of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> of Good Hope.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a> of heat is one of the most remarkable phenomena in fermentation, and it bears a proportion to the bulk of the fluid. It is sometimes so great as to render it necessary to reduce it by art; its cause is obscure. The colour of wines is also produced during the fermentation; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> appears to be a substance analogous to resin, soluble in alcohol; and thus its production is accounted for. Hence, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> wines may be made from red grapes, by excluding the husks; hence also, red wines are often astringent; because the tannin also lies in the husk. Thus also, in Champagne wines, the red are generally inferior; because, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of fermentation required to extract the colour dissipates part of the flavour.\n\nThe formation of alcohol is the last, and the essential phenomenon; and it is now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, how this must depend on the quantity of sugar, on the goodness of the fruit, on the due apportioning of the leaven, and on the management of the process.\n\nThus, when all the necessary circumstances are present, the process goes on till the produce is pure wine, or a compound of alcohol, water, acid, colour, vegetable extract, and sugar. For although the two latter are said to be destroyed, there is almost always a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> portion of both remaining; the former rendered very sensible, in some wines, by the skinny matter which they deposit on the sides of the bottles. In a similar manner, it happens, that a portion of sugar continues attached to the wine for a long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, though it is not always sensible except to a fine taste. Thus, it is perceptible in Claret, and even in Madeira, which are among the driest of our wines. It is often very sensible in Port; and, when in excess, is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> the mark of a bad wine. In the first stages of the fermentation, the sugar is never thoroughly decomposed. If that were the case, indeed, the process would stop, or it would proceed to vinegar. Farther fermentation, that slower species which takes place in the casks, tends farther to diminish it; but, still a portion remains, even when it has been bottled.\n\nIt is the gradual conversion of this sugar, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> operation that goes on in bottled wines, which is the cause of the change which these undergo. This process often requires many years for its completion; that is the case in the Clarets of Chateau Margaux, and other Bordeaux wines; and the same process indeed takes place, to a greater or less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, in Madeira and the other strong wines. In these cases, it is a cause of improvement; the wine becoming more perfect under this last tedious fermentation; in others, however, it is mischievous; and hence the destruction of many wines. Thus, Champagne is destroyed, and often very quickly; thus, Burgundy also is easily ruined; and thus, even our Port is not a very durable wine, though the destruction is here accelerated by the intermixture of brandy used in this particular manufacture. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">Age</a>, which thus meliorates one wine, destroys another, independently of that loss of flavour which occurs in some of the more delicate; though this also is the result of the slow fermentation under review. In the sweet wines, the same process tends constantly to diminish that sweetness; and hence, the comparatively dry qualities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Malmsey and of Paxaret under the same circumstances. In this class of wines also, the flavour is injured by the same process, or by age; and hence, though age may confer merit as well as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> on Malmsey and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MALAGA\">Malaga</a>, and generally on the sweet Spanish and Greek wines which have little flavour, by diminishing their lusciousness; it destroys or injures the highly perfumed wines of Frontignan, which can scarcely be drunk too new.\n\nBy the same considerations we can account for the benefit which Madeira wines receive in a hot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, or in a hot cellar. The effect of the heat, and, in the case of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> voyage, united to the agitation, whose action was considered before, is that of accelerating the imperceptible fermentation, and thus ripening the wine sooner than would have happened in a low temperature and at rest. But it is a mistake to imagine, that this is peculiar to Madeira, or that it is the only wine which can be benefited by this treatment. It is the same for all the Spanish wines, for Sherry and for Port, and it is also true of the better and safer wines of France, of those of Hermitage and the Bordelais. Claret becomes drinkable in a much shorter time in a warm than in a cold cellar; and that is equally true of many more of these wines. But that which some will bear, others will not; and thus many of the wines of France, so far from admitting a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> temperature, can scarcely be preserved even in a low one. As to Port, it is a useful piece of knowledge to be aware, that it may speedily be rendered aged by heat. And in this case it deposits its colour, and assumes the marks of old wine to the eye as well as to the palate. One year will thus do that for Port which might have required five or six; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of its entire <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> is consequently shortened, as might be expected. The effect of heat is indeed such in this case as is suspected by few. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a> it is a well known practice to boil Madeira, or to heat it to the boiling temperature, and the effect is that of rendering it good and old wine, when previously harsh and new. The same practice is applicable to Port. If newly bottled wine be exposed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, it begins shortly to deposit, and improves in flavour; and even the rawest wine of this kind may, by heating it in hot water, be caused, in the course of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, to assume the quality which it would have had after many years of keeping. It is so far from being injurious, as might be imagined, that it is a valuable secret; and, as we believe, one that is but little known to those whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> it is to give the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a> of old wine to new, and who generally effect this purpose in a fraudulent manner, by putting it into foul and crusted bottles.\n\nIt is important, in another view, to consider the effects which follow from a portion of undecomposed sugar remaining in wine. It is supposed to be a means and a test of the security of wine; and the French chemists assert, that as long as any portion\nremains undecomposed, such wine cannot run into the acetous fermentation. This appears true only in a limited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>. In Hock, it would seem as if every atom of sugar had vanished, and yet the durability of that wine appears to be endless. If that is not absolutely the case in Claret and Madeira, still these are very durable wines; the most so, after Hock, at least of the dry class. None of these, when of a good quality, ever run into the acetous fermentation. Perhaps this may depend on some peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> of principles which chemistry has not yet found the means of discovering. For, in other cases, it is certain that the chemists in question are under an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>; and that the acetous fermentation will come on, though sugar should still be present. This happens in many of the French wines of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a> kinds. If, in the sweet wines from the grape, that effect does not take place, it is very certain that it happens in the wines made in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of them from various substances. In these cases, even sweet wines are found to be occasionally pricked, as the technical term is, or vinegar and sugar are coexistent in the fluid at the same time. Nor are even all the foreign sweet wines of the grape exempt from this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>; as must be well known to those who have an extensive knowledge of wines, or of the wine market.\n\nThere is reason to believe that the cause of this must be sought as a circumstance which these chemists seem to have overlooked. If the balance of principles in a sweet wine has been perfect, and the process of fermentation has also been complete, and if, in addition to this, these wines have been so carefully racked and fined, that no lees or leaven remains in them, they may be safe, because there is nothing left in them to re-excite a fermentation, or to bring on the acetous stage. But if that is not the case, if any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPURITY\">impurity</a>, any leaven in any form remain, the sweetness offers no security against the change into vinegar, or at least against that partial change which constitutes a pricked wine. The acetous fermentation may commence and proceed as far as the circumstances allow; and thus vinegar and sweet wine may exist together in the fluid. The nature of the acetous fermentation is indeed very ill understood; as little as that of the vinous; and we are at present incompetent to reason much about it. It is a common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> that it must be preceded by the vinous; yet this does not appear to be true. Certain mixtures of sugar, leaven, and water, will immediately tend to vinegar, without our being able to detect a previous vinous stage; and this seems always the case when the solution is very weak, or the water in large quantity, provided, of course, there be access of air. It is indeed unquestionable, that in the common process of making vinegar, the acetous fermentation is going on in a saccharine fluid; so that the mixed taste of vinegar and sugar is perceptible until that process is completed. Vinegar can also be produced by passing alcoholized carbonic acid through water, another obscure operation; and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> stomach it is produced in a very few minutes, when we can scarcely imagine that any previous vinous stage can have taken place.\n\nWhen all the favourable circumstances above stated are present, the fermentation begins and passes through its regular stages till there is produced wine, perfect and dry, if the sugar has been thoroughly and accurately proportioned to the other ingredients; sweet, if it has been in excess; and acid, as in Hock, when this substance has been in undue proportion to the other ingredients. The unfavourable circumstances must be sought in the temperature, or in the quality of the fluid. The juice of the grape rarely labours under any defect but the want of sugar, arising from a bad variety of this fruit, from a bad season, or from imperfect ripening. In the latter case, however, there may be added to defect of sugar or excess of water, an excess of acid and an excess of extractive matter.\n\nIn the wine countries the defect of sugar is remedied by different expedients. In some, sugar or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a> is added to the juice, or must; in others, a portion of the juice is evaporated and added to the rest; and, sometimes, all the juice is boiled before it is submitted to fermentation. These seem to have been the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VINA\">vina</a> cotta of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>, which, from other circumstances, we know to have been thick and sweet wines, requiring dilution. They could not have been boiled to any consistence after they had become wine, without losing all their properties; and as to wines that were to be cut by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a>, it is plain that we must have misapprehended the meaning of the term vinaux in this case, as no wine could exist under such a form. To <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> the same ends, it is a practice in many countries to dry the grapes partially, by suffering them to remain on the vine; but this is chiefly resorted to for sweet wines, as in the case of Cyprus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TOKAY\">Tokay</a>, Lipari, and others. The other expedient for increasing the properties of sugar in the juice is by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLASTER\">plaster</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, or gypsum, not an uncommon ingredient; and this effect, as well as that of absorbing and destroying superfluous acid, is also partially attained by the use of lime.\n\nThe management of the fermentation, supposing the fluid to be perfect, is regulated by the intended nature of the wine. If sweet wine is desired, not only must the proportion of the water be diminished by one or other of the means above mentioned, if necessary, but the proportion of extractive matter or leaven must be reduced, to prevent it from running to the ultimate stage, and producing a dry and strong wine. In this case, the yeast is separated as fast as it rises by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> means; as by fermenting in full casks in such a manner that it may be continuously ejected at the bung-hole as fast as it is formed. Should the reverse be desired, or a dry wine be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANUFACTURER\">manufacturer</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>, the yeast is suffered to remain on the surface in the vat, that it may be continually returned into the liquor by the internal agitation, or else it is stirred, or rolled in a cask, or in the vat, so as to protract the fermentation. Lastly, if the wine is to be brisk, to retain carbonic acid, as in the wines of Champagne, not only must the proportions of water and leaven be increased, but the fermentation must be conducted in vessels partially closed, and these also must be fully closed before the fermentation is completed. The management of the temperature is easily deduced from the principles already laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>. A deficiency of heat is\neasily remedied by artificial means, by a fire, or by exposure to the sun; and this is sometimes done by heating a portion of the fluid, and then mixing it with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>. An equal temperature in the vat is also procured by agitation, and when it is necessary carefully to maintain a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> heat, this is frequently done in the wine countries, by surrounding it with straw or other bad conductors, or by other obvious artifices.\n\nOn apparently minute attentions of this nature, far more depends than would, on a superficial view, be imagined; and the great superiority of the wines of France above those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>, depend often much more on delicacies of this nature than on any difference in the quality of the grape. In wine-making, indeed, more seems to depend on art often than on nature; and it is both to the praise and advantage of the French, that, by these minute attentions, they have contrived to excel all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> in this art. Italy, Spain, and Greece, with better climates, and every natural advantage, are thus the manufacturers of a thousand detestable wines, which, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of Frenchmen, might rival the produce of that country. The recent improvements made in the Sicilian wines in new hands, are a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> how much depends on these attentions; and those who have drank the nauseous, putrid, acid, and disgusting common wines of Italy and Spain, where nothing is wanting but management and care, will know how to appreciate the value of these.\n\nIn conducting the fermentation, some other considerations are necessary, on which some remarks are also required. The first of these is the flavour. That evanescent and delicate property, the bouquet, as it is called, depends on attentions no less minute. The flavour is very apt to be dissipated by a violent or a long fermentation, or by an open one; and hence, for the finer wines, great care is required through every stage of that process. It is the same for the brisker wines; as, if this be neglected, this volatile substance, on which their peculiar property depends, may be irrecoverably dissipated. A consideration of the general divisions of the quality of wines will render these remarks more intelligible.\n\nThey may be divided into four classes: the sweet and strong; the dry and strong; the delicate and light, which are generally weak compared to the former; and the effervescent or brisk. Malmsey, Tokay, Frontignan, are examples of the first, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> are peculiarly familiar to England. Hermitage holds an intermediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>, as does Claret, between these and the third class; of which the lighter Burgundy wines, the white wines of Greece, and those of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHINE\">Rhine</a> and the Moselle, may be considered pure examples; and, of the last, Champagne is almost the only one that deserves to be named.\n\nIf, therefore, the intention is to make either a strong sweet wine or a strong dry one, the fermentation is commenced in an open vat. But, in the former case, it is not suffered to remain there long, as it is in the latter. For the driest wines, or for those which are manufactured for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTILLATION\">distillation</a>, the fermentation is allowed to expend itself in the vat, and the wine is not tinned till it is made; the completion of the process merely, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> solar fermentation, being reserved for the cask. In the sweet wines, on the contrary, it is soon removed from the vat to the casks, that it may be more in the operator's power to suspend the process, and thus to prevent the annihilation, or total conversion, of the saccharine matter. In the third class again, in the highly flavoured wines, of which Burgundy may be selected as an example, the fluid is only suffered to remain a few hours in the vat; from six perhaps to twenty, that period varying according to the state of the temperature, the particular quality of the juice as to goodness or strength, and the other views of the manufacturer. This is done to prevent the dissipation of the flavour, which would be injured if not destroyed by an open fermentation. The same practice is followed for the wines of Champagne, though there is here little flavour to preserve; the purpose being, in this case, to secure the power of checking the fermentation by pressure, so as to retain the wine in a low stage of this process, and thus to secure a supply of mixed, or combined carbonic acid, at the period of use or drinking.\n\nThere is nothing which more strongly distinguishes the bad, or inferior wines of Spain and Italy from those of France, even from those which, from their cheapness, must be considered as belonging to the same class, than the various disgusting flavours which they commonly present. Wines may have bad qualities from other causes,\u2014from the nature of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> or the grape; but there is far less difference in this fruit in different countries than there is in the care bestowed on the manufacture. To use a short and intelligible term, it is filth which is the cause of the bad quality of these wines; filth and neglect in every stage of the process, from the gathering to the pressing, the fermentation and the tunning. In the fermentation, no precaution too great can be used to have all the vessels clean and entirely free from every odour. There is no substance more delicate than wine, nor any one which is so easily contaminated and destroyed by bad flavours, even in the minutest quantity.\n\nThe same rules apply to the casks as the vats. New casks communicate the well-known flavour of oak, often found in wines, and that, fortunately, is so agreeable a one, that it is often given designedly by means of oak shavings. But in the finer wines, where it would be injurious, it is extracted from the wood by washing, and by hot water and by salt. The more destructive evil of musty vats or casks, so often a cause of the nauseous flavour of the common wines above mentioned, is remedied by scraping, by washing with boiling water, and, most effectually, by firing or charring the insides; while staves which are injured deeply are replaced by new ones. Hot lime and water are also used for the same purposes.\n\nAnother precaution is that of removing all the insoluble matter, of whatever nature, during every stage of the process; and from this neglect it is also that the great mass of bad wines is produced in those countries where this art is neglected. Thus the seeds are always to be removed as fast as they rise to the surface, as they both render the wine harsh and communicate a bad flavour. The same is done with the husks when they have performed their duty in giving out their colour. It is most peculiarly ne-\ncessary to be watchful over these, lest they should become moulded or musty; whence often arises that taste which resembles that of what is called corked wine; a disease also arising from a bad cask, and often attributed wrongfully to careless bottling. In the finer wines, a single musty seed or husk will ruin a whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TUN\">tun</a>. In transferring the wine from the vat to the cask, or from one cask to another, whether by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> off or pumping, care must be taken not to disturb the sediment; and more especially still, to separate any of the scum which may be on the surface, as this is always in danger of becoming musty, more particularly where it is most injurious, that is in the lighter and finer wines.\n\nWhen the quantity of the fermented fluid is considerable, the remaining wine, which adheres to the solid matter, is separated by the press, and made into wine of an inferior quality, either for use or distillation. That refuse is also subjected to distillation with water, in some cases; sometimes, by means of water, it is converted into vinegar, or used for the manufacture of white-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> or of verdigris; or, lastly, formed into cakes with the other refuse of the first pressing of the grapes, and used for feeding cattle.\n\nIf, after the wine is made and tanned, it were suffered to go on fermenting, it would, in many cases, be destroyed. This, it has already been seen, does not easily happen in the sweet wines, where a large portion of the saccharine matter remains unchanged, though even these are not absolutely exempt. Nor does it very easily happen in the stronger dry wines. Yet it does happen to all, and is almost inevitable in the light still wines, and in the brisk ones, whatever the strength or sweetness of the latter may be. Champagne would quickly become vapid, Burgundy would become <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STALE\">stale</a> and sour, and Claret would become vinegar. For though the natural progress is supposed to be from the vinous to the acetous stage of fermentation, there are phenomena in practice which show us that we are yet imperfectly acquainted with the exact nature and varieties of fermentation. Champagne, for example, becomes mucilaginous and flat; while, though Burgundy becomes acid, it is scarcely possible to make it pass to the exact state of vinegar.\n\nYet the tendency to the acetous stage must be considered as general,\u2014for want of a better <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>; and, on this view, the management after the great fermentation is regulated. If it is suspected that even intended sweet wine has been over wrought, boiled must or sugar is added to it; and thus, in the tedious fermentation of the cask, it is secured or restored. But it must be remarked, that if the acetous stage should have commenced, that addition would only serve to accelerate and determine it.\n\nThe remainder of the general management consists in regulating the fermentation of the cask by the general principles before laid down; that is, if the wine is incompleted, it is not suffered to rise to the bung-hole, so that the new leaven, which is disengaged, may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> back again and protract the fermentation; while this is also aided by heat, by stirring up the lees, and by agitation. If the reverse be the case, and that it is necessary to check the secondary fermentation, then a cool temperature and rest are adopted; while, as fast as the wine wastes, it is kept close to the bung by fresh additions, that so the disengaged leaven may escape. Some of the other requisites to the completion of wine will fall better into another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> of this little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSAY\">essay</a>; but the process of sulphuring belongs to the second stage of management, as well as to the final operations of the manufacture.\n\nHowever vulgar and mechanical the process of fining, sulphuring may appear, it is a refined chemical operation, the practice of which was long known before the theory, however discovered; and the theory of which, in a scientific and rigid view, is not very well understood even now. It has been already shown, that the process of fermentation has a perpetual tendency to continue as long as all the requisites are present, and, more particularly, as long as there is present that peculiar and obscure substance, the extractive matter, or leaven, on which it mainly depends. If, also, this substance has been entirely separated in the two forms of yeast and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEE\">lee</a>, the process terminates naturally; the produce being dry or sweet, according to other circumstances now understood. But if any portion of leaven remains in the liquor, then the acetous, or some similar stage, may come on, and the wine will be destroyed.\n\nThe processes of racking and mechanical separation <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> described, are all intended to separate this matter; and whenever the wine remains turbid, it is always in danger, because the fermentation may at any time be renewed. But often these operations are insufficient to disengage all the leaven or lee; as much of it not only continues mixed, so as to produce the turbid state, but the extractive matter itself, which has not been brought to this insoluble form, remains combined with the fluid.\n\nThe merely turbid state is remedied by the process called fining, which precipitates all the insoluble or disengaged lee and leaven that will neither subside nor rise; thus removing one part of the hazard, besides <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> that brightness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> which is demanded in all wines. That brightness, therefore, is more than a beauty, since, without it, there is no security,\u2014at least in the finer and lighter wines. Various substances are used for this purpose, and the action of many of them is very obscure. They are either chemical or mechanical. The mechanical substances are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> and gypsum, both of which have the property of precipitating the insoluble matter; while the latter also absorbs water. Beechwood chips are sometimes used for the same purpose; but the mode in which these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> is not known. But the matters chiefly in use are chemical ones, gluten and albumen. Of the latter, eggs and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILK\">milk</a> are both used; but the former are preferred. Of gluten, isinglass alone is used; for, from some causes hitherto undiscovered, the gluten of terrestrial animals, or common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLUE\">glue</a>, does not produce this effect to the same extent that it is obtained by the glue of fishes. It is also usual to adopt albumen for the white wines, and gluten for the red; as the former is found to precipitate much of the colour from these last. The proportion used is very small, an ounce of isinglass being sufficient for a hundred gallons. To these chemical matters we might have added <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STARCH\">starch</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUM\">gum</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICE\">rice</a>, and blood,\nbut they are very little used. The action of the albumen appears more mechanical than chemical; becoming coagulated, and then entangling the dust, if it may so be called, which is suspended in the fluid, in the same manner as it would purify muddy water. In the case of the gluten, however, a new chemical combination is formed with the tannin of the wine; and the produce is that well known substance resembling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BIRD\">bird</a>-lime, which is the basis of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a>. Hence, also, fining diminishes the astrigency of red wines.\n\nPresuming that one of these substances has been introduced, the fluid is strongly agitated and suffered to repose till clear, when it is again racked into a fresh cask. It is found very important to select for this purpose dry cold weather, and, as is particularly remarked, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>-east winds. From some mysterious cause, in close weather, and fogs, and southerly winds, the precipitated matters rise again, and defeat the objects of the operation. The other precautions are those of using a syphon instead of a cock, as affording greater security; or, what is now used in all the best French manufactories, blowing off. This is performed by a condensing engine, as in the drawing of porter, and thus access of air is prevented. This is very important where fine flavoured wines are concerned, as it is in brisk wines; because the carbonic acid which would thus be lost, carrying away also a portion of the alcohol or strength of the wine, is thus preserved.\n\nBut the leaven held in solution cannot be separated in this manner; and for that purpose recourse is had to the process of sulphuring. The most common and the simplest practice in this case, is to fill the proposed cask into which the wine is to be racked, with sulphurous gas, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> matches in it till full. The wine, being then introduced, becomes turbid, and, after the necessary time, it is found as before. Should the fermentation still be renewed or dreaded, this operation is repeated as often as it may be necessary. If, as in the case of some of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOURDEAUX\">Bourdeaux</a> wines, the quantity of leaven in the wine is so great, that it cannot be overcome in this manner, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMBUSTION\">combustion</a> of the sulphur within the cask is repeated at intervals during the process of filling it. But it is also a practice in that country to impregnate with sulphurous acid a quantity of wine, and this substance or mixed fluid, called Muet, is reserved for adding to those which may require it; by which means the efficacy of the operation is better ensured.\n\nThe theory of this practice seems, to a certain extent, simple. The sulphurous acid, or possibly its oxygen, unites to the extractive matter, or the soluble leaven, and renders it insoluble, as happens in the act of fermentation itself; and thus it becomes capable of being separated by the mechanical processes of racking and fining. It is for this reason also, that sulphuring is largely used for the sweet wines, to ensure their preservation in that state. It has been said that manganese, and other substances, containing much oxygen, will produce the same effect; but the cheapness and simplicity of the common process renders other expedients unnecessary.\n\nSupposing wines of any class to have thus been obtained, there is yet much more to be done before they become the wines which we know in our market. The processes in use for this end, to make marketable wines, are badly distinguished by the term medication, as they are of various natures. There is a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of wine, indeed, which can scarcely be considered as strictly natural; though it is a common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> that all wines are so, except when fraudulently mended, or altered, or mixed. It is difficult, indeed, to draw the line between what may be considered fraud and what is legitimate; and certainly by those who expect that all wine is to be what it is commonly thought, the mere produce of the grape, and of one process on one grape, every subsequent process may be esteemed a fraud. We must here limit ourselves to some of the most important and remarkable operations, as the whole would run into a very long detail.\n\nThe simplest process is that of mixing different wines together, whether of the same quality or country, or of different ones. In either case, this practice may sometimes be considered fraudulent, and, in the latter, especially so. But, in a degree, it is inseparable from the nature of the manufacture, and the mode in which it is conducted. The larger makers, or the capitalist on the spot, buying in small lots from the petty manufacturers, is obliged to adopt this practice, partly to ensure a certain quality, and partly for the purpose of remedying those that are defective, by the addition of better ones. He must often also have recourse to the same expedient, and for the same reasons, when he is himself the manufacturer.\n\nThe mode of performing this operation, which requires great experience and judgment, is to select, first, that period of the year in which the wines show a disposition to renew their fermentation, which is in the spring. They are then said, in English, to bear the fret; and hence the operation is called fretting-in. It is only thus that a new and fine wine can be produced. The operation of mixing different wines, in all cases, disturbs both, so that they become foul. They also tend to ferment again, till a new balance of all their principles is produced; and thus it is expedient to accelerate and determine this fermentation, so as to form a proper compound, without which the new wine would be perishable. After this, also, it becomes necessary once more to have recourse to sulphuring, fining, and racking; and not till all this has been gone through is the wine completed. In the Bourdeaux practice of mixing Clarets, the Muet or sulphured wine is sometimes added at the same time, where the wines, being of very discordant qualities, a dangerous fermentation might be excited.\n\nIn the wine countries, it is usual to cultivate particular grapes or wines, rough, or coloured, or astrigent, or high flavoured, for the mere purpose of mixing with others; so far is this art from being so simple as is commonly imagined. In many also it is a practice to import the wines of one country to mix with those of another, and thus to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> the taste of purchasers, or obtain other ends. This practice is\npursued even by the importers into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>; and, as we need not say, opens a door to endless frauds, while it may also be innocent. Thus, in this country, as well as in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PORTUGAL\">Portugal</a>, the wines of Spain, Alicante, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARCELONA\">Barcelona</a>, and so forth, are mixed with Port wines; as are the cheaper Clarets of the south of France, and some other of the strong flavoured wines of that country. In a similar manner, the wines of Fayal and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CANARIES\">Canaries</a> are manufactured into Madeira, as are those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SICILY\">Sicily</a>; and thus, too, Sherry is largely compounded out of many of the wines of Spain and Portugal, and of the islands of the African <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a>.\n\nBut the most extensive operations of this nature are carried on at Bordeaux with the wines which we call Claret; not one-thousandth part of which are of a good quality, or unmixed in some way, and the one-half of some of which, perhaps, are not French but Spanish wine. The following statement, while it is curious in itself, will illustrate this. In the year 1814, the total quantity of the Clarets, or Bourdeaux of the first class, was as follows:\n\n| Wine                  | Tons |\n|-----------------------|------|\n| Chateau Margaux       | 80   |\n| Latour                | 70   |\n| Chateau Lafite        | 80   |\n\nIn the second class it was thus:\n\n| Wine                  | Tons |\n|-----------------------|------|\n| Margaux de Madame Derauzan | 60   |\n| M. Chevalier          | 25   |\n| M. Monterison         | 25   |\n| M. Montalambert      | 25   |\n| St Julian             | 80   |\n| Leoville              | 70   |\n| Pauillac              | 60   |\n| M. Depichon           | 80   |\n| Brame Mouton          | 80   |\n\nWe cannot afford room for the remainder of this statement, comprising the produce of the fourth and the fifth qualities; but it is plain, that very few of those persons who imagine that they are drinking the first growth of Bourdeaux wines, can even be drinking the second.\n\nThe first growth of Claret, it is thus seen, amounts only to 230 tons for an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a>; and that, even of the second, is only 425: a fraction, indeed, in the consumption of Europe. But, in the third class, of which we cannot afford to give the details, there are 1061 tons, and in the fourth, 825, making a general total of 2541 tons. Besides this, there are other inferior wines which do not enter into the enumeration; and it is by mixing the greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of these in various proportions that the market is supplied; it being necessary to reserve many of the better wines to render the others saleable.\n\nWe must however remark, that, among the districts which produce the inferior wines, such as those of the Bas and the Petit Medoc, a few farms produce small quantities, of a quality equal nearly to the good St Julian or Lafite wines; and these add to the bulk of the better kinds, being generally reserved, and sold at high prices. In the district Medoc, the seat of the better wines already mentioned, there are besides the third and fourth classes, six or eight kinds of wine known by the names of Gros Bourgeois, Petit Bourgeois, Artisan, and Payan; and these are manufactured, with others, for the English and Irish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARKETS\">markets</a> chiefly, by means of Spanish wines,\u2014by mixing with the strong wines of Benecasto and Alicante. The same is true of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAVE\">Grave</a> wines.\n\nThis is the great mixture, in fact, by which the market is filled to almost any extent with Claret wines, so called; and these mixed wines are almost the only ones we drink in this country. If that be a fraud, it must be remembered also that such is British taste in wine; and that Claret is in general esteemed here only in proportion to its strength. Of the stronger and finer wines there is not enough for even our consumption; and, as we must have them strong, they are thus made such by this process. That effect is also obtained, however, by some of the south of France wines also; by those of C\u00f4te, which are used for mixing with the weak Medoc and Grave wines, for the British market. This is the case with those of Queyras, such as Monserrant and Bassens; and those of Palu, such as Macaw, St Romain, Cordillac, St Andr\u00e9, Lugon, and many more.\n\nThe French wines of which we have been speaking, will not endure to be rendered stronger by means of brandy. The property of this substance, thus mixed, is to decompose the wine in process of time; causing the extractive matter or mucilage to be deposited, as well as the colour, as is daily seen in Port wines, and thus diminishing their powers of duration. At the same time, it destroys their lightness and flavour; that peculiar indescribable delicacy well known to drinkers of good wine, but quite imperceptible to British drinkers of Port. In a certain sense, we may consider that it is only the bad wines which will bear this medicine; those which have no flavour of their own, and whose whole merit already is their strength. What sort of a compound is made of a weak wine with brandy ought to be known to those who drink what is called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LISBON\">Lisbon</a> wine. But a depraved taste has rendered it necessary to our nation; and thus it is largely used, even in those wines of Portugal and Spain, of which the chief fault is that of being too strong already. We may thank the Methuen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREATY\">Treaty</a> for being condemned to drink what Mr Pinkerton calls wine fit for hogs only. This mixture is performed in the same manner, at the period of fretting; and the proportion is regulated, partly by the taste of the consumers, and partly by the badness of the wine. As it must have a certain strength, the worst wines require most; and hence, whenever we taste the brandy in wine, we may be sure it is bad. It is a taste sufficiently perceptible to those who know what real wine is.\n\nMany wines have so little flavour naturally, that Flavouring they can scarcely be considered to possess any. There are few, indeed, that possess this quality in any great degree; and, of these flavours, a large proportion is bad. Wines so highly perfumed by nature as Hermitage and Burgundy, are rare; indeed, these are almost the only examples; and, after them, we may consider the finest Clarets, and then the finest of the Rhine wines. The sweet wines which possess it are well known; and these also are but a small part of\nthe total number in this class; being almost limited to Paxaret and the Muscat wines, among which Rivesaltes stands first. Constantia has rather a taste than a flavour; and what the ordinary sweet Spanish wines possess is rather bad than good; though, like the taste of Sherry, and Porter, and Olives, they may become agreeable by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a>.\n\nExcepting these cases, and a few among the Italian wines, which we cannot afford room to detail, many of the flavours found in wines are communicated by art; and this forms part of the business of the manufacturer and merchant. Much of this is a secret, but some of the substances used for this purpose are known. The taste of Greece is now, as it was in ancient times, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERFUME\">perfume</a> its wines with turpentine\u2014the vina picala of the ancients; and this is effected by putting turpentine or rosin into the casks. In Britain, our Chivalrous and Baronial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a> perfumed their wines with every strange ingredient that can be imagined; but that was the age of spicery and perfumes; and he who eat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CINNAMON\">cinnamon</a> with his pork, might drink ambergrise in his wine.\n\nThe flavour of Madeira is nothing; but that which we know is given by means of bitter almonds, and, we believe, of sweet almonds also; and the same practice is followed for the wines of Saint Lucar. That which is called the borrachio taste in wine is for the most part that of the tar with which the seams are secured. In Sherry, the flavour seems produced by the destruction of the acid, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the lime used, and possibly by some other action of that substance on the fruit. One of the most common ingredients used for flavouring wines is oak chips; and from this the wretched Lisbon wines acquire the little taste they have. Orris root is also a common ingredient: and the high flavoured wine of Johannesburg is imitated by a proportion of rose water. The orris root gives a very agreeable flavour, and is used in France; and there, also, it is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> to use raspberries and other highly perfumed fruits. A very agreeable flavour is also said to be produced by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WORMWOOD\">wormwood</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a> of the vine itself are also used for the same purpose, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a> much resembling that of our mignonette. This last is an ancient practice in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>.\n\nThe method of gaining this end requires some delicacy and attention. In particular, care is taken that it be not overdone. As the full fermentation would destroy the more volatile flavours, these substances are only introduced towards its decline. In Madeira the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NUT\">nut</a> cake is put into the cask. Flowers are suspended in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">net</a> or cloth, either in the fluid or the vacant part of the cask, and thus a small quantity of raspberries communicate a very considerable flavour.\n\nThe colouring of wine is also part of the business of the maker; because colour is, in a good measure, a matter of fashion and fancy. Some grapes contain naturally very little colour, while that of the Claret vine, and many of the grapes of Spain, are highly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> with the colouring principle. We already explained that the colour was contained exclusively in the husk. These latter wines are often, therefore, selected and reserved for this particular purpose; and it is also a practice to use the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DYEING\">dyeing</a> woods, logwood and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRAZIL\">Brazil</a> wood, for obtaining the same end. The elder berry, which is full of colour, is also resorted to; and in Portugal it used to be extensively cultivated for the purpose of dyeing Port wines. When white wines are thought too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> for the market, they are coloured browner by means of the well-known ingredient burnt sugar; and the chips of oak also produce the same effect. By some means also <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> finds its way into some of the French wines, and thus, on exposure to air, they become <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>. This unpleasant effect is not unusual in the sweet wines from the south of France.\n\nThis property relates almost exclusively to the briskness of wines of Champagne, and it is one that may err in wines excess or defect. It is already apparent, that it is the produce of an unfinished fermentation, and, therefore, a due degree of it must depend mainly on the proper management of this process. It is secured by bottling at the proper season, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a>, and before the fermentation is exhausted; and, if in danger of excess, it is restrained or diminished by racking, or decanting, and sulphuring. But it happens not unfrequently that it fails altogether; either from accident in the management, or a bad season; from faults in the fruit, or fermentation carried too far, or a weak wine exhausting itself unexpectedly. In this case the remedy is to introduce sugar, not only into the casks but into the bottles. In the first case, the fermentation is renewed, and the wine may thus become legitimate and good. In the other, the effect is far different, and not good; and hence it is that all the very sweet Champagne wines are bad or indifferent. These are, in fact, a mixture of wine and sugar, rather than proper wine. And, in this case, the effect of the sugar is, not to produce a new fermentation, but to disengage the carbonic acid of the wine; as a salt or any other soluble substance would do, by a superior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a>. To gain this end, the solid sugar is corked up in the bottle; so that the disengaged gas is retained under the pressure of the cork, ready to fly out whenever that is removed. Thus Champagne, which has been destroyed by age, is rendered, at once, both sweet and effervescent; and this, however convenient a secret it may be to the possessor, is but a fraud, and a very common one too.\n\nThe acidity, or the pricked taste of wines, is a fault which, perhaps, ought never to be corrected, as, in this case, the wine is generally spoiled. This nevertheless is done, and sometimes to a considerable extent. Acidity arising from tartarous acid, or even from malic acid, if that really be the acid in wines which is not tartarous, may be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> and a quality; as it is very remarkably in Hock. But it is often thought otherwise, even when it is the natural property of the wine, arising from its own native acid, and after a correct fermentation. In this case, means are applied to remedy it, as a disease in the wine. In the manufacture of Sherry, it was already remarked, that lime was used to prevent it, and this is also applied in other cases, where tartar is in excess, as the tartrate of lime is insoluble, and can be fined down and separated by racking. It has been the fashion to use lead, metallic lead, for this pur-\npose; and, in France, it was formerly used largely in the wines consumed in Paris. It was then discovered, and the act made penal; and, if not abandoned entirely, it is less used at present everywhere. That this is a poisonous substance is too well known. But that has been overrated in this particular case. The tartrite of lead, like that of lime, is insoluble; so that, after the lead had done its duty, it was discharged by racking and fining. Had this not been the case, all Paris, at the time we speak of, must have been poisoned. Yet it is a substance that ought not to be used; because, in an acid wine, ascendant from fermentation, it might produce either white lead, or subcarbonate of lead, or else sugar of lead, acetite; both of them poisons, if in different degrees.\n\nFor the acidity of wine from the commencement of the acetic fermentation, there is no proper remedy. It may be checked, if taken in time, as it would be prevented, by careful sulphuring. Here lead is highly pernicious; and it need scarcely be said, that to add sugar of lead, as has been done from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> and fraud united, is to add a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POISON\">poison</a> without even obtaining a remedy. Chalk and lime may be used with impunity. Yet neither can these, and far less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALKALIES\">alkalies</a>, be used to such an extent as to cure the disease; as they unite to the other acids, and also decompose and destroy the wine. To prevent it as far as possible, when commenced, a low temperature, and careful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCLUSION\">exclusion</a> from the air, are necessary. But it must be remembered that air will find access, not merely through cork, but through sealing-wax, and, indeed, through all rosins also; and thus there can be no complete security; the best being that of placing the bottles on their sides, so that the fluid itself becomes its own cork. The Italian practice of using <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> is thus far safer; but it is balanced by its various inconveniences.\n\nRopiness of Wines.\n\nRopiness is a disease almost peculiar to the wines of Champagne, and its chemistry is very obscure. It is not a destruction of the wine, although it materially injures its flavour and other qualities. It occurs in this wine, from the quantity of extractive matter which it still contains, and which is that by which the fermentation is maintained. It is conceived to arise from the action of oxygen on this substance, converting it into a matter analogous to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIBRE\">fibre</a>, instead of changing the whole into vinegar. Thus it resembles the mucilaginous deposit of vinegar called the mother. In the bottles, it may be often cured merely by heat; by exposure to the sun, or by immersion in hot water. When obstinate, it is remedied by uncasking, and by agitation; by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> the fluid to the air. It is said also to be removed by a small quantity of any vegetable acid, as it also is by sugar; but when on a large scale, it requires the process of fining.\n\nIt is held essential by the French, who are our chief teachers in every thing that relates to wine, that a wine cellar should not only be dry, but preserved in a very uniform state of temperature, as near to the mean annual heat of the country as possible. We have already shown, however, when this rule may be usefully departed from, for the purpose of accelerating the ripening of wines. In the delicate wines of that country, however, the rule still holds good; and very conspicuously too with regard to the wines of Burgundy and Champagne. It is equally true of the finer and lighter Italian wines. The wines of Spain and Portugal seem to defy every thing. It is also held by the French most essential, that a cellar should not be subject to the agitation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARRIAGES\">carriages</a>; the reason of which is plain enough; and that it should be free of bad smells. As to moisture, however, we must remark, that, like heat, it seems to accelerate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEPOSITION\">deposition</a> and consequent ripening of Port wines. On bottling, we need say nothing; only let it be remembered that corks cannot be too good, but that no precaution will absolutely prevent all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> through a cork, however secured and sealed.\n\nThe rules which we have thus given are all of a general nature; and though some of the particular distinctions in the modes of making the several classes of wine might be understood from them, there are yet a few niceties to be explained; while an example from each of the four classes into which we divided wines, will render the subject more intelligible.\n\nThe attentions required in Champagne wines are perhaps the most minute, and the most complicated, and they therefore stand most in need of being detailed. Champagne is a late country, and it frequently happens that the frosts have arrived before the grapes are ripe. Of course, it is an imperfect vintage. Yet, in a certain sense, this is an advantage; while it has also condemned that country, in a great measure, to limit itself to this particular class of wine. A very brisk wine is not easily secured from grapes absolutely ripe; and thus the half-ripened fruit of this district is brought into use. Yet the best of these wines, the finest class of Sillery, rarely seen in this country, is made from the ripened grapes. And hence it is, that the best of the Champagne wines are those which are least brisk or violent, and that great violence is a characteristic of the inferior kinds. When there is violence and sweetness both, we may easily conjecture what the wine is; and in those, as might be expected, there is no flavour.\n\nThe finest wine is thus produced here by a very light pressure of the grapes; in which case only the ripest give out their juice.\n\nIt is held necessary to gather them when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEW\">dew</a> is off, to prevent water being added to the juice. The next pressure, and the least ripe grapes, are reserved for the inferior classes. When the juice is poured into the vat, it remains one night only, the seeds being carefully separated. In all cases also, the greatest care is taken to separate damaged grapes or rotten ones; and it is as much from this neglect as any thing, that the common Italian wines are so bad. If the Champagne is to be red, the fermentation is suffered to proceed on the husks a little longer, for the purpose of extracting the colour; and according to the length of this process, we have the oeil de perdrix, and the pink and red wines. But as we remarked before, this injures the flavour, as all good judges of Champagne know.\n\nWhen the liquor is transferred to the cask, the discharge of yeast at the bung-hole is encouraged for\nten or twelve days; and when the fermentation has become moderate, the bung is put down, and a hole is made by its side. This hole is occasionally opened to give vent to the air, for a space of eight or ten days; when no more air is discharged, fresh wine is introduced, so as to keep the cask constantly full to the bung-hole. This operation is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> when necessary, till the end of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a>, when the wine generally becomes clear. It is then racked into a fresh cask, and fined. After this, it begins to ferment again, losing a portion of its sweetness, and improving in quality. If too sweet, it is not decanted and fined till the fermentation has been renewed by agitation. As the fineness of this wine is one of its essential qualities, and one difficult to obtain, on account of its perpetual fermentation, it is racked and fined a second time, and thus it remains till March. In March it is bottled; yet still it ferments, though corked, and again it begins to deposit. In the best wines, it thus remains from fifteen to eighteen months in the cellar, when it is bottled over again, and is then marketable. The inferior kinds are seldom bottled twice; but an expedient is used instead, to get rid of the sediment. For this purpose, the bottles are ranged in frames with their necks downwards; and when the sediment has been collected in the neck, the cork is dexterously drawn, and again replaced, after which the bottles are filled and completed for the market. There are varieties also in this general process, such as that of suffering the wine to remain in the cask for a year or more on its lees; but we need not enter into these collateral details.\n\nThere is little difference in the practice of Burgundy, except what refers to the retention of the carbonic acid. All else is the same; but great care is taken to clear these wines of their lees, as, from their extreme delicacy, they would soon lose their flavour, and also become sour. In the practice of Bordeaux also, the first stages of the process are the same, excepting in as far as a longer fermentation in the husks is used to extract the colour from the red wines. But there is a difference as to the process of sulphuring, which is largely used in these, in the manner as already described. The red wines of Bordeaux are racked about the end of March or the beginning of April, but the white in December; and in all these wines, great care is taken in all those circumstances which relate to cleanliness, however rude the people, and the operations may appear on a superficial view.\n\nIn the drier Italian wines, the must is allowed to ferment completely in the vat. In some vineyards, a quantity of selected and half-dried grapes is thrown into each two when the wine is finished, so as to give it sweetness, and prevent the hazard of its running to the acetous stage; a rude and a bad process. In the manufacture of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLORENCE\">Florence</a> wine, the must is withdrawn from the vat as soon as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> is raised, and the wine is transferred to a cask, where it is only suffered to remain thirty-six hours, when it is again decanted into a fresh cask at the end of a few hours, and so on, until it is clear and marketable. Thus it is completed in a short time, by little more than the process of racking.\n\nIn different countries, the practices used for preserving the sweet wines vary; but they will be found to depend on one or other of the principles already laid down. In Italy, as in the making of Florence wine, the fermentation is quelled by repeated racking and shifting. Thus the other processes are partly or entirely saved. But it is necessary that very sweet and rich grapes should be used if this process is to be followed. To ensure sweetness, on the principles formerly laid down, the grapes of Tokay are partially dried before they are used; and this is also done for the wines of Cyprus, and for some of those of France and Spain. The remaining processes, consisting in sulphuring, &c., need not be detailed again, as they are nearly the same in all countries.\n\nIn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPORTO\">Oporto</a>, for the dry wines, the practice is to carry on the complete fermentation of the must in the vats. The wine is then introduced into large tuns, capable of holding twenty-five <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PIPES\">pipes</a> each, and at this stage, the brandy is added at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-DISCRETION\">discretion</a> of the maker. In Madeira, the second or insensible fermentation is effected in pipes, and, at the end of three months, the wine is racked, when a certain portion of brandy is added. In both these practices, it would seem as if the union of the brandy with the wine was less perfect than it might be rendered by a different management of this part of the process. Hence, probably, it arises, in a great measure, that the taste of brandy is so sensible in many of these wines. In the best, the quantity is said to be about a twentieth part; but, in the worst class of Port wines, it seems sometimes to amount to a fifth or more. The process followed in making Sherry is rather more complicated. The grapes, in this case, are first slightly dried, and then sprinkled with quicklime. They are then wetted with brandy when introduced into the press, and a farther portion is again added to the must before fermentation. It is highly probable that, by this practice, the brandy is more perfectly combined in the wine, and the fluid rendered more uniform; and hence also, probably, it arises, that the taste of brandy is not to be perceived in genuine Sherry, though often found in those baser imitations which are manufactured from the tasteless wines of the Canary Islands, and of other parts of Spain. The remainder of the process for Sherry consists in racking repeatedly at intervals of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> or two; fresh brandy in small quantities being added at each stage of this process.\n\nWe may, in conclusion, remark, that in the attempts to make wines in our own country from native fruits, the same rules are of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> application, and that an attention to them would render these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> processes more complete than they now are, and the results more valuable. In Britain, also, it is easy to make very good wine from immature grapes, by the addition of sugar in the necessary proportions; and these can be procured in almost any season, so that this might even become an object of a petty domestic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>. Nor is the manufacture limited to the fruit alone, since the leaves and tendrils, by infusion, admit of the same treatment, and with the same results. Very tolerable wine, perfectly resembling the wines of France, can thus be made, and at an expense of little more than the very moderate cost of the sugar.","sp":869,"ep":880}]
