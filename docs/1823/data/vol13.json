[{"h":"AFTER THE PATIENT HAS BY THIS","t":"r the patient has by this means vomited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> eight times, or oftener, and discharged a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> and blackish bilious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, a grain or a grain and a half of thebaic extract is given, in order to procure some respite from the violent retching, vomiting, and anxiety. The person is desired to take nothing into his stomach for two hours after this, by which means it is seldom or never rejected; and thus all the symptoms are considerably abated, the retching and vomiting either totally cease or are very much lessened, so that medicines may now be exhibited which the stomach would not have retained before. These are cooling acid juleps, or other antiseptic remedies; but neither nitre nor any of its preparations <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> be found to stay on the stomach, nor, according to Dr Hilary, are the nitrous medicines, or even the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> antiemetic draughts, proper to be given in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>, even though they should agree with the stomach, on account of their attenuating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> the patient has not a stool or two after drinking the warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> and vomiting, it is necessary to give a gentle purging clyster; and when six or eight hours rest have been obtained, a gentle antiphlogistic and antiseptic purge, in order to evacuate by stool as much of the bilious matter as we possibly can. Or if the patient has a purging before, which sometimes though very rarely happens, a dose of toasted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-RHUBARB\">rhubarb</a> is given, and an antiseptic anodyne after it has operated, to abate and check the too great purging, but not to stop it, as this evacuation has been always observed to be of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>, provided it be not very violent.\n\nAfter this indication is completely answered, the next is to exhibit such proper antiseptic medicines as may stop the putrescent disposition of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a>. Here the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CINCHONA\">cinchona</a> would seem to be the most proper remedy; but unluckily the stomachs of the patients in this disease are so much irritated, and so apt to reject every thing, that it cannot be retained in any form whatever. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> Dr Percival recommends columbo root, the infusion of which is found to be a powerful antiemetic and antiputrescent medicine, and might perhaps so far alter the state of the stomach as to make it bear the bark. Dr Hilary, however, who was ignorant of the virtues of columbo, substituted the radix serpentinae Virginianae with success. A slight infusion of this root not only sat easily on the stomach of the patients, but moderately raised the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULSE\">pulse</a> and fever, both of which are now too low. The following receipt was found the most agreeable and efficacious:\n\nRad. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERPENT\">serpent</a>. Virginian. 3i.\nCroc. Ang. 3ss.

But if, after taking this a little while, we find that the pulse does not rise, but on the contrary that a coldness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> parts comes on, the medicines must be made more warming, by increasing the quantity of the snakeroot and saffron, or by adding *vinum croceum*, *confectio cardiana*, or the like, but not by the use of volatile spirits and salts, which hurt by their stimulating and dissolving qualities. Blisters Dr Hilary reproaches in the strongest terms, and affirms that he has seen the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> where a blister was applied turned perfectly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> and sphecalated; so that if the spine and end of the ribs had not hindered, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> passage would have been opened into the cavity of the thorax, had the patient lived a few hours after it.\n\nAt the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> that the strength of the patient is kept up by the medicines above mentioned, or by others similar, he gave repeated gentle purgatives every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> or third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, and sometimes, when the symptoms were very urgent, every day, for four or five days successively. But if proper methods be taken in the beginning of the disease, it is seldom that such a repetition of purging is necessary.\n\nDr Hilary's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of treating the yellow fever is, in our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, as judicious as any that has yet been proposed. But, among the late writers, some have recommended <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a>, particularly under the form of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CALOMEL\">calomel</a>, as the most efficacious remedy which can be employed. In some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> it has certainly been given to an almost incredible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, in a very short time, without exciting either purging or salivation. And it cannot be denied, that patients have not unfrequently recovered under the use of it. But calomel can <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> more be reckoned an infallible remedy for this disease than blood-letting.\n\nSince the introduction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> affusion, in the care of typhus fevers, by Dr Currie, it has been imagined by some, that this practice would afford a very efficacious remedy in the typhus icteroides, as well as in the typhus mitior. But <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> has not yet confirmed the utility of this practice.\n\nSome have suggested the internal use of the oxygenated muriatic acid, properly diluted, as an article from which great benefit may be expected in the yellow fever. This practice deserves, we think, a fair <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>: but the utility of it still remains to be determined by experience.\n\nTo the genus of *typhus* also belong all those fevers attended with very profuse and debilitating sweats, and which have sometimes, not without good reason, been accounted plagues; such as the English sweating-sickness, *Miliaris sudatoria*, *Sauv.* sp. 5. *Ephemeris sudatoria*, *Sauv.* sp. 7. *Ephemeris Britannica*, *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAIUS\">Caius</a> de ephem.

According to him, the appearance of the hectic fever is not unlike that of the genuine intermittent; from which, however, the disease is very different in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, while at the same time it is much more dangerous. In the true intermittent, the three stages of cold, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, and sweat, are far more distinctly marked, the whole fit is much longer, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> which it observes is more constant and regular, and the intermissions are more perfect, than in the hectic fever. For in the latter, even during the clearest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REMISSION\">remission</a>, there is usually a feverish quickness perceptible in the pulse, which seldom fails to exceed the utmost limit of a healthy one by at least 10 strokes in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a>.\n\nThe chilness of the hectic fever is sometimes succeeded by heat, and sometimes immediately by a sweat without any intermediate state of heat. The heat will sometimes come on without any remarkable chilness preceding; and the chilness has been observed to go off without being followed either by heat or sweat. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> of these stages is seldom the same for three fits together; and as it is not uncommon for one of them to be wanting, the length of the whole fit must vary much more than in the true intermittent; but in general it is much shorter.\n\nA patient subjected to hectic fever is little or nothing relieved by the occurrence of the sweat; but is often as anxious and restless under it as during the chilness or heat. When the sweat is over, the fever will sometimes continue; and in the middle of the fever the chilness will return; which is a most certain mark of this disease.\n\nThe hectic fever will return with great exactness, like an intermittent, for two or perhaps three fits; but Dr Heberden informs us, that he does not remember ever to have known it keep the same period for four fits successively. The paroxysm will now and then keep off for 10 or 12 days; and at other times, especially when the patient is very ill, it will return so frequently on the same day, that the chilness of a new fit will follow immediately the sweat of the former. It is not unusual to have many threatenings of a shivering in the same day; and some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of drowsiness is apt to attend the cessation of a fit.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-URINE\">urine</a> in a true intermittent is clear during the fits and turbid during the intervals; but in the hectic fever it is liable to all kinds of irregularity. It will be equally clear or turbid in both stages; or turbid in the fits and clear in the intervals; and sometimes it will be, as in a true intermittent, clear during the fever, and thick at the going off.\n\nHectic patients often complain of pains like those of the rheumatism, which either affect by turns almost every\nevery <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the body, or else return constantly to the same part; which is often at a great distance from the seat of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> disorder, and, as far as is known, without any peculiar connection with it. Those pains are so violent in some patients, as to require a large quantity of opium. As far as Dr Heberden has observed, they are most common where the hectic arises from some ulcer open to the external <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, as in cancers of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>, &c. Joined with this fever, and arising probably from one common cause, he has been surprised to see swellings of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a>, neck, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a> of the body, rise up almost in an instant, as if the part was all at once grown fatter. These swellings are not painful, hard, or discoloured, and they continue for several hours.\n\nDr Heberden has seen this fever attack those who seemed in tolerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, in a sudden and violent manner, like a common inflammatory one; and like that, also, in a very short time bring them into imminent danger of their lives; after which it has begun to abate, and to afford hopes of a perfect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a>. But though the danger might be over for the present, and but little of a fever remain; yet that little has soon demonstrated, that it was kept up by some great mischief within, and, proving unconquerable by any remedies, has gradually undermined the health of the patient, and never ceased except with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. This manner of its beginning, however, is a rare occurrence. It much oftener dissembles its strength at first; and creeps on so slowly, that the subjects of it, though they be not perfectly well, yet for some months hardly think themselves ill; complaining only of being sooner tired with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> than usual, of want of appetite, and of falling away. But gentle as the symptoms may seem, if the pulse be quicker than ordinary, so as to have the artery to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> 90 times and perhaps 120 times in a minute, there is the greatest reason to be apprehensive of the event. In no disorder, perhaps, is the pulse of more use to guide our judgment than in the hectic fever: yet even here we must be upon our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a>, and not trust entirely to this criterion; for one in about twenty patients, with all the worst signs of decay from some incurable cause, which irresistibly goes on to destroy his life, will show not the smallest degree of quickness, nor any other irregularity of the pulse, to the day of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>.\n\nCauses, &c. This fever will supervene whenever there is a great collection of matter formed in any part of the body; but it more particularly attends upon the inflammation of a scirrhouss gland, and even upon one that is slight and only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> beginning; the fever growing worse in proportion as the gland becomes more inflamed, ulcerated, or gangrenous. And such is the lingering nature of those glandular disorders, that the first of those stages will continue for many months, and the second for some years.\n\nIf this scirrhouss inflammation be external, or in the lungs, or some of the abdominal viscera, where the disturbance of their functions plainly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> out the seat of the disorder, no doubt can be entertained concerning the cause of the fever. But if the part affected be not obvious to the senses, and its precise functions be not known, the hectic, which is there only part of the train of another disease, may be mistaken for the primary or only affection.\n\nLying-in-women, on account of the violence sustained in delivery, generally die when affected with this fever. Women of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of near 50 and upwards are particularly liable to it. For, upon the cessation of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> discharge, the glands of the breasts, ovaries, or womb, too commonly begin to grow scirrhouss, and proceed to be cancerous. Not only these, but the glandular parts of all the abdominal viscera, are supposed to be affected at this particular time, and to become the seats of incurable disorders.\n\nThe injuries done to the stomach and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIVER\">liver</a> by hard drinking are attended with similar symptoms, and terminate in the same manner.\n\nDr Heberden observes, that the slightest wound by a fine-pointed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> is known upon some occasions to bring on the greatest disturbances, and the most alarming symptoms, nay even death itself. For not only the wounded part will swell and be painful, but by turns almost every part of the body; and very distant parts have been known to come even to suppuration. These symptoms are constantly accompanied with this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> intermittent, which lasts as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> as any of them remain.\n\nPrognosis. This anomalous fever is never less dangerous than when it originates from a kindly suppuration, into which all the diseased parts are melted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>, and for which there is a proper outlet.\n\nThe symptoms and danger from some small punctures, with their concomitant fever; most frequently give way in a few days; though in some persons they have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> for two or three months, and in others have proved fatal.\n\nThe inflammation of internal scirrhouss glands, or of those in the breasts, sometimes goes off, and the fever, which depended upon it, ceases; but it much oftener happens, that it proceeds to cancerous and gangrenous ulcers, and terminates only in death. Death is also, almost universally, the consequence of hectic fever from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TUBERCLES\">tubercles</a> of the lungs, which have in general at least been considered as glandular bodies in a scirrhouss state.\n\nCure. It is not to be expected that the same remedies will in every case be adapted to a fever which, arising from very different causes, is attended with such a variety of symptoms. A mixture of asafoetida and opium has some persons seemed singularly serviceable in this fever, when brought on by a small wound; but in most other cases the principal if not the sole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of the physician must be employed in relieving the symptoms, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEMPERING\">tempering</a> the heat, by preventing both costiveness and purging, by procuring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a>, and by checking the sweats. If, at the same time, continues Dr Heberden, he put the body into as good general health as may be, by air, exercise, and a proper course of mild diet, he can perhaps do nothing better than to leave all the rest to nature. In some few fortunate patients, nature appears to have such resources, as may afford reason for entertaining hopes of cure, even in very bad cases. For some have recovered from this fever attended with every symptom of an abdominal viscus incurably diseased, after all probable methods of relief from art had been tried in vain, and after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> and strength were so exhausted as to leave scarce any hopes from nature. In those deplora-\nble circumstances; there has arisen a swelling not far from the probable seat of the disorder, and yet without any discoverable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> with it. This swelling has come to an abscess; in consequence of which the pulse has soon returned to its natural state, as have also the appetite, flesh, and strength. What nature has performed in these rare cases, Dr Heberden acquaints us, he has often endeavoured to imitate, by making issues or applying blisters near the seat of the disease; but he cannot say with the same success.\n\nIt seems at present, Dr Heberden observes, to be the opinion of many practitioners, that gangrenes will be stopped, and suppuration become more kindly, by the use of Peruvian bark; and therefore this remedy is always either advised or permitted in the irregular fever joined with suppurations and gangrenes. But he affirms he does not remember ever to have seen any good effect from cinchona in this fever unattended with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> ulcer; and even in gangrenes it so often fails, that in successful cases, where it has been administered, there must be room for suspicion that the success was owing to another cause. Dr Heberden acknowledges, at the same time, that he never <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> any harm from cinchona, in these, or indeed in any other cases, except a slight temporary purging or sickness, where it has happened to disagree with the stomach, or where the latter has been loaded by taking the medicine too fast, especially in dry boluses wrapped in wafer-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>.\n\nIn hectic illnesses, where all other means have proved ineffectual, a journey to Bath is usually proposed by the friends, and wished for by the sick; but Dr Heberden justly observes, that, besides the fatigue and many inconveniences of a journey to a dying person, the Bath waters are peculiarly hurtful in this fever, which they never fail to increase, and thereby aggravate the sufferings and hasten the death of the patient.\n\n**ORDER II.

Their great characteristics are, the general symptoms of fever, and a topical inflammation, attended with the lesion of some important <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a>. In most instances, when blood is drawn, it is found upon coagulation to be covered with a bulky coat.

To this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>, therefore, belong the following diseases:\n\nFurunculus, Sauv. gen. 18.

Vog. 348.\n\nParaphimosis, Vog. 349.\n\nFor the cure of inflammations, Dr Cullen lays down the following indications. 1. To remove the remote causes when they are evident and continue to operate. 2. To take off the phlogistic diathesis affecting the whole system, or the particular part. 3. To take off the spasm of the particular part, by remedies applied to the whole system, or to the part itself.\n\nThe means of removing the remote causes will readily occur, from considering the particular nature and circumstances of the different kinds. Acrid matters must be removed, or their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> must be prevented, by the application of demulcents. Compressing and overstretching powers must be taken away; and from their several circumstances, the means of doing so will be obvious.\n\nThe means of taking off the phlogistic diathesis of the system are the same with those already mentioned under the cure for synocha. The means of taking off the spasm also from the particular part, are much the same with those already mentioned. Only it is to be remembered, that topical bleedings, such as cupping with scarifications, applying leeches, &c. are in this case much more indicated; and that some of the other remedies are to be directed more particularly to the part affected, as shall be more fully considered when we treat of those diseases attended with particular inflammations.\n\nWhen a tendency to suppuration is perceived, the proper indication is to promote the production of perfect pus as much as possible. For this purpose various remedies, supposed to possess a specific power, have been proposed; but it does not appear that any of them are possessed of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of this kind; and, in Dr Cullen's opinion, all that can be done is to favour the suppuration by such applications as may support a moderate heat in the part, by some tenacity confine the perspiration, and by an emollient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> may weaken the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COHESION\">cohesion</a> of the teguments, and favour their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EROSION\">erosion</a>. As all abscesses are occasioned by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EFFUSION\">effusion</a> of fluids, and as in the case of certain effusions a suppuration becomes\ncomes not only unavoidable but desirable, it may be supposed that most of the means of procuring a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a>, by diminishing the force of circulation, &c., ought to be avoided. But as we observe, on the one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, that a certain degree of increased impetus, or of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> symptoms of inflammation, is necessary to produce a proper suppuration; so it is then especially necessary to avoid those means of resolution which may diminish too much the force of circulation. And on the other hand, as the impetus of the blood, when violent, is found to prevent the proper suppuration; so, in such cases, though a tendency to suppuration may have begun, it may be proper to continue those means of resolution which moderate the force of the circulation. With respect to the opening of abscesses when completely formed, see the article <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SURGERY\">Surgery</a>.\n\nWhen an inflammation has taken a tendency to gangrene, that event is to be prevented by every possible means; and these must be different according to the nature of the several causes: but after a gangrene has in some degree taken place, it can be cured only by the separation of the dead from the living parts. This in certain circumstances can be performed, and most properly, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a>. In other cases it can be done by exciting a suppuratory inflammation on the verge of the living part, whereby its cohesion with the dead part may be everywhere broken off, so that the latter may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> off by itself. While this is doing, it is proper to prevent the further <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUTREFACTION\">putrefaction</a> of the part, and its spreading wider. For this purpose various antiseptic applications have been proposed: but Dr Cullen is of opinion, that while the teguments are entire, these applications can hardly have any effect; and therefore that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> procedure must be to scarify the part so as to reach the living substance, and, by the wounds made there, to excite the suppuration required. By the same incisions also we give access to antiseptics, which may both prevent the progress of the putrefaction in the dead, and excite the inflammation necessary on the verge of the living parts.\n\nWhen the gangrene proceeds from loss of tone, and when this, communicated to the neighbouring parts, prevents that inflammation which, as we have said, is requisite to the separation of the dead parts from the living, it will be necessary to obviate this loss of tone by tonic medicines given internally; and for this purpose cinchona has been found to be most effectual. But when the gangrene arises from the violence of inflammation, the bark may not only fail of proving a remedy, but may do harm: for its power as a tonic is especially suited to those cases of gangrene which proceed from an original loss of tone, as in the case of palsy and oedema; or in those cases where a loss of tone takes place after the original inflammatory symptoms are removed.\n\nOn the other hand, Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELL\">Bell</a> is of opinion, that incisions made with a view to admit the operation of antiseptic remedies in gangrenes, as well as the remedies themselves, must be pernicious from the irritation they occasion, and from the danger of wounding blood-vessels, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NERVES\">nerves</a>, or tendons, and also by allowing a free passage for the putrescent fluids into the parts not yet affected. And unless they be carried so deep as to reach the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> parts, applications of the antiseptic kind can never have any effect in answering the purpose for which they were intended. The same author also remarks, that all the advantages commonly observed from the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of applications recommended for gangrene, are obtained with more ease, and generally too with more certainty, from the use of some gentle stimulating embrocation; which, by exciting a slight irritation upon the surface, especially when assisted by a free use of cinchona, produces for the most part such a degree of inflammation as is wished for. With this view he has frequently known a weak solution of sal ammoniac, a dram of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> to two ounces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VINEGAR\">vinegar</a> and six of water, form a mixture of very proper strength for every purpose of this kind. But the degree of stimulus can easily be either increased or diminished according to circumstances, by using a larger or smaller proportion of the salt.\n\nWhenever, either by the means recommended, or by a natural exertion of the system, a slight inflammation appears between the diseased and sound parts, we may in general, with tolerable certainty, expect, that in due time the parts will be separated; and when a full suppuration is once fairly established, there can be little doubt that the mortified parts will be soon and easily removed.\n\nA complete separation being effected, the sore is to be treated in the manner described under the article Surgery; with a proper attention, at the same time, to the support of the general system by the continuance of nourishing diet, and cinchona with such quantities of wine as may seem necessary.\n\nWith regard to the bark, however, it is proper to take notice of another case of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTIFICATION\">mortification</a> in which it is likewise unsuccessful, as well as in that attended with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> degree of inflammation; and that is, in those mortifications of the toes and feet, common in old people, or which arise from any cause increasing the rigidity of the vessels to such a degree as to prevent the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of the fluids through them. In this case Mr Pott has discovered, that all kinds of warm applications are very unsuccessful; but by the free use of opium, together with sedatives and relaxants externally applied, he has frequently seen the tumefaction of the feet and ankles subside, the skin recover its natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, and all the mortified parts separate in a very short time, leaving a clean sore. But as to scarifications, or any other attempt to separate artificially the mortified from the sound parts, he thinks them very prejudicial, by giving pain; which is generally of itself violent in this disease, and which seems to have a great share in producing the other evils.\n\nThe other terminations of inflammation either do not admit of any treatment except that of preventing them by resolution, or properly belong to the article Surgery.\n\nSp.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between the phlegmon or preceding species, and erythema, according to Dr Cullen, is, that, in the former, the inflammation seems particularly to affect the vessels on the internal surface of the skin, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> with the lax adjacent cellular texture; whence a more copious effusion, and that too of serum convertible into pus, takes place. In the erythema the affection is of the vessels on the external surface of the skin communicating with the rete mucosum. This affection does not admit of any effusion but what separates the cuticle, and gives occasion to the formation of a blister, while the smaller size of the vessels admits only of the effusion of a thin fluid very seldom convertible into pus.

Dr Cullen observes, that the inflammation of the eye may be considered as of two kinds; according as it is seated in the membranes of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> of the eye, when it is named ophthalmia membranarum; or as it is seated in the sebaceous glands placed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TARSUS\">tarsus</a>, or edges of the eyelids, in which case it may be termed ophthalmia tarsi. These two kinds are very frequently connected together, as the one may excite the other; but they are still to be distinguished according as the one or the other may happen to be the primary affection.\n\n1. The inflammation of the membranes of the eye affects especially, and most frequently, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ADNATA\">adnata</a>, and appears in a turgescence of its vessels; so that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> vessels which are naturally there, become not only increased in size, but many more appear than in a natural state. This turgescence of the vessels is attended with pain, especially upon the motion of the ball of the eye; and this irritation, like every other, applied to the surface of the eye, produces an effusion of tears from the lachrymal gland.\n\nThe inflammation commonly, and chiefly, affects the adnata spread on the anterior part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BULB\">bulb</a> of the eye; but usually spreads also along the continuation of the adnata on the inside of the palpebrae; and as that is extended on the tarsus palpebrarum, the excretories of the sebacous glands opening there are also frequently affected. When the affection of the adnata is considerable, it may be communicated to the subjacent membranes of the eye, and even to the retina itself; which thereby acquires so great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a>, that every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> of light becomes painful. The inflammation of the membranes of the eye is in different degrees, according as the adnata is more or less affected, or according as the inflammation is either of the adnata alone, or of the subjacent membranes also; and upon these differences, different species have been established; but they seem all to differ only in degree, and are to be cured by the same remedies more or less employed.\n\nThe proximate cause of ophthalmia is not different from that of inflammation in general; and the different circumstances of ophthalmia may be explained by\nby the difference of its remote causes, and by the different parts of the eye which it happens to affect; as may be understood from what has been already said. We shall therefore proceed to give an account of the method of cure.\n\nThe great objects to be aimed at in the treatment of ophthalmia, are, in the first place, the resolution of the inflammation which has already taken place; and, secondly, the removal of those consequences which frequently arise from the inflammation, especially if it have been of long standing. But besides these, while it has appeared from former observation, that there is a peculiar disposition to the disease, practices may often be successfully employed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBAT\">combat</a> this disposition, and thus prevent the return of the affection.\n\nThe ophthalmia membranarum requires the remedies proper for inflammation in general; and when the deeper-seated membranes are affected, and especially when a pyrexia is present, large general bleedings may be necessary. But this last is seldom requisite, and, for the most part, the ophthalmia is an affection merely local, accompanied with little or no pyrexia. General bleedings therefore have little effect upon it, and the cure is chiefly to be obtained by topical bleedings, that is, blood drawn from the vessels near the inflamed part; and opening the jugular vein, or the temporal artery, may be considered as in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of this kind. It is commonly sufficient to apply a number of leeches round the eye; but it is perhaps still better to draw blood by cupping and scarifying from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a>. In many cases, the most effectual remedy is to scarify the internal surface of the inferior eyelid, and to cut the turgid vessels upon the adnata itself.\n\nBesides blood-letting, purging, as a remedy suited to inflammation in general, has been considered as peculiarly adapted to inflammation in any part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, and therefore to ophthalmia; and it is sometimes useful: but, for the reasons given before with respect to general bleeding, purging in the case of ophthalmia does not prove useful in any proportion to the evacuation excited.\u2014For relaxing the spasm in the part, and taking off the determination of the fluids to it, blistering near the part has commonly been found useful. When the inflammation does not yield to the application of blisters after topical bleeding, great benefit is often obtained by supporting a discharge from the blistered part, under the form of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a>, by which means a more permanent determination of blood from the part is obtained.\n\nIt is probably also on the same principle that the good effects obtained from the use of errhine medicines in obstinate cases of ophthalmia are to be accounted for. By these errhines, in particular, which occasion and support for some time a great discharge from the nose, great benefit has often been obtained. The powder of asarabacca, or the infusion of hippocastanum, sniffed up the nose at bedtime in proper doses, are often productive of the best effects, when many other remedies have been tried in vain.\n\nOphthalmia, as an external inflammation, admits of topical applications. All those, however, which increase the heat and relax the vessels of the part, prove hurtful; and the admission of cool air to the eye, and the application of cooling and astringent medicines, which at the same time do not produce irritation, prove useful. Of all these the solution of acetite of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>, assiduously applied, is perhaps the best. In the cure of this distemper, indeed, all irritation must carefully be avoided, particularly that of light; and the only certain means of doing this is by keeping the patient in a very dark chamber.\n\n2. In the ophthalmia tarsi, the same medicines may be necessary, as have been already recommended for the ophthalmia membranarum. However, as the ophthalmia tarsi may often depend upon an acrimony deposited in the sebaceous glands of the part, so it may require various internal remedies according to the variety of the acrimony in fault; for which we must refer to the consideration of scrophula, syphilis, or other diseases with which this ophthalmia may be connected; and where these shall not be evident, certain remedies more generally adapted to the evacuation of acrimony, such as mercury, may be employed. In the ophthalmia tarsi, it almost constantly happens that some ulcerations are formed on the tarsus. These require the application of mercury and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>, which alone may sometimes cure the whole affection: and they may be useful even when the disease depends upon a fault of the whole system.\n\nBoth in the ophthalmia membranarum, and in the ophthalmia tarsi, it is necessary to obviate that gluing together of the eyelids which commonly happens in sleep; and which may be done by insinuating a little of any mild unctuous medicine between the eyelids before the patient shall go to sleep.\n\nThe slighter kinds of inflammations from the dust or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, may be removed by fomenting with warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILK\">milk</a> and water, adding a small portion of brandy; and by anointing the borders of the eyelids with unguentum tutteri, or the like, at night, especially when those parts are excoriated and sore. But in bad cases, after the inflammation has yielded a little to evacuations, the cataplasmum aluminis of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> Pharmacopoeia spread on lint, and applied at bedtime, has been found the best external remedy. Before the use of the latter, the solution of sulphate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZINC\">zinc</a> is prescribed with advantage; and in violent pains it is of service to foment frequently with a decoction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> poppy-heads. One of the most common and most disagreeable consequences of ophthalmia, is an effusion of the cornea, so far obstructing the passage of light as to diminish or prevent vision. This is sometimes so considerable as to admit of removal by operation: but in slighter cases it may often be removed by the application of different gentle escharotics; and in this way, without the least danger of any inconvenience, goods effects are often obtained, from gently introducing into the eye at bedtime a powder consisting of equal parts of supertartrite of potass and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>, reduced together to a fine powder.\n\nWhere there is a disposition to frequent returns of this affection, cinchona is often employed with success in combating it: But nothing in general answers better than frequent and regular cold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATHING\">bathing</a> of the eyes.\n\nBesides the various species of ophthalmia which were before known in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, another has lately been introduced, that contagious ophthalmia, viz. with which the British\nBritish troops were affected in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>, and which they have imported into this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> on their return from thence.\n\nOf this affection many interesting accounts have been published. Perhaps the best is an elaborate treatise by Mr Edmonston, who has had many opportunities of witnessing the affection, and extensive practice in the treatment of the disease, both in Egypt and in Britain. To his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> therefore we may refer those who wish for the most full information respecting it. We shall only observe, that now, no doubt can be entertained respecting the contagious nature of the disease; and that therefore the first great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> necessary in the treatment is the complete separation of the diseased from the sound.\n\nGENUS IX.

The signs of an impending phrenitis are, immoderate and continual watchings; or if any sleep be obtained, it is disturbed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DREAMS\">dreams</a>, and gives no refreshment; acute and lasting pains, especially in the hind part of the head and neck; little thirst; a great and slow respiration, as if proceeding from the bottom of the breast; the pulse sometimes small and slow, sometimes quick and frequent; a suppression of urine; and forgetfulness. The distemper when present may be known by the following signs:\n\nThe veins of the head swell, and the temporal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ARTERIES\">arteries</a> throb much; the eyes are fixed, sparkle, and have a fierce aspect; the speech is incoherent, and the patient behaves very roughly to the bystanders, with furious attempts to get out of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a>, not indeed continually, but returning as it were by paroxysms: the tongue is dry, rough, yellow, or black; there is a coldness of the external parts; a proneness to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a>; chattering of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>; a trembling of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, with which the sick seem to be gathering something, and actually do gather the naps off the bed-clothes.\n\nCauses of, and persons subject to, this disorder. People of a hot and bilious habit of body, and such as are of a passionate disposition, are apt to be affected with phrenitis. In the same danger are those who make much use of spices, or are given to hot and spirituous liquors; who have been exposed more than usual to the sun, or obliged to undergo immoderate studies or watchings; who are subject to headaches, or in whom some customary hemorrhages have been stopped; or the disease may arise from some injury offered to the head externally. Sir John Pringle observes, that the phrenitis, when considered as an original disease, is apt to attack <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> season when they are exposed to the heat of the sun, and especially when asleep and in liquor. A symptomatic phrenitis is also more frequent in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> than elsewhere, on account of the violence done to all fevers when the sick are carried in waggons from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAMP\">camp</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">hospital</a>, where the very noise or light alone would be sufficient, with more delicate natures, to raise a phrensy. From these and similar causes, a state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> inflammation, affecting some parts within the cranium, is produced; and there can be no doubt, that from this all the symptoms of the disease arise, and particularly that peculiar delirium which characterizes it. But in what manner local diseases, even of the brain itself, produce affections of the mind, we are still totally in the dark.\n\nPrognosis. Every kind of phrenitis, whether idiopathic or symptomatic, is attended with a high degree of danger; and, unless removed before the fourth day, a gangrene or sphacelus of the meninges readily takes place, and the patient dies delirious. The following are the most fatal symptoms: A continual and furious delirium, with watching; thin watery urine, white faeces, the urine and stools running off involuntarily, or a total suppression of these excretions; a ready disposition to become stupid, or to faint; trembling, rigor, chattering of the teeth, convulsions, hiccup, coldness of the extremities, trembling of the tongue, shrill <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a>, a sudden cessation of pain, with apparent tranquillity. The following are favourable: Sweats, apparently critical, breaking out; a seeming effort of nature to terminate the disease by a diarrhoea; a large hemorrhage from the nose; swellings of the glands behind the ears; haemorrhoids.\n\nCure. From what has been said of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of this disease, the cure must entirely depend on obtaining a resolution of the inflammation. The objects chiefly to be aimed at with this view are, 1. The removal of such exciting causes as continue to operate. 2. The diminution of the momentum of the blood in the circulating system in general. 3. The diminution of impetus at the brain in particular: and, 4. The avoiding\nDifferent practices may be used with these intentions; but the most powerful remedies are to be immediately employed. Large and repeated bleedings are especially necessary; and these too taken from vessels as near as possible to the part affected. The opening the temporal artery has been recommended, and with some reason; but as the practice is attended with inconveniences, perhaps the opening of the jugular veins may in general prove more effectual; with which, however, may be joined the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> of blood from the temples by cupping and scarifying. It is also probable, that purging may be of more use in this than in some other inflammatory affections, as it may operate by revulsion. For the same purpose of revulsion, warm pediluvia are a remedy, but rather ambiguous.\n\nThe taking off the force of the blood in the vessels of the head by an erect posture is generally useful. Blistering is also useful, but chiefly when applied near to the part affected. In short, every part of the antiphlogistic regimen is here necessary, and particularly the admission of cold air. Even cold substances applied to the head have been found useful; and the application of such refrigerants as vinegar is certainly proper. Opiates are thought to be hurtful in every inflammatory state of the brain. On the whole, however, it must be remarked, that practitioners are very uncertain with regard to the means proper to be used in this disease; and the more so, that the symptoms by which the disease is commonly judged to be present, appear sometimes without any internal inflammation; and on the other hand, dissections have shown that the brain has been inflamed, where few of the peculiar symptoms of inflammation had appeared before death.\n\n**GENUS X. CYNANCHE.**\n\n*Cynanche, Sauv. gen. 110. Lin. 33. Sag. gen. 300. Angina, Vog. 49. Hoffm. II. 125. Junck. 30. Angina inflammatoria, Boerh. 798.*\n\nSp. I. **CYNANCHE TONSILLARIS.**\n\n*The Inflammatory Quinsy.*\n\n*Cynanche tonsillaris, Sauv. sp. 1. Angina inflammatoria, sp. 5. Boerh. 805.*\n\n**Description.** This is an inflammation of the mucous membrane of the fauces, affecting principally that congeries of mucous follicles which forms the tonsils; and from thence spreading along the velum and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UVULA\">uvula</a>, so as frequently to affect every part of the mucous membrane. The disease appears by some tumour and redness of the parts; is attended with a painful and difficult deglutition; a troublesome clamminess of the mouth and throat; a frequent but difficult excretion of mucus; and the whole is accompanied with pyrexia. The inflammation and tumour are commonly at first most considerable in one tonsil; and afterwards, abating in that, increase in the other. This disease is not contagious.\n\n**Causes of, and persons subject to, this disorder.** This disease is commonly occasioned by cold externally applied, particularly about the neck. It affects especially the young and sanguine; and a disposition to it is often acquired by habit. It occurs especially in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> cynanche, and autumn, when vicissitudes of heat and cold frequently take place.\n\n**Prognosis.** This species of cynanche terminates frequently by resolution, sometimes by suppuration, but hardly ever by gangrene; though in some cases sloughy spots appear on the fauces: the prognosis therefore is generally favourable.\n\n**Cure.** As the principal morbid affection in this disease, on which all its characterising symptoms immediately depend, is the active inflammation in the tonsils and neighbouring parts, the object first and principally to be aimed at in the cure is to obtain a resolution of this inflammation. Sometimes, however, it is necessary to have recourse to practices, with the view of obviating urgent symptoms before a resolution can be effected; and in other cases, where a resolution cannot be obtained, it must be the aim of the practitioner to promote a speedy and favourable suppuration. After suppuration has taken place, the proper means of promoting a discharge of the purulent matter will conclude the cure. Here some bleeding may be necessary; but large and general evacuations are seldom beneficial. The opening of the ranular veins is an insignificant remedy, according to Dr. Cullen, but is recommended as efficacious by Sir John Pringle: more benefit, however, may in general be derived from leeches to the external fauces. The inflammation may be often relieved by moderate astringents, and particularly by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a> applied to the parts affected. In many cases, nothing has been found to give more relief than the vapour of warm water received into the fauces.\n\nBesides these, blistering, and still more frequently rubefacient medicines, are applied with success, as well as antiphlogistic purgatives; and every part of the antiphlogistic regimen is to be observed, except the application of cold. Sir John Pringle recommends a thick piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FLANNEL\">flannel</a> moistened with two parts of common sweet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>, and one of spirit of hartshorn (or in a larger proportion, if the skin will bear it), to be applied to the throat, and renewed once every four or five hours. By this means the neck, and sometimes the whole body, is put into a sweat, which after bleeding either carries off or lessens the inflammation. When the disease has a tendency to suppuration, nothing will be more useful than receiving into the fauces the steams of warm water. Benefit is also obtained from poultices applied to the external fauces. When the abscess is attended with much swelling, if it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> not spontaneously, it ought to be opened by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANCET\">lancet</a>; and this does not require much caution, as even the inflammatory state may be relieved by some scarification of the tonsils. When this disease runs very rapidly to such a height as to threaten suffocation, it is sometimes necessary to have recourse to bronchotomy as the only means of saving the life of the patient. But there is reason to believe that this operation has sometimes been employed where it was not necessary; and we may safely venture to say, that it is but seldom requisite; insomuch that Dr. Cullen tells us, he has never in his practice seen any case requiring bronchotomy.\n\nSp.

This distemper is not particularly described by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> physicians; though perhaps the Syrian and Egyptian ulcers mentioned by Aretaeus Cappadoc, and the pestilent ulcerated tonsils we read of in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIUS\">Actius</a> Amideus, were of this nature. Some of the scarlet fevers mentioned by Morton seem also to have approached near to it. In the beginning of the last century, a disease exactly similar to this is described by the physicians of that time, as raging with great violence and mortality in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a> and some parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>; but no account of it was published in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> till the year 1748, when a very accurate one was drawn up by Dr Fothergill, and in 1752 by Dr Huxham. The latter observes, that this disease was preceded by long, cold, and wet seasons; by which probably the bodies of people were debilitated, and more apt to receive contagion, which possibly also might be produced by the stagnant and putrid waters.\n\nThe attack of this disease was very different in different persons. Sometimes a rigor, with fulness and soreness of the throat; and painful stiffness of the neck, were the first symptoms complained of. Sometimes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> chills and heats, with some degree of giddiness, drowsiness, or headache, ushered in the distemper. It seized others with more severe feverish symptoms; great pain of the head, back, and limbs; a vast oppression of the praecordia, and continual sighing. Some grown persons went about for days in a drooping state, with much uneasiness and anxiety, till at last they were obliged to take to their beds.\u2014Thus various was the disease, says Dr Huxham, at the onset. But it commonly began with chills and heats, load and pain of the head, soreness of throat, and hoarseness; some cough, sickness at stomach, frequent vomiting and purging, in children especially, which were sometimes very severe; though a contrary state was more common to the adult. There was in all a very great dejection of spirits, very sudden weakness, great heaviness on the breast; and faintness, from the very beginning. The pulse in general was quick, small, and fluttering, though sometimes heavy and undulating. The urine was commonly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a>, thin, and crude; however, in many grown persons, it was passed in small quantities and high coloured, or like turbid whey. The eyes were heavy, reddish, and as it were weeping; the countenance very often full, flushed, and bloated, though sometimes pale and sunk.\n\nHow slight soever the disorder might appear in the daytime, at night the symptoms became greatly aggravated, and the feverish habit very much increased, nay, sometimes a delirium occurred on the very first night; and this exacerbation constantly returned through the whole course of the disease. Indeed, when it was considerably on the decline, our author says he has been often pretty much surprised to find his patient had passed the whole night in a phrensy, whom he had left tolerably cool and sedate in the day.\n\nSome few hours after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEIZURE\">seizure</a>, and sometimes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">contemporary</a> with it, a swelling and soreness of the throat was perceived, and the tonsils became very tumid and inflamed, and many times the parotid and maxillary glands swelled very much, and very suddenly, even at the very beginning; sometimes so much as even to threaten strangulation. The fauces also very soon appeared of a high florid red, or rather of a bright crimson, colour, very shining and glossy; and most commonly on the uvula, tonsils, velum palatinum, and back part of the pharynx, several whitish or ash-coloured spots appeared scattered up and down, which oftentimes increased very fast, and soon covered one or both the tonsils, uvula, &c.: these in the event proved sloughs of superficial ulcers (which sometimes, however, ate very deep into the parts). The tongue at this time, though only white and moist at the tip, was very foul at the root, and covered with a thick, yellowish or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> coat. The breath also now began to be very nauseous; which offensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a> increased hourly, and in some became at length intolerable, and that too sometimes even to the patients themselves.\n\nThe second or third day every symptom became much more aggravated, and the fever much more considerable; and those that had struggled with it tolerably well for 30 or 40 hours, were forced to submit. The restlessness and anxiety greatly increased, as well as the difficulty in swallowing. The head was very giddy, pained, and loaded; there was generally more or less of a delirium; sometimes a pervigilium and perpetual phrensy, though others lay very stupid, but often starting and muttering to themselves. The skin was very hot, dry, and rough; there was very rarely any disposition to sweat. The urine was pale, thin, crude; often yellowish and turbid. Sometimes vomiting was urgent, and sometimes a very great looseness, in children particularly. The sloughs were now much enlarged, and of a darker colour, and the surrounding parts tended much more to a livid hue. The breathing became much more difficult; with a kind of a rattling stertor, as if the patient was actually strangling, the voice being exceeding hoarse and hollow, exactly resembling that from venereal ulcers in the fauces: this noise in speaking and breathing was so peculiar, that any person in the least conversant with the disease might easily know it by this odd noise; from whence indeed the Spanish physicians gave it the name of garrotilla, expressing the noise made by persons when they are strangled with a rope. Dr Fothergill never observed in one of them the shrill <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARKING\">barking</a> noise that we frequently hear in inflammatory cynanche. The breath...\nbreath of all the diseased was very nauseous; of some insufferably fetid, especially in the advance of the distemper to a crisis; and many about the fourth or fifth day spit off a vast quantity of stinking purulent mucus tinged sometimes with blood: and sometimes the matter was quite livid, and of an abominable smell. The nostrils likewise in many were greatly inflamed and excoriated, continually dripping down a very sharp ichor or sanious matter, so excessively acrid, that it not only corroded the lips, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEEKS\">cheeks</a>, and hands of the children that laboured under the disease, but even the fingers and arms of the very nurses that attended them: as this ulceration of the nostrils came on, it commonly caused an almost incessant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SNEEZING\">sneezing</a> in the children; but few adults were affected with it, at least to any considerable degree. It was surprising what quantities of matter some children discharged this way, which they would often rub on their face, hands, and arms, and blister them all over. A sudden stoppage of this rheum from the mouth and nostrils actually choked several children; and some swallowed such quantities of it, as occasioned excoriations of the intestines, violent gripings, dysentery, &c. nay, even excoriations of the anus and buttocks. Not only the nostrils, fauces, &c. were greatly affected by the extremely sharp matter, but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>-pipe itself was sometimes much corroded by it, and pieces of its internal membrane were spit up, with much blood and corruption; and the patients lingered on for a considerable time, and at length died tabid; though there were more frequent instances of its falling suddenly and violently on the lungs, and killing in a peripneumonic manner.\n\nDr Huxham was astonished sometimes to see several swallow with tolerable ease, though the tumour of the tonsils and throat, the quantity of thick mucus, and the rattling noise in breathing, were very terrible; which he thinks pretty clearly shows, that this malignant angina was more from the acrimony and abundance of the humours than the violence of the inflammation.\n\nMost commonly the angina came on before the exanthemata; but many times the cuticular eruption appeared before the sore-throat, and was sometimes very considerable, though there was little or no pain in the fauces: on the contrary, a very severe angina seized some patients that had no manner of eruption; and yet, even in these cases, a very great itching and desquamation of the skin sometimes ensued; but this was chiefly in grown persons, very rarely in children. In general, however, a very considerable efflorescence broke out on the surface of the body, particularly in children; and it most commonly happened the second, third, or fourth day: sometimes it was partial, sometimes it covered almost the whole body, though very seldom the face: sometimes it was of an erysipelasous kind; sometimes more pustular: the pustules frequently eminent, and of a deep fiery red colour, particularly on the breast and arms; but oftentimes they were very small, and might be better felt than seen, and gave a very odd kind of roughness to the skin. The colour of the efflorescence was commonly of a crimson hue, or as if the skin had been smeared over with juice of raspberries, and this even to the fingers ends; and the skin appeared inflamed and swollen, as it were; the arms, hands, and fingers, were often evidently so, and very stiff, and somewhat painful. This crimson colour of the skin seemed indeed peculiar to this disease. Though the eruption seldom failed of giving some manifest relief to the patient, as to anxiety, sickness at stomach, vomiting, purging, &c. yet there was observed an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> fiery eruption on some persons, without the least abatement of the symptoms, nay almost every symptom seemed more aggravated, particularly the fever, load at breast, anxiety, and delirium; Dr Huxham knew more than one or two patients die in the most raging phrensy, covered with the most universal fiery rash he ever saw: so that, as in the highly confluent smallpox, it seemed only to denote the quantity of the disease, as he terms it.\n\nHe had under his care a young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>, about 12 years of age, whose tongue, fauces, and tonsils, were as black as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INK\">ink</a>, and he swallowed with extreme difficulty; he continually spit off immense quantities of a black, sanious, and very fetid matter, for at least eight or ten days:\u2014about the seventh day, his fever being somewhat abated, he fell into a bloody dysentery, though the bloody, sanious, fetid expectoration still continued, with a most violent cough. He at length indeed got over it, to the very great surprise of every one that saw him. Now, in this patient, a severe and universal rash broke out upon the second and third day; and the itching of his skin was so intolerable, that he tore it all over his body in a most shocking manner; yet this very great and timely eruption very little relieved his fever and phrensy, or prevented the other dreadful symptoms mentioned.\n\nAn early and kindly eruption, however, was most commonly a very good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OMEN\">omen</a>; and, when succeeded by a very copious desquamation of the cuticle, one of the most favourable symptoms that occurred: but when the eruption turned of a dusky or livid colour, or prematurely or suddenly receded, every symptom grew worse, and the utmost danger impended, especially if purple or black spots appeared up and down, as sometimes happened; the urine grew limpid, and convulsions came on, or a fatal suffocation soon closed the tragedy.\n\nThe disease was generally at the height about the fifth or sixth day in young persons, in the elder not so soon; and the crisis many times was not till the 11th or 12th, and then very imperfect; some adults however, were carried off in two or three days; the distemper either falling on the lungs, and killing in a peripneumonic manner; or on the brain, in which case the patient either died raving or comatose. In some, the disease brought on a very troublesome cough, purulent expectoration, haemoptoe, and hectic fever; in which they lingered on for several weeks, and then died tabid.\n\nIf a gentle easy sweat took place on the third or fourth day; if the pulse became more slow, firm, and equal; if the sloughs of the fauces <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> off in a kindly manner, and appeared at the bottom tolerably clean and florid; if the breathing was more soft and free, and some degree of vigour and quickness returned in the eyes; all was well, and a salutary crisis followed soon by a continuance of the sweat, and a turbid, subsiding, farinaceous urine, a plentiful expectoration, and a very large desquamation of the cuticle. But if a rigor came on, and the exanthemata suddenly disappeared or turned livid;\nlivid; if the pulse grew very small and quick, and the skin remained hot and parched as it were, the breathing more difficult, the eyes dead and glassy, the urine pale and limpid, a phrensy or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMA\">coma</a> succeeded, with a coldish clammy sweat on the face or extremities; life was despaired of, especially if a singultus and choking or gulping in the throat attended, with sudden, liquid, involuntary, livid stools, intolerably fetid. In some few patients, Dr Huxham observed, some time before the fatal period, not only the face bloated, sallow, shining and greasy as it were, but the whole neck very much swollen, and of a cadaverous look; and even the whole body became in some degree edematous; and the impression of a finger would remain fixed in a part, the skin not rising again as usual; an indication that the blood stagnated in the capillaries, and that the elasticity of the fibres was quite lost.\n\nMedical writers are still much divided in opinion, whether the cynanche maligna is to be considered as the same disease with the scarlatina anginosus, afterwards to be treated of, or not. This question will afterwards come to be more fully discussed. At present we may only observe, that although ulcerous sore throats of a malignant nature often appear sporadically, yet that the disease above described appears only as an epidemic, and is always the consequence of contagion.\n\nWe have, therefore, no doubt that the cynanche maligna of Huxham, Fothergill, and Cullen, is precisely the same disease with the scarlatina anginosus of Sauvage, Withering, and other late writers. This is abundantly demonstrated by the diversities which take place in the appearance of the disease among children of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> during the same epidemic.\n\nPrognosis. This may be easily gathered from the above description. The malignant and putrid tendency of the disease is evident, and an increase of the symptoms which arise from that putrescent disposition of the body must give an unfavourable prognostic. On the contrary, a decrease of these, and an apparent increase of the vis viva, are favourable: in general, what is observed to be favourable in the nervous and putrid malignant fevers, is also favourable in this, and vice versa.\n\nCauses. Since the accurate accounts given by Dr Fothergill and Huxham of the epidemics which prevailed about 50 years ago, this disease has frequently been observed at times epidemic in almost every different part of Britain. Like smallpox, measles, and cough, it seems in every case to be the effect of a peculiar and specific contagion. It has been observed to prevail, equally generally in every situation, and at every season; and on exposure to the contagion, no age, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEX\">sex</a>, or condition, is exempted from it. But the having once had the disease, seems in this affection to afford the same security against future contagion as in the smallpox: at least instances, where it can be said that the same individual has been twice affected with it, are both very rare and very doubtful, as well as in smallpox.\n\nCure. Like other febrile contagions, the malignant ulcerous sore throat is terminated only by a natural course; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> business of the practitioner is to combat unfavourable occurrences. In this the septic tendency of the disease is chiefly to be kept in view. The debility with which it is attended renders all evacuations by bleeding and purging improper, except in a few instances where the debility is less, and the inflammatory symptoms more considerable. The fauces are to be preserved from the effects of the acrid matter poured out upon them, and are therefore to be frequently washed out by antiseptic gargles or injections; and the putrescent state of the whole system should be guarded against and corrected by internal antiseptics, especially by the Peruvian bark given in the beginning and continued through the course of the disease. Great benefit is also often derived from the liberal use of the mineral acids. Both the sulphuric and muriatic, in a state of proper dilution, have been highly extolled by different medical writers, and are productive of the best effects in actual practice, when they can be introduced to a sufficient extent. In particular, the oxygenated muriatic acid, as recommended by Mr Braithwaite, has been found productive of the greatest advantages. Emetics, both by vomiting and nauseating, prove useful. When any considerable tumor occurs, blisters applied externally will be of service, and in any case may be proper to moderate the inflammation.\n\nVery lately, the internal use of the capsicum annum, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAYENNE\">Cayenne</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEPPER\">pepper</a>, as it is commonly called, has been highly celebrated in this affection; and it is particularly said to have been employed with singular success in the West Indies.\n\nBut of all the remedies lately proposed, none has been more highly extolled than the external use of cold water. It has even been contended by some that by dashing cold water on the surface of the body, an immediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> cure of this disease may be obtained. We are, however, fully persuaded, that cold water will no more destroy the contagion of this disease than of smallpox; and we cannot help thinking that the practice is seldom necessary, and sometimes hurtful.\n\nSp.

Argentorati 1778, et auctores ab eo allegati.\n\nThe best description of this disease we have in Dr Cullen's Practice of Physic. He informs us, that it consists in an inflammation of the glottis, larynx, or upper part of the trachea, whether it affect the membranes of these parts or the muscles adjoining. It may arise first in these parts, and continue to subsist in them alone; or it may come to affect these parts from the cynanche tonsillaris, or maligna, spreading into them.\n\nIn either way it has been a rare occurrence, and few instances of it have been marked and recorded by physicians. It is to be known by a peculiar croaking sound of the voice, by difficult respiration, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of straitening about the larynx, and by a pyrexia attending it.\n\nFrom the nature of these symptoms, and from the dissection of the bodies of persons who died of this disease, there is no doubt of its being of an inflammatory kind. It does not, however, always run the course of inflammatory affections; but frequently produces such an obstruction of the passage of the air, as suffocates, and thereby proves suddenly fatal.\n\nIt particularly proves fatal, in consequence of the trachea being obstructed by a membranous substance lining the inside of it, and very nearly approaching in appearance to the inflammatory exudation often discovered on the intestinal canal in those dying of enteritis.\n\nIf we judge rightly of the nature of this disease, it will be obvious, that the cure of it requires the most powerful remedies of inflammation to be employed upon the very first appearance of the symptoms. When a suffocation is threatened, whether any remedies can be employed to prevent it, is not yet determined by sufficient experience: but it is evident, that in certain cases the life of the patient can be preserved only by the removal of that matter which obstructs the passage of air through the trachea.\n\nThe accounts which books have hitherto given us of inflammations of the larynx, and the parts connected with it, amount to what we have now said; and many instances are recorded of the disease happening in adult persons: but there is a peculiar affection of this kind happening to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANTS\">infants</a>, which has been little taken notice of till lately. Dr Francis Home is the first who has given any distinct account of this disease; but, since he wrote, several other authors have taken notice of it, and have given different opinions concerning it.\n\nThis disease seldom attacks infants till after they have been weaned. After this period, the younger they are, the more liable they are to the disease. The frequency of it becomes less as children become more advanced; and there are few instances of children above 12 years of age being affected with it. It attacks children of the midland countries, as well as those who live near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>; but it occurs much more frequently at certain places than at others. It does not appear to be contagious; and its attacks are frequently repeated in the same child. It is often manifestly the effect of cold applied to the body; and cynanche therefore appears most frequently in the winter and spring seasons. It very commonly comes on with the ordinary symptoms of a catarrh; but sometimes the peculiar symptoms of the disease show themselves at the very first.\n\nThese peculiar symptoms are the following: A hoarseness, with some shrillness and ringing sound, both in speaking and coughing, as if the noise came from a brazen tube. At the same time, there is a sense of pain about the larynx, some difficulty of respiration, with a whizzing sound in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSPIRATION\">inspiration</a>, as if the passage of the air were straitened. The cough which attends it, is commonly dry; and if anything be spit up, it is matter of a purulent appearance, and sometimes films resembling portions of a membrane. With all these symptoms, there is a frequency of pulse, a restlessness, and an uneasy sense of heat. When the internal fauces are viewed, they are sometimes without any appearance of inflammation; but frequently a redness, and even swelling, appears; and sometimes there is an appearance of matter like to that rejected by coughing, together with the symptoms now described, and particularly with great difficulty of breathing, and a sense of strangling in the fauces, by which the patient is sometimes suddenly taken off.\n\nMany dissections have been made of infants who had died of this disease, and almost constantly there has appeared a preternatural substance, apparently membranous, lining the whole internal surface of the upper part of the trachea, and extending in the same manner downwards into some of its ramifications. This preternatural membrane may be easily separated, and sometimes has been found separated in part from the subjacent proper membrane of the trachea. This last is commonly found entire, that is, without any appearance of erosion or ulceration; but it frequently shows the vestiges of inflammation, and is covered by a matter resembling pus, like to that rejected by coughing; and very often a matter of the same kind is found in the bronchiae, sometimes in considerable quantity.\n\nFrom the remote causes of this disease; from the catarrhal symptoms commonly attending it; from the pyrexia constantly present with it; from the same kind of preternatural membrane being found in the trachea when the cynanche maligna is communicated to it; and from the vestiges of inflammation on the trachea discovered upon dissection; we must conclude, that this disease consists in an inflammatory affection of the mucous membrane of the larynx and trachea, producing an exudation analogous to that found on the surface of inflamed viscera, and appearing partly in a membranous crust, and partly in a fluid form resembling pus.\n\nThough this disease consists in an inflammatory affection, it does not commonly end either in suppuration or gangrene. The most troublesome circumstance of it seems to consist in a spasm of the muscles of the glottis, threatening suffocation.\n\nWhen this disease terminates in health, it is by resolution of the inflammation, by ceasing of the spasm of the glottis, by an expectoration of the matter exuding from the trachea, and of the crusts formed there,\nthere, and frequently it ends without any expectoration, or at least with such only as attends an ordinary catarrh. But in some instances, a salutary termination has very speedily taken place, in consequence of the discharge of the membranous substance from the trachea, even under its proper tubular form.\n\nWhen the disease ends fatally, it is by a suffocation seemingly depending upon a spasm affecting the glottis; but sometimes, probably, depending on a quantity of matter filling the bronchial or obstructing the trachea.\n\nAs we suppose the disease to be an inflammatory affection, so we attempt the cure of it by the usual remedies of inflammation. Bleeding, both general and topical, has often given immediate relief, and, by being repeated, has entirely cured the disease. Blistering also, near the part affected, has been found useful. Upon the first attack of the disease, vomiting, immediately after bleeding, seems to be of considerable use, and sometimes suddenly removes the disease. But emetics are still more useful in advanced periods. By the employment of these, the matter obstructing the trachea, and inducing spasmodic affections, has often been successfully removed, when the situation of the patient seemed to be almost desperate. And as in the progress of the disease fresh effusions of this matter are very apt to take place, the frequent repetition of emetics becomes necessary. It is often necessary to have recourse to those operating the most expeditiously, such as sulphate of zinc even in large doses. In every stage of the disease, the antiphlogistic regimen is necessary, and particularly the frequent use of laxative glysters. Some practitioners consider mercury, particularly under the form of calomel, as an almost infallible remedy in this disease. It has particularly been extolled by Mr James Anderson, an eminent surgeon in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>. But we are sorry to say that in some cases at least, after the fairest trial, it has been found to fail. Though we suppose that a spasm affecting the glottis is often fatal in this disease, antispasmodic medicines have not in general been found of great service. Some, however, have strongly recommended the use of asafoetida under the form of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INJECTION\">injection</a>; others place great confidence in oil or oily mixtures, taken by the mouth; but more immediate benefit is derived from tepid bathing, and the employment of sulphuric <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ETHER\">ether</a>, both externally and internally.\n\nBy these, when the disease is spasmodic, it is often successfully removed. But by much the most dangerous form of the disease is the inflammatory state giving the exudation. And when this inflammatory exudation has even been removed from the upper part of the trachea, yet it has sometimes proved fatal from the inflammation and exudation extending to the branches of the aspera arteria.

It is often epidemic, and manifestly contagious. It comes on with the usual symptoms of pyrexia, which is soon after attended with a considerable tumour of the external fauces and neck. The swelling appears first as a glandular moveable tumor at the corner of the lower jaw; but it soon becomes uniformly diffused over a great part of the neck, sometimes on one side only, but more commonly on both. The swelling continues to increase till the fourth day; but from that period it declines, and in a few days more goes off entirely. As the swelling of the fauces recedes, it not unfrequently happens that some tumor affects the testicles in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> sex, or the breasts in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a>. These tumors are sometimes large, hard, and somewhat painful; but are seldom either very painful or of long continuance. The pyrexia attending this disease is commonly slight, and goes off with the swelling of the fauces; but sometimes, when the swelling of the testicles does not succeed to that of the fauces, or when the one or the other has been suddenly repressed, the pyrexia becomes more considerable, is often attended with delirium, and has sometimes proved fatal.\n\nAs this disease commonly runs its course without either dangerous or troublesome symptoms, so it hardly requires any remedies. An antiphlogistic regimen, and avoiding cold, are all that will be commonly necessary. But when, upon the receding of the swellings, the pyrexia comes to be considerable, and threatens an affection of the brain, it will be proper, by warm fomentations, to bring back the swelling; and by vomiting, bleeding, or blistering, to obviate the consequences of its absence.\n\nGenus XI.

Pneumonic inflammation, however various in the seat, always discovers itself by pyrexia, difficult breathing, cough, and pain in some part of the thorax. It almost always comes on with a cold stage, and is accompanied with the other symptoms of pyrexia; though in some few instances the pulse may not be more frequent, nor the heat of the body increased beyond what is natural. Sometimes the pyrexia is from the beginning accompanied with the other symptoms; but frequently it is formed some hours before them, and particularly before the pain be felt. The pulse for the most part is frequent, full, strong, hard, and quick; but, in a few instances, especially in the advanced state of the disease, it is weak, soft, and at the same time irregular. The difficulty of breathing is most considerable in inspiration, both because the lungs do not easily admit of a full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DILATATION\">dilatation</a>, and because the dilatation increases the pain attending the disease. The difficulty of breathing is also greater when the patient is in one posture of the body rather than another. It is generally greater when he lies on the side affected; though sometimes the contrary happens. Very often the patient cannot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> upon either side, and can find ease only when lying on the back; and sometimes he cannot breathe readily, except when in somewhat of an erect posture. The cough, in different cases, is more or less urgent or painful. It is sometimes dry, or without any expectoration, especially in the beginning of the disease; but more commonly it is, even from the beginning, moist, and the matter spit up various both in consistence and colour, and frequently it is streaked with blood. The pain is also different in different cases, and felt in different parts of the thorax, but most frequently in one side. It has been said to affect the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> side more frequently than the left; but this is uncertain, and we are sure that the left side has been very often affected. Sometimes it is felt as if it was under the sternum; sometimes in the back between the shoulders; and when in the sides, its place has been higher or lower, more forward or backward; but the place of all most frequently affected is about the sixth or seventh rib, near the middle of its length, or a little more forward. The pain is often severe and pungent; but sometimes more dull and obtuse, with a sense of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> rather than of pain. It is most especially severe and pungent when occupying the place last mentioned. For the most part it continues fixed in one part, but sometimes shoots from the side to the scapula on one hand, or to the sternum and clavicle on the other.\n\nDr Cullen supposes that the disease is always seated, or at least begins, in some part of the pleura, taking that membrane in its greatest extent, as now commonly understood; that is, as covering not only the internal surface of the cavity of the thorax, but also as forming the mediastinum, and as extended over the pericardium, and over the whole surface of the lungs. But as the symptoms never clearly indicate where the seat of the disease is, there is but little foundation for the different names by which it has been distinguished. The term pleurisy is improperly limited to that inflammation which begins in and chiefly affects the pleura costalis. This Dr Cullen thinks is a rare occurrence; and that the pneumonia much more frequently begins in the pleura investing the lungs, producing all the symptoms which belong to what hath been called the pleuritis vera. The word <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIPNEUMONY\">peripneumony</a> has been applied to an inflammation beginning in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARENCHYMA\">parenchyma</a>, or cellular texture of the lungs, and having its seat chiefly there. But to Dr Cullen it seems very doubtful if any acute inflammation of the lungs, or any disease which has been called peripneumony, be of that kind. It seems probable,\nthat every acute inflammation begins in membranous parts; and in every dissection of persons who have died of peripneumony, the external membrane of the lungs, or some part of the pleura, has appeared to have been considerably affected. An inflammation of the pleura covering the upper surface of the diaphragm, has been distinguished by the appellation of paraphrenitis, as supposed to be attended with the peculiar symptoms of delirium, risus sardonicus, and other convulsive motions: but it is certain, that an inflammation of that portion of the pleura, and affecting also even the muscular substance of the diaphragm, has often taken place without any of the symptoms above mentioned; and neither the dissections which have fallen under Dr Cullen's observation, nor any accounts of dissections, support the opinion that an inflammation of the pleura covering the diaphragm is attended with delirium more commonly than any other pneumonic inflammation.\u2014It is to be observed, however, that though the inflammation may begin in one particular part of the pleura, the morbid affection is commonly communicated to the whole extent of the membrane.\n\nThe pneumonic inflammation, like others, may terminate by resolution, suppuration, or gangrene: but it has also a termination peculiar to itself; namely, when it is attended with an effusion of blood into the cellular texture of the lungs, which, soon interrupting the circulation of the blood through the viscera, produces a fatal suffocation. This indeed appears to be the most common termination of pneumonic inflammation when it ends fatally; for upon the dissection of almost every person who has died of this disease, it appears that such an effusion had happened. From the same dissections we learn, that pneumonic inflammation commonly produces an exudation from the internal surface of the pleura, which appears partly as a soft viscid crust, often of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a> membranous form, covering everywhere the surface of the pleura, and particularly those parts where the lungs adhere to the pleura costalis, or mediastinum; and this crust seems always to be the cement of such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ADHESION\">adhesion</a>. The same exudation shows itself also by a quantity of a serous fluid commonly found in the cavity of the thorax; and some exudation or effusion is usually found to have been made into the cavity of the pericardium. It seems likewise probable, that an effusion of this kind is sometimes made into the cavity of the bronchiae; for in some persons who have died after labouring under a pneumonic inflammation for a few days only, the bronchiae have been found filled with a considerable quantity of serous and thickish fluid, which must be considered rather as the effusion above mentioned, having had its thinner parts taken off by respiration, than as a pus so suddenly formed in the inflamed part. It is, however, not improbable, that this effusion, as well as that made into the cavities of the thorax and pericardium, may be a matter of the same kind with that which in other inflammations is poured into the cellular texture of the parts inflamed, and there converted into pus; but in the thorax and pericardium it does not always put on this appearance, because the crust covering the surface prevents the absorption of the thinner part. This absorption, however, may be compensated in the bronchiae, by the drying power of the air; and therefore the effusion into them may assume a more purulent appearance. In many cases of pneumonic inflammation, when the expectoration is very copious, it is difficult to suppose that the whole proceeds from the mucous follicles of the bronchiae; and it seems probable that a great part of it may come from the effused serum fluid just mentioned; and this too will account for the appearance of the expectoration being so often purulent. Perhaps the same thing will account for that purulent matter found in the bronchiae, which Mr de Haen says he had often observed when there was no ulceration in the lungs, and which he accounts for in a very strange manner, namely, by supposing a pus formed in the circulating blood.\n\nDr Cullen is of opinion, that the effusion into the bronchiae above mentioned often concurs with the effusion of red blood into the cellular substance of the lungs to occasion the fatal suffocation which frequently terminates peripneumony: that the effusion of serum alone may have this effect: and that the serum poured out in a certain quantity, rather than any debility in the powers of expectoration, is the cause of that cessation of spitting which precedes the fatal event; for in many cases the expectoration has ceased, when no other symptoms of debility have appeared, and when, upon dissection, the bronchiae have been full of liquid matter. Nay, it is even probable, that in some cases such an effusion may take place without any symptoms of violent inflammation; and in other cases the effusion taking place may seem to remove the symptoms of inflammation which had appeared before, and thus account for those unexpected fatal terminations which have sometimes happened.\n\nPneumonic inflammation seldom terminates by resolution, without being attended with some evident evacuation. An haemorrhagy from the nose happening on some of the first days of the disease has sometimes put an end to it; and it is said, that an evacuation from the hemorrhoidal veins, a bilious evacuation by stool, and an evacuation of urine with a copious sediment, have severally had the same effect; but such occurrences have been rare. The evacuation most frequently attending, and seeming to have the greatest effect in promoting resolution, is an expectoration of a thick, white, or yellowish matter, a little streaked with blood, copious, and brought up without much or violent coughing. Very frequently the resolution of this disease is attended with, and perhaps produced by, a sweat, if it be warm, fluid, copious, over the whole body, and attended with an abatement of the frequency of the pulse, heat of the body, and other febrile symptoms. Although, from the history now given, it appears that pleurisy and peripneumony cannot with propriety be considered as different diseases, yet it is certain that in different cases this affection occurs with an assemblage of symptoms separate and distinct. Thus even Dr Cullen himself, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOSOLOGY\">Nosology</a>, has defined pleuritis to consist in pyrexia, attended with pungent pain of the side, painful respiration, difficulty of lying down, particularly on the affected side, and distressing cough, in the beginning dry, but afterwards humid, and often with bloody expectoration. While again he has defined peripneumony to consist in pyrexia, attended with a dull pain under the sternum and between the shoulders, anxiety, difficulty of breathing, but\nmid cough, expectoration generally bloody, a soft pulse, and a tumid livid appearance of the countenance. It is highly probable, that the first of these sets of symptoms chiefly arises from a state of active inflammation, and the second from effusion. Thus, in certain cases, the symptoms may appear perfectly separate and distinct; but more frequently both inflammation and effusion are united; and thus the symptoms in both definitions are in general combined in the same patient. But still pleuritis, strictly so called, may be considered as characterized by the acute pungent pain at a particular spot of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEST\">chest</a>, and that pain much aggravated on a full inspiration; while proper peripneumonia is distinguished by the dull graveative pain extended over the whole chest, and by the laborious respiration.\n\nCauses of, and persons subject to, this disorder. The remote cause of pneumonic inflammation is commonly cold applied to the body, obstructing perspiration, and determining to the lungs, while at the same time the lungs themselves are exposed to the action of cold. These circumstances operate chiefly when an inflammatory diathesis prevails in the system; and therefore those principally affected with this disease are persons of the greatest vigour, in cold climates, often in the winter season, but particularly in the spring, when vicissitudes of heat and cold are frequent. The disease, however, may arise in any season when such varieties take place. Other remote causes also may have a share in producing this distemper; such as every means of obstructing, straining, or otherwise injuring, the pulmonary organs. The pneumonic inflammation has sometimes been so much an epidemic, that it hath been suspected of depending on a specific contagion; but Dr Cullen never met with an instance of its being contagious.\n\nPrognosis. In pneumatic inflammations, a violent pyrexia is always dangerous. The danger, however, is chiefly denoted by the difficulty of breathing. When the patient can lie on one side only; when he can lie on neither side, but only on his back; when he cannot breathe with tolerable ease, except when the trunk of his body is erect; when even in this posture the breathing is very difficult, and attended with a turgescence and flushing of the face, with partial sweats about the head and neck, and an irregular pulse; these circumstances mark the difficulty of breathing in different degrees; and consequently, in proportion, the danger of the disease. A frequent violent cough, aggravating the pain, is always the symptom of an obstinate disease; and as the disease is seldom or never resolved without some expectoration, so a dry cough must always be an unfavourable symptom.\n\nThe proper characteristics of the expectoration have been already laid down; and though an expectoration which has not these marks must indicate a doubtful state of the disease, yet the colour alone can give no certain prognostic. An acute pain, very much interrupting inspiration, is always the mark of a violent disease; but not of a more dangerous disease than an obtuse pain, attended with very difficult respiration, demonstrating effusion into the cells.\n\nWhen the pains, which had at first affected one side only, shall afterwards spread into the other; or when, leaving the side first affected, they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> entirely into the other; these are always marks of a dangerous disease.\n\nA delirium coming on during a pneumonic inflammation is always a symptom denoting much danger.\n\nWhen pneumonic disorders terminate fatally, it is on one or other of the days of the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>, from the third to the seventh. This is the most common case; but, in a few instances, death has happened at a later period. When the disease is violent, but admitting of resolution, this also happens frequently in the course of the first week; but in a more moderate disease the resolution is often put off to the second week. The disease generally suffers a remission on some of the days; from the third to the seventh: which, however, may be often fallacious, as it sometimes returns again with as much violence as before: and in such a case with great danger. Sometimes it disappears on the third day, while an erysipelas makes its appearance on some external part; and if this continue fixed, the pneumatic inflammation does not recur. If the disease continue beyond the 14th day, it will terminate in a suppuration, or PHthisis. The termination by gangrene is much more rare than has been imagined: and when it does occur, it is usually joined with the termination by effusion; the symptoms of the one being hardly distinguishable from those of the other.\n\nCure. This must proceed upon the general plan mentioned under SYNOCHA; but, on account of the importance of the part affected, the remedies must be employed early, and as fully as possible: and these are chiefly directed with one of three views, viz., for obtaining a resolution of the inflammation in the thorax, for mitigating the urgent symptoms before a resolution can be effected, and for counteracting or obviating the consequences of the disease. Venesection is the remedy chiefly to be depended on; and may be performed in either arm, as the surgeon finds most convenient; and the quantity taken away ought in general to be as large as the patient's strength will allow. The remission of pain, and the relief of respiration, during the flowing of the blood, may limit the quantity to be then drawn: but if these symptoms of relief do not appear, the bleeding should be continued to a considerable extent, unless symptoms of a beginning syncope come on. It is seldom that one bleeding, however large, will cure this disease; and though the pain and difficulty of breathing may be much relieved by the first bleeding, these symptoms commonly and after no long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> recur, often with as much violence as before. In this case the bleeding is to be repeated even on the same day, and perhaps to the same quantity as before. Sometimes the second bleeding may be larger than the first. There are persons, who, by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>, are ready to faint even upon a small bleeding; and in such persons this may prevent the drawing so much blood at first as a pneumonic inflammation may require: but as the same persons are found to bear after-bleedings better than the first, this allows the second and subsequent bleedings to be larger, and to such a quantity as the symptoms of the disease may seem to require.\n\nBleedings are to be repeated according to the state of the symptoms, and they will be more effectual when practised in the course of the first three days than afterwards; but they are not to be omitted though four days of the disease may already have elapsed. If the physician has not been called in time, or the first bleedings\nings have not been sufficiently large; or even though they should have procured some remission, yet upon the return of the urgent symptoms, bleeding may be repeated at any time within the first fortnight, or even after that period, if a suppuration be not evident, or if after a seeming solution the disease shall have returned.\n\nWith respect to the quantity of blood which may be taken away with safety, no general rules can be given; as it must be very different according to the state of the disease, and the constitution of the patient. In an adult male of tolerable strength, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> of blood is a full bleeding. Any quantity above 20 ounces is a large, and any quantity below 12 is a small, bleeding. An evacuation of four or five pounds, in the course of two or three days, is generally as much as most patients will bear; but if the intervals between the bleedings, and the whole of the time during which the bleedings have been employed, have been long, the quantity taken upon the whole may be greater.\n\nWhen a large quantity of blood has been taken from the arm, and it is doubtful if more can be taken in that manner with safety, some blood may still be taken by cupping and scarifying. This will especially be proper, when the recurrence of the pain, rather than the difficulty of breathing, becomes the urgent symptom; and then the cupping and scarification should be made as near as possible to the pained part.\n\nAn expectoration sometimes takes place very early in this disease; but if the symptoms continue urgent, the bleedings must be repeated notwithstanding the expectoration; but in a more advanced state, and when the symptoms have suffered a considerable remission, we may then trust the cure to the expectoration alone. It is not observed that bleeding, during the first days of the disease, stops expectoration; on the contrary, it has been often found to promote it; and it is only in a more advanced state of the disease, when the patient has been already exhausted by large evacuations and a continuance of his illness, that bleeding seems to put a stop to expectoration; and even then, this stoppage seems not to take place so much from the powers of expectoration being weakened by bleeding, as by its favouring the scrous effusion in the bronchiae, already taken notice of.\n\nBesides bleeding, every part of the antiphlogistic regimen ought here to be carefully employed; the patient must keep out of bed as much as he can bear; must have plenty of warm diluting drinks, impregnated with vegetable acids, accompanied with nitre or some other cooling neutral salt; and the belly also ought to be kept open by emollient clysters or cooling laxative medicines. Vomiting in the beginning is dangerous; but in a somewhat advanced state of the disease emetics have been found the best means of promoting expectoration. Fermentations and poultices to the pained part have been found useful; but blistering is found to be much more effectual. A blister, however, ought not to be applied till at least one bleeding has been premised, as venesection is less effectual when the irritation of a blister is present. If the disease be moderate, a blister may be applied immediately after the first bleeding; but in violent cases, where it may be presumed that a second bleeding may soon be necessary after the first, it will be proper to delay the blister till after the second bleeding, when it may be supposed that the irritation occasioned by the blister will be over before another bleeding becomes necessary.\n\nIt may frequently be of use in this disease to repeat the blistering; and in that case the plasters should always be applied somewhere on the thorax, for when applied to more distant parts they have less effect. The keeping the blistered parts open, and making what is called a perpetual blister, has much less effect than a repeated blistering.\n\nMany methods have been proposed for promoting expectoration, but none appear to be sufficiently effectual; and some of the expectorants, being acrid stimulant substances, are not very safe. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUMS\">gums</a> usually employed seem to be too heating; the squills less so; but they are not very powerful, and sometimes inconvenient, by the constant nausea they occasion. The volatile alkali may be of service as an expectorant, but it ought to be reserved for an advanced state of the disease. Mucilaginous and oily demulcents appear to be useful, by allaying that acrimony of the mucus which occasions too frequent coughing; and which coughing prevents the stagnation and thickening of the mucus, and thereby its becoming mild. The receiving into the lungs the steams of warm water, impregnated with vinegar, has often proved useful in promoting expectoration; and, for this purpose, the machine called the Inhaler, lately invented by Dr Mudge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLYMOUTH\">Plymouth</a>, promises to be of great service. But of all others, the antimonial emetics, given in nauseating doses, are perhaps the most powerful for promoting expectoration. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KERMES\">kermes</a> mineral has been greatly recommended; but does not seem to be more efficacious than tartrite of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTIMONY\">antimony</a> or antimonial wine; and the dose of the kermes is much more uncertain than that of the others.\n\nThough this disease often terminates by a spontaneous sweating, this evacuation ought not to be excited by art, unless with much caution. When, after some remission of the symptoms, spontaneous sweats arise, they may be encouraged; but it ought to be without much heat, and without stimulant medicines. If, however, the sweats be partial and clammy only, and a great difficulty of breathing still remain, it will be very dangerous to encourage them.\n\nPhysicians have differed much with regard to the use of opiates in pneumonic affections. It appears, however, that in the beginning of the disease, and before bleeding and blistering have produced some remission of the pain, and of the difficulty of breathing, opiates have had a bad tendency, by their increasing the difficulty of breathing and other inflammatory symptoms. But in a more advanced state of the disease, when the difficulty of breathing has abated, and when the urgent symptom is a cough, proving the chief cause of the continuance of pain and want of rest, opiates may be employed with great advantage and safety. The interruption of the expectoration which they seem to occasion, is for a short time only; and they seem often to promote it, as they occasion a stagnation of what was by frequent coughing dissipated insensibly; and therefore give the appearance of what physicians called concocted matter.\n\nOpium combined with calomel has of late been highly extolled in this and other inflammatory diseases by Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAMILTON\">Hamilton</a> of Lynn Regis; who has given a full account\nVomica, or Abscess of the Lungs.\n\nVomica, Boerh. 835. Junck. 35.\nPleurodyne vomica, Saur. sp. 21.\n\nPhthisis sometimes follows pneumonia, though the case is not frequent. The symptoms of it so much resemble ordinary phthisis, that it can most properly be treated of under that head.\n\nEmpyema.\n\nThis is another consequence of a pneumonia terminating unfavourably, and is occasioned by the effusion of a quantity of purulent matter into the cavity of the thorax, producing a lingering and painful disorder, very often incurable.\n\nDescription. The first sign of an empyema is a cessation of the pain in the breast, which before was continual; this is followed by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a> of weight on the diaphragm; and a fluctuation of matter, sometimes making a noise that may be heard by the bystanders; the acute fever is changed into a hectic, with an exacerbation at night; a continual and troublesome dry cough remains. The respiration is exceedingly difficult, because the lungs are prevented by the matter from fully expanding themselves. The patient can lie easily on that side where the matter is effused, but not on the other, because then the weight of the matter on the mediastinum produces uneasiness. The more the hectic heat is augmented, the more is the body emaciated, and its strength decayed. In some there is danger of suffocation when they stoop down, which goes off when they alter that posture of the body; and in some there is a purulent spitting.\u2014These symptoms are accompanied with great anxiety, palpitations of the heart, and faintings. Sometimes the patients have a sensation like a hot vapour ascending from the cavity of the thorax to their mouth. Others, in a more advanced state of the disease, have a putrid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> in the mouth. At the same time, profuse night sweats waste the body, and greatly weaken the patient. The face at first grows red on that side where the matter lies, at last the Hippocratic face comes on, and the eyes become hollow. The pulse is quick, but more frequently intermittent. Sometimes the nails are crooked, and pustules appear on the thorax; and frequently, according to the testimony of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HIPPOCRATES\">Hippocrates</a>, the feet swell, and, on the affected side of the breast, there is an inflation and swelling of the skin.\n\nCauses, &c. An empyema may arise either from the bursting of a vomica of the lungs, or from a suppuration taking place after the inflammatory stage of pneumonia; or sometimes from a suppuration in the case of a quinsy, when the inflammation had extended to the aspera arteria, from whence arises a kind of bloody spittle, and the patients are afflicted with an empyema, unless they die on the 7th day of the disease, according to the observation of Hippocrates. It may arise also from external violence, as wounds of the thorax, &c., blood extravasated, corrupted, or changed into pus.\n\nLike the vomica, it is a rare distemper, but may attack Peritonitis, all those subject to pneumonia.\n\nPrognosis. Very few recover after an empyema has been once formed, especially if the operation of paracentesis be neglected. After this operation is performed, if a great quantity of bloody fetid pus be discharged, if the fever continue, and if the patient spit up a purulent, pale, frothy, livid, or green matter, with a decay of strength, there is no hope: But when a small quantity of pus, of a white colour, not very fetid, is discharged; when the fever and thirst presently cease, the appetite returns, and feces of a good consistence are discharged, the strength also returning in some degree; there is then hope of a perfect recovery. If the matter be not dried up in seven weeks time, the disease readily changes to a fistulous ulcer, which is very difficult to cure. An empyema affecting both sides of the thorax is more dangerous than that which affects only one.\n\nCure. This consists in evacuating the purulent matter contained in the cavity of the thorax, which is best done by the operation of paracentesis of the thorax. See Surgery. Afterwards the ulcer is to be treated with abistergent and consolidating medicines, and the same internal ones are to be given as in a Phthisis.\n\nGenus XIII.

This disease is attended with all the symptoms of pneumonia, but in a higher degree; it is besides said to be accompanied with hydrophobic symptoms, fainting, palpitation of the heart, a seeming madness, a sunk and irregular pulse, watery eyes, and a dejected countenance, with a dry and black tongue. On dissection, the heart and pericardium are found very much inflamed, and even ulcerated, with many polypous concretions.\n\nCauses, &c. The same as in the pneumonia.\n\nPrognosis. In the carditis the prognosis is more unfavourable than in the pneumonia; and indeed, unless the disease very quickly terminates, it must prove fatal, on account of the constant and violent motion of the heart, which exasperates the inflammation, and increases all the symptoms.\n\nCure. Here bleeding is necessary in as great a degree as the patient can possibly bear, together with blistering, and the antiphlogistic regimen likewise carried to a greater height than in the pneumonia; but the general method is the same as in other inflammatory diseases.\n\nGenus XIV.

The inflammation of the stomach is attended with great heat and pain in the epigastric region, extreme anxiety, an almost continual and painful hiccup, with a most painful vomiting of everything taken into the stomach. Sometimes a temporary madness ensues; and there is an instance in the Edinburgh Medical Essays of the disorder being attended with an hydrophobia. The pulse is generally more sunk than in other inflammations, and the fever inclines to the nature of a typhus. The disorder is commonly of the remitting kind, and during the remissions the pulse frequently intermits. During the height of the disease, a mortal phrensy frequently supervenes. The disease terminates on the fourth, seventh, or ninth day; or from the eleventh to the fifteenth; and is more apt to end in a gangrene than pneumonic inflammations, and more frequently in a scirrhus than in an abscess.\n\nCauses, &c. The inflammation of the stomach may arise from any acrid substance taken into it; from a vehement <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>, too large draughts of cold liquor, especially when the person is very hot; from a surfeit; a stoppage of perspiration; repulsion of the gout; inflammations of the neighbouring viscera; or from external injuries, such as wounds, contusions, &c.\u2014It affects chiefly those of a plethoric habit and hot bilious constitution.\n\nPrognosis. This disease is always very dangerous, and the prognosis doubtful, which also must always be in proportion to the severity of the symptoms. A cessation of pain, coldness about the precordia, great debility, with a languid and intermitting pulse, with an abatement of the hiccup, denote a gangrene and speedy death. From the sensibility of the stomach also, and its great connexion with the rest of the system, it must be obvious, that an inflammation of it, by whatever causes produced, may be attended with fatal consequences; particularly, by the great debility it produces, it may prove suddenly fatal, without running through the usual course of inflammations.\u2014Its tendency to admit of resolution may be known by its having arisen from no violent cause, by the moderate state of the symptoms, and by a gradual remission of these symptoms in the course of the first or at most of the second week of the disease. The tendency to gangrene may be suspected from the symptoms continuing with unremitting violence, notwithstanding the use of proper remedies; and a gangrene already begun may be known by the symptoms above mentioned, particularly great debility and sudden cessation of pain. The tendency to suppuration may be known by the symptoms continuing but in a moderate degree for more than one or two weeks, and by a considerable remission of the pain, while a sense of weight and anxiety still remain. When an abscess has been formed, the frequency of the pulse is first abated; but soon after it increases, with frequent cold shivering, and an exacerbation in the afternoon and evening; followed by night sweats, and other symptoms of hectic fever. These at length prove fatal, unless the abscess open into the cavity of the stomach, the pus be evacuated by vomiting, and the ulcer soon healed.\n\nCure. It appears from dissections, that the stomach may very often be inflamed when the characteristic marks of it have not appeared; and therefore we are often exposed to much uncertainty in the cure. But when we have sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> that a state of active inflammation has taken place in the stomach, the principal object to be aimed at is to obtain a resolution. Before, however, this can be accomplished, it will often be necessary to employ <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> with the view of obviating urgent symptoms. When the symptoms appear in the manner above described, the cure is to be attempted by large and repeated bleedings employed early in the disease; and from these we are not to be deterred by the weakness of the pulse, for it will commonly become fuller and softer after the operation. A blister ought also to be applied to the region of the stomach; and the cure will be assisted by fomentations of the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ABDOMEN\">abdomen</a>, and by frequent emollient and laxative clysters. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRRITABILITY\">irritability</a> of the stomach in this disease will admit of no medicines being thrown into it; and if any can be supposed necessary, they must be exhibited in clysters. Diluting drinks may be tried; but they must be of the very mildest kind, and given in very small quantities at a time. Opiates, in whatever manner exhibited, cannot be retained in the stomach during the first days of the disease; but when the violence of the disease shall have abated, and when the pain and vomiting recur at intervals only, opiates given in clysters are frequently employed with advantage; and after bleeding and blisters no remedy is more effectual either in allaying the pain or vomiting. As soon as the stomach will retain any laxative, gentle refrigerant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHARTICS\">cathartics</a>, taken by the mouth, such as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SODA\">soda</a> phosphorata, soda tartarissata, or the like, are\nare productive of great benefit. A tendency to gangrene in this disease is to be obviated only by the means just now mentioned; but when it does actually supervene, it admits of no remedy. A tendency to suppuration is to be obviated by the same means employed early in the disease. After a certain period it cannot be prevented by any means whatever; and, when actually begun, must be left to nature; the only thing that can be done by art being to avoid all irritation.\n\nB. Gastritis Erysipelatosa, or the Erysipelasous Gastritis.\n\nDescription. This species of inflammation takes place in the stomach much more frequently than the former. From dissections it appears that the stomach has been often affected with inflammation, when neither pain nor fever had given any notice of it; and such is justly looked upon to have been of the erysipelasous kind. This kind of inflammation also is especially to be expected from acrimony of any kind applied to the stomach; and would certainly occur much more frequently, were not the interior surface of this organ commonly defended by mucus exuding in large quantity from the numerous follicles placed immediately under the villous coat. On many occasions, however, the exudation of mucus is prevented, or the liquid poured out is of a less viscid kind, so as to be less fitted to defend the subjacent nerves; and it is in such cases that acrid matters may readily produce an erysipelasous affection of the stomach.\n\nIn many cases this kind of inflammation cannot be discovered, as it takes place without pain, pyrexia, or vomiting; but in some it may; namely, when it spreads into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OESOPHAGUS\">oesophagus</a>, and appears on the pharynx and on the whole internal surface of the mouth. When therefore an erysipelasous inflammation affects the mouth and fauces, and there shall be at the same time in the stomach an unusual sensibility to all acids, and also a frequent vomiting, there can be little doubt of the stomach's being affected in the same manner. Even when no inflammation appears in the fauces, if some degree of pain be felt in the stomach, if there be a want of appetite, an anxiety and frequent vomiting, an unusual sensibility with regard to acids, some thirst, and frequency of pulse, there will then be room to suspect an inflammation in the stomach; and such symptoms, after some time, have been known to discover their cause by the inflammation rising to the fauces or mouth. Inflammation of this kind is often disposed to pass from one place to another on the same surface, and, in doing so, to leave the place it had at first occupied. Such an inflammation has been known to spread successively along the whole tract of the alimentary canal; occasioning, when in the intestines, diarrhoea, and in the stomach vomitings; the diarrhoea ceasing when the vomitings came on, and the vomitings on the coming on of the diarrhoea.\n\nCauses, &c. An erysipelasous inflammation may arise from acrid matters taken into the stomach; or from some internal causes not yet well known. It frequently occurs in putrid diseases, and in those recovering from fevers.\n\nCure. When the disease is occasioned by acrid matters taken internally, and these may be supposed still present in the stomach, they are to be washed out by drinking a large quantity of warm and mild medicines, and exciting gentle vomiting. At the same time, if the nature of the acrimony and its proper corrector be known, this should be thrown in; or if a specific corrector be not known, some general demulcents should be employed.\n\nThese measures, however, are more suited to prevent than to cure inflammation after it has taken place. When this last may be supposed to have happened, if it be attended with a sense of heat, with pain and pyrexia, according to the degree of these symptoms, the measures proposed for the cure of the other kind are to be more or less employed. When an erysipelasous inflammation of the stomach has arisen from internal causes, if pain and pyrexia occur, bleeding may be employed in persons not otherwise weakened; but in case of its occurring in putrid diseases, or where the patients are already debilitated, bleeding is inadmissible; all that can be done being to avoid irritation, and only throwing into the stomach what quantity of acids and acetic aliments it shall be found able to bear. In some conditions of the body in which this disease is apt to occur, cinchona and bitters may seem to be indicated; but an erysipelasous state of the stomach will seldom allow them to be used.\n\nGenus XVI. ENTERITIS.\n\nInflammation of the Intestines.\n\nEnteritis, Sauv. gen. 105. Lin. 29. Vog. 57. Sag. gen. 307.\nIntestinorum inflammatio, Boerh. 959.\nFebris intestinorum inflammatoria ex mesenterio, Hoffm. ii. 170.\n\nSp. I. Enteritis Phlegmonodes, or the Acute Enteritis.\n\nEnteritis iliaca, Sauv. sp. i.\nEnteritis colica, Sauv. sp. 2. Boerh. 963.\n\nDescription. This disease shows itself by a fixed pain in the abdomen, attended with fever, vomiting, and costiveness. The pain is often felt in different parts of the abdomen, but more frequently spreads over the whole, and is particularly violent about the navel.\n\nCauses, &c. Inflammations of the intestines may arise from the same causes as those of the stomach; though commonly the former will more readily occur from cold applied to the lower extremities, or to the belly itself. It is also found supervening on the spasmodic colic, incarcerated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERNIA\">hernia</a>, and volvulus.\n\nPrognosis. Inflammations of the intestines have the same terminations with those of the stomach, and the prognosis in both cases is much the same.\n\nCure. The cure of enteritis is in general the same with that of gastritis; but in this disease there is commonly more opportunity for the introduction of liquids, of acid, acetic, and other cooling remedies, and even of laxatives; but as a vomiting frequently attends the enteritis, care must be taken not to excite that vomiting by the quantity or quality of anything thrown into the stomach. With regard to the suppuration...\nConcerning this nothing farther can be said, than what hath been already delivered concerning the gastritis.\n\nGENUS XVII. HEPATITIS.\n\nInflammation of the Liver.\n\nHepatitis, Sauv. gen. 113. Lin. 35. Vog. 58. Sag. gen. 312. Boehr. 914. Hoffm. ii. 14. Junck. 66.\n\nDescription. The inflammation of the liver is thought to be of two kinds, acute and chronic; but the latter very often does not discover itself except by an abscess found in the liver after death, and which is supposed to have been occasioned by some degree of inflammation; for this reason the chronic inflammation often escapes observation, and we shall here only treat of the acute hepatitis.\n\nThe acute hepatitis is attended with considerable fever; a frequent, strong, and hard pulse; high coloured urine; an acute pain in the right hypochondrium, increased by pressing upon the part. The pain is very often in such a part of the side as to make it appear like a pleurisy; and frequently, like that, is increased on inspiration. The disease is also commonly attended with a cough, which is generally dry, though sometimes moist; and when the pain thus resembles a pleurisy, the patient cannot lie easily except upon the side affected. The pain is frequently extended to the clavicle, and to the top of the shoulder; and is attended sometimes with hiccupping, and sometimes with vomiting. Some have added <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JAUNDICE\">jaundice</a>, or a yellowness of the eyes, to the symptoms of this distemper; but experience shows that it has often occurred without any such symptom.\n\nWhen hepatitis is of the chronic kind, depending more on an accumulation and effusion in the liver, than on an increased action of its small vessels, the patient complains rather of a sense of weight than of pain; and the fever is by no means either acute or constant; but it often returns in paroxysms somewhat resembling the attacks of an intermittent. This disease is very slow in its progress, frequently continuing for many months, and at last terminating in a very considerable suppuration. In most cases, however, it may be discovered by careful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of the region of the liver externally. By this means a considerable enlargement of that viscus may in general be detected.\n\nCauses, &c. The remote causes of hepatitis are not always to be discerned, and many have been assigned on a very uncertain foundation. It is principally a disease of warm climates. It has been supposed that the disease may be an affection either of the extremities of the hepatic artery, or those of the vena portarum; and the supposition is by no means improbable. The opinion, however, most commonly adopted is, that the acute hepatitis is an affection of the external membrane of the liver, and the chronic kind an affec-\nin different cases, under various forms. Some are very fond of the use of calomel. But the preference in general given, and perhaps with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, to friction with mercurial ointment over the region of the liver. But under whatever form it may be employed, it is necessary that it should be introduced to such an extent as to keep the patient on the verge of salivation for some length of time; the duration being regulated by the circumstances of the case.\n\nFrom the liberal use of mercury, there can be no doubt that a successful resolution has been obtained in many cases, which would otherwise have infallibly terminated in suppuration. But notwithstanding the most careful employment of it in some cases, suppuration will ensue; and then it is very doubtful whether any benefit will be derived from the continuance of it. But when a suppuration has been formed, and the abscess points outwardly, the part must be opened, the pus evacuated, and the ulcer healed according to the ordinary methods in use for healing abscesses and ulcers in other parts.\n\nChronic hepatitis often terminates in scirrhus. Against this, after mercury has failed, nitric acid taken internally has sometimes been employed with success.\n\n**GENUS XVIII. SPLENITIS.**\n\n*Inflammation of the Spleen.*\n\nSplenitis, Sauv. gen. 114. Lin. 36. Vog. 59. Junck. 67. Sag. gen. 313.\n\nLienis inflammatio, Boerh. 958. et Van Swieten, Comm.\n\nSplenitis phlegmonodica, Sauv. sp. 1. Forest, l. xx. obs. 5, 6. De Haen, apud Van Swieten, p. 958.\n\nPleuritis splenica, Sauv. sp. 3.\n\nSplenaalgia suppuratoria, Sauv. sp. 3.\n\n**Description.** This disease, according to Juncker, comes on with a remarkable shivering, succeeded by a most intense heat and very great thirst; a pain and tumour are perceived in the left hypochondrium, and the paroxysms for the most part assume a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTAN\">quartan</a> form. When the patients expose themselves for a little to the free air, their extremities immediately grow very cold. If a hemorrhage happens, the blood flows out of the left nostril. The other symptoms are the same with those of the hepatitis. Like the liver, the spleen is also subject to a chronic inflammation, which often happens after agues; and the tumour which succeeds the inflammation is in many cases very considerable, and is called the *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGUE\">ague</a> cake*, though that name is also frequently given to a scirrhouss tumour of the liver succeeding intermittents.\n\n**Causes, &c.** The causes of this distemper are in general the same with those of other inflammatory disorders; but those which determine the inflammation to that particular part more than another, are very much unknown. It attacks persons of a very plethoric and sanguine habit of body rather than others.\n\n**Prognosis.** What has been said of the inflammation of the liver applies also to that of the spleen, though the latter is less dangerous than the former. Here also a vomiting of black matter, which in other acute diseases is such a fatal symptom, sometimes proves critical, according to the testimony of Juncker. Sometimes the hemorrhoids prove critical; but very often the inflammation terminates by scirrhus.\n\n**Cure.** This is not at all different from what has been already laid down concerning the hepatitis.\n\n**GENUS XIX. NEPHRITIS.**\n\n*Inflammation of the Kidneys.*\n\nNephritis, Sauv. gen. 115. Lin. 37. Vog. 65. Sag. gen. 314.\n\nNephritis vera, Sauv. sp. 1.\n\n**Description.** The nephritis has the same symptoms which take place in other inflammations; but its distinguishing mark is the pain in the region of the kidney, which is sometimes obtuse, but more frequently pungent. The pain is not increased by the motion of the trunk of the body so much as a pain of the rheumatic kind affecting the same region. It may also frequently be distinguished by the pain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHOOTING\">shooting</a> along the course of the ureter, and it is often attended with a drawing-up of the testicle, and a numbness of the limb on the side affected; though indeed these symptoms most commonly attend the inflammation arising from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CALCULUS\">calculus</a> in the kidney or ureter. The disease is also attended with frequent vomiting, and often with costiveness and colic pains. The urine is most commonly of a deep red colour, and is voided frequently and in a small quantity at a time. In more violent cases the urine is commonly colourless.\n\n**Causes, &c.** The remote causes of this disease may be various; as external <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTUSION\">contusion</a>, violent or long-continued riding; strains of the muscles of the back incumbent on the kidneys; various acids in the course of circulation conveyed to the kidneys; and perhaps some other internal causes not yet well known: the most frequent is that of calculous matter obstructing the *tubuli uriniferi*, or calculi formed in the pelvis of the kidneys, and either sticking there or falling into the ureter.\n\n**Prognosis.** This is not different from that of other inflammatory diseases.\n\n**Cure.** When any of those causes operating as inducing the inflammation still continue to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a>, the first object in the cure must be the removal of these; but the principal intention to be had in view, is the resolution of the inflammation which has already taken place. But when, notwithstanding efforts for this purpose, the disease terminates in suppuration, it must be the endeavour of the practitioner to promote the discharge of the purulent matter, and the healing of the ulceration in the kidney.\n\nThese different objects are principally accomplished by bleeding, external fomentation, frequent emollient cloths, antiphlogistic purgatives, and by the free use of mild and demulcent liquids. The use of blisters is scarce admissible, or at least will require great care to avoid any considerable absorption of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CANTHARIDES\">cantharides</a>.\n\nThe other species of nephritis enumerated by authors are only symptomatic.\nGENUS XX. CYSTITIS.\n\nInflammation of the Bladder.\n\nCystitis, Sauv. gen. 108. Lin. 31. Vog. 66.

When the disease arises from the internal use of these flies, camphor is recommended, besides other cooling medicines, and particularly cooling and emollient elysters.\n\nGENUS XXI. HYSTERITIS.\n\nInflammation of the Uterus.\n\nHysteritis, Lin. 38. Vog. 63.\nMetritis, Sauv. gen. 107. Sag. gen. 315.\nInflammatio et febris uterina, Hoffm. II. 156.\n\nDescription. This disease is often confounded with that called the puerperal or child-bed fever; but is essentially distinct from it, as will be shown in its proper place. The inflammation of the uterus is often apt to terminate by gangrene: there is a pain in the head, with delirium; and the uterine region is so exceedingly tender, that it cannot bear the most gentle pressure without intolerable pain. When the fundus uteri is inflamed, there is a great heat, throbbing, and pain, above the pubes; if its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POSTERIOR\">posterior</a> part, the pain is more confined to the loins and rectum, with a tenesmus; if its anterior part, it shoots from thence towards the neck of the bladder, and is attended with a frequent irritation to make water, which is voided with difficulty; and if its sides or the ovaria are affected, the pains will then dart into the inside of the thighs.\n\nCauses, &c. Inflammations of the uterus, and indeed of the rest of the abdominal viscera, are very apt to take place in child-bed women; the reason of which seems to be the sudden change produced in the habit, and an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> in the course of the circulating blood by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a> of the uterus after delivery. The pressure of the gravid uterus being suddenly taken off from the aorta descendens after delivery, the resistance to the impulse of the blood passing through all the vessels derived from it, and distributed to the contiguous viscera, will be considerably lessened: it will therefore rush into those vessels with a force superior to their resistance; and, by putting them violently on the stretch, may occasion pain, inflammation, and fever. This contraction of the uterus also renders its vessels impervious to the blood which had freely passed through them for the service of the child during pregnancy; and consequently a much larger quantity will be thrown upon the contiguous parts, which will still add to their distention, and increase their tendency to rheumatic inflammation.\n\nPrognosis. An inflammation of the uterus may in general be expected to produce an obstruction of the lochia; but the fever produced seldom proves fatal, unless the inflammation be violent, and end in a gangrene.\n\nCure. This is to be attempted by the same general means already recommended, and the management of this disorder entirely coincides with that of the puerperal fever.\n\nGENUS XXII.

Very often they shoot along the course of the muscles from one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> to another, and are always much increased by the action of the muscles belonging to the joint or joints affected. The larger joints are those most frequently affected, such as the hip-joint and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-KNEES\">knees</a>, of the lower extremities, and the shoulders and elbows of the upper ones. The ankles and wrists are also frequently affected; but the smaller joints, such as those of the toes or fingers, seldom suffer. Sometimes the disease is confined to one part of the body, yet very frequently it affects many parts; and then it begins with a cold stage, which is immediately succeeded by the other symptoms of pyrexia, and particularly by a frequent, full, and hard pulse. Sometimes the pyrexia is formed before any pains are perceived; but more commonly pains are felt in particular parts before any symptoms of fever occur. When no pyrexia is present, the pain may be confined to one joint only; but when any considerable pyrexia takes place, though the pain may chiefly be felt in one joint, yet it seldom happens that it does not affect several joints, often at the very same time, but for the most part shifting their place, and having abated in one joint they become more violent in another. They do not commonly remain long in the same joint, but frequently shift from one to another, and sometimes return to joints formerly affected; and in this manner the disease often continues for a long time. The fever attending these pains has an exacerbation every evening, and is most considerable during the night, when the pains also become more violent; and it is at the same time that the pains shift their place from one joint to another. These seem to be also increased during the night by the body being covered more closely, and kept warmer.\n\nA joint, after having been for some time affected with pain, commonly becomes also affected with some swelling and redness, which is painful to the touch. It seldom happens that a swelling coming on does not take off the pain entirely, but it rarely secures the joint against a return of it. This disease is commonly attended with more or less sweating, which occurs early, but is seldom free or copious, and seldom proves critical, though it may give temporary relief of the pain. The urine is high-coloured, and in the beginning without sediment. This, however, does not prove entirely critical, for the disease often continues long after such a sediment has appeared in the urine. The blood is always sity. The acute rheumatism differs from all other inflammatory diseases, in not being liable to terminate in suppuration: this almost never happens; but the disease sometimes produces effusions of a transparent gelatinous fluid into the sheaths of the tendons: but if these effusions be frequent, it is certain that the liquor must often be absorbed; for it very seldom happens, that considerable or permanent tumours have been produced, or such as required to be opened and to have the rheumatic-contained fluid evacuated. Such tumours, however, have sometimes occurred, and the opening made in them has produced ulcers very difficult to heal.\n\nSometimes rheumatism will continue for several weeks; but it seldom proves fatal, and it is rare that the pyrexia continues to be considerable for more than two or three weeks. While the pyrexia abates in its violence, if the pains of the joints continue, they are less violent; more limited in their place, being confined commonly to one or a few joints only; and are less ready to change their place.\n\nIt is often a very difficult matter to distinguish rheumatism from gout: but in rheumatism there in general occurs much less affection of the stomach; it affects chiefly the larger joints, and several of these are often affected with severe pain at the same time: it occurs at an earlier period of life than gout; it is not observed to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a>; and it can in general be traced to some obvious exciting cause, particularly to the action of cold.\n\nCauses, &c. This disease is frequent in cold, and more uncommon in warm climates. It appears most frequently in autumn and spring; less frequently in winter, while the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FROST\">frost</a> is constant; and very seldom during the heat of summer. It may, however, occur at any season, if vicissitudes of heat and cold be for the time frequent. For the most part, the acute rheumatism arises from the application of cold to the body when unusually warm; or when the cold is applied to one part of the body, whilst the other parts are kept warm; or, lastly, when the application of the cold is long continued, as when moist or wet clothes are applied to any part of the body.\u2014These causes may affect persons of all ages; but the rheumatism seldom appears either in very young or in elderly persons, and most commonly occurs from the age of puberty to that of 35. These causes may also affect persons of any constitution, but they most commonly affect those of a sanguine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEMPERAMENT\">temperament</a>.\n\nWith respect to the proximate cause of rheumatism, there have been various opinions. It has been imputed to a peculiar acrimony; of which, however, there is no evidence; and the consideration of the remote causes, the symptoms, and cure, render it very improbable. A disease of a rheumatic nature, however, may be occasioned by an acrid matter applied to the nerves, as is evident from the toothach, a rheumatic affection generally arising from a carious tooth. Pains arising from deep-seated suppurations may also resemble the rheumatism; and many cases have occurred in which such suppurations occasioned pains resembling the lumbago and ischias; but from what has been already said, it seems improbable that ever any pure rheumatic case should end in suppuration.\n\nThe proximate cause of rheumatism has by many been supposed to be a lender in the fluids obstructing the vessels of the part; but in the observations formerly made, sufficient reasons have been already laid down for rejecting the doctrine of lender. While we cannot therefore find either evidence or reason for supposing that the rheumatism depends on any change in the state of the fluids, we must conclude that the proximate cause of it is the same with that of other inflammations not depending upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> stimulus.\nIn the case of rheumatism, it is supposed that the most common remote cause of it, that is, cold applied, operates especially on the vessels of the joints, these being less covered by a cellular texture than those of the intermediate parts of the limbs. It is farther supposed, that the application of cold produces a constriction of the extreme vessels, and at the same time an increase of tone or phlogistic diathesis in the course of them, from which arises an increased impetus of the blood, and at the same time a resistance to the free passage of it, and consequently inflammation and pain. It is also supposed, that the resistance formed excites the vis medicatrix to a further increase of the impetus of the blood; and to support this, a cold stage arises, a spasm is formed, and a pyrexia and phlogistic diathesis are produced in the whole system.\n\nHence the cause of rheumatism appears to be exactly analogous to that of inflammations depending on an increased afflux of blood to a part while it is exposed to the action of cold. But there seems to be further in this disease some peculiar affection of the muscular fibres. These seem to be under some degree of rigidity; and therefore less easily admit of motion, and are pained upon the exertions of it. This also seems to be the affection which gives opportunity to the propagation of pains from one joint to another, and which are most severely felt in the extremities terminating in the joints, because beyond these the oscillations are not propagated. This affection of the muscular fibres explains the manner in which strains and spasms produce rheumatic affections; and, on the whole, shows, that with an inflammatory affection of the sanguiferous system, there is also in rheumatism a peculiar affection of the muscular fibres, which has a considerable share in producing the phenomena of the disease. And it would even appear, that in what has commonly been called acute rheumatism, in contradistinction to the chronic, of which we are next to treat, there exists not only a state of active inflammation in the affected parts, but also of peculiar irritability; and that this often remains after the inflammation is very much diminished or has even entirely ceased. Hence a renewal of the inflammation and recurrence of the pain take place from very slight causes; and in the treatment of the disease both the state of inflammation and irritability must be had in view.\n\nCure. For counteracting the state of active inflammation, the chief aim of the practitioner must be to diminish the general impetus of the circulation, and the impetus at the part particularly affected. For counteracting the state of irritability, he must endeavour to remove the disposition to increased action in the vessels; to prevent the action of causes exciting painful sensations; and to obviate their influence on the part. The cure therefore requires, in the first place, an antiphlogistic regimen, and particularly a total <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTINENCE\">abstinence</a> from animal food, and from all fermented or spirituous liquors; substituting a mild vegetable or milk diet, and the plentiful use of soft diluting liquors. On this principle also, blood-letting is the chief remedy of acute rheumatism. The blood is to be drawn in large quantity; and the bleeding is to be repeated in proportion to the frequency, fulness, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a> of the pulse, and the violence of the pain. For the most part, large and repeated bleeding during the first days of the disease seem to be necessary, and accordingly have been very much employed; but to this some bounds are to be set; for very profuse bleedings occasion a slow recovery, and are ready to produce a chronic rheumatism.\n\nTo avoid that debility of the system which general bleedings are apt to occasion, the urgent symptom of pain may be often relieved by topical bleedings; and when any swelling or redness has come upon a joint, the pain may very certainly be relieved by this evacuation; but as the pain and continuance of the disease seem to depend more upon the phlogistic diathesis of the whole system than upon the affection of particular parts, so topical bleedings will not supply the place of the general bleedings proposed above in most instances.\n\nTo take off the phlogistic diathesis prevailing in this disease, purging may be useful, if procured by medicines which do not stimulate the whole system, as neutral salts, and other medicines which have a refrigerant power. Purging, however, is not so useful as bleeding in removing the phlogistic diathesis; and when the disease has become general and violent, frequent stools are inconvenient, and even hurtful, by the motion and pain which they occasion.\n\nNext to blood-letting, nothing is of so much service, both in alleviating the pains in this disease and in removing the phlogistic diathesis, as the use of sudorifics: and of all the medicines belonging to this class, what has commonly been known by the name of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOVER\">Dover</a>'s powder, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of powder of ipecacuan and opium, is the most convenient and the most effectual. Copious sweating, excited by this medicine, and supported for 10 or 12 hours by tepid diluents, such as decoction of the woods, or the like, will in most instances produce a complete remission of the pain: and by this practice, combined with blood-letting and proper regimen, the disease may often be entirely removed.\n\nIf, however, after complete intermissions from pain for some length of time have been obtained by these means, it be found that there is a great tendency to a return of the pains without any obvious cause, recourse may be had with very great benefit to the use of the Peruvian bark. By the early use of this, where a complete intermission from pain is obtained, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of repeated blood-letting and sweating is often superseded; but where a complete remission cannot be obtained, it has been suspected by some to be hurtful: and in these cases, when blood-letting and sudorifics have been pushed as far as may be thought prudent, without being productive of the desired effect, very great benefit is often derived from the use of calomel combined with opium, as recommended in the Edinburgh Medical Commentaries, by Dr Hamilton of Lynn Regis.\n\nIn this disease, external applications are of little service. Fomentations in the beginning of the disease rather aggravate than relieve the pains. The rubefacients and camphire are more effectual: but they commonly only move them from one part to another, and do not prove any cure of the general affection. Blistering may also be very effectual in removing the pain.","sp":333,"ep":358},{"h":"AMONG OTHER","t":"g other means of preventing scurvy, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> Cook had also a liberal supply of portable soup; of which the men had generally an ounce, three days in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>, boiled up with their pease; and sometimes it was served to them oftener; and when they could get fresh greens, it was boiled up with them, and made such an agreeable mess, that it was the means of making the people eat a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of greens than they would otherwise have done.

When the pyrexia attending the acute rheumatism has ceased; when the swelling and redness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a> are entirely gone, but pains still continue to affect certain joints, which remain stiff, feel uneasy upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, changes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, or in the night <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> only, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> is then called the chronic rheumatism, as it often continues for a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> time.\n\nThe limits between the acute and chronic rheumatisms are not always exactly marked. When the pains are still ready to shift their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>; when they are especially severe in the night time; when, at the same time, they are attended with some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of pyrexia, and with some swelling, and especially some redness of the joints; the disease is to be considered as partaking of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the acute rheumatism. But when there is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> longer any degree of pyrexia remaining; when the pained joints are without redness; when they are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> and stiff; when they cannot easily be made to sweat; or when, while a free and warm sweat is brought out on the rest of the body, it is only clammy and cold on the pained joints; and when, further, the pains of these are increased by cold, and relieved by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, applied to them; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> is to be considered as that of a purely chronic rheumatism: or, perhaps more properly, the first of the conditions now described may be termed the state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRRITABILITY\">irritability</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> the state of atony.\n\nThe chronic rheumatism, or rather the atomic, may affect different joints; but is especially apt to affect those which are surrounded with many muscles, and those of which the muscles are employed in the most constant and vigorous exertions. Such is the case of the vertebre of the loins, the affection of which is named lumbago; or of the hip <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a>, when the disease is named ischias or sciatica.\n\nViolent strains and spasms occurring on sudden and somewhat violent exertions, bring on rheumatic affections, which at first partake of the acute, but very soon change into the nature of the chronic, rheumatism.\u2014Such are frequently the lumbago, and other affections, which seem to be more seated in the muscles than in the joints. The distinction of the rheumatic pains from those resembling them which occur in the syphilis and scurvy must be obvious, either from the seat of the pains, or from the concomitant symptoms peculiar to those diseases. The distinction of the rheumatism from the gout <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be more fully understood from what is laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> under the genus Podagra.\n\nCauses, &c. The phenomena of the purely chronic rheumatism <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> us to conclude, that its proximate cause is an atony both of the blood-vessels and of the muscular fibres of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> affected, together with such a degree of rigidity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a> in the latter as frequently attend them in a state of atony; and indeed this atony, carried to a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, gives rise to a state of paralysis, with an almost total loss of motion in the affected <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a>. The paralytic state of rheumatism therefore may be pointed out as a fourth condition of the disease, often claiming the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of rheumatic practitioners.\n\nCare. From the view <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> now given of the proximate cause of chronic rheumatism, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> indication of cure must be, to restore the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> and vigour of the part, which is principally to be done by increasing the tone of the moving fibres, but which may sometimes also be aided by giving condensation to the simple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a>. When, however, the disease has degenerated into the state of paralysis, the objects to be aimed at are, the restoration of a due condition to the nervous energy in the part affected; the obtaining free circulation of blood through the vessels of the part; and the removal of rigidity in membranes and ligaments.\n\nFor answering these purposes, a great variety of remedies, both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> and internal, are had recourse to. The chief of the external are, the supporting the heat of the part, by keeping it constantly covered with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FLANNEL\">flannel</a>; the increasing the heat of the part by external heat, applied either in a dry or humid form; the diligent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRUSH\">brush</a>, or other means of friction; the application of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTRICITY\">electricity</a> in sparks or shocks; the application of cold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> by infusion or immersion; the application of essential oils of the most warm and penetrating kind; the application of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRINE\">brine</a>; the employment of the warm bath or of the vapour <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATHS\">baths</a>, either to the body in general or to particular parts; and, lastly, the employment either of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of the part itself as far as it can easily bear, or by riding or other modes of gestation.\n\nThe internal remedies are, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> doses of essential oils drawn from resinous substances, such as turpentine; substances containing such oils, as guaiac; volatile alkaline salts, &c. These or other medicines are directed to procure sweat; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CALOMEL\">calomel</a>, or some other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a>, in small doses, may be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> for some time. But of all the remedies which have been found useful in atomic rheumatism, perhaps the best is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CINCHONA\">cinchona</a>. It is particularly serviceable in the earlier periods of the disease. It has often been highly efficacious in preventing the degeneracy of the inflammatory into the atomic state of the disease; and by some practitioners, particularly Dr Haygarth of Bath, it has been highly extolled in acute rheumatism. Besides these, there are several other remedies recommended. The cicuta, aconitum, and hyoscyamus, have in particular been highly extolled; and an infusion of the rhododendron chrysanthum is said to be employed by the Siberians with very great success. An account of the Siberian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of practice is given by Dr Matthew Guthrie of Petersburgh, in the fifth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> Medical Commentaries, and has been followed with success at other places. Among other internal remedies for rheumatism, the use of arsenic has of late been recommended by Dr Bardsley of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIVERPOOL\">Liverpool</a>. It is advised to be given under the form of the mineral solution proposed by Dr Fowler as a remedy in intermittent fever and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PERIODIC\">periodic</a> headaches. Under this form, it is now ascertained by extensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> that arsenic may be taken internally with as much safety as any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> medicine; and in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> of rheumatism in which it has been employed at Edinburgh, there is reason to believe that it has been productive of benefit.\nGENUS XXIII.

This well-known disease makes its attack by a most violent pain in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>, most frequently in the molares, more rarely in the incisores, reaching sometimes up to the eyes, and sometimes backward into the cavity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EAR\">ear</a>. At the same time there is a manifest determination to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>; and a remarkable tension and inflation of the vessels takes place, not only in the parts next to that where the pain is seated, but over the whole head.\n\nCauses, &c. The toothach is sometimes merely a rheumatic affection, arising from cold, but more frequently from a carious tooth. It is also a symptom of pregnancy, and takes place in some nervous disorders; it may attack persons at any time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, though it is most frequent in the young and plethoric.\n\nCure. Many empirical remedies have been proposed for the cure of the toothach, but none have in any degree answered the purpose. When the affection is purely rheumatic, blistering behind the ear will almost always remove it; but when it proceeds from a carious tooth, the pain is much more obstinate. In this case it has been recommended to touch the pained part with a hot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, or with sulphuric acid, in order to destroy the aching nerve; to hold strong spirits in the mouth; to put a drop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> of cloves into the hollow of the tooth, or a pill of equal parts of opium and camphor; but one of the most useful applications of this kind is strong nitrous acid, diluted with three or four times its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of spirit of wine, and introduced into the hollow of a tooth from which great pain arises, either by means of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a> or a little cotton. Cinchona has also been recommended, and perhaps with more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, on account of its tonic and antiseptic powers; but very often all these remedies will fail, and the only infallible cure is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTRACTION\">extraction</a> of the tooth.

The Retrocedent Gout.\n\nSp. IV. The Misplaced Gout.\n\nDescription. What we call a paroxysm of the gout is principally constituted by an inflammatory affection of some of the joints. This sometimes comes on suddenly, without any warning, but is generally preceded by several symptoms; such as the ceasing of a sweating which the feet had been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> before affected with; an unusual coldness of the feet and legs; a frequent numbness, alternating with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of pricking along the whole of the lower extremities; frequent cramps of the muscles of the legs; and an unusual turgescence of the veins.\n\nWhile these symptoms take place in the lower extremities, the body is affected with some degree of torpor and languor, and the functions of the stomach in particular are more or less disturbed. The appetite is diminished; and flatulency, or other symptoms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIGESTION\">indigestion</a>, are felt. These symptoms take place for several days, sometimes for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a> or two, before a paroxysm comes on; but commonly, upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> immediately preceding it, the appetite becomes keener than usual.\n\nThe circumstances of paroxysms are chiefly the following. They come on most commonly in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>, and sooner or later according as the vernal heat succeeds sooner or later to the winter's cold, and, perhaps, sooner or later also, according as the body may happen to be more or less exposed to vicissitudes of heat and cold.\n\nThe attacks are sometimes felt first in the evening, but more commonly about two or three o'clock in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>. The paroxysm begins with a pain affecting one foot, most frequently in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> or first joint of the great toe, but sometimes in other parts of the foot. With the attack of this pain, there is commonly more or less of a cold shivering; which, as the pain increases, gradually ceases; and is succeeded by a hot stage of pyrexia, which continues for the same time with the pain itself. From the first attack, the pain becomes, by degrees, more violent, and continues in this state with great restlessness of the whole body till next midnight, after which it gradually remits; and, after it has continued for twenty-four hours from the commencement of the first attack, it commonly ceases almost entirely; and, with the coming on of a gentle sweat, allows the patient to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> asleep. The patient, upon coming out of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a> in the morning, finds the pained part affected with some redness and swelling, which, after having continued for some days, gradually abate.\n\nWhen a paroxysm has thus come on, although the violent pain after 24 hours be considerably abated, the patient is not entirely relieved from it. For some days\ndays he has every evening a return of more considerable pain and pyrexia, and these continue with more or less violence till morning. After going on, in this manner, for several days, the disease sometimes goes entirely off, not to return till after a long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a>.\n\nWhen the disease, after having thus remained for some time in a joint, ceases entirely, it generally leaves the person in very perfect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, enjoying greater ease and alacrity in the functions of both body and mind than he had for a long time before experienced.\n\nAt the beginning of the disease, the returns of it are sometimes only once in three or four years; but as it advances, the intervals become shorter, and at length the attacks are annual; afterwards they come twice each year; and at length recur several times during the course of autumn, winter, and spring; and as, when the fits are frequent, the paroxysms become also longer, so, in the advanced state of the disease, the patient is hardly ever tolerably free from it, except perhaps for two or three months in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>.\n\nThe progress of the disease is also marked by the parts which it affects. At first, it commonly affects one foot only; afterwards, every paroxysm affects both feet, the one after the other; and as the disease proceeds, it not only affects both feet at once, but, after having ceased in the foot which was last attacked, returns again into the first, and perhaps a second time also into the other. Its changes of places are not only from one foot to another, but from the feet into other joints, especially those of the upper extremities; so that there is hardly a joint of the body which, on one occasion or another, is not affected. It sometimes affects two different joints at the very same time; but more commonly it is at any one time severe in a single joint only, and passes in succession from one joint to another; so that the patient's affliction is often protracted for a long time.\n\nWhen the disease has often returned, and the paroxysms have become very frequent, the pains are commonly less violent than they were at first; but the patient is more affected with sickness, and the other symptoms of the atonic gout, which shall be hereafter mentioned.\n\nAfter the first paroxysm of the disease, the joints which have been affected are entirely restored to their former suppleness and strength; but after the disease has recurred very often, the joints affected do neither so suddenly nor entirely recover their former state, but continue weak and stiff; and these effects at length proceed to such a degree, that the joints lose their motion entirely.\n\nIn many persons, but not in all, after the disease has frequently recurred, concretions of a chalky nature are formed upon the outside of the joints, and for the most part immediately under the skin. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> seems to be deposited at first in a fluid form, afterwards becoming dry and firm. In their firm state, these concretions are a hard earthy substance, very entirely soluble in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a>. After they have been formed, they contribute, with other circumstances, to destroy the motion of the joints.\n\nIn most persons who have laboured under the gout for many years, a nephritic affection comes on, and discovers itself by all the symptoms which usually attend calculous concretions in the kidneys, and which Podagra, we shall have occasion to describe in another place.\n\nAll that is necessary to be observed here is, that the nephritic affection alternates with paroxysms of the gout; and that the two affections, the nephritic and the gouty, are hardly ever present at the same time. This also may be observed, that children of gouty or nephritic parents commonly inherit one or other of these diseases; but whether the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> disease of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a> may have been either gout or nephritis alone, some of the children have the one and some the other. In some of them the nephritic affection occurs alone, without any gout supervening; and this happens to be frequently the case with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> children of gouty parents.\n\nIn the whole of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> already given, we have described the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> form of the disease, and which therefore, however diversified in the progress of it, may be still called the regular state of the gout.\u2014Upon some occasions, however, the disease assumes different appearances: but as we suppose the disease to depend always upon a certain diathesis, or disposition of the system; so every appearance which we can perceive to depend upon that same disposition, we still consider as symptomatic, and view the disease to be a case of the gout. The principal circumstance, in what we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> the regular gout, is the inflammatory affection of the joints; and whatever symptoms we can perceive to be connected with, or to depend upon, the disposition which produces that inflammatory affection, but without its taking place or being present at the same time, we name the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> gout.\n\nOf such irregular gout there are three different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, which may be named the atonic, the retrocedent, and the misplaced gout.\n\nThe first is, when the gouty diathesis prevails in the system; but, from certain causes, does not produce the inflammatory affection of the joints. In this case, the morbid symptoms which appear, are chiefly affections of the stomach, such as loss of appetite, indigestion, and its various attendants of sickness, nausea, vomiting, flatulence, acid eructations, and pains in the region of the stomach. These symptoms are frequently accompanied with pains and cramps in several parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a> and the upper extremities of the body, which are relieved by the discharge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> from the stomach. Together with these affections of the stomach, there commonly occurs a costiveness; but sometimes a looseness, with colic pains. These affections of the alimentary canal are often attended with all the symptoms of hypochondriasis, such as dejection of mind, a constant and anxious attention to the slightest feelings, an imaginary aggravation of these, and an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> of danger from them.\n\nIn the same atonic gout, the viscera of the thorax also are sometimes affected, and palpitations, faintings, and asthma occur.\n\nIn the head also occur headache, giddiness, apoplectic and paralytic affections.\n\nWhen the several symptoms now mentioned occur in habits having the marks of a gouty disposition, this may be suspected to have laid the foundation for them; and especially when either, in such habits, a manifest tendency to the inflammatory affection has formerly appeared, or when the symptoms mentioned are\nare intermixed with, and are relieved by some degree of the inflammatory gout. In such cases there can be no doubt of considering the whole as a state of the gout.\n\nAnother state of the disease we name the retrocedent gout. This occurs when an inflammatory state of the joints has, in the usual manner, come on, but without arising to the ordinary degree of pain and inflammation; or at least without these continuing for the usual time, or without their receding gradually in the usual manner; these affections of the joints suddenly and entirely cease, while some internal part becomes affected. The internal part most commonly attacked is the stomach; which then is affected with anxiety, sickness, vomiting, or violent pain: but sometimes the internal part is the heart, which gives occasion to a syncope; sometimes it is the lungs, which are affected with asthma: and sometimes it is the head, giving occasion to apoplexy or palsy. In all these cases there can be no doubt that the symptoms are all a part of the same disease, however different the affection may seem to be in the parts which it attacks.\n\nThe third state of irregular gout, which we name the misplaced, is when the gouty diathesis, instead of producing the inflammatory affection of the joints, produces an inflammatory affection of some internal part, and which appears from the same symptoms that attend the inflammations of those parts arising from other causes.\n\nWhether the gouty diathesis does ever produce such inflammation of the internal parts without having first produced it in the joints, or whether the inflammation of the internal part be always a translation from the joints previously affected, we dare not determine; but, even supposing the latter to be always the case, we think the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of the affection of the internal part must still distinguish the misplaced from what we have named the retrocedent gout.\n\nWith regard to the misplaced gout, Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CULLEN\">Cullen</a>, whom we here follow, tells us, that he never met with any cases of it in his practice, nor does he find any distinctly marked by practical writers, except that of a pneumonic inflammation.\n\nThere are two cases of a translated gout; the one of which is an affection of the neck of the bladder, producing pain, strangury, and a catarrhus vesicae: the other is an affection of the rectum, sometimes indicated by pain alone in that part, and sometimes by hemorrhoidal symptoms. In gouty persons such affections have been known to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> with inflammatory affections of the joints; but whether these belong to the retrocedent or to the misplaced gout, Dr Cullen pretends not to determine.\n\nIt is commonly supposed, that there are some cases of rheumatism which are scarcely to be distinguished from the gout: but these, Dr Cullen thinks, are but few; and that the two diseases may be for the most part distinguished with great certainty, by observing the predisposition, the antecedent circumstances, the parts affected, the recurrences of the disease, and its connection with the system; which circumstances, for the most part, appear very differently in the two diseases.\n\nCauses, &c. The gout is generally an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> disease: but some persons, without any hereditary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIS\">dis</a>-\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TAIN\">tain</a> morbid matter always present in the body; and that this matter, by certain causes, thrown upon the joints or other parts, produces the several phenomena of the disease.\n\nThis doctrine, however <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> and generally received, appears to Dr Cullen to be very doubtful. For,\n\nFirst, There is no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> of any morbid matter being present in persons disposed to the gout. There are no experiments or observations which show that the blood or other humours of gouty persons are in any respect different from those of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a>. Previous to attacks of the gout, there appear no marks of any morbid state of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a>; for the disease generally attacks those persons who have enjoyed the most perfect health, and appear to be in that state when the disease comes on. At a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of the disease, a peculiar matter indeed appears in gouty persons; but this, which does not appear in every instance, and which appears only after the disease has subsisted for a long time, seems manifestly to be the effect, not the cause, of the disease. Further, Though there be certain acids which, taken into the body, seem to excite the gout, it is probable that these acids operate otherwise in exciting the disease, than by affording the material cause of it. In general, therefore, Dr Cullen thinks there is no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of any morbid matter being the cause of the gout.\n\nSecondly, The suppositions concerning the particular nature of the matter producing the gout, have been so various, and so contradictory, as to allow us to conclude, that there is truly no proof of the existence of any of them. With respect to many of these suppositions, they are so inconsistent with chemical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, and with the laws of the animal economy, that they must be entirely rejected.\n\nThirdly, The supposition of a morbid matter as the cause, is not consistent with the phenomena of the disease, particularly with its frequent and sudden translations from one part to another.\n\nFourthly, The supposition is further rendered improbable by this, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> a morbid matter did exist, its operation should be similar in the several parts which it attacks: whereas it seems to be very different, being stimulant and exciting inflammation, in the joints; but sedative and destroying tone in the stomach; which, upon the supposition of the same particular matter acting in both cases, is not to be explained by any difference in the part affected.\n\nFifthly, Some facts alleged in proof of a morbid matter, are not confirmed; such as those which would prove the disease to be contagious. There is, however, no proper evidence of this, the facts given being not only few, but exceptionable, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a> observations innumerable.\n\nSixthly, Some arguments brought in favour of a morbid matter are founded upon a mistaken explanation. The disease has been supposed to depend upon a morbid matter, because it is hereditary. But the inference is not just: for most hereditary diseases do not depend upon any morbid matter, but upon a particular conformation of the structure of the body transmitted from the parent to the offspring; and this last appears to be particularly the case in the gout. It may be also observed, that hereditary diseases depending upon a morbid matter, appear always much more early in life than the gout commonly does.\n\nSeventhly, The supposition of a morbid matter being the cause of the gout, has been hitherto useless, as it has not suggested any successful method of cure. Particular theories of gout have often corrupted the practice, and have frequently led from those views which might have been useful, and from that practice which experience had approved. Further, Though the supposition of a morbid matter has been generally received, it has been as generally neglected in practice. When the gout has affected the stomach, nobody thinks of correcting the matter supposed to be present there, but merely of restoring the tone of the moving fibres.\n\nEightly, The supposition of a morbid matter is quite superfluous: for it explains nothing, without supposing that matter to produce a change in the state of the moving powers; and a change in the state of the moving powers, produced by other causes, explains every circumstance without the supposition of a morbid matter; and it may be observed, that many of the causes exciting the gout, do not operate upon the state of the fluids, but directly and solely upon that of the moving powers.\n\nLastly, Dr Cullen contends that the supposition of a morbid matter is superfluous; because, without that, the disease can be explained, he thinks, in a manner more consistent with its phenomena, with the laws of the animal economy, and with the method of cure which experience has approved. We now proceed to give this explanation; but, before entering upon it, we must premise some general observations which Dr Cullen states.\n\nThe first observation is, That the gout is a disease of the whole system, or depends upon a certain general conformation and state of the body, which manifestly appears from the facts above mentioned. But the general state of the system depends chiefly upon the state of its primary moving powers; and therefore the gout may be supposed to be an affection of these.\n\nThe second observation is, That the gout is manifestly an affection of the nervous system; in which the primary moving powers of the whole system are lodged. The occasional or exciting causes are almost all such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> directly upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NERVES\">nerves</a> and nervous system; and the greater part of the symptoms of the atomic or retrocedent gout are manifestly affections of the same system. This leads us to seek for an explanation of the whole of the disease, in the laws of the nervous system, and particularly in the changes which may happen in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> of its several parts.\n\nThe third observation is, That the stomach, which has so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> a consent with the rest of the system, is the internal part that is the most frequently, and often very considerably, affected by the gout. The paroxysms of the disease are commonly preceded by an affection of the stomach; many of the exciting causes act first upon the stomach; and the symptoms of the atomic and retrocedent gout are most commonly and chiefly affections of the same organ. This observation leads us to remark, that there is a balance subsisting between the state of the internal and that of the external parts; and, in particular, that the state of the stomach is connected with that of the external parts, so that the\nThese observations being premised, Dr Cullen offers the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATHOLOGY\">pathology</a> of the gout.\n\nIn some persons there is a certain vigorous and plethoric state of the system, which at a certain period of life is liable to a loss of tone in the extremities. This is in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> communicated to the whole system, but appears more especially in the functions of the stomach. When this loss of tone occurs while the energy of the brain still retains its vigour, the vis medicatrix nature is excited to restore the tone of the parts; and accomplishes it, by exciting an inflammatory affection in some part of the extremities. When this has subsisted for some days, the tone of the extremities and of the whole system is restored, and the patient returns to his ordinary state of health.\n\nThis is the course of things in the ordinary form of the disease, which we name the regular gout; but there are circumstances of the body, in which this course is interrupted or varied. Thus, when the atony has taken place, if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REACTION\">reaction</a> do not succeed, the atony continues in the stomach, or perhaps in other internal parts; and produces that state which Dr Cullen, for reasons now obvious, named the atonic gout.\n\nA second case of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> in the course of the gout is, when to the atony the reaction and inflammation have to a certain degree succeeded, but from causes either internal or external the tone of the extremities and perhaps of the whole system is weakened; so that the inflammatory state, before it had either proceeded to the degree, or continued for the time, requisite for restoring the tone of the system, suddenly and entirely ceases: whence the stomach, and other internal parts, relapse into the state of atony; and perhaps have that increased by the atony communicated from the extremities: all which appears in what has been termed the retrocedent state of the gout.\n\nA third case of variation from the ordinary course of the gout, is, when to the atony, usually preceding, an inflammatory reaction fully succeeds, but has its usual determination to the joints prevented by some circumstances; and is therefore directed to some internal part, where it produces an inflammatory affection, and that state of things which we have named the misplaced gout.\n\nThough this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of Dr Cullen's be supported with much ingenuity, yet we may confidently venture to assert, that on this subject he has been less successful in establishing his own opinions, than in combating those of others; and this theory, as well as others formerly proposed, is liable to numerous and unsurmountable objections. According to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>, a vigorous and plethoric <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> should in every case exist <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> to the appearance of gout; which is by no means consistent with fact: nor is it true that a vigorous and plethoric habit is liable at a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> to a loss of tone in the extremities; which is another necessary condition in the hypothesis. Loss of tone often occurs in the extremities without exerting any peculiar influence on the stomach; and why a loss of tone in the stomach should excite the vis medicatrix nature to restore it, by exciting an inflammatory affection in some part of the extremities, is very inconceivable. Were the hypothesis true, every dyspeptic patient should infallibly be affected with gout; which, however, is by no means the case. In short, every step in the theory is liable to unsurmountable objections; and it by no means, any more than former hypotheses, explains the phenomena of the disease, particularly what Dr Cullen has himself so accurately pointed out, the connection of gouty with calculous complaints.\n\nA very ingenious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> has lately been published by an anonymous author, entitled \"A Treatise on Gravel and upon Gout,\" in which the sources of each are investigated, and effectual means of preventing or removing these diseases recommended. In this treatise an attempt is made to prove, that both diseases depend upon a peculiar concreting acid, the acid of calculi, or the lithic or uric acid, as it has been styled by some. He supposes this acid, constantly present to a certain degree in the circulating fluids, to be precipitated by the introduction of other acids; and in this manner he explains the influence of acid wines and other liquors, as claret, cider, &c., inducing gout; for he considers the circumstance chiefly constituting the disease as being an inflammation in parts of which the functions have been interrupted by the redundant acid precipitated. Although this theory be supported with much ingenuity, yet it is also liable to many objections. The sudden attack of the affection; its sudden transition from one part of the body to another; the instant relief of one part when another comes to be affected; and the various anomalous forms which the disease puts on, having an exact resemblance to different affections; are altogether irreconcilable to the idea of its depending on any fixed obstruction at a particular part arising from concreting acid. Nor does the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of prevention and cure which he proposes, and which consists chiefly in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTINENCE\">abstinence</a> from acid, and in the destruction of acid, by any means correspond in every particular to the best established facts respecting the treatment of gout; to which we next proceed.\n\nCure. In entering upon this, we must observe, in the first place, that a cure has been commonly thought impossible; and we acknowledge it to be very probable, that the gout, as a disease of the whole habit, and very often depending upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> conformation, cannot be cured by medicines, the effects of which are always very transitory, and seldom extend to the producing any considerable change of the whole habit.\n\nIt would perhaps have been happy for gouty persons if this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> had been implicitly received by them; as it would have prevented their having been so often the dupes of self-interested pretenders, who have either amused them with inert medicines, or have rashly employed those of the most pernicious tendency. Dr Cullen, who has treated of the cure of the disease with great judgment, as he has done the theory with much ingenuity, is much disposed to believe the impossibility of the cure of the gout by medicines; and more certainly still inclined to think, that whatever may be the possible power of medicines, yet no medicine for curing the gout has hitherto been found. Although almost every age has presented a new remedy, all hitherto offered have, very soon after, been either neglected as useless, or condemned as pernicious.\n\nBut though unwilling to admit the power of medicines, yet he contends, that a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> can be done towards\ntowards the cure of the gout by a regimen: and he is firmly persuaded, that any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> who, early in life, will enter upon the constant practice of bodily labour, and of abstinence from animal food, will be preserved entirely from the disease.","sp":358,"ep":365},{"h":"AXIOMS","t":"34. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-AXIOM\">AXIOM</a> 1. Equal weights acting at the extremities of equal arms of a straight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEVER\">lever</a>, and having the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> in which they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> at equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> to these arms, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> exert the same effort to turn the lever round its fulcrum. This axiom has been generally restricted to the particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> when the weights act perpendicularly to the arms of the lever; but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> reason can be assigned for such limitation. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> in the axiom is as self-evident when the angles formed by the arms of the lever and the direction of the forces are $30^\\circ$, as when they are $90^\\circ$; for in each case the two weights exert...\nexert their influence upon the lever in precisely the same circumstances.\n\n35. **Axiom 2.** <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> two equal weights are placed at the extremities of a lever supported by two fulcra; and if these fulcra are at equal distances from the weights, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> if the extremities of the lever; the pressure upon the fulcra will be equal to the sum of the weights, and the pressure upon each fulcrum will be equal to one of the weights.\n\nThe lever being supposed devoid of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>, it is obvious, that as each fulcrum is similarly situated with respect to both the weights, the pressure upon each must be equal; and as the fulcra support both the equal weights, the pressure upon each must be equal to one of the weights.\n\n**Proposition I.**\n\n36. If two weights or forces acting at equal angles upon a straight lever, devoid of weight, are in equilibrium, they are reciprocally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to their distances from the fulcrum.\n\n37. **Case 1.** When the weights act on contrary sides of the fulcrum.\n\nLet \\( <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">AB</a> \\) be a lever devoid of weight, and let it be supported on the two fulcra, \\( fF \\), situated in such a manner that \\( Af = fF = FB \\). Then if two equal weights \\( C, D \\) of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> each are suspended at the extremities \\( A, B \\), so as to act in the directions \\( AC, BD \\), making the angles \\( CAB, DBA \\) equal, these weights will be in equilibrium, for since \\( Af = fF = FB \\) (Axiom 1.), the effort of the weight \\( D \\) to turn the lever round the fulcrum \\( F \\), will be equal to the effort of the weight \\( C \\) to turn it round the fulcrum \\( f \\). Now (Axiom 2.) the pressure upon the fulcrum \\( f \\) is equal to one pound, therefore if that fulcrum be removed, and a weight \\( E \\) of one pound be made to act upward at the point \\( F \\), the weights \\( C \\) and \\( D \\) will continue in equilibrium. Then it is obvious that since \\( FB = fF \\), the weight \\( E \\) of one pound acting upwards at the point \\( f \\), so that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> \\( Df = DBA \\), will have the same effect as an equal weight acting downwards at \\( B \\). By removing the weight \\( E \\), therefore, and suspending its equal \\( C \\) at the extremity \\( B \\), the equilibrium will still be preserved. But the weights \\( D, C \\), suspended at \\( B \\), are equal to two pounds, and the weight \\( C \\) is only one pound; and as \\( FA \\) is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> of \\( FB \\), it follows that a weight of two pounds, placed at the end of one arm of a lever, will be in equilibrium with a weight of one pound placed at twice the distance of the former from the fulcrum. But \\( 2 : 1 = 2FB \\) or \\( AF : FB \\), that is, when the distances are as \\( 2 \\) to \\( 1 \\), an equilibrium takes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> if the weights are reciprocally proportional to these distances.\n\n38. **Case 2.** When weights act on the same side of the fulcrum.\n\nLet \\( AB \\) be a lever in equilibrium upon the fulcrum \\( F \\), and let \\( FA \\) be equal to \\( FB \\), consequently (Case 1.) we must have \\( C = D = 1 \\) pound. Now as the fulcrum \\( F \\) supports a weight equal to \\( C + D = 2 \\) pounds, the equilibrium will continue if a weight \\( E \\) of two pounds is made to act upwards at the point \\( F \\), for in this case it supplies the place of the fulcrum. It is obvious also that a fulcrum placed at \\( A \\) or \\( B \\) will supply the place of the weights at these parts without affecting the equilibrium. Let, therefore, the weight \\( D \\) be removed, and let the extremity \\( B \\) rest upon a fulcrum; then since the lever is in equilibrium, we have a weight \\( E = C + D = 2 \\) pounds acting at \\( F \\), and balancing a weight \\( C \\) of one pound acting at \\( A \\). But \\( 2 : 1 = AB : FB \\), consequently when there is an equilibrium between two weights \\( C, D \\) acting at the distances \\( 2 \\) and \\( 1 \\) from the fulcrum, and on the same side of the fulcrum, the weights are reciprocally proportional to these distances.\n\n39. Again, let \\( AB \\) be the same lever supported by Fig. 5. the fulcra \\( f, F \\), and let \\( Af = fF = FB \\). Then if two weights \\( C, D \\) of one pound each be suspended at the extremities \\( A, B \\), they will be in equilibrium as before. But since the fulcrum \\( f \\) supports a pressure of one pound (Axiom 2.), the equilibrium will still continue when that fulcrum is removed and a weight of one pound made to act in a contrary direction \\( fP \\) at the point \\( f \\), so that the angle \\( PfF \\) may be equal to \\( DBA \\). Now, (Axiom 1.) a weight \\( E \\) of one pound acting upward at \\( f \\) will be in equilibrium with a weight \\( E' \\) of one pound acting downwards at \\( f' \\); \\( f'f \\) being equal to \\( Ef \\), and therefore by removing \\( E \\) from the point \\( f \\) and substituting \\( E \\) at the point \\( f' \\), an equilibrium will still obtain. But since \\( fF = fFB \\) a weight of one pound suspended from \\( f \\) will have the same influence in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> the lever round \\( F \\) as a weight of two pounds suspended at \\( B \\) (Case 2.). Let us remove, therefore, the weight \\( E' \\) from \\( f' \\), and substitute a weight \\( G = 2E' \\), so as to act at \\( B \\). Then since the equilibrium is not destroyed, we have a weight \\( C \\) of one pound acting at the distance \\( FA \\), and the weights \\( D + G = 3 \\) pounds acting at the distance \\( FB \\). But \\( FA = 3FB \\) and \\( D + G = 3C \\), consequently \\( C : D + G = FB : FA \\): That is, when the distances from the fulcrum are as \\( 3 \\) to \\( 1 \\), and when an equilibrium exists, the weights are reciprocally proportional to these distances.\n\n40. By making \\( EA \\) in fig. 2. equal to \\( 2FB \\) it may be shewn, as in Case 2. that the weights are reciprocally proportional to their distances from the fulcrum, when they act on the same side of the fulcrum, and when the distances are as \\( 3 \\) to \\( 1 \\).\n\n41. In the same way the demonstration may be extended to any commensurable proportion of the arms, by making \\( EA \\) to \\( FB \\) in that proportion, and keeping \\( fA \\) always equal to \\( FB \\). Hence we may conclude in general, that when two weights acting at equal angles upon a straight lever devoid of weight, are in equilibrium, they are reciprocally proportional to their distances from the centre of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>. Q. E. D.\n\n42. **Cor. I.** If two weights acting at equal angles upon the arms of a straight lever devoid of weight are reciprocally proportional to their distances from the fulcrum, they will be in equilibrium.\n\nFor if an equilibrium does not take place, the proportion of the weights must be altered to procure an equilibrium, and then, contrary to the proposition, the weights would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> each other when they are not reciprocally proportional to their distances from the fulcrum.\n\n43. **Cor. 2.** If a weight \\( W \\) be supported by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> lever resting on the fulcra \\( A, B \\), the pressure upon \\( A \\) is to the pressure upon \\( B \\) in the inverse ratio of their distances from the point where the weight is suspended, that is, as \\( BF \\) to \\( FA \\).\n\nFor if we suppose \\( B \\) to be the fulcrum, and if removing\nthe fulcrum A, we support the extremity A of the lever by a weight F <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to the weight sustained by the fulcrum A, and acting upwards over the palley P, then the weight E or that sustained by A : W = BF : BA (Prop. 1.) ; and if we conceive A to be the fulcrum, and support the extremity B by a weight F equal to that which was supported by the fulcrum B, we shall have the weight F or the weight sustained by B : W = FB : FA. Hence ex aequo the weight sustained by A is to the weight sustained by B as BF is to FA.\n\n44. Cor. 3. We may now call the two weights P and W, the power and the weight, as in fig. 5, and since P : W = EB : FA, we have (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">Geometry</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">Sect</a>. iv. Theor. 8.) P \u00d7 FA = W \u00d7 FB, when an equilibrium takes place;\n\nconsequently \\( P = \\frac{W \\times FB}{FA} \\); \\( W = \\frac{P \\times FA}{FB} \\)\n\n\\( FA = \\frac{W \\times FB}{P} \\)\n\n\\( FB = \\frac{P \\times FA}{W} \\).\n\n45. Cor. 4. We have already seen (Axiom 2.) that when the power and the weight are on contrary sides of the fulcrum, the pressure upon the fulcrum is equal to P + W or the sum of the weights; but it is obvious that when they act on the same side of the fulcrum, the pressure which it supports will be P - W, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of their weights.\n\n46. Cor. 5. If a weight P be shifted along the arm of a lever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-AD\">AD</a>, the weight W, which it is capable of balancing at A, will be proportional to FA.\n\nWhen the weights are in equilibrium (Cor. 3.)\n\n\\( W : P = FA : FB \\), or by alternation \\( W : FA = P : FB \\),\n\nand if \\( w \\) be another value of W and \\( f \\) another value of FA, we shall also have \\( w : P = f : a : FB \\) or \\( w : f = P : FB \\), consequently (Euclid, Book v. Prop. xi. and xvi.) \\( W : w = FA : f \\), that is, W varies as FA.\n\nCor. 6. It is obvious that the truths in the preceding proposition and corollaries, also hold when the lever has the form represented in fig. 6, only the straight lines AF, FB are in that case the length of the arm.\n\n47. Cor. 7. Since by the last corollary \\( FA : f = w : w \\), it follows that in the Roman steelyard or staterc, which is merely a lever with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> and short arm, having a weight moveable upon the long one, the distances at which the constant weight must be hung are as the weights suspended from the shorter arm. The steelyard is represented in fig. 7, where AB is the lever with unequal arms AF, FB, and F the centre of motion. The body W, whose weight is to be found, is suspended at the extremity B of the lever, and the constant weight P is moved along the divided arm FB till an equilibrium takes place. As soon as this happens, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> placed at the point of suspension D, indicates the weight of the body. If the lever is devoid of weight, it is obvious that the scale EB will be a scale of equal parts of which EB is the unit, and that the weight of the body W will be always equal to the constant weight P multiplied by the number of divisions between P and F. Thus if the equilibrium takes place when P is pulled out to the 12 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a>, we shall have \\( W = 12 P \\), and if \\( P = 1 \\) pound, \\( W = 12 \\) pounds. But when the gravity of the lever is considered, which must be done in the real steelyard, its arms are generally of unequal weight, and therefore the divisions of the scale must be ascertained by experiment. In order to do this, remove the weight P, and find the point C, at which a weight \\( P' \\) equal to P being suspended, will keep the unequal arms in equilibrium, C will then be the point at which the equal divisions must commence. For when W and P are placed upon the steelyard and are in equilibrium, W balances P along with a weight which, placed at D, would support P placed at C: Therefore \\( W \\times BF = P \\times DF + P \\times CF \\); but \\( P \\times DF + P \\times CF = P \\times DC \\), consequently \\( W \\times BF = P \\times DC \\), and (Geometry, Sect. iv. Theor. 8.) \\( W : DC = P : BF \\). By taking different values of the variable quantities W and DC as \\( w \\) and \\( d c \\), we shall have \\( w : d c = P : BF \\), consequently (Euclid, B. V. Prop. xi. and xvi.) \\( W : w = DC : d c \\), that is, the weight of W varies as DC, and therefore the divisions must commence at C. If the arm BF had been heavier than FA, which, however, can scarcely happen in practice, the point C would have been on the other side of F. In constructing steelyards, it might be advisable to make the unequal arms balance each other by placing a weight M at the extremity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a> arm, in which case the scale will begin at F. In the Danish and Swedish steelyard the body to be weighed and the constant weight are fixed at the extremities of the steelyard, but the point of suspension or centre of motion F moves along the lever till the equilibrium takes place. The point F then indicates the weight of the body required. \u2014There are some steelyards in which the constant weight is fixed to the shorter arm, while the body to be weighed moves upon the longer arm. The method of dividing this and the preceding steelyard may be seen in De la Hire's Trait\u00e9 de M\u00e9canique, Prop. 36, 37, 38.\n\nProp. II.\n\n48. To find the condition of equilibrium on a straight lever when its gravity is taken into the account.\n\n49. Let us suppose the lever to be of uniform thickness and density, as AB, fig. 7, and let it be suspended by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> c, d to another lever a b, considered as without weight, so that \\( a = c = f = d = b \\). Then if \\( f \\) be the centre of motion or point of suspension, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a> A B will be in equilibrium; for the weight AB may be regarded as composed of a number of pairs of equal weights, equally distant from the centre of motion. For the same reason, if we conceive the cylinder to be cut through at F the equilibrium will continue, c, d being now the points at which the weights AF, FB act, and their distances \\( c f, d f \\) from the centre of motion being equal. Consequently the arms AF, FB have the same energy in turning the lever round \\( f \\) as if weights equal to AF, FB were suspended at the distance of their middle points c, d from the fulcrum.\n\nLet P therefore, in fig. 5, be the power, W the weight, m the weight of the arm AF, and n the weight of FB. Then when there is an equilibrium we shall have (Prop. I. Cor. 3.) \\( P \\times AF + m \\times \\frac{1}{2} AF = W \\times FB + n \\times \\frac{1}{2} FB \\); and since the weight m, acting at half the distance AF is the same as half the weight m acting at\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">Theory</a>, the whole distance AF, we may substitute \\( \\frac{1}{2} m \\times AF \\) instead of \\( m \\times \\frac{1}{2} AF \\), and the equation becomes\n\n\\[ P + \\frac{1}{2} m \\times AF = W + \\frac{1}{2} n \\times FB. \\]\n\nHence\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{W + \\frac{1}{2} n \\times FB}{AF - \\frac{1}{2} m} \\]\n\n\\[ W = \\frac{P + \\frac{1}{2} m \\times AF}{FB - \\frac{1}{2} n} \\]\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{W + \\frac{1}{2} n \\times FB}{AF - \\frac{1}{2} m} \\]\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{P + \\frac{1}{2} m \\times AF}{FB - \\frac{1}{2} n} \\]\n\n50. Cor. If the arms of the lever are not of uniform density and thickness, instead of the distance of their middle points, we must take the distance of their centre of gravity from the fulcrum.\n\nProf. III.\n\n51. If two forces acting in any direction, and in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a>, upon a lever of any form, are in equilibrium, they will be reciprocally proportional to the perpendiculars let <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> from the fulcrum upon the directions in which they act.\n\nPlate CCCXVII A, B the points to which the forces, or the power P and weight W, are applied, and AE, BK the directions in which these forces act. Make AE to PK as P is to W, and they will therefore represent the forces applied at A and B. Draw AC perpendicular to AF and EC <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to it, and complete the parallelogram ADEC. In the same way form the parallelogram BGKH. Produce EA and KB towards m and n if necessary, and let fall FM, FN perpendicular to AE, BK produced. Then P shall be to W as FM is to FN. By the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> of forces (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DYNAMICS\">Dynamics</a>, \u00a7 149.) the force AE is equivalent to forces represented by AD and AC, and acting in these directions. But as AD acts in the direction of the arm AF, it can have no influence in turning the lever round F; and therefore AC represents the portion of the force AD which contributes to produce an angular motion round F. In the same way it may be shown that BG is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the force BK which tends to move the lever round F. Now suppose AF produced to B, FB being made equal to FB and B'G' = BG. Then by Prop. I. AC : B'G' = EB' : FA; but by Axiom I. the effort of BG to turn the lever round F is equal to the effort of the equal force B'G' to turn the lever round F; therefore AC : BG = EB : FA and AC \u00d7 FA = BG \u00d7 FB. Now the triangles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ACE\">ACE</a>, AE m are similar, because the angles at F and M are both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>, and on account of the parallels DF, AC, MAC = ADF; therefore AC : AF = FM : FA, and AC \u00d7 FA = AE \u00d7 FM. For the same reason in the similar triangles BGK, BF n we have BG : BK = FM : FB, and BK \u00d7 FM = BG \u00d7 FB.\n\nHence AE \u00d7 FM = BK \u00d7 FM, and AE : BK or P : W = FM : FM. Q.E.D.\n\n53. Cor. 1. The forces P and W are reciprocally Corollaries proportional to the sines of the angles which their directions make with the arms of the lever, for FM is evidently the sine of the angle FA m, and FN the sine of the angle FB n, FA, FB being made the radii; therefore P : W = Sin. FB n : Sin. FA m, or P : W = \\(\\frac{1}{\\text{Sin. FA m}} : \\frac{1}{\\text{Sin. FB n}}\\). Since FA : FM = Rad. : Sin. FA m, we have FM = \\(\\frac{\\text{FA} \\times \\text{Sin. FA m}}{\\text{Rad.}}\\); and since FB : FN = Rad. : Sin. FB n, we have FM = \\(\\frac{\\text{FB} \\times \\text{Sin. FB n}}{\\text{Rad.}}\\).\n\nbut in the case of an equilibrium P : W = FM : FM, consequently P : W = \\(\\frac{\\text{FB} \\times \\text{Sin. FB n}}{\\text{Rad.}} : \\frac{\\text{FA} \\times \\text{Sin. FA m}}{\\text{Rad.}}\\);\n\nand since magnitudes have the same ratio as their equimultiples, P : W = EB \u00d7 Sin. EB : FA \u00d7 Sin. FA m.\n\n54. Cor. 2. The energies of the forces P, W to turn the lever round the fulcrum F is the same at whatever point in the directions mE, nK they are applied, for the perpendiculars to which these energies are proportional remain the same.\u2014The truth of this corollary has been assumed as an axiom by some writers on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a>, who have very readily deduced from it the preceding proposition. But it is very obvious that the truth assumed as self-evident is nearly equivalent to the truth which it is employed to prove. Those who have adopted this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of demonstration illustrate their axiom by the case of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> body that is either pushed in one direction with a straight rod, or drawn by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CORD\">cord</a>; in both of which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> it is manifest that the effect of the force employed is the same, at whatever part of the rod or string it is applied: But these cases are completely different from that of a body moving round a fixed centre.\n\n55. Cor. 3. If AE and BK the directions in which the forces P, W are exerted be produced till they meet at L; and if from the fulcrum E the line FS be drawn parallel to the direction AL of one force till it meets BL, the direction of the other; then LS, SF will represent the two forces. For as the sides of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a> are as the sines of the opposite angles LS : SF = sin. LFS : sin. FLS; but on account of the parallels FS, AL the angle LFS = FLA, and FL being radius FM is the sine of PLA or LFS, and FN the sine of FLS, therefore by substitution LS : SF = FM : FN, that is as the force W : P.\n\n56. Cor. 4. If several forces act upon a lever, and keep it in equilibrium, the sum of the products of the forces and the perpendiculars from the fulcrum to the direction of the different forces on one side is equal to the sum of the products on the other. For since the energy of each force to turn the lever is equal to the product of the force and the perpendicular from the fulcrum on the line of its direction; and since in the case of an equilibrium, the energy of all the forces on one side of the fulcrum must be equal to the energy of all the forces on the other side, the products proportional to their energies must also be equal.\n\n57.

This eruption breaks out in many, according to Dr Heberden, without any illness or previous sign; in others it is preceded by a slight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of chillness, lassitude, cough, broken <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a>, wandering pains, loss of appetite, and feverish state for three days.\n\nIn some patients the chicken-pox make their first appearance on the back; but this perhaps is not constant. Most of them are of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> size of the small-pox, but some are less. Dr Heberden never <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> them confluent, nor very numerous. The greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> was about 12 on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a>, and 200 over the rest of the body.\n\nOn the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> of the eruption they are reddish. On the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> day there is at the top of most of them a very small bladder, about the size of a millet seed. This is sometimes full of a watery and colourless, sometimess of a yellowish liquor, contained between the cuticle and skin. On the second, or, at the farthest, on the third day from the beginning of the eruption, as many of these pocks as are not broken seem arrived at their full maturity; and those which are fullest of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> liquor very much resemble what the genuine smallpox are on the fifth or sixth day, especially where there happens to be a larger space than ordinary occupied by the extravasated serum. It happens to most of them, either on the first day that this little bladder arises, or on the day after, that its tender cuticle is burst by the accidental rubbing of the clothes, or by the patient's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> to allay the itching which attends this eruption. A thin scab is then formed at the top of the pock, and the swelling of the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> abates, without its ever being turned into pus, as it is in the smallpox. Some few escape being burst; and the little drop of liquor contained in the vesicle at the top of them, grows yellow and thick, and dries into a scab. On the fifth day of the eruption they are almost all dried and covered with a slight crust. The inflammation of these pocks is very small, and the contents of them do not seem to be owing to suppuration, as in the smallpox, but rather to what is extravasated under the cuticle by the serous vessels of the skin, as in a common blister. It is not wonderful, therefore, that this liquor appears so soon as on the second day; and that, upon the cuticle being broken, it is presently succeeded by a slight scab: hence too, as the true skin is so little affected, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> mark or scar is likely to be left, unless in one or two pocks, where, either by being accidentally much fretted or by some extraordinary sharpness of the contents a little ulcer is formed in the skin.\n\nThe patients scarce suffer anything throughout the whole progress of this illness, except some languidness of strength, spirits, and appetite; all which is probably owing to the confining of themselves to their chamber.\n\nRemedies are not likely to be much wanted in a disease attended with hardly any inconvenience, and which in so short a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> is certainly cured of itself.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> marks by which the chickenpox may be distinguished from the smallpox are,\n\n1.

Morton speaks of it as if he supposed it to be a very mild genuine smallpox. But these two distempers are certainly totally different from one another, not only on account of their different appearances above mentioned, but because those who have had the smallpox are capable of being infected with the chickenpox; but those who have once had the chickenpox are not capable of having it again, though to such as have never had this distemper, it seems as infectious as the smallpox. Dr Heberden wetted a thread in the most concocted pus-like liquor of the chickenpox which he could find; and after making a slight inci-\nFrom the great similitude between the two distemper, it is probable, that instead of the smallpox, some persons have been inoculated from the chickenpox; and that the distemper which has succeeded, has been mistaken for the smallpox by hasty or unexperienced observers.\n\nThere is sometimes seen an eruption, concerning which Dr Heberden is in doubt whether it be one of the many unnoticed cutaneous diseases, or only a more malignant sort of chickenpox.\n\nThis disorder is preceded for three or four days by all the symptoms which forerun the chickenpox; but in a much higher degree. On the fourth or fifth day the eruption appears, with a very little abatement of the fever: the pains likewise of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a> and back still continue, to which are joined pains of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUMS\">gums</a>.

All the secretions and excretions are promoted by moderate exercise without doors, and by a gay, cheerful, sprightly temper of mind.\n\nThe drink should be of an opening <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>. All ardent spirits, austere and astringent wines, as port, claret, &c. ought to be avoided. Malt liquor that is fine and of a moderate strength is very proper. Butter-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>, whey, and other watery liquors, are likewise proper, and may be drank in turns, as the patient's inclination directs.\n\nThose who are troubled with costiveness ought, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> possible, to remedy it by diet, as the constant use of medicines for that purpose is attended with many inconveniences, and often with bad consequences. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> becomes necessary, and generally ends in a total relaxation of the bowels, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIGESTION\">indigestion</a>, loss of appetite, wasting of the strength, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>.\n\nThe learned Dr Arbuthnot advises those who are troubled with costiveness to use animal oils, as fresh-butter, cream, marrow, fat broths, &c. He likewise recommends the expressed oils of mild vegetables, as olives, almonds, pistaches, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> themselves; all oily and mild fruits, as figs; decoctions of mealy vegetables; these lubricate the intestines; some saponaceous substances which stimulate gently, as honey, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HYDROMEL\">hydromel</a>, or boiled honey and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, unrefined sugar, &c. are useful.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a> observes, that such lenitive substances are proper for persons of dry atrabiliarian constitutions, who are subject to astriction of the belly and the piles, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> operate when stronger medicinal substances are sometimes ineffectual; but that such lenitive diet hurts those whose bowels are weak and lax. He likewise observes, that all watery substances are lenitive; and that even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> water, whey, sour-milk, and butter-milk, have that effect:\u2014That new milk, especially asses milk, stimulates still more when it soars on the stomach; and that whey, turned sour, will purge strongly:\u2014That most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of fruits are likewise laxative; and that some of them, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAPES\">grapes</a>, will throw such as take them immoderately, into a cholera morbus, or incurable diarrhoea.\n\nWhen the body cannot be kept open without medicine, gentle doses of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-RHUBARB\">rhubarb</a> may be taken twice or thrice a-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>. This is not near so injurious to the stomach as aloes, jalap, or the other drastic purgatives so much in use. Infusions of senna and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANNA\">manna</a> may likewise be taken, or half an ounce of tartarised alkali dissolved in water gruel. About the size of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NUTMEG\">nutmeg</a> of lenitive electuary taken twice or thrice a-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, generally answers the purpose very well.\n\nGENUS CXXIII.

Milman, Animadversiones de Hydrope, 1779.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">Description</a>. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> assumes three different forms: 1. When the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> immediately washes the intestines. 2. When it is interposed between the abdominal muscles and peritoneum. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">Or</a>, 3. When it is contained in sacs and hollow vesicles; in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> it is called the encysted dropsy. Some physicians of great reputation have asserted, that the water was often placed within the duplicature of the peritoneum: but this is alleged by Dr Milman to be a mistake, as that membrane is looked upon by the best anatomists to be single; and he thinks that the above-mentioned physicians have been led into this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> from observing the water collected in the cellular substance of the peritoneum.\n\nIn the beginning of an ascites the patient becomes languid, breathless, and has an aversion to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>: his belly swells; and, when struck, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> of fluctuating water is perceptible; there is a difficulty of breathing when the belly is pressed. There is an almost continual thirst, which in the progress of the disease becomes very urgent; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-URINE\">urine</a> is thick, in small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> coloured. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULSE\">pulse</a> is small and frequent; and as the belly swells, the other parts waste away. A fever at last arises, which constantly increasing, in the end carries off the patient. These symptoms are most urgent where the waters are in immediate contact with the intestines; in the other kinds the rest of the body is less wasted; nor is there so great thirst or difficulty of breathing.\n\nCauses, &c. The immediate cause of dropsy is a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EFFUSION\">effusion</a> of serum by the exhalant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ARTERIES\">arteries</a> than the absorbents take up. This may be occasioned either by too great a quantity of liquid thrown out by the former, or by an inability of the latter to perform their office. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> happens in people whose bodies are of a weak and lax texture, and hence women are more subject to this malady than men; chlorotic girls especially are very apt to become dropsical.\n\nSometimes, however, this disease is occasioned by a debility of the vital powers, by great evacuations of blood, or by acute diseases accidentally protracted beyond their usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>; and although this cause seems very different from a laxity of fibres, yet the dropsy seems to be produced in a similar manner by both. For the vital powers being debilitated by either of these causes, naturally bring on a certain debility and laxity of the solids; and, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, a debility of the solids always brings on a debility of the vital powers; and from this debility of the vital powers in both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> it happens, that those humours which ought to be expelled from the body are not discharged, but accumulate by degrees in its cavities. There is, however, this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between the two kinds of dropsy arising from these two different causes: That in the one which arises from laxity, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> parts are more injured than in that which arises from a debility of the vital powers. In the former, therefore, the water seems to flow out from every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>, and the body swells all over. But when the disease is occasioned by a debility of the vital powers, though the solids be less diseased, yet the power of the heart being much diminished, and the humours scarce propelled through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> vessels, the thin liquids, by which in a healthy state the body is daily recruited, are carried by their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> either into the cavities or into the cellular texture. Hence those aqueous effusions which follow great evacuations of blood, or violent loosenesses, begin in the more depending parts of the body, gradually ascending, till they arrive at the cavity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ABDOMEN\">abdomen</a>, or even the thorax.\n\nBut another and much more sufficient cause for the production of dropsy is an obstruction of the circulation; and this may take <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> from polypi in the heart or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> vessels, and hard swellings in the abdomen. Instances have been observed of a dropsy arising from steatomatous tumors in the omentum, and many more from a scirrhouss <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIVER\">liver</a> or spleen, and from an infarction.\ntion and obstruction of the mesenteric glands, by which means the lymph coming from the extremities is prevented from arriving at the heart. Scirrhosity of the liver, the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> cause of ascites, probably operates by augmenting effusion, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of its preventing the return of the venous blood, the greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the veins from the abdomen going to the formation of the vena portatium.\n\nLastly, Whatever, either within or without the vessels, contracts or shuts up their cavities, produces a more copious and easy transmission of the thin humours through the exhalant arteries, at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> that it prevents their return by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSORBENT\">absorbent</a> veins. This has been established by experiment: For Lower having perforated the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> side of the thorax in a dog, tied the vena cava, and sewed up the wound. The animal languished for a few hours, and then died. On dissection, a great quantity of serum was found in the abdomen, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> laboured under an ascites. In like manner, having tied the jugular veins of another dog, a surprising swelling took place in those parts above the ligatures, and in two days the animal died. On dissection, all the muscles and glands were vastly distended, and quite pellucid, with limpid serum. From these experiments, and some cases of the disease mentioned by different authors, it appears, that when the veins are obstructed so that they cannot receive the arterial blood, the serum is separated as by a filter into the more open cavities and laxer parts of the body, while the thicker part stagnates and is collected in the proper blood-vessels.\n\nThe too great tenacity of the humours is very frequently accused as the cause of dropsy, and many authors have asserted that dropsy might arise merely from a superabundance of water in the blood. For this, some experiments are quoted, from which they would infer, that when a great quantity of aqueous fluid is introduced into the blood, the superfluous fluid ought by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> means to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> through the extremities of the sanguiferous arteries into the veins in the common course of circulation, but by being effused into the cavities should produce a dropsy. But this can only happen when the vital powers are very much diminished; for, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> state, the superfluous quantity is immediately thrown out by the skin or the kidneys; and agreeable to this we have an experiment of Schultzins, who induced a dropsy in a dog by causing him drink a great quantity of water; but he had first bled him almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-AD\">ad</a> deliquium, so that the vital powers were in a manner oppressed by the deluge of water. In this manner do those become hydropic who are seized with the disease on drinking large quantities of water either when wearied with labour, or weakened by some kinds of diseases. Dr Fothergill relates an instance of a person who, being advised to drink plentifully of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-BARLEY_WATER\">barley-water</a>, in order to remove a fever, rashly drank 12 pounds of that liquor every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>, and thus fell into an almost incurable dropsy. But if this quantity had been taken only during the prevalence of the fever, he would in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>, have suffered no inconvenience, as may be inferred from what has been related concerning the dieta aquae used by the Italians.\n\nIt is moreover evident from experiments, that, in a healthy state, not only water is not deposited in the cavities, but that if it is injected into them it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be absorbed, unless some laxity of the solids has already taken place. Dr Musgrave injected into the right side of the thorax of a dog four ounces of warm water; whence a difficulty of breathing and weakness immediately followed. But these symptoms continually lessened, and in the space of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a> the animal seemed to be in as good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> as before. Afterwards he injected 16 ounces of warm water into the left cavity of the thorax in the same dog; the same effects followed, together with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, and strong pulsation of the heart; but he again recovered in the space of a week. Lastly, He injected 18 ounces of water into one side of the thorax, and only six into the other: the same symptoms followed, but vanished in a much shorter time; for within five days the dog was restored to perfect health. During this time, however, he observed that the dog made a greater quantity of urine than usual.\n\nThe remote causes of dropsy are many and various. Whatever relaxes the solids in such a manner as to give an occasion of accumulation to the serous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a>, disposes to the dropsy. A lazy indolent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, rainy wet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, a swampy or low <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, and every thing which conduces to vitiate the viscera, or insensibly to produce obstructions in them, paves the way for a dropsy. Hence those are ready to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> into the disease who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> hard and viscid aliment, such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> people in some countries who use coarse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>, and children who are fed with unwholesome aliments; and the same thing happens to those who drink immoderately of spirituous liquors.\n\nPrognosis. When the dropsy arises from a scirrhus of the liver or spleen, or any of the other viscera, the prognosis must always be unfavourable, and also when it arises from disorders of the lungs. Neither is the case more favourable to those in whom the small vessels are ruptured, and pour out their liquids into the cavity of the abdomen. Those certainly die who have polypi in the vessels, or tumours compressing the veins and vessels of the abdomen. A dropsy arising from obstructions in the mesenteric glands is likewise difficult to cure, whether such obstructions arise from a bad <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of body, or from any other cause; if we can, however, by any means remove the disease of the glands, the dropsy soon ceases. But in those who fall into dropsy without any disease preceding, it is not quite so dangerous; and even though a disease has preceded, if the patient's strength be not greatly weakened, if the respiration be free, and the person be not affected with any particular pain, we may entertain great hopes of a cure. But where a great loss of blood is followed by a fever, and that by a dropsy, the patients almost always die, and that in a short time: those, however, are very frequently cured who fall into this disease without any preceding hemorrhage.\n\nCure. In the cure of this disease authors chiefly mention two indications: 1. To expel the effused water; and, 2. To prevent its being again collected. But before we proceed to speak of the remedies, it is necessary to take notice, that by the laws of the animal economy, if a great evacuation of a fluid takes place in any part of the body, all the other fluids in the body are directed towards that part, and those which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIE\">lie</a>, as it were, lurking in different parts will be immediately absorbed, and thrown out by the same passage. Hence the humours which in hydropic per-\nsons are extravasated into the different cavities of the body will be thrown into the intestines, and evacuated by purgatives; or by diuretics will be thrown upon the kidneys, and evacuated by urine. It is, however, not only necessary to excite these evacuations in order to remove this malady, but they must be assiduously promoted and kept up till the abundant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a> is totally expelled. For this reason Sydenham has advised purgatives to be administered every day, unless, either through the too great weakness of the body, or the violent operation of the purgative, it shall be necessary to interpose a day or two now and then; because if any considerable intervals be allowed to take place between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXHIBITION\">exhibition</a> of the purgatives, an opportunity is given to the waters of collecting again. In this method, however, there is the following inconvenience, that, when the waters are totally evacuated, the strength is at the same time so much exhausted, that the distemper commonly returns in a very short time. Hence our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> hopes of curing a dropsy consist in gently evacuating the waters by means of diuretics. But the efficacy of these is generally very doubtful. Dr Freund has long ago observed, that this part of medicine is of all others the most lame and imperfect; but a French physician, Mr Bacher, lately discovered, as he alleges, a method of making the diuretics much more successful. His reputation became at last so great, that the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> thought proper to purchase his secret for a great sum of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>. The basis of his medicine was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> hellebore root, the malignant qualities of which he pretended to correct in the following manner: A quantity of the dried roots of black hellebore were pounded, and then put into a glazed earthen vessel, and afterwards sprinkled with spirit of wine. They were suffered to stand for twelve hours, stirring them about twice or thrice during that space of time. They were then sprinkled again, and at last good Rhenish wine was poured on till it stood six fingers above the roots. The mixture was frequently agitated with a wooden spatula; and as the wine was imbibed by the roots, more was poured on, so as to keep it always at the same height for 48 hours. The whole was then put on the fire and boiled for half an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>, after which the decoction was violently pressed out; the same quantity of wine was added as at first, and the mixture boiled as before. After the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> the woody residuum was thrown away as useless. Both the strained liquors were then mixed together with two parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> water to one of the decoction. The whole is afterwards evaporated in a silver vessel to the consistence of a syrup. One part of the extract is again mixed with two parts of boiling water, and the whole inspissated as before.\u2014By this means, says he, the volatile nauseous acrid particles are separated by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a>, and the fixed ones remain corrected and prepared for medicinal uses; adding, towards the end, a ninth part of old brandy, and evaporating to the consistence of turpentine. Mr Bacher reasons a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> on the way in which this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> corrects the medicine; but tells us, that notwithstanding the improvement, his pills will not have the desired effect unless properly made up. For forming them, they ought to be mixed with matters both of an invasivating and indurating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>; yet so prepared that it will be readily soluble in the stomach, even of a person much debilitated. For answering these purposes, he chose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MYRRH\">myrrh</a> and carduus benedictus, and he gives the following receipt for the formation of his pills:\n\n\"Take of the extract of hellebore prepared as above directed, and of solution of myrrh, each one ounce; of powdered carduus benedictus, three drams and a scruple. Mix them together, and form into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>, dividing it into pills of a grain and a half each.\" To these pills Mr Bacher gives the name of the pilulae tonicae, from an idea, that, while they evacuate the water, they at the same time <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> as tonics; and thus, from augmenting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the lymphatics, prevent the return of the disease. And if both these intentions could be effectually answered by the use of the same remedy, it would unquestionably be of great importance in practice.\n\nThe effects of these pills were, we are told, very surprising. Dr Daigman relates that he gave them to eighteen hydropic patients at once; and these he divided into three classes, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of the disease with which they were affected. The first class contained those who laboured under an anasarca following intermittent fevers. The second class contained those who had an anasarca, together with some degree of ascites, arising from tedious febrile disorders. All these were cured; but these two classes consisted of such cases as are most easily removed. But the third contained six who were seized with a most violent anasarca and ascites, after being much weakened by tedious disorders, and of consequence in whom the disease was very difficult to be cured. Even of these, however, four were cured, and the other two died. The body of one of these being dissected, both sides of the cavity of the thorax were found to be full of a blackish-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> water. The lungs were unsound; there was a polypous concretion in the right ventricle of the heart; the liver and spleen were hard, and of a preterminal bulk; and the glands of the mesentery were obstructed and infarcted. In the other, the liver and pancreas were scirrhouss, and the spleen very hard.\n\nThe same medicines were given by De Horne to eight persons, six of whom had both an anasarca and ascites, but the other two only an ascites. Four of these recovered; three died without being freed from the dropsy; one in whom the dropsy was cured died in a short time after, having for some time before his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> become speechless.\n\nBy these patients ten of the pills were taken at once; and the same dose repeated to the third time, with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> of an hour betwixt each dose. At first they proved purgative, and then diuretic: by which last evacuation they finally cured the disease. But though Mr Bacher was firmly of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> that his pills cured the dropsy by reason of the above-related correction, yet it is certain that, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of other practitioners, these very pills have failed, unless they also made use of the same regimen recommended by that physician; while, on the other hand, it is also certain, that different medicines will prove equally efficacious in dropsical cases, provided this regimen is made use of.\n\nFor a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of ages it has been recommended to dropsical patients to abstain as much as possible from drink, and thus to the torments of their disease was added that of an intolerable thirst; and how great this torment was, we may understand from an example of a friend of King Antigonus, who, having\nbeen closely watched both by order of the physicians and also of the king, was so unable to bear the raging thirst occasioned by his disease, that he swallowed his own excrements and urine, and thus speedily put an end to his life. Dr Milman shows at great length the pernicious tendency of this practice. He maintains that it is quite contrary to the sentiments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HIPPOCRATES\">Hippocrates</a> and the best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> physicians. He asserts, that unless plenty of diluting drink be given, the best diuretics can have no effect. He condemns also in the strongest terms the practice of giving dropsical patients only dry, hard, and indigestible aliments. These would oppress the stomach even of the most healthy; and how much more must they do so to those who are already debilitated by labouring under a tedious disorder! By what means also are these aliments to be dissolved in the stomach when drink is withheld? In this disease the saliva is viscid, and in small quantity; from whence it may be reasonably conjectured, that the rest of the fluids are of the same nature, and the gastric juices likewise depraved. Thus the aliments lie long in the stomach; and if the viscera were formerly free of obstructions, they are now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a>; the strength fails; perspiration and other excretions are obstructed; the viscid and pituitous humours produced by these kinds of food float about the precordia, and increase the disease, while the surface of the body becomes quite dry. Nay, so much does this kind of diet conspire with the disease, that 100 pounds of fluid will sometimes be imbibed in a few days by hydropic persons who take no drink. Even in health, if the body from any cause becomes dry, or deprived of a considerable part of its juices, as by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUNGER\">hunger</a>, labour, &c. it will imbibe a considerable quantity of moisture from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>; so that we must impute the above-mentioned extraordinary inhalation, in part at least, to the denial of drink, and to the nature of the aliment given to the sick. The following is the account given by Sir Francis Milman of his practice in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MIDDLESEX\">Middlesex</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">hospital</a>.\n\nIf the patient be not very much debilitated, he is sometimes treated with the purging waters, and a dose of jalap and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CALOMEL\">calomel</a> alternately. On the intermediate days he gets a saline mixture, with 40 or 60 drops of acetum scillitium every sixth hour; drinking with the purgatives oat-gruel and some thin broths. That he might the better ascertain what share the liquids given along with the medicines had in producing a copious flow of urine, he sometimes gave the medicines in the beginning of the distemper without allowing the drink; but though the swellings were usually diminished a little by the purgatives, the urine still <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> scanty, and the patients were greatly weakened. Fearing, therefore, lest, by following this course, the strength of the sick might be too much reduced, he then began his course of diuretic medicines, giving large quantities of barley water with a little sal diureticus; by which means, sometimes in the short space of 48 hours after the course was begun, the urine flowed out in very large quantity: but as saline drinks are very disagreeable to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, a drink was composed purposely for hydropic persons, of half an ounce of supertartrite of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POTASH\">potash</a>, dissolved in two pounds of barley-water, made agreeably sweet with syrup, adding one or two ounces of French brandy.\n\nTo this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> Sir Francis Milman was induced by the great praises given to supertartrite of potash by some physicians in hydropic cases. In the Acta Bononiensia, 15 cases of hydropic patients are related who were cured only by taking half an ounce of cream of tartar daily. But it is remarkable, that by these very patients the cream of tartar was taken for 29, 30, nay 40 days, often without any perceptible effect; yet when dissolved in a large quantity of water, it showed its salutary effects frequently within as many hours, by producing a plentiful flow of urine. This liquor is now the common drink of hydropic patients in the hospital above mentioned, of which they drink at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> along with their medicines.\n\nAmong purgative medicines Sir Francis Milman recommends the radix senecae; but says the decoction of it, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> Pharmacopoeia is too strong, as he always found it excite vomiting when prepared as there directed, and thus greatly to distress the patients: but when only half an ounce or six drams of the root are used to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> of decoction, instead of a whole ounce as directed by the Edinburgh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a>, he finds it an excellent remedy; and though it may sometimes induce a little vomiting, and frequently a nausea, yet it seldom failed to procure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> or ten stools a day, and sometimes also proved diuretic. But we must take care not to be too free in the use of seneca, or any other purgative, if the patients be very weak; and therefore, after having used purgatives for some time, it will be proper to depend upon diuretics entirely for perfecting the cure; and of the success of this method our author gives some very remarkable instances. But he observes, that after the dropsy is removed, the patients will sometimes die without any evident cause; and of this it is proper that the physicians should be aware. It is remarkable with what ease a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLUX\">flux</a> of urine is induced in those who have a scirrhus liver; while, on the other hand, in one who had the mesenteric glands obstructed, along with a scirrhus state of the liver and vitiated state of the lungs, the most powerful diuretics proved ineffectual. In some cases Sir Francis Milman thinks the kidneys may be so pressed with the weight of the water, as to be unable to perform their office. With regard, however, to diuretics in general, it may be remarked, that the operation of none of them can be certainly depended upon. In particular constitutions, and at particular times, one will be observed to succeed, after another, though commonly much more powerful, has been tried in vain. Accordingly various <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of this kind are often used in succession. Recourse is particularly often had to the root of taraxacum, of colchicum, and of squills; the latter, especially when combined with calomel, is often found to be a very powerful diuretic. And indeed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a> in different forms, probably from acting as a decostruent, is often of very great use in dropsical complaints. Among other diuretics, the lactuca virosa has of late been highly extolled by Dr Collins of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIENNA\">Vienna</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NICOTIANA\">nicotiana</a> tabacum by Dr Fowler of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a>: but neither has been extensively introduced into practice, although we have known some instances in which the latter, in particular, has been used with great advantage.\n\nThe water having been drawn off, we are to put the patient on a course of strengtheners; such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CINCHONA\">cinchona</a>, with some of the warm aromatics, and a due proportion of\nof <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-RHUBARB\">rhubarb</a> infused in wine and chalybeates. Gentle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a>, and frictions on the belly, with such a course of diet as shall be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> and nourishing, are also to be enjoined; and it may be observed, that the use of tonic medicines is by no means to be delayed till a complete evacuation of the water can be obtained. On the contrary, by alternating, and even combining the use of evacuants and tonics, the influence of both is often very much promoted.","sp":461,"ep":465},{"h":"END OF THE THIRTEENTH VOLUME","t":"DIRECTIONS FOR PLACING THE PLATES OF VOL.

But many circumstances prevent the steadiness necessary in pursuing these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a>; and therefore in such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, unless great care be taken to avoid the exciting causes, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> may frequently return, and, in many cases, the preventing of paroxysms is chiefly to be obtained by avoiding those exciting causes already enumerated.\n\nA due <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> in avoiding these different causes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> certainly prevent fits of the gout; and the taking care that the exciting causes be never applied in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, will certainly render fits more moderate when they do come on. But, upon the whole, it will appear, that a very strict attention to the general conduct of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> is in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> necessary; and therefore, when the predisposition has taken <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, it will be extremely difficult to avoid the disease.\n\nDr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CULLEN\">Cullen</a> is firmly persuaded, that by obviating the predisposition, and by avoiding the exciting causes, the gout may be entirely prevented: but, as the measures necessary for this purpose will, in most cases, be pursued with difficulty, and even with reluctance, men have been very desirous to find a medicine which might answer the purpose without any restraint on their manner of living. To gratify this desire, physicians have proposed, and, to take advantage of it, empirics have feigned, many remedies. Of what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> several of these remedies have been, it is difficult to say: but of those which are unknown, we conclude, from their having been only of temporary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>, and from their having soon fallen into neglect, that they have been either inert or pernicious. We shall therefore make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> inquiry after them; and shall now remark only upon one or two known remedies for the gout which have been lately fashionable.\n\nOne of these is what has been named in England the Portland powder. This is not a new medicine, but is mentioned by Galen, and, with some little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>, has been mentioned by the writers of almost every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> since that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>. It appears to have been at times in fashion, and to have again fallen into neglect; and Dr Cullen thinks that this last has been owing to its having been found to be, in many instances, pernicious. In every instance which he has known of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXHIBITION\">exhibition</a> for the length of time prescribed, the persons who had taken it were indeed afterwards free from any inflammatory affection of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a>; but they were affected with many symptoms of the atonic gout; and many, soon after finishing their course of the medicine, have been attacked with apoplexy, asthma, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DROPSY\">dropsy</a>, which proved fatal.\n\nAnother remedy which has had the appearance of preventing the gout, is alkali in various forms; such as the fixed alkali, both mild and caustic, lime <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOAP\">soap</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSORBENT\">absorbent</a> earths; and of late the alkaline aerated water has been more fashionable than any other. Since it became <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> to exhibit these medicines in nephritic and calculous cases, it has often happened that they were given to those who were at the same time subject to the gout; and it has been observed, that under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of these medicines, gouty persons have been longer free from the fits of their disease. That, however, the use of these medicines has entirely prevented the returns of gout, Dr Cullen does not know; because he never pushed the use of them for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> time, being apprehensive that the long-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> use of them might produce a hurtful change in the state of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a>.\n\nAs the prevention of gout depends very much on supporting the tone of the stomach, and avoiding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIGESTION\">indigestion</a>; so costiveness, by occasioning this, is very hurtful to gouty persons. It is therefore necessary for such persons to prevent or remove costiveness, by a laxative medicine, when needful; but it is at the same time proper, that the medicine employed should be such as may keep the belly regular, without much purging. Aloetias, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-RHUBARB\">rhubarb</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNESIA\">magnesia</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALBA\">alba</a>, oleum ricini, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a> of sulphur, may be employed, as the one or the other may happen to be best suited to particular persons.\n\nThese are the several measures to be pursued in the intervals of the paroxysms; and we are next to mention the measures proper during the time of them.\n\nAs during the time of paroxysms the body is in a feverish state, no irritation should then be added to it; every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a>, therefore, of the antiphlogistic regimen, except the application of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, ought to be strictly observed.\n\nAn exception to the general rule, however, may occur when the tone of the stomach is weak, and when the patient has been much more accustomed to the use of strong drink; for then it may be allowable, and even necessary, to give some animal food and a little wine.\n\nThat no irritation is to be added to the system during the paroxysms of gout, except in the cases mentioned, is agreed upon among physicians: but it is a more difficult matter to determine, whether, during the time of paroxysms any measures may be pursued to moderate the violence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REACTION\">reaction</a> and of inflammation. Dr Sydenham has given it as his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that the more violent the inflammation and pain, the paroxysm will be the shorter, as well as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> between the present and the next paroxysm longer; and, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> this opinion be admitted as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a>, it will forbid the use of any remedies which might moderate the inflammation; which is, to a certain degree, undoubtedly necessary for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> of the body. On the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, acute pain presses for relief; and although a certain degree of inflammation may seem absolutely necessary, there is reason to believe, a moderate degree of it may answer the purpose; and it is even probable, that in many cases the violence of inflammation may weaken the tone of the parts, and thereby invite a return of paroxysms. It seems to be in this way, that, as the disease advances, the paroxysms become more frequent.\nFrom these last considerations, it seems probable, that, during the time of paroxysm some measures may be taken to moderate the violence of the inflammation and pain, and particularly, that in first paroxysms, and in the young and vigorous, blood-letting at the arm may be practised with advantage; but this practice cannot be repeated often with safety; because blood-letting not only weakens the tone of the system, but also contributes to produce plethora. However, bleeding by leeches on the foot, and upon the inflamed part, may be practised and repeated with greater safety; and instances have been known of its having been employed with safety to moderate and shorten paroxysms; but how far it may be carried, we have not had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> enough to determine.\n\nBesides blood-letting and the antiphlogistic regimen, it has been proposed to employ remedies for moderating the inflammatory spasm of the part affected, such as warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATHING\">bathing</a> and emollient poultices. These have sometimes been employed with advantage and safety; but, at other times, have been found to give occasion to a retrocession of the gout.\n\nBlistering is a very effectual means of relieving and dissolving a paroxysm of the gout; but has also frequently had the effect of rendering it retrocedent. The stinging with nettles is analogous to blistering; and probably would be attended with the same danger. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> with moxa, or other substances, is a remedy of the same kind; but though not found hurtful, there is no sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> of its proving a radical cure.\n\nCamphor, and some aromatic oils, have the power of allaying the pain, and of removing the inflammation from the part affected: but these remedies <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> make the inflammation only shift from one part to another, and therefore with the hazard of its falling upon a part where it may be more dangerous; and they have sometimes rendered the gout retrocedent.\n\nAmong other remedies which have of late been highly extolled during a paroxysm of gout, some have recommended the use of strong purgatives frequently repeated; others have highly extolled the assiduous application of cold water to the affected foot. But we may safely venture to assert that both practices are very doubtful, if not very dangerous.\n\nFrom these reflections it will appear, that some danger must attend every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> application to the parts affected during a paroxysm; and that therefore the common practice of committing the person to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FLANNEL\">flannel</a> alone, is established upon the best foundation. Opiates give the most certain relief from pain; but, when given in the beginning of gouty paroxysms, it has by some been thought that they occasion these to return with greater violence. When, however, the paroxysms shall have abated in their violence, but still continue to return, so as to occasion painful and restless nights, opiates may be given with safety and advantage; especially in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of persons advanced in life, and who have been often affected with the disease. When, after paroxysms have ceased, some swelling and stiffness still remain in the joints, these symptoms are to be discussed by the diligent use of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRUSH\">brush</a>. Purging immediately after a paroxysm will be always employed with the hazard of bringing it on again; but keeping the belly gently open even during the continuance of the paroxysm is highly proper.\n\nThus far of the regular gout. We now proceed to consider the management of the disease when it has become <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a>.\n\nIn the atonic gout, the cure is to be accomplished by carefully avoiding all debilitating causes; and by employing, at the same time, the means of strengthening the system in general, and the stomach in particular.\n\nFor strengthening the system in general, Dr Cullen recommends frequent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> on horseback, and moderate walking. Cold bathing also may answer the purpose; and may be safely employed, if it appear to be powerful in stimulating the system, and be not applied when the extremities are threatened with any pain.\n\nFor supporting the tone of the system in general, when threatened with atonic gout, some animal food ought to be employed, and the more acescent vegetables ought to be avoided. In the same case, some wine also may be necessary; but it should be in moderate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a>, and of the least acescent kinds, and if every kind of wine shall be found to increase the acidity of the stomach, ardent spirits and water must be employed.\n\nFor strengthening the stomach, bitters and the Peruvian bark may be used; but care must be taken that they be not constantly employed for any great length of time.\n\nThe most effectual medicine for strengthening the stomach is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, which may be employed under various preparations; but the best appears to be the rust in fine powder, which may be given in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> doses.\n\nFor supporting the tone of the stomach, aromatics may be exhibited; but should be used with caution, as the frequent and copious use of them has an opposite effect; and they should therefore be given only in compliance with former habits, or for palliating present symptoms.\n\nWhen the stomach happens to be liable to indigestion, gentle vomits may be frequently given, and proper laxatives should be always employed to obviate or to remove costiveness.\n\nIn the atonic gout, or in persons liable to it, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> against cold is especially necessary; and the most certain means of doing this, is by repairing to a warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> during the winter season. In the more violent cases, blistering the lower extremities may be useful; but that remedy should be avoided when any pain threatens the extremities. In persons liable to the atonic gout, issues may be established in the extremities as in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> a supplement to the disease.\n\nA <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> case of the irregular gout, is the retrocedent.\n\nWhen this affects the stomach and intestines, relief is to be instantly attempted by the free use of strong wines, joined with aromatics, and given warm; or, if these shall not prove powerful enough, ardent spirits must be employed, and are to be given in a large dose. In moderate attacks, ardent spirits, impregnated with garlic or with asafoetida, may be used; or, even without the ardent spirits, a solution of asafoetida with the volatile alkali, may answer the purpose. Opiates are often an effectual remedy; and may be\njoined with aromatics, as in the electuarium opiatum; or they may be usefully joined with volatile alkali and camphor. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MUSK\">Musk</a> has likewise proved useful in this disease.\n\nWhen the affection of the stomach is accompanied with vomiting, this may be encouraged, by taking draughts of warm water, at first with wine, and afterwards without it; having at length recourse, if necessary, to some of the remedies above mentioned, and particularly the opiates.\n\nIn like manner, if the intestines be affected with diarrhoea, this is to be at first encouraged by taking plentifully of weak broth; and when this shall have been done sufficiently, the tumult is to be quieted by opiates.\n\nWhen the retrocedent gout shall affect the lungs, and produce asthma, this is to be cured by opiates, by antispasmodics, and perhaps by blistering on the back or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>.\n\nWhen the gout, leaving the extremities, shall affect the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, and produce pain, vertigo, apoplexy, or palsy, our resources are very precarious. The most probable means of relief is, blistering the head; and, if the gout shall have receded very entirely from the extremities, blisters may be applied to these also. Together with these blisterings, aromatics, and the volatile alkali, may be thrown into the stomach.\n\nThe third case of the irregular gout is the misplaced; that is when the inflammatory affection of the gout, instead of falling upon the extremities, falls upon some internal part. In this case, the disease is to be treated by blood-letting, and by such other remedies as would be proper in an idiopathic inflammation of the same parts.\n\nWhether the translation so frequently made from the extremities to the kidneys, is to be considered as an instance of the misplaced gout, seems uncertain: but Dr Cullen is disposed to think it something different; and therefore is of opinion, that, in the nephalgia calcusa produced upon this occasion, the remedies of inflammation are to be employed no farther than they may be sometimes necessary in that disease, arising from other causes than the gout.\n\nBesides what have been mentioned, a variety of other practices may be necessary and proper against the various anomalous symptoms, which are at times produced by irregular gout. But of these we cannot propose to treat. And we may conclude with observing, that in every form of gout, the cure principally depends on avoiding occasional causes, particularly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a> and laziness.\n\n**Genus XXV.

The hot stage of this is frequently attended with a confusion of the head, and some degree of delirium; and almost always with drowsiness, and perhaps <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMA\">coma</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULSE\">pulse</a> is always frequent, and commonly full and hard.\u2014When these symptoms have continued for one, two, or at most three days, an erythema appears on some part of the face. This at first is of no great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, but gradually spreads from the part it first occupied to the other parts of the face, till it has affected the whole; and frequently from the face it spreads over the hairy scalp, or descends on some part of the cheek. As the redness spreads, it commonly leaves, or at least is abated in the parts it had before occupied. All the parts which the redness affects are also affected with some swelling, which continues for some time after the redness has abated. The whole face becomes considerably turgid; and the eyelids are often so much swelled as entirely to shut up the eyes. When the redness and swelling have continued for some time, there commonly arise, sooner or later, blisters of a larger or smaller size on several parts of the face. These contain a thin colourless liquor, which sooner or later runs out. The surface of the skin, in the blistered places, sometimes becomes livid and blackish; but this seldom goes deeper, or discovers any degree of gangrene affecting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTIS\">cutis</a> vera. On the parts of the face not affected with blisters, the cuticle suffers, towards the end of the disease, a considerable desquamation. Sometimes the tumour of the eyelids ends in a suppuration.\n\nThe inflammation coming upon the face does not produce any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REMISSION\">remission</a> of the fever which had before prevailed; and sometimes the fever increases with the spreading and increasing inflammation. The inflamma-\ntion commonly continues for eight or ten days; and for the same time, the fever and symptoms attending it also continue. In the progress of the disease, the delirium and coma attending it sometimes go on increasing, and the patient dies apoplectic on the seventh, ninth, or eleventh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> of the disease. In such cases it has been commonly supposed, that the disease is translated from the external to the internal parts. But Dr Cullen thinks that the affection of the brain is merely a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> from the external affection, as this continues increasing at the same time with the internal. When a fatal event does not take place, the inflammation, after having affected the whole face, and perhaps the other external parts of the head, ceases, and with that the fever also; and, without any other crisis, the patient returns to his ordinary health. This disease is not commonly contagious; but as it may arise from an acrid matter externally applied, so it is possible that the disease may sometimes be communicated from one person to another; and certainly there are several well authenticated instances of its prevailing in such a manner, even in particular wards of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOSPITALS\">hospitals</a>, as to leave no doubt respecting its contagious nature. Persons who have once laboured under this disease are liable to returns of it.\n\nPrognosis. The event of this disease may be foreseen from the state of the symptoms which denote more or less the affection of the brain. If neither delirium nor coma come on, the disease is seldom attended with any danger; but when these symptoms appear early in the disease, and are in a considerable degree, the utmost danger is to be apprehended.\n\nCure. The erysipelas of the face is to be cured, according to the opinion of most practitioners, much in the same manner as phlegmonic inflammations; by blood-letting, cooling purgatives, and by employing every part of the antiphlogistic regimen. Many observations, however, would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> us to conclude, that in not a few cases the concomitant fever has here a tendency to the typhoid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYPE\">type</a>; and therefore evacuations, apparently serviceable in the first instance, have afterwards a bad effect. The evacuations of blood-letting and purging are to be employed more or less according to the urgency of symptoms; particularly those which mark an affection of the brain. As the pyrexia continues, and often increases with the inflammation of the face, so the evacuations above mentioned are to be employed at any time of the disease. When, however, the fever, in place of marks of the phlogistic diathesis, particularly a full, hard, and strong pulse, is attended with symptoms of great debility, and with a small pulse easily compressible; evacuations, particularly under the form of blood-letting, must be used with very great caution. Even in such cases, however, the use of refrigerant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHARTICS\">cathartics</a> may still be persisted in with more safety and greater advantage. But whether evacuants have been employed or not, when symptoms of debility run to a great height, and marks of a putrescent tendency appear, recourse must be had to wine and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CINCHONA\">cinchona</a>. In cases which at the commencement require evacuation, these are often in the after periods employed with very great benefit.\n\nIn this, as in other diseases of the head, when that part happens to be the seat of erysipelas, it is proper to put the patient, as often as he can easily bear it, into somewhat of an erect posture; and as there is always an external affection, so various external applications have been proposed to be made to the part affected; but almost all of them are of doubtful effect.\n\nAn erysipelas frequently appears on other parts of the body besides the face, and such other erysipelatous inflammations frequently end in suppuration; but these cases are seldom dangerous. At coming on they are sometimes attended with drowsiness, and even with some delirium; but this seldom happens, and these symptoms do not continue after the inflammation is formed; and Dr Cullen does not remember to have seen an instance of the translation of an inflammation from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a> to an internal part; and though these inflammations of the limbs be attended with pyrexia, they seldom require the same evacuations as the erysipelas of the face.\n\nSp.

Of this distemper Dr Cullen declines giving any particular history, because he never <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> it; from the accounts of other authors, however, he is of opinion, that the circumstances peculiarly characteristic of it, especially of its more violent and dangerous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, are, 1. The great loss of strength in the animal functions, which often appears early in the disease. 2. The stupor, giddiness, and consequent staggering, which resembles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRUNKENNESS\">drunkenness</a>, or the headache and various delirium, all of them denoting a great disorder in the functions of the brain. 3. Anxiety, palpitation, syncope, and especially the weakness and irregularity of the pulse, denoting a considerable disturbance in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the heart. 4. Nausea and vomiting, particularly the vomiting of bile, which shows an\nan accumulation of vitiated bile in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GALL\">gall</a>-bladder and biliary ducts, and from thence derived into the intestines and stomach; and which denote a considerable spasm, and loss of tone in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> vessels on the surface of the body. 5. The buboes and carbuncles, which denote an acrimony prevailing in the fluids; and, lastly, The petechiae, hemorrhages, and colligative diarrhoea, which denote a putrescent tendency prevailing in a great degree in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of blood.\n\nTo these characteristics of the plague enumerated by Dr Cullen, we shall add one mentioned by Sir John Pringle, which, though perhaps less frequent than the others, yet seems worthy of notice. It is this, That in the plague there is an extraordinary enlargement of the heart and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIVER\">liver</a>. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> dissections of bodies dead of the plague at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARSEILLES\">Marseilles</a>, this extraordinary enlargement of the heart is taken notice of in all of them, and of the liver in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> of them. The account was sent to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> by M. Didier, one of the physicians to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> of France, and has been published in the Philosophical Transactions. In the first case, the author takes notice, that \"the heart was of an extraordinary bigness; and the liver was of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> size.\u2014Case 2. The heart was of a prodigious bigness, and the liver much enlarged.\u2014Case 3. The heart double the natural bigness.\u2014Case 4. The heart was very large, and the liver was bigger and harder than ordinary.\u2014Case 5. The heart was of a prodigious bigness. Case 6. The heart was larger than in its natural state; the liver also was very large.\u2014Case 7. The heart was of a prodigious size, and the liver was very large.\u2014Case 8. The heart was much larger than natural, and the liver of a prodigious size.\u2014Case 9. The heart was double the natural bigness, and the liver was larger than ordinary.\"\n\nThis preternatural enlargement, Sir J. Pringle thinks, is owing to the relaxation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> parts, by which means they become unable to resist the impetus of blood, and therefore are easily extended; as in the case of infancy, where the growth is remarkably quick. And a similar enlargement he takes notice of in the scurvy, and other putrid diseases.\n\nA very elaborate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> has lately been published on the subject of the plague by Dr Patrick Russel, formerly physician to the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-FACTORY\">factory</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALEPPO\">Aleppo</a>. In this work, a very full history is given of the various forms and varieties of the disease. He makes particular observations on the following symptoms, which, in addition to the pestilential eruptions, he considers as the most important concomitants of plague, viz, fever, delirium, coma, impediment or loss of speech, deafness, muddiness of the eyes, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> tongue, state of the pulse, respiration, anxiety, pain at the heart, inquietude, debility, fainting, convulsion, appearances of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-URINE\">urine</a>, perspiration, vomiting, looseness, and hemorrhage; and he concludes these remarks with some observations on the occurrence of the plague with pregnant women.\n\nTo point out more distinctly the stable varieties of the disease, he arranges the pestilential cases which fell under his observation at Aleppo under six classes: and he concludes his description with a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> and particular account of the pestilential eruptions, appearing under the form either of buboes, carbuncles, or other exanthemata. The presence of the two first, he observes, either separately or conjunctly, leaves the nature of the distemper unequivocal. But fatal has been the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> of rashly pronouncing a distemper not to be a plague from their absence. Buboes affected the inguinal, axillary, parotid, maxillary, and cervical glands. But the first were the most commonly affected, and the two latter seldom observed to swell, without either the parotid swelling at the time, or soon after. Of the carbuncles, Dr Russel describes five different varieties. The other exanthemata, which he observed sometimes, though less frequently, attending the plague, were petechiae, a marbled appearance of the skin, an erysipelas redness, streaks of a reddish purple or livid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, vibices or weals, and large blue or purple spots, the maculae magna of authors. In some cases, an extraordinary concurrence of eruptions took place, which was chiefly observed among children under 10 years of age.\n\nCauses, &c. From a consideration of the symptoms above mentioned, Dr Cullen concludes, that the plague is owing to a specific contagion, often suddenly producing the most considerable debility in the nervous system, or moving powers, and a general putrescence in the fluids. Dr Russel also considers the disease as being universally the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of what may be called pestilential contagion; and has judiciously repelled the objections which have been brought against this doctrine.\n\nPrevention. Here we must refer to all those methods of preventing and removing the incipient contagion of putrid fevers, which have been so fully enumerated. Dr Cullen is persuaded that the disease never arises in the northern parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, but in consequence of being imported from some other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a>'s first care, therefore, ought to be, to prevent the importation; and this may generally be done by a due attention to bills of health, and to the proper performance of quarantines.\u2014With respect to the latter, he is of opinion, that the quarantines of persons may with safety be much less than 40 days; and if this were allowed, the execution of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-QUARANTINE\">quarantine</a> would be more exact and certain, as the temptation to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> it would be in a great measure avoided. With respect to the quarantine of goods, it cannot be perfect unless the suspected goods be unpacked, duly ventilated, and other means be employed for correcting the infection they may carry; and if all this be properly done, it is probable that the time commonly prescribed for quarantine may also be shortened.\n\nA second measure in the way of prevention is required, when an infection has reached and prevailed in any place, to prevent that infection from spreading into others. This can only be done by preventing the inhabitants or the goods of any infected place from going out of it till they have undergone a proper quarantine.\n\nThe third measure, and which ought to be employed with great care, is, to prevent the infection from spreading among the inhabitants of a place in which it has arisen. And in this case, a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> may be done by the magistrate: 1. By allowing as many of the inhabitants as are free from infection, and are not necessary to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> of the place, to go out of it. 2. By discharging all assemblies, or unnecessary intercourse of the people. 3. By ordering some necessary communications to be performed without contact.\ncontact. 4. By making such arrangements and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> as may render it easy for the families remaining to shut themselves up in their own houses. 5. By allowing persons to quit houses where an infection appears, upon condition that they go into lazarettos. 6. By ventilating, and purifying, or destroying, at the public expense, all infected goods. 7. By avoiding hospitals, and providing separate apartments for infected persons.\n\nThe fourth and last part of the business of prevention respects the conduct of persons necessarily remaining in infected places, especially those obliged to have some communication with persons infected. Those obliged to remain in places infected, but not to have any near communication with the sick, must avoid all near communication with other persons or their goods; and it is probable, that a small distance will serve, if, at the same time, there be no stream of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> to carry the effluvia of persons or goods to some distance. Those who are obliged to have a near communication with the sick ought to avoid any of the debilitating causes which render the body susceptible of infection, as a spare diet, intemperance in drinking, excess in venery, cold, fear, or other depressing passions of the mind. A full diet of animal food is also to be avoided, because it increases the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRRITABILITY\">irritability</a> of the body, and favours the operation of contagion; and indigestion, whether from the quantity or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of the food, contributes very much to the same end.\n\nBesides these, it is probable that the moderate use of wine and spirituous liquors, moderate exercise, and the cold bath, may be of use; tonic medicines also, of which cinchona is deservedly accounted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a>, may be used with some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> of success. If anything is to be expected from antiseptics, Dr Cullen thinks camphor preferable to every other. In general, however, every one is to be indulged in the medicine of which he has the best opinion, provided it is not evidently hurtful. Whether issues be useful in preserving from the effects of contagion, is a matter of doubt. Dr Russel in his treatise enters very fully into the consideration of the means of prevention, both with respect to quarantines, lazarettos, and bills of health. He is of opinion, that the present laws on these subjects are in many respects defective; and he thinks, that a set of new regulations would have the best chance of a deliberate and impartial discussion in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a>, if the inquiry were taken at a time free from all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> of immediate danger.\n\nCure. According to Dr Cullen, the indications are the same as in fever in general, but are not all equally important. The measures for moderating the violence of reaction, which operate by diminishing the action of the heart and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ARTERIES\">arteries</a>, have seldom, he thinks, any place here, excepting that the antiphlogistic regimen is generally proper. Some physicians have recommended bleeding; and Sydenham even seems to think it an effectual cure; but Dr Cullen supposes, that for the most part it is unnecessary, and in many cases might do much hurt. Dr Russel, however, who on this subject speaks from experience and actual observation, is of a different opinion. With most of his patients, a single bleeding was employed with advantage; and even where the sick under his inspection were bled oftener than once, he did not find that the low state was thereby hurried on. Purging has also been recommended; and in some degree it may be useful in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> off the putrescent matter frequently present in the intestines; but a large evacuation in this way may certainly be hurtful.\n\nThe moderating the violence of reaction, as far as it can be done, by taking off the spasm of the extreme vessels, is a measure, in Dr Cullen's opinion, of the utmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> in the cure of the plague; and the whole of the means formerly mentioned, as suited to this indication, are extremely proper. The giving an emetic, at the first approach of the disease, would probably be of great service; and it is probable, that, at some other periods of the disease, emetics might be useful, both by evacuating bile abounding in the alimentary canal, and by taking off the spasm of the extreme vessels. Indeed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARON\">Baron</a> Ash, and some other of the Russian practitioners, represent the early and repeated used of emetics as the only effectual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of cure.\n\nAccording to the observations of Dr de Mertens, who wrote a very interesting treatise on the fatal plague which raged at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOSCOW\">Moscow</a> in 1771, and which carried off upwards of 20,000 inhabitants in the space of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>, emetics were often of the greatest service.\n\nFrom some principles with respect to fever in general, and with respect to the plague in particular, Dr Cullen is of opinion, that after the exhibition of the first vomit, the body should be disposed to sweat: but this sweat should be raised only to a moderate degree, though it must be continued for 24 hours or more if the patient bears it easily. The sweating is to be excited and conducted according to the rules laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> under Synocha; and must be promoted by the plentiful use of diluents rendered more grateful by vegetable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a>, or more powerful by being impregnated with some portion of neutral salts. To support the patient under the continuance of the sweat, a little weak broth, acidulated with the juice of lemons, may be given frequently, and sometimes a little wine if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of the body be not considerable. If sudorific medicines be judged necessary, opiates will be found more effectual and safe; but they should not be combined with aromatics, and probably may be more effectual if joined with a portion of emetics and of neutral salts. But if, notwithstanding the use of emetics and sudorifics in the beginning, the disease should still continue, the cure must turn upon the use of means for obviating debility and putrescence; and for this purpose tonic medicines, especially cinchona and cold drink, are the most proper.\n\nGenus XXVIII.

In the distinct smallpox, the disease begins with a synocha or inflammatory fever. This fever generally comes on about mid-day, with some symptoms of a cold stage, and commonly with a considerable languor and drowsiness. A hot stage is soon formed, and becomes more considerable on the second and third day. During this course children are liable to frequent startings from their slumber; and adults, if they are kept in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a>, are disposed to much sweating. On the third day, children are sometimes affected with one or two epileptic fits. Towards the end of the third day the eruption commonly appears, and gradually increases during the fourth; appearing first on the face, and successively on the inferior parts, so as to be completed over the whole body on the fifth day. From the third day the fever abates, and by the fifth it entirely ceases. The eruption appears first in small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> spots hardly eminent, but by degrees rising into pimples. There are generally but few on the face; but, even when more numerous, they are separate and distinct from one another. On the fifth or sixth day, a small vesicle, containing an almost colourless fluid, appears on the top of each pimple. For two days these vesicles increase in breadth only, and there is a small hollow pit in their middle, so that they are not raised into spheroidal pustules till the eighth day. These pustules from their first formation continue to be surrounded with an exactly circular inflamed margin, which, when they are numerous, diffuses some inflammation over the neighbouring skin, so as to give somewhat of a damask-rose colour to the spaces between the pustules. As the pustules increase in size, the face swells considerably if they are numerous on it; and the eyelids particularly are so much swelled, that the eyes are entirely shut. As the disease proceeds, the matter in the pustules becomes by degrees more opaque and white, and at length assumes a yellowish colour. On the 11th day the swelling of the face is abated, and the pustules seem quite full. On the top of each a darker spot appears; and at this place the pustule, on the 11th day, or soon after, is spontaneously broken, and a portion of the matter oozes out; in consequence of which the pustule is shrivelled, and subsides; while the matter oozing out dries, and forms a crust upon its surface. Sometimes only a little of the matter oozes out, and what remains in the pustule becomes thick and even hard. After some days, both the crusts and the hardened pustules <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> off, leaving the skin which they covered of a brownish red colour; nor doth it resume its natural colour till many days after. In some cases, where the matter of the pustules has been more liquid, the crusts formed from it are later in falling off, and the part they covered suffers some desquamation, which occasions a small hollow or pit.\n\nOn the legs and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> the matter is frequently absorbed; so that at the height of the disease, these pustules appear as empty as vesicles. On the 10th and 11th days, as the swelling of the face subsides, a swelling arises in the hands and feet; but which again subsides as the pustules come to maturity.\u2014When the pustules on the face are numerous, some degree of pyrexia appears on the 10th and 11th days; but disappears again after the pustules are fully ripened, or perhaps remains in a very slight degree till the pustules on the feet have finished their course; and it is seldom that any fever continues longer in the distinct smallpox. When the pustules are numerous on the face, upon the sixth or seventh day some uneasiness of the throat, with a hoarseness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a>, comes on, and a thin liquid is poured out from the mouth. These symptoms increase with the swelling of the face; and the liquids of the mouth and throat becoming thicker, are with difficulty thrown out; and there is at the same time some difficulty in swallowing, so that liquids taken in to be swallowed are frequently rejected or thrown out by the nose. But all these affections of the fauces are abated as the swelling of the face subsides.\n\nIn the confluent smallpox all the symptoms above mentioned are much more severe. The eruptive fever particularly is more violent; the pulse is more frequent and more contracted, approaching to that state of pulse which is observed in typhus. The coma is more considerable, and there is frequently a delirium. Vomiting also frequently attends, especially at the beginning of the disease. In very young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANTS\">infants</a> epileptic fits are sometimes frequent on the first days of the disease, and sometimes prove fatal before any eruption appears, or they usher in a very confluent and putrid smallpox. But at the same time, it has been justly remarked by Dr Sydenham, and other accurate observers, that epileptic attacks more frequently precede distinct and mild than malignant and confluent smallpox. The eruption appears in the confluent more early on the third day, and it is frequently preceded or accompanied with an erysipelasous efflorescence. Sometimes\nWhen the eruption is completed, the pimples are always more numerous upon the face, and at the same time smaller and less eminent. Upon the eruption the fever suffers some remission, but never goes off entirely; and after the fifth or sixth day it increases again, and continues to be considerable throughout the remaining part of the disease. The vesicles formed on the top of the pimples appear sooner; and while they increase in breadth, they do not retain a circular, but are every way of an irregular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>. Many of them run into one another, insomuch that very often the face is covered with one vesicle rather than with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of pustules. The vesicles, as far as they are any way separated, do not arise to a spheroidal form, but remain flat, and sometimes the whole of the face appears an even surface. When the pustules are in any measure separated, they are not bounded by an inflamed margin, but the part of the skin that is free from pustules is commonly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> and flaccid. The liquor that is in the pustules changes from a clear to an opaque appearance, and becomes whitish or brownish, but never acquires the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> colour and thick consistence that appears in the distinct smallpox. The swelling of the face, which only sometimes attends the distinct smallpox, always attends the confluent kind; it also comes on more early, and arises to a greater height, but abates considerably on the tenth or eleventh day. At this time the pustules or vesicles break and shrivel; pouring out at the same time a liquor, which is formed into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> crusts, which do not fall off for a long time after. Those of the face, in falling off, leave the skin subject to a desquamation, which pretty certainly produces pitting. On the other parts of the body the pustules of the confluent smallpox are more distinct than on the face; but never acquire the same maturity and consistence of pus as in the properly distinct kind.\n\nThe salivation, which sometimes only attends the distinct smallpox, very constantly attends the confluent; and both the salivation and the affection of the fauces above mentioned occur, especially in adults, in a higher degree. In infants a diarrhoea comes frequently in place of a salivation.\n\nIn this kind of smallpox there is often a very considerable putrescence of the fluids, as appears from petechiae, from serous vesicles, under which the skin shows a disposition to gangrene, and from bloody urine or other hemorrhages; all of which symptoms frequently attend this disease. In the confluent smallpox also, the fever, which had only suffered a remission from the eruption to the maturation, at or immediately after this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> is frequently renewed again with considerable violence. This is what has been called the secondary fever, and is of various <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> and event.\n\nCauses, &c. It is evident that the smallpox is originally produced by a contagion; and that this contagion is a ferment with respect to the fluids of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> body, which assimilates a considerable portion of them to its own nature; or, at least, we have every reason to believe that a small quantity of contagious matter introduced, is sometimes multiplied and increased in the circulating fluids of the animal body. This quantity passes again out of the body, partly by insensible perspiration, and partly by being deposited in pustules.\n\nThe causes which determine more of the variolous matter to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> by perspiration, or to form pustules, are probably certain circumstances of the skin, which determine more or less of the variolous matter to stick in it, or to pass freely through it. The circumstance of the skin, which seems to determine the variolous matter to stick in it, is a certain state of inflammation depending much on the heat of it: thus we have many instances of parts of the body, from being more heated, having a greater number of pustules than other parts. Thus parts covered with plasters, especially those of the stimulant kind, have more pustules than others.\n\nCertain circumstances also, such as adult age, and full living, determining to a phlogistic diathesis, seem to produce a greater number of pustules, and vice versa. It is therefore probable, that an inflammatory state of the whole system, and more particularly of the skin, gives occasion to a greater number of pustules; and the causes of this may produce most of the other circumstances of the confluent smallpox, such as the time of eruption, the continuance of the fever, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EFFUSION\">effusion</a> of a more putrescent matter, and less fit to be converted into pus, together with the form and other circumstances of the pustules.\n\nPrognosis. The more exactly the disease retains the form of the distinct kind, it is the safer; and the more completely the disease takes the form of the confluent kind, it is the more dangerous. It is only when the distinct kind shows a great number of pustules on the face, or otherwise by fever or putrescence, approaching to the circumstances of the confluent, that the distinct kind is attended with any danger.\n\nIn the confluent kind the danger is always very considerable; and the more violent and permanent the fever is, the greater the danger; and especially in proportion to the increase of the symptoms of putrescence. When the putrid disposition is very great, the disease sometimes proves fatal before the eighth day; but in most cases <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> happens on the eleventh, and sometimes not till the fourteenth or seventeenth day.\n\nThough the smallpox may not prove immediately fatal, the more violent kinds are often followed by a morbid state of the body, sometimes of very dangerous event. These consequences, according to Dr Cullen, may be imputed sometimes to an acrid matter produced by the preceding disease, and deposited in different parts; and sometimes to an inflammatory diathesis produced and determined to particular parts of the body.\n\nSince the introduction of smallpox into Europe, there is perhaps no disease which has produced a greater number of deaths. But, fortunately, a discovery is now made, by which there is reason to hope that this loathsome case may be altogether exterminated; its prevention, viz. by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INOCULATION\">inoculation</a> of the vaccine or cowpox.\n\nThis most important discovery we owe to the successful exertions of Dr Edward Jenner; to whom, for these exertions, repeated rewards have been voted by the British legislature, but who unquestionably enjoys a much higher reward in the satisfaction of having conferred an inestimable blessing on the human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>.\nFor an account of the progress of this discovery, we must refer our readers to Dr Jenner's publication. Here we shall only observe, that it had long been remarked in some parts of England, particularly in the neighbourhood of Berkley, where Dr Jenner resided, that cows were liable to a pustular disease on their udders, somewhat resembling smallpox; that this disease was communicated by contact to the fingers of those employed in milking the cows; and, finally, that those thus infected with cowpox, were completely protected against the contagion of smallpox.\n\nFounding on these observations, Dr Jenner ascertained by experiment, that the inoculation of vaccine matter was an infallible preventive of smallpox; and that this vaccine matter had equal power in preventing variola when transferred from one human subject to another, as when obtained immediately from the cow. It is not therefore wonderful that this practice of vaccine inoculation should soon have become general, both in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> and in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of the world. Nor is it perhaps surprising, that it should have been violently opposed by ignorant and obstinate men. Hence numerous publications have of late appeared both for and against this practice. Many mistakes have undoubtedly been committed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> and inattention; and thus the preventive has been supposed to fail. For the best account both of the method of performing the operation, of conveying the vaccine matter from one place to another, and of the tests of constitutional affection in those cases in which the inflammation is slight, and in which no fever is perceptible, we may refer our readers to a treatise published at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> in 1802, by Mr James Bryce, entitled Practical Observations on the Inoculation of Cowpox.\n\nOf the efficacy of vaccine inoculation as a preventive of smallpox, few candid men will entertain any doubt, after the following report on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-VACCINATION\">vaccination</a>, from the Royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">College</a> of Physicians in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, ordered to be printed on the 8th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> 1807, by the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a>.","sp":366,"ep":374},{"h":"FALLING-SICKNESS","t":"Epilepsia, Sauv. gen. 134.

The epilepsy often attacks suddenly, and without giving any warning; but more frequently is preceded by a pain in the head, lassitude, some disturbance of the senses, unquiet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a>, unusual dread, dimness of sight, a noise in the ears, palpitation of the heart, coldness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a>; and in some there is a sensation of formication, or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, &c., ascending from the lower extremities towards the head. In the fit, the persons <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> suddenly to the ground (whence the name of the falling-sickness), frequently with a violent cry. The thumbs are shut up <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> in the palms of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, and are with difficulty taken out; the eyes are distorted, so that nothing but the whites are to be seen; all sensation is suspended, insomuch, that by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a>, noise, or otherwise, nor even by pinching the body, can they be brought to themselves; they foam at the mouth, with a hissing kind of noise; the tongue is frequently lacerated by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>, and there is a violent convulsive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of the arms and legs. Sometimes, however, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a>, instead of being agitated by convulsive motions, are all stiff, and the patients are as immovable as a statue. In children, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PENIS\">penis</a> is erected; and in young men there is an emission of the semen, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-URINE\">urine</a> is often thrown out to a considerable distance. At length there is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REMISSION\">remission</a> of the symptoms, and the patients recover after a longer or shorter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a>; when they complain of a pain, torpor, or heaviness of the head, with a lassitude of all the joints.\n\nCauses, &c. The dissection of epileptic subjects has shown a variety of morbid appearances, which may be supposed to have contributed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>; such as, indurations in the brain or meninges; caries of the internal surface of the cranium; projections of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BONY\">bony</a> substance of the same, pressing upon the brain; collections of serum or purulent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, and earthy concretions within the skull; besides many others which are recorded by Bonetus, Morgagni, and Lieutaud. But often the causes are impossible to be discovered; for even in those who have died of the disease, the brain and all other parts of the nervous system have been apparently <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a>. The disease <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> attack strong as well as weak people; and in those who are subject to it, any considerable excess in drinking, a surfeit, violent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>, or venery, &c. will certainly bring on a fit. Some have epileptic paroxysms returning periodically after considerable intervals; and the disease has been thought to have some dependence on the phases of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>.\n\nPrognosis. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> the epilepsy comes on before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of puberty, there are some hopes of its going off at that time. But it is a bad sign when it attacks about the 21st year, and still worse if the fits grow more frequent; for then the animal functions are often destroyed, as well as those of the mind, and the patient becomes stupid and foolish. Sometimes it will terminate in melancholy or madness, and sometimes in a mortal apoplexy or palsy. It has sometimes, however, been observed, that epilepsies have been removed by the appearance of cutaneous diseases, as the itch, smallpox, measles, &c. While the disease is recent, therefore, we are not to despair of a cure; but if it be of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> standing, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a>, there is very little reason to expect that it can be removed.\n\nCure. From the symptoms occurring in epilepsy, which consists of involuntary convulsive motions, and an affection of the mental powers, there is reason to conclude that the fit immediately depends on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDUCTION\">induction</a> of some peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the brain; but that convulsions may ensue from this cause, it would seem necessary that there should also occur a peculiar disposition to action in the moving fibres. On this ground, then, we may suppose the cure to be chiefly expected on one of two principles; either by our being able to prevent the peculiar action of the brain, or to remove the disposition to action in the moving fibres. The first is chiefly to be accomplished by the removal of irritating causes, by preventing their influence from being propagated to the brain, when they are applied to remote parts; or by counteracting their influence, from inducing in the brain a state of action different from that to which they give rise. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> end is chiefly to be obtained by diminishing the mobility of the nervous energy, and by strengthening...\nening the tone of the moving fibres. It must, however, be allowed, that in all convulsive disorders, excepting those which are cured by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> about the time of puberty, the cure by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> means is very difficult. Numberless <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIFICS\">specifics</a> have been recommended, but all of them have failed of answering the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a>. When the cause can be discovered, that must be removed. In other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, the cold bath, valerian root, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASTOR\">castor</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MUSK\">musk</a>, opium, the fetid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUMS\">gums</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CINCHONA\">cinchona</a>, with the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> of nervous and antispasmodic medicines, have been recommended: but none of those, or indeed any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of them, have been found generally useful; though the slighter, or symptomatic cases, may often be removed by them.\n\nOf late the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CALX\">calx</a> or oxide, improperly called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a>, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZINC\">zinc</a>, have obtained such reputation in convulsive disorders as to be received into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> Pharmacopoeia under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of oxidum zinei. They were proposed by Dr Gaubius as an antispasmodic, in his Adversaria; and their efficacy has since been confirmed by various observations. In an inaugural dissertation published by Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HART\">Hart</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEYDEN\">Leyden</a>, the medical virtues of the flowers of zinc are considered. He observes, that they have long been used externally, chiefly for inflammations of the eyes from acrid lymph. Glauber first proposed the internal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of them; and Gaubius discovered them to be the remedy of a celebrated empiric Ludde mannus, which he styled his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUNA\">luna</a> firtata. After this he exhibited them with success in convulsive and spasmodic diseases. Dr Hart supposes, that they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> either as absorbents, or as possessing a specific <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>: but is a strong advocate for their efficacy, on whatever principles they may operate; and, in favour of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, relates <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> cases in which they proved successful. A girl of 17 years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> was seized with a slight chorea from a fright; and when the disease had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> six days, she began to take the flowers of zinc, by which her disorder was removed in less than three weeks. Her cure required only 16 grains of the zinc. In a few months the complaints returned, from the same cause; and were removed by four grains of the medicine divided into 10 doses. A boy of about four years old, labouring under a real epilepsy, suspected to be hereditary, was cured by a grain of the flowers of zinc taken every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> for some time.\u2014A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> 50 years old, thrown into convulsions from a violent passion, was cured by a grain of the calx taken every two hours. The disease had gone off upon venesection and the use of some other remedies; but returned again in two weeks, when it was finally removed by the zinc. The two last cases are related from Dr Gaubius, who affirms that he has used the flowers of zinc in cases of the chincough, hysteric hiccough, and spasmus cynicus; that they frequently did more than other medicines, but were by no means successful in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>. The other cures mentioned by Dr Hart are similar to those above mentioned. But it does not appear that he ever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> a confirmed epilepsy cured by this medicine.\n\nIn the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the Edinburgh Medical Commentaries, we have an account by Mr Benjamin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELL\">Bell</a>, of a man afflicted with a confirmed epilepsy, who was considerably relieved by the flowers of zinc.\n\nIn a young man labouring under the epilepsy, in whom the fits were preceded by an aura epileptica, or sensation like air arising from the inside of the knee-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a>, the disease was also relieved, but not cured.\n\nDr Percival relates some cases of epilepsy which seem to have been cured by the flowers of zinc; and in other cases, where the disease was not entirely removed by it, the spasms were nevertheless much mitigated. He did not observe that it promoted any evacuation; excepting that in some, upon being first taken, it occasioned a little sickness, which went off with a stool. He adds, that those apothecaries who do not prepare this medicine themselves, are in great danger of being imposed upon, as it is sometimes a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> corrosion of the zinc by an acid, and even imperfectly washed.\n\nThe good effects of the oxide of zinc as an antispasmodic are also attested by Dr Haygarth of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHESTER\">Chester</a> and Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">White</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a>. The former gives a test of their goodness which may be of use to those who do not prepare them, namely, that the true flowers of zinc, when strongly heated, become <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a>, but re-assume their white <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> on being allowed to cool. The latter gives a case of hieranosos, or strange convulsions of almost all the muscles of the body, cured by zinc, after a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of other remedies had failed. But, although from these and other respectable authorities, there can be no doubt that zinc has often been successful in epilepsy; yet it is equally certain, that in many others it has had a fair <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>, without producing any benefit.\n\nIn Dr Home's clinical experiments and histories, also, oxide of zinc is mentioned as having been found serviceable upon trial in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> Infirmary of Edinburgh. Of the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> remedies which have been recommended for the epilepsy and other convulsive disorders allied to it, we have the following account by the same author.\n\n1. The cold-bath was tried in one who had a convulsive disorder of one side, but the symptoms were rendered much worse by it.\n\n2. Venesection. Not to be depended on in convulsions.\n\n3. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTRICITY\">Electricity</a>. In two convulsive cases was of no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>.\n\n4. Epispastics. Do not seem to be powerful antispasmodics.\n\n5. Valerian. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> convulsive cases, for which this remedy has been reckoned almost a specific, it not only made no cure, but could scarcely be reckoned to do any good. Dr Home supposes that it acts as a bitter tonic, something like the serpentina <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGINIA\">Virginia</a>. Though much used at present, he tells us it has always appeared to him a weak, often a hurtful, medicine.\n\n6. Musk. Six convulsive patients treated with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> doses of this remedy, were neither cured nor in the least relieved.\n\n7. Castor seems to be unworthy of the confidence formerly put in it. It is indeed possessed of a sedative power, and therefore may be useful in spasmodic feverish cases.\n\n8. Asafoetida has considerable antispasmodic powers, but is not always successful. It heats and quickens the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULSE\">pulse</a>; and is therefore improper in cases attended with inflammation. It disagrees with some from a peculiarity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>; exciting pain in the stomach,\nand vomiting; but this can be known only after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXHIBITION\">exhibition</a> of the medicine.\n\n9. Cinchona. Of seven spasmodic cases, six were either cured or mitigated. An epilepsy of eight years standing was very much relieved by taking the bark for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>, and one of two years standing by taking it for ten days. But the medicine is of a heating nature, and therefore is not to be employed in cases attended with inflammatory symptoms.\n\n10. Peony root was given to two epileptic patients without the least success.\n\n11. Viscus quercinus, or mistletoe, was given in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of two scruples five times a-day to an epileptic patient, without success.\n\n12. Extractum hyoscyami was given to an epileptic patient, to one afflicted with the hemitotonos, and to one who laboured under the hysteric affection, without the least good effect.\n\n13. Folia aurantiacum were exhibited with the like bad success. Five drams of the powdered leaves were taken at once without any sensible effect.\n\n14. Cardamine pratensis, in three epileptic cases, was not attended with any success.\n\n15. Opium did no good.\n\n16. Ammoniaretum cupri made no cure in four cases of epilepsy in which it was tried.\n\nThat in many cases all these remedies have been employed without success, is not to be denied; and indeed it may with confidence be asserted, that a great majority of cases of epilepsy are incurable by any remedy that has yet been discovered. At the same time, as there is incontrovertible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> that some of them have succeeded at least in certain cases, the more powerful may always be considered as deserving a fair trial. The ammoniaretum cupri, in particular, seems well entitled to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of practitioners; for though it be a medicine of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a>, yet under prudent administration it may be employed even with very young subjects without any hazard; and in several inveterate cases, which had obstinately resisted other medicines, it has brought about a complete <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a>.\n\nGenus LIV.

Junck. 33.\n\nThe palpitation of the heart is sometimes so violent, that it may be heard at a considerable distance. It may proceed from a bad conformation of the heart itself, or some of the large vessels. It may also be occasioned by wounds or abscesses in the heart; or it may proceed from polypous concretions or ossifications of that viscus, or from plethora, fear, or spasmodic affections of the nervous system. When it proceeds from diseases of the heart or large vessels, it is absolutely incurable. In spasmodic cases, the remedies above related may be used. If the patient be plethoric, bleeding will probably remove the disorder, at least for the present.\n\nGenus LV. ASTHMA.\n\nAsthma, Sauv. gen. 145. Lin. 161. Vog. 268.

Sir John Floyer, when he wrote his celebrated treatise, had laboured under repeated paroxysms for thirty years.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> distinction is into humid and dry; the former is accompanied with an expectoration of mucus or purulent matter, but the latter is not. In the genuine humoral asthma, the patients are obliged to lean forward; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSPIRATION\">inspiration</a> is short and spasmodic; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-EXPIRATION\">expiration</a> very slow.\n\nAsthmatic persons have generally some warning of the attack, from a languor, loss of appetite, oppression, and swelling of the stomach from flatulence, which precede the fit; but it is usually in the middle of the night that the violent difficulty of breathing comes on.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> of the paroxysm is uncertain, as it will sometimes terminate in three or four hours, while at other times it will continue for as many days; nay, it has been known to last three weeks without intermission. While it subsists, the patient is in very great distress, not being able to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a>, nor scarcely to speak or expectorate, so great is the difficulty of breathing; and yet, notwithstanding all this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> interruption to the free passage of the blood through the lungs, an inflammation here seldom or never supervenes a fit of the asthma. As the paroxysm wears off, and the breathing becomes free, there is more or less of an expectoration of mucus; and the urine, from being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> and limpid, becomes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> coloured, and lets fall a copious sediment.\n\nIn order to obtain relief in the fit, we must sometimes bleed, unless <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> weakness or old age should forbid, and repeat it according to the degrees of strength and fulness: a purging clyster, with a solution of assafetida, must be immediately injected; and if the violence of the symptoms should not speedily abate, it will be proper to apply a blistering <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLASTER\">plaster</a> to the neck or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>.\n\nIn the height of the paroxysm, an emetic might be followed...\nSpasms, followed by dangerous symptoms, as it would increase the accumulation of blood in the vessels of the head; but vomiting will often prevent a fit of the asthma, especially if the stomach should chance to be loaded with any sort of saburra. A very strong infusion of roasted coffee has been found to give ease in an asthmatic paroxysm.\n\nSir John Pringle says it is the best abater of the paroxysms of the periodic asthma that he has seen. The coffee ought to be of the best Mocco, newly burnt, and made very strong immediately after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRINDING\">grinding</a> it. He <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> ordered an ounce for one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISH\">dish</a>; which is to be repeated fresh after the interval of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> or half an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>; and which is to be taken without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILK\">milk</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>. The medicine in general is mentioned by Musgrave in his treatise de Arthritide anomala; but he first heard of it from a physician in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LITCHFIELD\">Litchfield</a>, who had been informed by the old people of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, that Sir John Floyer, during the latter part of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, kept free from, or at least lived easy under, his asthma, from the use of very strong coffee. This discovery, it seems, he made after the publication of his book upon that disease. Dr Percival says he has frequently directed coffee in the asthma with great success.\n\nIn the intervals of the fit, persons subject to the asthma, especially the humid species, should take emetics from time to time. An infusion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOBACCO\">tobacco</a> is an emetic that has been said to be very serviceable in some asthmatic cases; but its operation is both so distressing and so dangerous, that it will never probably be introduced into common use as an emetic. Smoking or chewing the same has been known to prevent the frequency and severity of the paroxysms. Asthmatic patients may also use the lac ammoniaci, with a due proportion of oxymel scillitium and vinum antimoniale, with a view to promote expectoration; or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUM\">gum</a> ammoniac, and others of similar virtues, may be formed into pills, and combined with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOAP\">soap</a>, as mentioned for the dyspnea pituitosa; or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> may be composed of asafoetida and balsam of Tolu, with syrup of garlic; and these pills may be washed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> by a medicated wine, impregnated with squills, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>-radish root, and mustard seed; or a strong bitter infusion, with a little antimonial wine.\n\nIn some cases crude <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a> will be found serviceable; in others flowers of sulphur, made into an electuary with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a> or syrup of garlic; and if, notwithstanding the use of these things, a costive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> should prevail, it will be necessary, from time to time, to give a few grains of pills of aloes and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MYRRH\">myrrh</a>, soap and aloes, or a mass of equal parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-RHUBARB\">rhubarb</a>, scammony, and soap.\n\nThe dry or spasmodic asthma, during the extreme violence of the fit, is best relieved by opiates; and sometimes very large doses are required. But in order to obtain permanent relief, nothing is found to answer better than ipecacuanha in small doses. Three, five, eight, or ten grains, according to the strength and constitution of the patient, given every other day, have been productive of the happiest effects; acting sometimes as an evacuant, pumping up the viscid phlegm; at others, as an antispasmodic or sedative. Issues are generally recommended in both species, and will often be found useful.\n\nChanges of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> are usually felt very sensibly by asthmatic people, who in general cannot live with tolerable ease in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a> of large cities; though we shall sometimes meet with patients who agree better with this air, which is so replete with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> effluvia of various kinds, than with the purest that can be found in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> situations. And some are found who breathe with the most ease in a crowded room, with a fire and candles.\n\nA <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> diet of meats that are easy of digestion, and not flatulent, is requisite for asthmatic people; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of riding is often highly serviceable.\n\nWhen the asthma is found to depend on some other disease, whether it be the gout or an intermittent fever, or when it proceeds from the striking in of some cutaneous eruption, regard must always be had to the primary disease: thus, in the asthama arthritica, sinapisms to the feet, or blistering, will be absolutely necessary, in order, if possible, to bring on a fit of the gout. And when the dregs of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGUE\">ague</a> give rise to an asthma, which is termed febriculoseum, and invades at regular intervals, we must have recourse to the Peruvian bark. The asthama exanthematicum will require blisters or issues, to give vent to the acrid matters which were repelled from the surface of the body; and courses of sulphureous waters, goats whey, and sweetening diet drinks, or perhaps mercurial alternatives, in order to correct the sharpness of the juices.\n\nGENUS LVI. DYSPNOEA:\n\nHabitual Difficulty of Breathing.\n\nDyspnea, Sauv. gen. 144. Lin. 160. Vog. 267. Sag. 251. Junk. 32.\n\nSp. I. The Catarrhal Dyspnoea.\n\nAsthma catarrhale, Sauv. sp. 16.\nAsthma pneumonicum, Willis Pharm. rat. P. II. sect. i. cap. 12.\nAsthma pituitosum, Hoffm. III. sect. ii. cap. 2. \u00a7 3.\nAsthma pneumodes, Sauv. sp. 17.\n\nThis is readily known by the symptoms of pneumonia and catarrh attending it; and to the removal of these symptoms the care of the physician must be principally directed.\n\nSp. II. The Dry Dyspnoea.\n\nDyspnea \u00e0 tuberculis, \u00e0 hydatibus, &c. Sauv. sp. 2, 4, 5, 20.\nOrthopnoea \u00e0 lipomate, Sauv. sp. 18.\n\nThis is generally accompanied with a phthisis pulmonalis; but Sauvages mentions one species of phthisis to which the dry dyspnea seems more particularly to belong. The patients fall away by degrees, and have a great difficulty of breathing, continual thirst, and little or no spitting. When opened after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, their lungs are found not to be ulcerated, but shrivelled and contracted as if they had been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a>-dried. Goldsmiths and chemists are said to be subject to this disease, by reason of the vapours they draw in with their breath. Sauvages doth not mention any particular remedy. Shortness of breath arising from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TUBERCLES\">tubercles</a>, as they are termed, or a scirrhouss enlargement of the lymphatic glands which are dispersed through the lungs, is com-\nmonly found in scrophulous habits, and may be distinguished by the concomitancy of those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> swellings and appearances which particularly mark the scrophula. This species of dyspnoea generally ends in a phthisis. Courses of goats whey, and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, have been known to do service; but it must be confessed, that a perfect cure is seldom obtained. Issues are of use in these cases, as they appear to prevent the ill effects of over fulness, if it should happen at any time to supervene.\n\nSp. III. Dyspnoea from Changes in the Weather. (Sauv. sp. 12.)\n\nThis seems to be a disease entirely spasmodic, and the antispasmodics already related are accordingly indicated.\n\nSp. IV. The Dyspnoea from Earthy Substances formed in the Lungs.\n\nSauvages mentions this disease as much more common in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUTES\">brutes</a> than in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>: but Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CULLEN\">Cullen</a> mentions his having seen some instances of it; and we have several accounts by different authors of calculous matters being coughed up by people labouring under a dyspnoea, and threatened with consumption. In three cases of this kind which fell under Dr Cullen's inspection, there was no appearance of earthy or stony concretions in any other part of the body. The calcareous matter was coughed up frequently with a little blood, sometimes with mucus only, and sometimes with pus. In one of these cases, an exquisite phthisis came on, and proved mortal; in the other two the symptoms of phthisis were never fully formed; and after some time, merely by a milk diet and avoiding irritation, the patients entirely recovered.\n\nSauvages also greatly recommends milk in these cases, and soap for dissolving the concretions. The reason why brutes are more subject to these pulmonary calculi than mankind, is, that they very seldom cough, and thus the stagnating mucus or lymph concretes into a kind of gypseous matter.\n\nSp. V. The Watery Dyspnoea.\n\nDyspnoea pituitosa, Sauv. sp. 1.\nOrthopnoea ab hydropneumonia, Sauv. sp. 12.\n\nThis may arise from too great a defluxion of mucus on the lungs, or from an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EFFUSION\">effusion</a> of serum, as is mentioned under the pneumonia. The treatment of the disease may be gathered from what has been already said under the heads of Pneumonia, Catarrh, Empyema, &c.\n\nSp. VI. The Dyspnoea from Corpulency.\n\nOrthopnoea \u00e0 pinguedine, Sauv. sp. 6.\n\nThere have been many instances of suffocation and death occasioned by too great corpulency. These fatal effects, however, may be almost always avoided, if the persons have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> to persist in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> and very temperate course of life; avoiding animal food, much sleep, and using a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of exercise. In the third volume of the Medical Observations, however, there is an extraordinary instance of internal obesity which neither showed itself externally, nor could be removed by any medicines.\n\nOther species of dyspnoea have been considered under Phthisis. It is frequently symptomatic of diseases of the heart and large vessels, or swellings of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ABDOMEN\">abdomen</a>, &c.\n\nGenus LVII. Pertussis.\n\nChincough.\n\nPertussis, Sydenham, Ed. Leid. p. 200, 311, 312.\nHuxham de aere, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-AD\">ad</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANN\">ann</a>. 1732.\nTussis convulsiva, sive ferina, Hoffm. III. 111.\nTussis ferina, Sauv. sp. 10. Sag. sp. 10.\nTussis convulsiva, Sauv. sp. 11. Sag. sp. 11.\nAmphimerina tussiculosa, Sauv. sp. 13.\n\nDescription. This disease comes on at first like a common cold; but is from the beginning attended with a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of dyspnoea than is common in catarrh; and there is a remarkable affection of the eyes, as if they were swelled, and a little pushed out of their sockets. By degrees the fits of coughing become longer and more violent, till at last they are plainly convulsive, so that for a considerable time the patient cannot respire, and when at last he recovers his breath, inspiration is performed with a shrill kind of noise like the crowing of a cock. This kind of inspiration serves only as an introduction to another convulsive fit of coughing, which is in like manner followed by another inspiration of the same kind; and thus it continues for some time, very often till the patient vomit, which puts an end to the paroxysm at that time. These paroxysms are attended with a violent determination of the blood towards the head, so that the vessels become extremely turgid, and blood not unfrequently flows from the mouth and nose. The disease is tedious, and often continues for many months. It is not commonly attended with fever, unless at the commencement.\n\nCauses, &c. The chincough is an infectious disorder, and very often epidemic: but the nature of the contagion is not understood; at least it is no farther understood than that of smallpox, measles, or similar epidemics. We well know that it is from a peculiar and specific contagion alone that this disease, as well as the others above mentioned, can arise. But with regard to the nature of any of them, we are totally in the dark. It generally attacks children, or adults of a lax habit, making its attack frequently in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> or autumn; at the same time, when this contagion is introduced into any town, village, or neighbourhood, it will rage epidemically at any season. Those alone are affected with this disease who had never before been subjected to it. For in this affection, as well as in smallpox, having had the disease once, gives <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> against future contagion. Every individual, however, does not seem to be equally readily affected with this contagion; like other contagious diseases occurring only once in a lifetime, it may naturally be expected to be more frequent among children than at any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of life. But many, though frequently exposed to contagion, are yet not affected with the disease: and those children who live upon unwholesome watery food, or breathe unwholesome air, are most liable to its attack, or at least suffer\nmost from them. In general it has been concluded, that whatever weakens the solids, or tends to bring on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a>, predisposes to this disease, and increases its severity.\n\nPrognosis. The chincough is not very often fatal. During one epidemic, however, it is often observed to be much more dangerous and more severe than during another. This is also remarked with regard even to particular periods of the same epidemic; and it is also observed, that on certain families this disease is much more severe than on others. Its danger, however, is still more connected with the period of life at which it occurs. In children under two years of age it is most dangerous; and kills them by producing convulsions, suffocation, inflammation, and suppuration of the brain or in the lungs, ruptures, and incurvation of the spine. In pregnant women it will produce <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABORTION\">abortion</a>; and in adults inflammations of the lungs, and all the consequences of pneumonia, more frequently than in children. From a long continuance of the disease patients will become asthmatic, ricketty, and scrofulous. It is generally reckoned a good sign when a fit terminates by vomiting; for in this disease there seems to be a great increase of the secretion of mucus, and the vomiting affords great relief.\n\nCure. Pertussis is one of those diseases which, after the contagion has exerted its influence, can be terminated only by running a certain course; but it is much less limited in its course than smallpox and measles, and often it runs on to a very great length, or at least it is very difficult to distinguish certain sequelae of this disease from the disease itself. And when it exists in the former of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, it admits of an artificial termination. In the treatment of this affection, therefore, the objects at which a practitioner chiefly aims, are in the first place, the obviating urgent symptoms, and forwarding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> termination of the disease; and secondly, the inducing an artificial termination. With these intentions various practices are employed on different occasions. The most approved remedies are vomits, purges, bleeding, and the attenuating pectorals; for the other kinds generally do hurt; but large evacuations of any kind are pernicious. In the Medical Observations, vol. iii. Dr Morris recommends castor, and cinchona; but in cases attended with any degree of inflammation, the latter must certainly do hurt, and the former will generally be insignificant. Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">Butter</a>, in a dissertation expressly on the subject, relates 20 cases of it cured by the extract of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-HEMLOCK\">hemlock</a>. He directs half a grain daily for a child under six months old; one grain for a child from six months to two years; afterwards allowing half a grain for every year of the patient's age till he be 20; beyond that period, he directs ten grains to be given for the first day's consumption, gradually increasing the dose according to the effect. If the patient have not two stools daily, he advises <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNESIA\">magnesia</a>, or the sulphur potass\u00e6 cum sulphure, to be added to the hemlock mixture. By this method he says the peculiar symptoms of the disease are removed in the space of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>; nothing but a slight cough remaining. The use of hemlock, however, has by no means become <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of this publication, nor indeed has this remedy been found equally successful with others who have given it a fair trial.\n\nThe remedy most to be depended upon in this disease is change of air. The patient, as soon as the disease is fully formed, ought to be removed to some other part of the country; but there is no occasion for going to a distant place; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> or two, or frequently a smaller distance, will be sufficient; and in this new habitation, the frequency of the cough is almost instantly diminished to a most surprising degree. After remaining there for some time, however, the cough will often be observed to become again more frequent, and the other symptoms increased. In this case, another change of air, or even a return to the former habitation, becomes necessary. Manifest benefit has even been derived by changing a patient from one room of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> to another. But although change of air has thus been advantageous, it must also be remarked, that when it has been had recourse to at very early periods it has often done mischief, particularly by aggravating the febrile and inflammatory symptoms. If the disease be attended with fever, bleeding and other antiphlogistic remedies are proper. Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUCHAN\">Buchan</a> recommends an ointment made of equal parts of garlic and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HOG\">hog</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-LARD\">lard</a> applied to the soles of the feet; but if it have any effect, it is probably merely as an emplastrum calidum. It ought to be put on a rag and applied like a plaster. Opiates may sometimes be useful, but in general are to be avoided. They are chiefly serviceable where the cough is very frequent, with little expectoration. In these cases benefit has sometimes also been derived from sulphuric <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ETHER\">ether</a>, and sometimes from the tincture of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CANTHARIDES\">cantharides</a>. An almost instantaneous termination has on some occasions been put to this disease by exciting a high degree of fear, or by inducing another febrile contagion: But the effects of both are too uncertain and too dangerous to be employed in practice.\n\nGenus LVIII.

The Spasmodic Colic.\n\nColica flatulenta, pituitosa, Sauv. sp. 1. 2. 5. 6. 7.\nDescription. The colic is chiefly known by a violent pain in the abdomen, commonly about the umbilical region. The pain resembles various kinds of sensations, as of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a>, twisting, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BORING\">boring</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGATURE\">ligature</a> drawn very tight, &c. The belly is generally costive, though sometimes there is a violent evacuation of bilious matters upwards and downwards. In these cases the disease is sometimes accompanied from the beginning with a weak and intermittent pulse, cold sweats, and fainting. In some the disease comes on gradually, beginning with an habitual costiveness; and if purgatives be taken, they do not operate. The pain comes on generally after a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAL\">meal</a>, and soon occasions nausea and vomiting. Sometimes the disease is attended with pyrexia, violent thirst, and a full pulse; the vomiting becomes more violent, and excrementitious matters are thrown up with the most exquisite pain and tension of the abdomen; and hiccup comes on, which continues obstinately; till at last a cessation of pain and fetid breath indicate a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTIFICATION\">mortification</a> of the intestines and approaching death. Sometimes the peristaltic motion of the intestines is so totally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERTED\">inverted</a>, that all their contents are evacuated by the mouth, and even clisters will be vomited; which constitutes that disease commonly called the iliac passion.\n\nCauses, &c. Colics may arise from any sudden check given to perspiration, as by violent cold applied to any part of the body, especially to the lower extremities and abdomen. Very frequently they are occasioned by nause, acid, or indigestible aliments taken into the stomach. By any of these, a violent colic, or indeed an iliac passion, may be occasioned; for Dr Cullen justly observes, that this last, though commonly accounted a different species of disease, differs from colic in no other way than in being in every respect in a much higher degree. In those who have died of this disease and been dissected, the intestines have sometimes been found twisted; but more commonly there hath been an intussusception of the intestine, that is, one part of the gut seems to have entered within the other. In the Edinburgh Medical Essays, vol. iii., we have a dissertation on the use of the warm bath in the bilious colic, in which the author derives the disorder from a spasmodic constriction of the intestine occasioned by the acrimony of the bile. By this, he says, the intestine is not only contracted into an unusual narrowness, but the sides of it have been found, upon dissection, so closely joined, that no passage could be made downwards more than if they had been strongly tied by a ligature. The formation of the intussusception he explains by quoting a passage from Peyerus, who made the following experiment on a frog. Having irritated the intestine of the animal in several different places, he observed it to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> at those places most violently, and to protrude its contents upwards and downwards wherever the relaxed state of the part would permit; by which means the contents were heaped together in different parts. Hence some parts of the intestine being dilated much more than enough, by reason of the great quantity of matter thrown into them, formed a kind of sack which readily received the constricted part into it. If this happen in the human body, there is the greatest danger of a mortification; because the part which is constricted, and at any rate disposed to inflammation, has that disposition very much increased by its confinement within the other, and by the pressure of the contents of the alimentary canal from the stomach downwards upon it. An iliac passion may also arise from the strangulation of part of the intestine in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERNIA\">hernia</a>; and even a very small portion of it thus strangulated may occasion a fatal disease. In the Medical Observations, vol. iv., however, we have an account of an iliac passion arising from a very different cause, which could neither have been suspected nor cured by any other way than the operation of gastrotony, or opening the abdomen of the patient, in order to remove the cause of the disorder. The patient, a woman of about 28 years of age, died after suffering extreme torture for six days. The body being opened, some quantity of a dirty coloured fluid was found in the cavity of the abdomen. The jejunum and ileum were greatly distended with air. A portion of the omentum adhered to the mesentery, near that part where the ileum terminates in the cecum. From this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ADHESION\">adhesion</a>, which was close to the spine, there ran a ligamentous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CORD\">cord</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> about two inches and a half long, unequally thick, in some places not thicker than a packthread; which by its other extremity adhered to the coats of the ileum, about two inches above the cecum. This cord formed a circle with the mesentery, large enough to admit a hen's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGG\">egg</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> through it. The cord had formed a noose (in a manner difficult to be explained), which included a doubling of about two inches of the lower end of the ileum, and was drawn so tight, that it not only put a stop to the passage of every thing through the bowels, and brought on a gangrene of the strangulated part, but it had even cut through all the coats of the intestine on the opposite side to the mesentery, and made an aperture about an inch long. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> of the Academy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SURGERY\">Surgery</a> are mentioned several similar cases.\n\nPrognosis. The colic is never to be reckoned void of danger, as it may unexpectedly terminate in an inflammation and gangrene of the intestines. Those species of it which are attended with purging must be considered as much less dangerous than those in which the vomiting is very violent. The iliac passion, or that attended with the vomiting of feces, is always to be accounted highly dangerous; but if the passage through the intestines be free, even though their peristaltic motion should be inverted, and clisters evacuated by the mouth, there is much more hope of a cure, than when the belly is obstinately costive, and there is some fixed obstruction which seems to bid defiance to all remedies.\n\nCure. In the cure of the spasmodic colic, the recovery must ultimately depend on producing a resolution of the spasmodic affection. In order to accomplish this, it is in general necessary to evacuate the contents of the intestines, and to remove morbid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRRITABILITY\">irritability</a> existing in that part of the system. But in order to preserve the life of the patient from the most imminent hazard, it is still more necessary to prevent and remove those inflammatory affections which often occur in this disease. As the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> danger in colics arises from an inflammation and consequent mortification of\nthe intestines, it is essentially necessary, in the first place, to diminish the tendency to a pyrexia, if there should happen to be any. This is accomplished by bleeding, emollient injections, warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATHING\">bathing</a>, and cooling medicines taken inwardly. Dr Porter strongly recommends the warm bath in those colics attended with violent evacuations of bile. He supposes it to do service by relaxing the constriction of the intestines, and thus preventing or removing the intussusception. In the meantime opiates may be given to ease the pain, while every method is tried, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHARTICS\">cathartics</a> and glysters of various kinds to procure a stool. In obstinate cases, where stimulating cathartics have proved ineffectual, the milder kinds, such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANNA\">manna</a>, senna, oleum ricini, &c. will sometimes succeed; but when every thing of this kind fails, recourse must be had to some of the more extraordinary methods. Some have recommended the swallowing of leaden bullets, on a supposition that by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> they would force through the obstruction; but these seem much more likely to create than to remove an obstruction. It is impossible they can act by their gravity, because the intestines do not lie in a straight line from the pylorus to the anus; and though this were actually the case, we cannot suppose that the weight of a leaden bullet could prove very efficacious in removing either a spasmodic constriction or an obstruction from any other cause. But when we consider not only that the intestines consist of a great multitude of folds, but that their peristaltic motion (by which only the contents are forced through them) is inverted, the futility of this remedy must be evident. It might rather be supposed to aggravate the disease; as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>, by its pressure, would tend to fix the intussusception more firmly, or perhaps push it still farther on. The same thing may be said of quicksilver: not to mention the pernicious consequences to be apprehended from swallowing large quantities of this mineral, even if it should prove efficacious in relieving the patient for the present. There are, however, some late cases on record, particularly one by Mr William Perry, published in the sixteenth volume of the Edinburgh Medical Commentaries, in which the hydrargyrum, swallowed in great quantities, was attended with the happiest effects, after every other remedy had been tried in vain.\n\nAnother method has been proposed, in the Medical Essays, for relieving the miserable patients in this disorder, which in many cases has been known to do service. The patient is to be taken out of bed, and made to walk about on the cold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a> of a damp apartment. At the same time, basons of cold water are to be dashed on his feet, legs, and thighs; and this must be continued for an hour or longer, if a stool be not procured before that time, though this will generally be the case much sooner. The exercise does not at all impair the patient's strength, but rather adds to it; and some very remarkable instances are adduced in the 6th volume of the Medical Essays, where this proved effectual after all other medicines had failed. In one person the disease had come on with a habitual costiveness, and he had been for a week tormented with the most violent pain and vomiting, which could be stopped neither by anodynes nor any other medicines, the sharpest glysters being returned unaltered, and all kinds of purgatives thrown up soon after they were swallowed; but by the above-mentioned method, a stool was procured in 35 minutes, and the patient recovered. In some others the costiveness had continued for a much longer time.\n\nOther remedies are, the blowing air into the intestines by means of a bellows, and the injecting glysters of the smoke of tobacco. But neither of these seem very capable of removing the disease. They can affect only the parts below the obstruction; while, to cure the disease, it is necessary that the obstructed parts themselves should be reached by the medicine, and therefore we have not many well-attested instances of their success. In some obstinate cases, however, benefit has certainly been derived from tobacco-smoke injections, and likewise from injections of tepid water to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of several pounds. For putting in practice these modes of cure, a particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> has been contrived; and in cases even apparently desperate, neither should be neglected. The cold water gives a general and very considerable shock to the system, checks the perspiration, and thus drives the humours inward upon the intestines, by which they receive a much more effectual stimulus than can be supposed to arise from any kind of glyster. But when all methods have failed, the only chance the patient can have for life is by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANUAL\">manual</a> operation.\n\nIn those colics which are attended with faintings, &c. from the beginning, and which generally attack hysterical women and other debilitated persons, all kinds of evacuations are pernicious; and the cure is to be attempted by anodynes and cordials, which will seldom fail of success. Even there also, however, it is necessary that the belly should be moved; and for this purpose injections containing a solution of asafoetida, which operate powerfully as antispasmodics, are preferable to most other modes of cure.\n\nSp. II. Colica Pictonum. The Colic of Poitou.\n\nRachialgia Pictonum, Sauv. sp. 1.\nRachialgia metallica, Sauv. sp. 3.\nColica Pictonum Citesi.\n\nAnother cause to which violent colics are frequently to be ascribed, and which often gives occasion to them where it is very little suspected, is lead, or some solution or fume of it, received into the body. To this cause is evidently owing the colics to which plumbers, lead-miners, and smelters of lead are subject. To the same cause, though not so apparent at first sight, are we to ascribe the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEVONSHIRE\">Devonshire</a> colic, where lead is received into the body dissolved in cider, the common drink of the inhabitants of that country. This has been proved by experiment; for lead has been extracted from cider in quantity sufficient to produce pernicious effects on the human body. The colic of Poitou, and what is called the dry belly-ach in the West Indies, are of the same nature: for which reason we give the following general description of the symptoms of all these diseases.\n\nThe patient is generally first seized with an acute pain at the pit of the stomach, which extends itself down with gripping pains to the bowels. Soon after there is a distention, as with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>; and frequent retchings to vomit, without bringing up any thing but small quantities of bile and phlegm. An obstinate costiveness follows, yet sometimes attended with a tenesmus, and\nand the bowels seem to the patient as if they were drawn up towards the back; at other times they are drawn into hard lumps, or hard rolls, which are plainly perceptible to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> on the belly. Sometimes the coats of the intestines seem to be drawn up from the anus and down from the pylorus towards the navel. When a stool is procured by artificial means, as clysters, &c., the feces appear in little hard knots like sheep's dung, called seybula, and are in small quantity. There is, however, usually an obstinate costiveness; the urine is discharged in small quantity, frequently with pain and much difficulty. The pulse is generally low, though sometimes a little quickened by the violence of the pain; but inflammatory symptoms very seldom occur. The extremities are often cold, and sometimes the violence of the pain causes cold clammy sweats and fainting. The mind is generally much affected, and the spirits are sunk. The disease is often tedious, especially if improperly treated, insomuch that the patients will continue in this miserable state for twenty or thirty days successively; nay, instances have been known of its continuing for six months. In this case the pains at last become almost intolerable: the patient's breath acquires a strong fetid smell like excrements, from a retention of the feces, and an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSORPTION\">absorption</a> of the putrid effluvia from them by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LACTEALS\">lacteals</a>. At last, when the pain in the bowels begins to abate, a pain comes on in the shoulder-joints and adjoining muscles, with an unusual sensation and tingling along the spinal marrow. This soon extends itself from thence to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NERVES\">nerves</a> of the arms and legs, which become weak; and that weakness increases till the extreme parts become paralytic, with a total loss of motion, though a benumbed sensation often remains. Sometimes, by a sudden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METASTASIS\">metastasis</a>, the brain becomes affected, a stupor and delirium come on, and the nervous system is irritated to such a degree as to produce general convulsions, which are frequently followed by death. At other times, the peristaltic motion of the intestines is inverted, and a true iliac passion is produced, which also proves fatal in a short time.\n\nCure. Various methods have been attempted for removing this terrible disease. The obstinate costiveness which attends it, made physicians at first exhibit very strong purgatives and stimulating clysters. But these medicines, by increasing the convulsive spasms of the intestines, were found to be pernicious. Balsam of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERU\">Peru</a>, by its warm aromatic power, was found to succeed much better; and Dr Sydenham accordingly prescribed it in the quantity of 40 drops twice or thrice a day taken on sugar. This, with gentle purgatives, opiates, and some drops of the hotter essential oils, continued to be the medicine commonly employed in this disease, till a specific was published by Dr Lionel Chalmers of South Carolina. This receipt was purchased by Dr Chalmers from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> where it had long been kept a secret. The only unusual medicine in this receipt, and on which the efficacy of it chiefly if not wholly depends, is sulphate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>. This must be dissolved in water, in the quantity of one grain to an ounce, and the dose of the solution is a wine-glassful given fasting for nine successive mornings. For the first four or five days this medicine discharges much serous bile both ways; but the excretions of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a> lessen by degrees; and before the course be ended, it has little other effect than to cause some degree of squeamishness, or promote a few bilious stools, or perhaps may not move the patient at all. At the time of using this medicine the patients should live upon broth made of lean meat, gruel, or panada: but about the seventh or eighth day, they may be allowed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a> and boiled chicken. Here the copper seems to do service by its tonic power; and for the same reason <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALUM\">alum</a>, recommended by Dr Percival, most probably cures the disease. He says he has found this very efficacious in obstinate affections of the bowels, and that it generally proves a cure in the slighter cases of the colica pictorum. It was given to the quantity of fifteen grains every fourth, fifth, or sixth hour; and the third dose never failed to mitigate the pain, and sometimes entirely removed it. Among purgative medicines the oleum recini is found to be the most efficacious. Mercury also, particularly under the form of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CALOMEL\">calomel</a>, has often been employed with success. And much benefit has been derived from combining the calomel with opium. From this combination there is often obtained, in the first instance, an alleviation of the pain, and afterwards a free discharge by the belly.\n\nSp. III. The Colic from Costiveness.\n\nColica stercorea, Sauv. sp. 3.\nIleus \u00e0 fecibus induratis, Sauv. sp. 2.\n\nFor the treatment of this species, see above.\n\nSp. IV. The Accidental Colic.\n\nColica Japonica,\u2014accidentalis,\u2014lactentium,\u2014\u00e0 veneno, Sauv. sp. 10. 14. 18. 20.\nCholera sicca aurigina, \u00e0 fungis venenatis, ejusd. sp. 2.\n\nWhen colics arise from acid poisonous matter taken into the stomach, the only cure is either to evacuate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POISON\">poison</a> itself by vomiting, or to swallow some other substance which may decompose it, and thus render it inactive. The most common and dangerous substances of this kind are corrosive mercury and arsenic. The former is easily decomposed by alkaline salts; and therefore a solution of lixivial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>, if swallowed before the poison has time to induce a mortification of the bowels, will prove a certain cure. Much more uncertain, however, is the case when arsenic is swallowed, because there is no certain and speedy solvent of that substance yet known. Milk has been recommended as efficacious; and lately a solution of hepatic sulphuris. The latter may possibly do service; as arsenic unites readily with sulphur, and has its pernicious qualities more obviated by that than by any other known substance: but indeed, even the solvent powers of this medicine are so weak, that its effects as well as those of others must be very uncertain.\n\nSome kinds of fungi, when swallowed, are apt to produce colics attended with stupor, delirium, and convulsions; and the same sometimes happens from eating a large\nlarge quantity of the shell-fish known by the name of muscles (the Mytilus). Some of the fungi, doubtless, may have an inherent poisonous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>; but generally they as well as the muscles act on a different principle. Their pernicious effects happen most commonly when they are taken on an empty stomach; and are then supposed to be occasioned by their adhering so close to its coats, that it cannot exert its powers, and the whole system is thrown into the utmost disorder. The malady may therefore be very easily prevented; but when once it has taken place, it cannot be removed till either vomiting be excited, or the stomach has recovered itself in such a manner as to throw off the adhering matter.\n\nSp. V. Colic of New-born <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANTS\">Infants</a>, from a Retention of the Meconium. (Sauv. sp. 19.)\n\nThis disorder would be prevented were children allowed immediately to suck their mothers, whose milk at first is purgative. But as this is not commonly done, the child is frequently troubled with colics. These, however, may be removed by a few grains of ipecacuanha, or a drop or two of antimonial wine. By these means the stomach is cleansed by vomiting, and the belly is generally loosened; but if this last effect does not happen, some gentle purge will be necessary.\n\nSp. IV. Colic from a Callosity of the Colon.\n\nIt is often impossible to discover this distemper before the patient's death; and though it should, it does not admit of a cure.\n\nSp. VII. The Colic from Intestinal Calculi. (Sauv. sp. 10. 15.)\n\nWhen certain indigestible bodies, such as cherry-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, plum-stones, small pieces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a>, &c., are swallowed, they frequently prove the basis of calculi, formed by an accretion of some kind of earthy matter; and being detained in some of the flexures of the intestines, often occasion very violent colics. These calculi do not discover themselves by any peculiar symptoms, nor do they admit of any particular method of cure. In the Medical Essays we have an instance of colics for six years, occasioned by calculi of this kind. The concretions were at last passed by stool; and their passage was procured by causing the patient drink a large quantity of warm water, with a view to promote the evacuation of bile, a redundancy of which was supposed to be the cause of her disorder.\n\nGenus LX. CHOLERA, the Cholera Morbus.\n\nCholera, Sauv. 253. Lin. 186. Vog. 110. Sag. 183. Hoffm. II. 165.\nDiarrhoea chol\u00e9rica, Junck. 112.\n\nSp. I. The Spontaneous Cholera, coming on without any manifest cause.\n\nCholera spontanea, Sauv. sp. 1. Sydenh sect. iv. cap. 2.\nCholera Indica, Sauv. sp. 7.\n\nSp. II. The Accidental Cholera, from acrid matter taken inwardly.\n\nCholera crapulosa, Sauv. sp. 11.\nCholera \u00e0 venenis, Sauv. sp. 4, 5.\n\nThe cholera shows itself by excessive vomiting and purging of bilious matters, with violent pain, inflation and distention of the belly. Sometimes the patients fall into universal convulsions; and sometimes they are affected with violent spasms in particular parts of the body. There is a great thirst, a small and unequal pulse, cold sweats, fainting, coldness of the extremities, and hiccup; and death frequently ensues in twenty-four hours.\n\nIn this disease, as a great quantity of bile is deposited in the alimentary canal, particularly in the stomach, the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> is to counteract its influence, and to promote an easy discharge of it. It is next necessary to restrain that increased secretion of bile, by which a fresh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEPOSITION\">deposition</a> in the alimentary canal would otherwise be soon produced. And, in the last place, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> must often be employed to restore a sound condition to the alimentary canal, which is frequently much weakened by the violence of the disease.\n\nOn these grounds, the cure of this distemper is effected by giving the patient a large quantity of warm water, or very weak broth, in order to cleanse the stomach of the irritating matter which occasions the disease, and injecting the same by way of clyster, till the pains begin to abate a little. After this, a large dose of laudanum is to be given in some convenient vehicle, and repeated as there is occasion. But if the vomiting and purging have continued for a long time before the physician be called, immediate recourse must be had to the laudanum, because the patient will be too much exhausted to bear any further evacuations. Sometimes the propensity to vomit is so strong, that nothing will be retained, and the laudanum itself thrown up as soon as swallowed. To <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> the stomach in these cases, Dr Douglas, in the Medical Essays, recommends a decoction of oat-bread toasted as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> as coffee; and the decoction itself ought to be of the colour of weak coffee. He says he does not remember that this decoction was ever vomited by any of his patients. An infusion of mint leaves, or good simple mint-water is also said to be very efficacious in the same case.\n\nThe tincture of opium is sometimes retained when given in conjunction with a portion of the sulphuric acid properly diluted. But when it cannot be retained in a fluid form by the aid of any addition, it will sometimes sit upon the stomach when taken in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> state.\n\nAfter the violence of the disease is overcome, the alimentary canal, and the stomach in particular, requires to be braced and strengthened. With this view recourse is often had with advantage to different vegetable bitters, particularly to the use of the colombo root; which, while it strengthens the stomach, is also observed to have a remarkable tendency in allaying a disposition to vomiting, which often remains for a considerable time after the cholera may be said to be overcome.\nGENUS LXI. DIARRHOEA.\n\nLooseness.\n\nDiarrhoea, Sauv. gen. 253. Lin. 187. Vog. 105.\nSag. gen. 189. Junck. 112.\nHepatirrhoea, Sauv. gen. 246.\nCholerica, Lin. 190.\nCoelica, Sauv. gen. 255. Lin. 189.

The Feculent Diarrhoea.\n\nDiarrhoea stercorosa et vulgaris, Sauv. sp. 1. 2.\n\nThis is occasioned by too great a quantity of matter thrown into the alimentary canal; and what is discharged has not the appearance of excrements, but is much whiter, and of a thinner consistence. Voracious people who do not sufficiently chew their food, gormandizers, and even those who stammer in their speech, are said to be liable to this disease. In slighter cases it is removed without any medicine, or by a dose of rhubarb; but where the matters have acquired a putrid taint, the disorder may be much protracted and become dangerous. In this case lenient and antiseptic purgatives are to be made use of, after which the cure is to be completed by astringents.\n\nSp. II. Bilious Diarrhoea.\n\n(Sauv. sp. 8).\n\nThis distemper shows itself by copious stools of a very yellow colour, attended with gripes and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of the bowels, thirst, bitterness and dryness of the mouth, yellowness of the tongue, and frequently follows an intermitting or bilious fever. When the fever is gone, the diarrhoea is to be removed by acidulated and cooling drinks, with small doses of nitre.\n\nSp. III. The Mucous Diarrhoea.\n\nDiarrhoea lactentium, Sauv. sp. 19.\nDysenteria Parisiaca, Sauv. sp. 3.\nDiarrhoea ab hypercatharsi, Sauv. sp. 16.\nDysenteria a catharticis, Sauv. sp. 12.\nPituitaria, Vog. 111.\nLeucorrhoeis, Vog. 112.\nDiarrhoea pituitosa, Sauv. sp. 4.\nCoelica mucosa, Sauv. sp. 3.\nDiarrhoea serosa, Sauv. sp. 10.\na. Diarrhoea urinosa.\n\nThis kind of diarrhoea, besides the matters usually excreted, is attended with a copious dejection of the mucus of the intestines with great pain; while the patient daily pines away, but without any fever.\u2014Persons of all ages are liable to it, and it comes on usually in the winter-time; but is so obstinate, that it will sometimes continue for years. In obstinate loosenesses of this kind, vomits frequently repeated are of the greatest service. It is also very beneficial to keep the body warm, and rub the belly with stimulating ointments; at the same time that astringent clysters, rhubarb, and stomachic medicines, are to be exhibited. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STARCH\">Starch</a> clysters are very often efficacious.\u2014Some kinds of looseness are contagious; and Sir John Pringle mentions a soldier who laboured under an obstinate diarrhoea, who infected all those that used the same privy with himself. In the looseness which frequently followed a dysentery, the same author tells us that he began the cure with giving a vomit of ipecacuanha, after which he put the patients on a course of astringents. He used a mixture of three drachms of extract of logwood, dissolved in an ounce and a half of spirit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CINNAMON\">cinnamon</a>, to which was added seven ounces of common water, and two drachms of tincture of catechu. Of this the patient took two spoonsfuls once in four or five hours, and sometimes also an opiate at bedtime. He recommends the same medicine in obstinate diarrhoeas of all kinds. A decoction of simarauba bark was also found effectual, when the dysenteric symptoms had gone off. Dr Huck, who used this article in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">North</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>, also recommends it in diarrhoeas. Two or three ounces of the simarauba are to be boiled in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> and a half of water to a pound, and the whole quantity taken throughout the day. He began with the weakest decoction; and, when the stomach of the patient could easily bear it, he then ordered the strongest; but at the same time he acknowledges, that, unless the sick found themselves sensibly better within three days from the time they began the medicine, they seldom afterwards received any benefit from it. But when all astringents have failed, Sir John Pringle informs us, he hath known a cure effected by a milk and farinaceous diet; and he thinks in all cases the disorder would be much more easily removed, if the patients could be prevailed on to abstain entirely from spirituous liquors and animal food. If the milk by itself should turn sour on the stomach, a third part of lime-water may be added. In one case he found a patient receive more benefit from good butter-milk than from sweet-milk. The chief drinks are decoctions of barley, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICE\">rice</a>, calcined hartshorn, toast and water, or milk and water.\n\nSp. IV. The Coeliac Passion.\n\nCoelica chylosa, Sauv. sp. 1.\nCoelica lactea, Sauv. sp. 4.\n\nThere are very great differences among physicians concerning the nature of this disease. Sauvages says, from Arctetus, it is a chronic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLUX\">flux</a>, in which the aliment is discharged half digested. It is attended with great pains of the stomach, resembling the prickling of pins; rumbling and flatus in the intestines; white stools, because deprived of bile, while the patient becomes weak and lean. The disease is tedious, periodical, and difficult to be cured. Sauvages adds, that none of the moderns seem to have observed the disease properly; that the excrements indeed are white, on account of a deficiency of the bile, but the belly is bound as in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JAUNDICE\">jaundice</a>. Dr Cullen says there is a dejection of a milky liquid of the nature of chyle; but this is treated by Vogel as a vulgar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>. He accuses the moderns of copying from Arctetus, who mentions white faeces as a symptom of the distemper; from whence authors have readily fallen into the notion that they never appeared of any other colour in persons.\npersons labouring under the celiac passion. This error quickly produced another, which has been very generally received; namely, that the chyle was thrown out of the lacteals by reason of some obstruction there, and thus passed along with the excrements; of which he says there is not the least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a>, and agrees with Areteus that the whiteness is only occasioned by the want of bile. He endeavours to prove at length, that the celiac passion can neither be occasioned by an obstruction of the lacteals, nor of the mesenteric glands; though he owns that such as have died of this disease and were dissected, had obstructions in the mesenteric glands; but he denies that all those in whom such obstructions occur, are subject to the celiac passion. He considers the distemper as arising from a cachexy of the stomachic and intestinal juices; and directs the cure to be attempted by emetics, purgatives, antiscopics, and tonics, as in other species of diarrhoea.\n\nSp. V. The Lientery.\n\nLienteria spontanea, Sauv. sp. 2.\n\nThe lientery, according to Sauvages, differs from the celiac passion only in being a slighter species of the disease. The aliment passes very quickly through the intestines, with scarce any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a>. The patients do not complain of pain, but are sometimes affected with an intolerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUNGER\">hunger</a>. The cure is to be attempted by stomachics and tonics, especially the Peruvian bark. This disease is most common at the earlier periods of life; and then rhubarb in small quantities, particularly when combined with magnesia, is often productive of the best effects.\n\nSp. VI. The Hepatic Flux.\n\nHepatirrhoea intestinalis, Sauv. sp. 2.\n\nThe hepatic diarrhoea is by Sauvages described as a flux of bloody serous matter like the washings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>, which percolates through the coats of the intestines by means of the anastomosing vessels. It is the celiac passion of Trillianus; and which, according to Sauvages, rarely, if ever, occurs as a primary disease. It has, however, been observed to follow an inflammation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIVER\">liver</a>, and then almost always proves fatal.\n\nGENUS LXII.

The diabetes first shows itself by a dryness of the mouth and thirst, white frothy spittle, and the urine in somewhat larger quantity than usual. A heat begins to be perceived in the bowels, which at first is a little pungent, and gradually increases. The thirst continues to augment by degrees, and the patient gradually loses the power of retaining his urine for any length of time. It is remarkable, that though the patients drink much, the quantity of urine always exceeds what is drank. In Dr Home's Clinical Experiments we have an account of two patients labouring under this disease: one of them drank between 10 and 12 English pints a-day without being satisfied. The quantity was greater in the forenoon than in the afternoon. In the other the case was reversed. He drank about four pints a-day, and more in the afternoon than the forenoon. The former discharged from 12 to 15 pints of urine in the day: the latter, 11 or 12; so that his urine always exceeded his drink by eight or at least seven pints. When the urine is retained a little while, there is a swelling of the loins, feet, and scrotum; in this disease the strength gradually decays; the skin is dry and shrivelled; oedematous swellings arise in various parts of the body, but afterwards subside without relieving the disease in the least; and the patient is frequently carried off by convulsions.\n\nThe most singular phenomenon in this disease is, that the urine seems to be entirely or very much divested of an animal nature, and to be largely impregnated with a saccharine matter scarce distinguishable from that obtained from the sugar-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANE\">cane</a>. This discovery was first made by Dr Dobson of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIVERPOOL\">Liverpool</a>, who made some experiments on the urine of a person labouring under a diabetes, who discharged 28 pints of urine every day, taking during the same time from 12 to 14 pounds of solid and liquid food. Some of this urine being set aside, fell into a spontaneous effervescence, changed first into a vinous liquor, and afterwards into an acetic one, before it became putrid and offensive. Eight ounces of blood taken from the same patient, separated into crassamentum and serum; the latter being sweet to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, but less so than the urine. Two quarts of the urine, evaporated to dryness, left a white cake weighing four ounces two drams and two scruples. This cake was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANULATED\">granulated</a>, and broke easily between the fingers: it smelled sweet like brown sugar; neither could it by the taste be distinguished from sugar, except that it left a slight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of coolness on the tongue. The experiment was repeated after the patient was recovered to such a degree as to pass only 14 pints of urine a-day. There was now a strong urinous smell during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a>; and the residuum could not be procured in a solid form; but was blackish, and much resembled very thick treacle. In Dr Home's patients, the serum of the blood had no supernatural sweetness; in one of them the crassamentum was\nwas covered with a thick inflammatory crust. In one of these patients the urine yielded an ounce and a half, and in the other an ounce, of saccharine matter from each pound. It had, however, an urinous smell, and a saline taste mixed with the sweet one; and the urine of one fermented with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YEAST\">yeast</a>, we are told, into \"tolerable small-beer.\" Both these patients had a voracious appetite, and perpetual gnawing sense of hunger; as had also Dr Dobson's patient. The insipid urine of those affected with diabetes has not been examined by physicians with sufficient accuracy to enable us to speak with confidence of its contents.\n\nCauses. These are exceedingly obscure and uncertain; spasms of the nervous system, debility, and everything inducing it, but especially strong diuretics and immoderate venery, have been accused of bringing on the diabetes. It has, however, occurred in persons where none of these causes could be suspected; nor have the best physicians been able to determine it\u2014Dissections have only shown that the kidneys were in an enlarged and lax state. In one of Dr Home's patients who died, they smelled sour; which showed that the urine peculiar to diabetes came from the kidneys, and was not sent directly from the intestines by a retrograde motion of the lymphatics, as some imagine.\n\nPrognosis. The diabetes is rarely cured, unless when taken at the very beginning, which is seldom done; and in a confirmed diabetes the prognosis must therefore be unfavourable.\n\nCure. As there is reason to believe that in this affection the morbid secretion of urine, which is both preternatural in point of quantity and of quality, arises from a morbid diminution of tone in the kidney, the great object in the cure must be the restoration of due tone to the secreting vessels of the kidney. But as even this diminished tone would not give rise to the peculiar vitiated secretion without a morbid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a> of that organ, it is necessarily a second object to remove this morbid sensibility. But besides this, the morbid secretion of urine may also be counteracted both by a diminution of the determination of fluids to the kidney, and by preventing the occurrence of superfluous water in the general mass of blood.\n\nOn these grounds the principal hopes of a cure in this distemper are from astringent and strengthening medicines. Dr Dobson's patient was relieved by the following remedies; which, however, were frequently varied, as none of them produced their good effects for any length of time: Cinchona in substance, with small doses of rhubarb; decoction of the bark, with the acid elixir of vitriol; the cold infusion of the bark, of which he drank from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUART\">quart</a> to two quarts daily; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOVER\">Dover</a>'s powder; alum-whey; lime-water; antimonials combined with tinctura thebaica. The warm bath was used occasionally when the skin was remarkably hot and dry, and the patient complained of restlessness and anxiety. The tincture of cantharides was likewise tried; but he could never take more than 25 drops for a dose, without exciting great uneasiness in his bowels. The body was kept constantly open, either with rhubarb or the infusion of senna joined with rhubarb. His common drinks were rice-water, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-BARLEY_WATER\">barley-water</a>, lime-water, and milk; lime-water alone; sage, balm, or mint <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEA\">tea</a>; small beer, simple water, and water acidulated with the sulphuric acid. In seven months, these remedies, Diabetes, in whatever manner varied, made no further progress in removing the disease. In Dr Home's patients, all these medicines, and many others, were tried without the least good effect; insomuch that he uses this remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>: \"Thus, these two patients have exhausted all that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> had ever recommended, and almost all that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> could suggest; yet in both cases, the disease has resisted all the means of cure used.\" It is remarkable, that though septic were given to both, in such quantity as evidently to produce a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUTREFACTION\">putrefaction</a> in the prime via, the urine remained unaltered both in quantity and quality.\n\nBut although this disease be frequently in its nature so obstinate as to resist every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of cure, yet there can be no doubt that particular remedies have succeeded in different cases. Dr Brisbane relates several cases cured by the use of tincture of cantharides; and Dr M'Cormick has related some in the 9th volume of the Edinburgh Medical Commentaries, which yielded to Dover's powder after a variety of other remedies had been tried in vain.\n\nBut of all the modes of cure lately proposed, that which has been most celebrated, is the treatment recommended by Dr Rollo of the Royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTILLERY\">Artillery</a>. In a valuable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> lately published, entitled Cases of the Diabetes Mellitus, he has recorded two remarkable examples of the good effects of a peculiar regimen in this disease. He considers diabetes as being a disease not of the kidney but of the alimentary canal, and as arising from the formation of an uncommon quantity of sugar. He therefore strictly forbids the use of every article of diet which can furnish sugar, even of bread; and by a diet consisting entirely of animal and alkaline food his patients were much benefited. The experience of some other practitioners has to a certain degree confirmed the observations of Dr Rollo. But we are sorry to add, that we have met with many other instances of diabetes mellitus, in which a diet consisting solely of animal food, had a fair trial, without producing any material benefit. And we may conclude with observing, that the cure of diabetes still remains to be discovered. As allaying the excessive thirst, and producing a temporary restoration of urinous smell, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1810/vol0.html#article-UREA\">urea</a> which it ought naturally to contain, we have found nothing equal in efficacy to a large proportion of fat meat, such as pork steaks or butter.\n\nGENUS LXIII. HYSTERIA.\n\nHysterics.\n\nHysteria, Sauv. gen. 135. Lin. 126. Vog. 219. Sag. gen. 242.\nMalum hystericum, Hoffm. III. 50. Junck. 36.\nAffectio hysterica, Willis de Morb. Convulsiv. cap. 5. 10. 11. Sydenham Diss. Epist. ad G. Cole, Whytt on Nervous Disorders.\n\nDescription. The hysteria is a convulsive disease, which comes on at uncertain intervals, sometimes longer and sometimes shorter, but at no stated time. The paroxysms commonly begin with a languor and debility of the whole body; yawning, stretching, and restlessness. A sense of coldness also in the extremities, almost always precedes, and for the most part remains during the whole time of the paroxysm. To this sometimes\ntimes succeeds a sense of heat; and the two sensations <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> with each other in different parts of the body. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a> is sometimes flushed and sometimes pale; and sometimes the paleness and flushing come alternately. There is a violent pain in the head; the eyes become dim, and pour out tears; there is a rumbling and inflation of the intestines; a sensation is felt like that of a globe ascending from the lower part of the abdomen or hypogastrium, which sometimes seems to roll along the whole alimentary canal. It ascends to the stomach, sometimes suddenly, sometimes slowly; and there produces a sense of inflation and weight, together with anxiety, nausea, and vomiting. At last it comes up to the throat, where it produces a sense of suffocation, and difficulty of breathing or swallowing. During this time there are the most violent pains both in the external and internal parts of the abdomen; the muscles are convulsed; the umbilicus is drawn inwards; and there are frequently such spasms of the intestines, that neither clysters can be injected, nor even flatus pass downwards. Sometimes the paroxysm remits after these symptoms have continued for a certain time, but more frequently the patients fall into fainting fits; sometimes they lie without motion, as if they were in a deep sleep; sometimes they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> their breasts violently and continually with their hands, and sometimes they are seized with general convulsions, and the disease puts on the appearance of an epilepsy. In some patients the extremities become cold and stiff, and the body has the appearance of one in a catalepsy. Sometimes a most violent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEATING\">beating</a> pain takes place in some part of the head, as if a nail was driven into it, and all visible objects seem to turn round; grievous pains attacks the loins, back, and bladder, and the patients discharge a surprising quantity of urine as limpid as water; which last is one of the surest signs of the disease. The mind is very much affected as well as the body. Sometimes the patients are tormented with vain fears: sometimes they will laugh, at other times cry immoderately; and sometimes their temper becomes so peevish and fretful, that they cannot enjoy a moment's quiet. The appearances which take place in this affection are indeed so much varied, that they can hardly be enumerated: they may, however, with propriety, be divided into hysteric fits, which very much resemble those of epilepsy, excepting that they are not attended with an abolition of the internal senses; and hysteric symptoms, such as the globus hystericus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLAVUS\">clavus</a> hystericus, and the like, which are chiefly known to constitute a part of this disease from being observed to alternate with fits.\n\nCauses, &c. The general cause of hysteria is thought by the best physicians to consist in a too great mobility and irritability of the nervous system, and of consequence the disease may be brought on by whatever debilitates and renders the body irritable. Hence it most frequently attacks females of a weak and lax habit of body, though there are some instances of men also attacked by it. It generally comes on between the time of puberty and the age of 35, and makes its attacks during the time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-MENSTRUATION\">menstruation</a> more frequently than at any other. It also more frequently seizes barren women and young widows, than such as are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> children.\n\nPrognosis. Though the appearance of this disease be so very terrible, it seldom proves mortal unless by wrong treatment: but notwithstanding this, it is extremely difficult of cure, and rarely admits of anything else than being palliated; for though it should seem to be conquered by medicine for a time, it very quickly returns, and that from the slightest causes.\n\nCure. The ends principally to be aimed at in the cure of this disease are, in the first place, the removal of particular convulsive or spasmodic affections immediately producing various appearances in the disease, whether under the form of proper hysteric fits, or merely of what may be called hysteric symptoms; and in the second place, the prevention of the return of symptoms after they have been removed, by the employment of proper remedies during those intervals from complaints which patients often have when labouring under this affection.\n\nThe most powerful remedy hitherto discovered in hysteric cases is opium, or the tincture of it. By this commonly the most violent paroxysms are stopped, though it be insufficient to accomplish a radical cure. In Dr Home's Clinical Experiments we find an instance of a cure performed by venesection, though this remedy has been generally condemned in hysterical cases. Asafoetida seems to stand next in virtue to opium; though with some it disagrees, and occasions pains in the stomach and vomiting. Sulphuric ether will also frequently remove an hysteric fit; but its effects are of short duration; and if it do not effect a cure soon after its exhibition, no service is to be expected, either by perseverance in the use of it or by increasing the dose; and with some constitutions it disagrees to such a degree as to occasion convulsions. If the patient be seized with a violent fit, so that she can swallow nothing, which is frequently the case, it will be proper to apply some strong volatile alkali to her nose; or if that be not at hand, the vapour of burning feathers is sometimes very efficacious. In some instances benefit is derived from the sudden application of cold water to the face or hands; but still more frequently the application of water in a tepid state, particularly the warm pediluvium, is found to be of very great service in bringing about a favourable termination of different violent hysteric symptoms. A plaster of galbanum and asafoetida will also prove serviceable: but it must be remembered, that none of these things will prevent the return of the disease; and therefore a radical cure is to be attempted by exercise, cinchona, chalybeates, mineral waters, and other tonics; but particularly, where the state of the patient is such as to be able to bear it, by the use of the cold bath, which, where it does not disagree with the constitution, is often of the greatest service in preventing returns of this affection.\n\nIn hysteria as well as in chorea Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAMILTON\">Hamilton</a> has found, that in some instances very great benefit has been obtained from copious evacuations of the alimentary canal, by cathartics frequently repeated.\n\nGENUS LXIV.

Hydrophobia Rabiosa, or Hydrophobia consequent on the Bite of a Mad Animal.\n\nHydrophobia vulgaris, Sauv. sp. i.\n\nIt is the opinion of some, that Dr Cullen has done wrong in employing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> hydrophobia as a generic name, under which canine madness is included; and it must be allowed, that the dread of water, while it is not universal, is also a symptom occurring only late in the disease, at least in the greater part of cases. Perhaps his arrangement would have been less exceptionable, if, following Linn\u00e6us, he had adopted rabies as a generic term, and had distinguished this particular species by the epithet of canina, contagiosa, or the like. Disputes, however, about names, are in general not very important; and it is sufficient to observe, that the affection now to be treated of is canine madness, or that disease which arises from the bite of a mad animal.\n\nDescription. This disease commonly does not make its attack till a considerable time after the bite. In some few instances it has commenced in seven or eight days from the accident; but generally the patient continues in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> for 20, 30, or 40 days, or even much longer. The bite, if not prevented, will in general be healed long before that time, frequently with the greatest ease; though sometimes it resists all kinds of healing applications, and forms a running ulcer which discharges a quantity of matter for many days. It has been said, that the nearer the wounded place is to the salivary glands, the sooner the symptoms of hydrophobia appear. The approach of the disease is known by the cicatrix of the wound becoming high, hard, and elevated, and by a peculiar sense of prickling at the part; pains shoot from it towards the throat; sometimes it is surrounded with livid or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> streaks, and seems to be in a state of inflammation; though frequently there is nothing remarkable to be observed about it. The patient becomes melancholy, loves solitude, and has sickness at stomach. Sometimes the peculiar symptom of the disease, the dread of water, comes on all at once. We have an instance of one who, having taken a vomit of ipecacuanha for the sickness he felt at his stomach, was seized with the hydrophobia in the time he was drinking the warm water. Sometimes the disease begins like a common sore throat; and the soreness daily increasing, the hydrophobic symptoms show themselves like a convulsive spasm of the muscles of the fauces. In others, the mind seems to be primarily affected, and they are subject to despondency and melancholy for some time <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> to any dread of water. And when that dread commences, it is with an evident mental afflication. Dr James, in his Treatise on Canine Madness, mentions a boy sent out to fill two bottles with water, who was so terrified by the noise of the liquid running into them, that he fled into the house crying out that he was bewitched. He mentions also the case of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">farmer</a>, who, going to draw some ale from a cask, was terrified to such a degree at its running into the vessel, that he ran out in a great haste with the spigot in his hand. But in whatever manner this symptom comes on, it is certain that the most painful sensations accompany every attempt to swallow liquids. Nay, the bare sight of water, of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a>-glass, of any thing clear or pellucid, will give the utmost uneasiness, or even throws the patient into convulsions.\n\nWith regard to the affection of the mind itself in this disease, it does not appear that the patients are deprived of reason. Some have, merely by the dint of resolution, conquered the dread of water, though they never could conquer the convulsive motions which the contact of liquids occasioned: while this resolution has been of no avail; for the convulsions and other symptoms increasing, have almost always destroyed the unhappy patients.\n\nIn this disease there seems to be an extreme sensibility and irritability of the nervous system. The eyes cannot bear the light, or the sight of any thing white; the least touch or motion offends them, and they want to be kept as quiet and in as dark a place as possible. Some complain of the coldness of the air, frequently when it is really warm. Others complain of violent heat; and have a great desire for cold air, which yet never fails to increase the symptoms. In all there is a great flow of viscid saliva into the mouth; which is exceedingly troublesome to the patients, as it has the same effect upon their fauces that other liquids have. This therefore they perpetually blow off with violence, which in a patient of Dr Fothergill's occasioned a noise not unlike the hollow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARKING\">barking</a> of a dog, and which he conjectures might have given rise to the common notion that hydrophobous patients bark like dogs. They have an insatiable thirst; but are unable to get down any drink, except with the utmost difficulty; though sometimes they can swallow bread soaked in liquids, slices of oranges, or other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>. There is a pain under the seroculatus cordis, as in the tetanus; and the patients mournfully point to that place as the seat of the disease. Dr Vaughan is of opinion that it is this pain, rather than any difficulty in swallowing, which distresses the patient on every attempt to drink. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> is commonly plaintive and mournful; but Dr Vaughan tells us there is a mixture of fierceness and timidity in the countenance which he cannot describe, but by which he could know a hydrophobous person without asking any questions.\n\nIn this distemper, indeed, the symptoms are so various, that they cannot be enumerated; for we will seldom read two cases of hydrophobia which do not differ very remarkably in this respect. Some seem to have at times a furious delirium, and an inclination to spit at or bite the bystanders; while others show no such inclination, but will even suffer people to wipe the inside of their mouths with the corner of a handkerchief in order to clear away the viscid saliva which\nSpasms is ready to suffocate them. In some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> patients there is an involuntary erection of the penis, and emission of the semen; and the urine is forced away by the frequent returns of the spasms. In a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> from Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WOLF\">Wolf</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARSAW\">Warsaw</a> to Henry Baker, F.R.S. dated Warsaw Sept. 26th, 1767, we have the following melancholy account of the cases of five persons who died of the hydrophobia: \"None of them quite lost their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> senses; but they were all talking without intermission, praying, lamenting, despairing, cursing, sighing, spitting a frothy saliva, screeching, sometimes belching, retching, but rarely vomiting. Every member is convulsed by fits, but most violently from the navel up to the breast and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OESOPHAGUS\">oesophagus</a>. The fit comes on every quarter of an hour; the fauces are not red, nor the tongue dry. The pulse is not at all feverish; and when the fit is over nearly like a sound pulse. The face grows pale, then brown, and during the fit almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>; the lips livid; the head is drowsy, and the ears tingling; the urine limpid. At last they grow weary; the fits are less violent, and cease towards the end; the pulse becomes weak, intermittent, and not very quick; they sweat, and at last the whole body becomes cold. They compose themselves quietly as if to get sleep, and so they expire. The blood drawn a few hours before death appears good in every respect. A general observation was, that the lint and dressings of the wounds, even when dry, were always black, and that when the pus was very good in colour and appearance.\" In one of Dr Wolf's patients who recovered, the blood stunk intolerably as it was drawn from a vein; and one of Mr Vaughan's patients complained of an intolerable fetid smell proceeding from the wounded part, though nobody but himself could perceive it. In general, the violent convulsions cease a short time before death; and even the hydrophobia goes off, so that the patients can drink freely. But this does not always happen; for Mr Vaughan mentions the case of a patient, in whom, \"when he had in appearance ceased to breathe, the spasms cynicus was observable, with an odd convulsive motion in the muscles of the face; and the strange <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTRARIETY\">contrariety</a> which took place in the action of these produced the most horrid assemblage of features that can well be conceived. Of this patient also it was remarkable, that in the last hours of his life he ceased to cry for drink, which had been his constant request; but was perpetually asking for something to eat.\"\n\nThe hydrophobia seems to be a symptom peculiar to the human race; for the mad animals which communicate the infection, do not seem to have any dread of water. Dr Wolf, in the letter above quoted, says in general, that cattle bit at the same time and by the same animal (a mad wolf) which bit the persons whose cases he related, died nearly with the same frightful raging as the men; but says nothing of their having any hydrophobia: nay, Dr James and some others assert, that the hydrophobia is not always an attendant on rabies canina in the human race; and indeed it is certain that the disease has proved mortal after this terrible symptom has been removed. With regard to the symptoms of madness in dogs, they are very equivocal; and those particularly enumerated by some authors, are only such as might be expected in dogs much heated or agitated by being violently pursued and struck. One symptom indeed, if it could be hydrogenated upon, would determine the matter; namely, that all other dogs avoid and run away from one that is mad; and even large dogs will not attack one of the smallest size who is infected with this disease. Upon this supposition they point out a method of discovering whether a dog who has been killed was really mad or not; namely, by rubbing a piece of meat along the inside of his mouth, and then offering it to a sound dog. If the latter eats it, it is a sign the dog was not mad; but if the other rejects it with a kind of howling noise, it is certain that he was. Dr James tells us, that among dogs the disease is infectious by staying in the same place; and that after a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KENNEL\">kennel</a> has been once infected, the dogs put into it will be for a considerable time afterwards in danger of going mad also. A remedy for this, he says, is, to keep geese for some time in the kennel. He rejects as false the opinion that dogs when going mad will not bark; though he owns that there is a very considerable change in their bark, which becomes hoarse and hollow.\n\nOf all the accounts that have been published on the characteristics of rabies in dogs, the best is to be found in Dr Arnold's late treatise: the characteristics there mentioned are given on the authority of Mr Meynell, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> who has paid particular attention to this subject. From Mr Meynell's observations it appears, that most of the characteristics which have been commonly mentioned, are mere vulgar errors; and, according to him, the best marks are from their peculiar dull look, and the peculiar sound which they utter. \"Mad dogs (says Mr Meynell) never bark, but occasionally utter a most dismal and plaintive howl, expressive of extreme distress, and which, they who have once heard it, can never forget; so that dogs may be known to be going mad without being seen, when only this dismal howl is heard.\n\nCauses, &c. In no disease whatever are we more at a loss to discover the causes than in the hydrophobia. In dogs, foxes, and wolves, it seems to come on spontaneously; though this is contested by some authors. It is said, that the causes commonly assigned, viz. heat, feeding upon putrid flesh, want of water, &c. are not sufficient for producing the distemper. It does not appear that madness is more frequent among dogs in the warm than in the cold climates; nay, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of Antigua, where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> is very hot, and the water very scarce, this distemper has never, it is said, been observed. As to putrid aliment, it seems natural for dogs to prefer this to any other, and they have been known to subsist upon it for a long time without any detriment. For these reasons, they think the disease arises from a specific contagion, like the smallpox and measles among the human race, which, being once produced by causes unknown, continues to be propagated by the intercourse which dogs have with each other, as the diseases <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> mentioned continue to be propagated among the human race.\n\nWith regard to the immediate cause among mankind, there is not the least doubt that the hydrophobia is occasioned by the saliva of the mad animal being mixed with the blood. It does not appear that this can operate through the cuticle; but, when that is rubbed off, the smallest quantity is sufficient to com-\ncommunicate the disease, and a slight scratch with the teeth of a mad animal has been found as pernicious as a large wound. It is certain also, that the infection has been communicated by the bites of dogs, cats, wolves, foxes, weasels, swine, and even cocks and hens, when in a state of madness. But it does not appear that the distemper is communicable from one hydrophobic person to another, by means of the bite, or any other way. Dr Vaughan inoculated a dog with the saliva of a hydrophobic child, but the animal continued free from disease for two months; and though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a> promised to inform the public if it should happen to occur afterwards, nothing has hitherto appeared on that subject. A nurse also frequently kissed this child during the time of his disorder, but no bad consequence ensued.\n\nWhen we attempt to investigate the nature of the cause of the hydrophobia by dissections, our inquiries are commonly disappointed. In two bodies opened by Dr Vaughan, there was not the least morbid appearance; in the very fauces, where we might have expected that the disease would have shown itself most evidently, there was not the least appearance even of inflammation. The stomach, intestines, diaphragm, oesophagus, &c. were all in a natural state; neither do we find in authors of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> any certain accounts of morbid appearances in the bodies of hydrophobous persons after death. Dr Vaughan therefore concludes, that the poison acts upon the nervous system; and is so wholly confined to it, that it may be doubted whether the qualities of the blood are altered by it or not; and that it acts upon the nerves by impairing and disturbing their functions to such a degree as speedily to end in a total extinction of the vital principle. As to the difficulty in swallowing generally believed to accompany the dread of water, he treats it as a misrepresentation, as well as that the oesophagus with the muscles subservient to deglutition are especially concerned in this disease. The principal foundation of the evil, he thinks, rests on a morbid sensibility both of the external and internal fauces. For the sight of a liquid, or the application of any substance to the internal fauces, but more especially of a fluid, instantly excites the most painful feelings. Nay, the same symptoms are produced by touching the external fauces, with a fluid, or by the contact of cold air with these parts; and nearly in as great a degree. But a solid or fluid substance being conveyed into the oesophagus, the transit into the stomach is accomplished with little or no impediment; so that in fact the difficulty is surmounted before the patient is engaged in the action of swallowing. Nor is the excruciating pain, which never fails to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a> of every attempt to drink, felt in the fauces and throat: it is, he says, at the scrobiculus cordis; to which the sufferer applies his hand. From this last circumstance, therefore, from the presence of the risus sardonicus, from the muscles of the abdomen being forcibly contracted, and from the sense of suffocation which seems to threaten the patient with immediate death, Dr Vaughan has been led to think that in the hydrophobia a new sympathy was established between the fauces, the diaphragm, and the abdominal muscles.\n\nPrognosis. When a person is bit, the prognosis with regard to the ensuing hydrophobia is very uncertain. All those who are bit do not fall into the disease; Hydrophobia, Dr Vaughan relates, that out of 30 bit by a mad dog, only one was seized with the hydrophobia. During the interval between the bite and the time the disease comes on, there are no symptoms by which we can judge whether it will appear or not. When once it has made its appearance, the prognosis is exceedingly fatal, though there are certainly some well authenticated cases of complete recovery, particularly one recorded by Dr Arnold.\n\nPrevention and Cure. It has been generally allowed by practitioners, that though the hydrophobia may be prevented, yet it can seldom if ever be cured after it has made its appearance. The most essential part of the treatment therefore depends on the proper use of means of prevention. The great objects to be aimed at in prevention, are, in the first place, the complete removal of the contagious matter as soon as possible; or, secondly, means of destroying it at the part, where there is even the slightest reason to believe that it has not been completely removed. Of all the means of removal, the complete <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> out the part to which the tooth had been applied, is unquestionably the most to be depended upon. This practice, therefore, should be had recourse to as soon as possible. The sooner it can be accomplished the better. But it has been observed, that as a peculiar sensation at the part affected always precedes the accession of the disease, even when it takes place at a late period after the bite, there is good ground for believing that the removal of the part may be of advantage even after a considerable interval. But besides removal of the contagious matter, by cutting away the part to which it is attached, this should also be attempted by careful and long-continued washing. This may be done, in most instances, before a proper opportunity can be had of having recourse to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a>. Cold water should particularly be poured upon the wound from a considerable height, that the matter may be washed away with some force. Even after removal by the knife, careful washing is still a necessary and proper precaution. And after both these, to prevent as far as can be the possibility of any contagious matter lurking about the wounded part, it should not be allowed to heal, but a discharge of matter should be supported for the space of several weeks, by ointment with cantharides, or similar applications. By these means there is at least the best chance of removing the matter at a sufficiently early period. And this mode of prevention seems to be of more consequence than all others put together which have hitherto been discovered. But besides removal, prevention may also be obtained by the destruction of the contagious matter at the part; and where there is the least reason to think that a complete removal has not been obtained, this should always be had recourse to. With this intention the actual cautery and burning with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUN\">gun</a>-powder have been employed. And the action of fire is probably one of the most powerful agents that can be used for this purpose. But recourse has also been had to washing, both with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a> and with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALKALIES\">alkalies</a>. Of the former kind, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VINEGAR\">vinegar</a> has been chiefly used, but more may probably be expected from the latter; and particularly from the caustic alkali, so far diluted that it can be applied with safety: for from its influence as a solvent of animal mucus, it gives\nthe best chance of a complete removal of the matter, independent of any influence in changing its nature. It has been thought also, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> applied to the part may be of service. But if recourse be had to it, more active measures should at least be previously employed; and even then, some are of opinion that it is of advantage to increase the activity of the unctuous matter by combining it with mercury.\n\nOn these grounds, and by these means, we are inclined to think that the action of this contagion on the system, after it has been applied by the bite of a rabid animal, may be most effectually prevented. But after this action has once taken place, no remedy has yet been discovered on which much dependence can be put. A very great variety of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> indeed have at different periods been held forth as infallible, both in the prevention and cure of this affection; but their reputation has, perhaps, universally been founded on their being given to people, who, though really <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol11.html#article-HIT\">hit</a> by a mad dog, were yet not infected with the contagion. And this happily, either from the tooth being cleaned in making the bite, or not being covered with contagious matter, is by no means an unfrequent occurrence. Mankind, however, even from the earliest ages, have never been without some boasted specific, which has been held forth as an infallible remedy for this affection till fatal experience demonstrated the contrary. Dr Boerhaave has given a pretty full catalogue of those specifics from the days of Galen to his own time; and concludes, that no dependence is to be put in any of them. It is now, therefore, altogether unnecessary to take notice of burnt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CRABS\">crabs</a>, the hyena's skin, mithridate with tin, liver of the rabid animal, or a variety of other pretended remedies for this disease, proved by experience to be totally inefficacious. But although no greater confidence is perhaps to be put in specifics of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a>, it will be proper that these should be mentioned.\n\nBathing in cold water, especially in the sea, and drinking sea-water for a certain time, have been prescribed, and by some accounted a certain preventive. When this was known to fail, a long course of antiphlogistic regimen, violent submersion in water, even to danger of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DROWNING\">drowning</a>, and keeping the wounded place open with cauteries, were recommended.\u2014To this extreme severity Dr Mead objected; and in his treatise on this subject endeavours to show, that in all ages the greatest success has been reaped from diuretics, for which reason he proposes the following powder: \"Take ash-coloured ground-liverwort, half an ounce; black-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEPPER\">pepper</a>, two drams: reduce them separately to powder, then mix them together.\" This powder was first published in the Philosophical Transactions, by Mr Dampier, in whose family it had been kept as a secret for many years. But this medicine which was inserted in former editions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> and Edinburgh pharmacopoeias under the name of Pulvis Antilyssus, has long lost its credit.\n\nThere is a famous East <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> medicine, composed of 24 grains of native and as much fictitious cinnamon, made into a powder with 16 grains of musk. This is called the Tonguin medicine, and must be taken in a tea cupful of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARRACK\">arrack</a> or brandy; and it is said to secure the patient for 30 days, at the expiration of which it is to be repeated; but if he has any symptoms of the disease, it must be repeated in three hours, which is said to be sufficient for a cure. The first dose is to be taken as soon after the bite as possible.\n\nAnother celebrated remedy is Palmarini's powder, composed of the leaves of rue, vervain, sage, polyphyllum, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WORMWOOD\">wormwood</a>, mint, mugwort, balm, betony, St John's wort, and lesser centaury. These herbs must be gathered in their prime, dried separately in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a>, and then powdered. The dose is a dram, or a dram and a half, taken every day.\n\nA remedy which might <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> to be more efficacious than any of those hitherto mentioned is mercury. This has been recommended in frictions, and to be taken inwardly in the form of calomel and turpith mineral, in order if possible to raise a slight salivation, on which the efficacy was thought to depend. Besides this, venesection, opium, cinchona, and camphor, have been tried in very large quantities; the warm bath; and, in short, every thing which human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> could suggest; but with how little success, can be judged from many well authenticated cases.\n\nDr Wolf, after detailing a number of interesting cases, makes the following observation.\u2014\"Thus we see, that the mercury, the acids, the musk, the feeding on the most famous herbs, the sweating, the cura antiphlogistica, &c. are no specifics.\"\n\nThe following case by Dr Raymond of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARSEILLES\">Marseilles</a> shows the inefficacy of mercury even as a preventive.\u2014On the 19th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> 1765, Mr Boyer, aged 25, of a bloated cachectic habit, was bit by a mad dog in the inferior part of the leg: the wound extended half way round, bled freely, and was like a great scratch. The patient's legs had been swelled for a considerable time before the accident; and there were also two ulcers in the other leg. Some hours after the accident, the actual cautery was applied to the wound. The doctor was not present at this operation; but the part around the bite was rubbed with mercurial ointment immediately after, and the eschar was dressed with the same ointment. The eschar was separated on the first day, but the dressing was continued till the wound was cicatrised. The second day a bolus of four grains of turpith and eight grains of camphor was exhibited. This procured a considerable evacuation both by vomit and stool, and a spitting also came on. The third day the bitten leg was rubbed with mercurial ointment; in the space of a month the frictions were repeated five times on both legs, three drams of mercurial ointment being used in each friction. During the same time the bolus was five times repeated; and this treatment kept up a slight salivation to the 40th day. The evening of the third day he took the Tonguin medicine, called also Sir George Cobb's powder, in a bolus; which vomited him briskly. This powder was repeated seven or eight times in the month, generally with the same effect. During the first seven or eight days he got four times, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, a dram of the amagallis flore puniceo, fresh gathered and powdered. The 41st day, the turpith bolus was prescribed for the seventh time: he was bathed in the sea, and continued the bathing for two days more. On the 74th he was seized with the distemper; and died on the 76th, seemingly suffocated or strangled, his mouth covered with slaver, and his\nAnother instance is mentioned by the same author, of a pregnant woman bit by the same dog and on the same day with Mr Boyer, who was never seized with the distemper. She was treated in much the same manner with him, and salivated a little more. But she was bit through a shamoy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHOE\">shoe</a>, which must necessarily have cleaned the animal's teeth of the poisonous saliva before they reached her skin, and to this we are naturally led to ascribe her safety. One of Dr Wolf's patients also was a pregnant woman, and was not seized with the distemper. Perhaps women in a state of pregnancy may be less liable to this distemper than others; but it is more probable that the contagion was not communicated.\n\nThe same author tells us, \"there are many examples of the inefficacy of mercurial frictions. A surgeon of Marseilles treated a girl about 12 years of age bit by a mad dog, with mercurial frictions; applying them as in the lues venerea: yet she died of the hydrophobia on the 55th day. Her wound was not cauterized.\"\n\nIn the following case all the most powerful remedies were tried.\u2014In the afternoon of the 29th of Aug. 1777, Dr Vaughan was called to a boy of eight years of age labouring under a hydrophobia. He had been bit on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WRIST\">wrist</a> by a cat about a month before; of which the marks remained, but without any ulcer, or even the smallest appearance of inflammation. About the middle of the day before Dr Vaughan saw him, he began to complain of a pain in the part bitten, which ascended up the arm, and affected the temple on that side; soon after which he swallowed liquids with reluctance and difficulty. He was put into the warm bath for three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of an hour, during which time he was easier: he had a clyster of five ounces of fresh broth, and 30 drops of landanum, injected immediately after his coming out of it: a liniment consisting of three drams of strong mercurial ointment with the same quantity of oil of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMBER\">amber</a>, was rubbed upon the shoulders and back; two pills of a grain of flowers of zinc, and half a grain of cuprum ammoniacum, were taken every three or four hours; and a medicated atmosphere was prepared for him, by burning gum ammoniac in his room. As these remedies were not attended with any good effect, each dose of pills was ordered to contain two grains of cuprum ammoniacum, the same quantity of opium, three grains of flowers of zinc, and ten grains of asafoetida; whilst a solution of that fetid gum, with a dram of landanum, was administered as a clyster. These pills, though repeated every four hours, afforded not the smallest relief, nor did they show the least action on the frame. At last the doctor resolved to put in practice the desperate remedy mentioned by Van Helmont, of throwing the patient into cold water, and keeping him there till he is almost drowned. With this view a large tub of cold water, well saturated with common salt, was prepared, into which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> boy was plunged over head and ears, and there held until he ceased to struggle. He was then taken out again, and the same operation repeated until he became so quiet that the doctor was under apprehensions that a total extinction of life would take place. He was then wrapped up in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLANKET\">blanket</a> and put to bed, and he remained more quiet than he had formerly been; but all his former restlessness soon returned; his pulse sunk, and he died about two o'clock in the morning.\n\nAnother celebrated antidote against the poison of a mad dog has been known for some years by the name of the Ormskirk medicine. The true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of this is kept a secret by the proprietors: however, it has been analysed, and the following composition published by Dr Heysham as perfectly similar to it in all respects.\n\n\"Take half an ounce of chalk, three drams of Armenian bale, 10 grains of alum, one dram of elecampane in powder; mix them all together, and add six drops of oil of anise.\"\n\nThey must certainly be very credulous who can put confidence in such an insignificant medicine as a preservative against the hydrophobia: however, there is a possibility that there may be some unknown ingredient in the genuine powder; for it is difficult to analyse powders after the ingredients are thoroughly mixed together. The efficacy of the medicine therefore must depend on the virtues of that unknown ingredient, if any such there be. The following cases, however, too well determine that it is not infallible, as was at first pretended. In all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>, as well as many others, its reputation also is solely rested on its being exhibited in many cases where no contagion was communicated to the person bit, and while of course no disease could take place.\n\nOn the 14th of February 1774, Mr Bellamy of Holborn, aged 40, was bit by a cat affected with rabies, which was killed the same morning. The following day he took the celebrated Ormskirk medicine, sold by Hill and Berry in Hill-Street, Berkeley-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">Square</a>, and conformed in every respect to the directions given by the vender. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a> maid, who was bitten in the leg before her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> was bitten, likewise took the same remedy. About the middle of April Mr Bellamy complained of a pain in his right knee, which he supposed to be rheumatic, and which continued and increased till the 7th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a>, when he got some pills of calomel, ipecacuanha, and pil sapon, from an apothecary, with Huxham's tincture of the bark in small doses. In six days more he had a titillation in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-URETHRA\">urethra</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a> of the scrotum and penis to a degree of pain, and an emission of semen after making water, to which he had frequent calls. The medicines were discontinued; and on the 16th of that month the hydrophobia came on, and Dr Fothergill was called. Six ounces of blood were taken from his arm, and a bolus of a scruple of native cinnamon and half a scruple of musk was given every four hours. The distemper manifestly increased through the day. In the evening a clyster was injected, and several times repeated during the night; he had been put into the warm bath, and two drams of strong mercurial ointment rubbed into his legs and thighs by himself. He was greatly relieved by the warm bath while he continued in it, but the symptoms returned with increased violence in the night. The next day being greatly worse, he was blooded to as great a quantity as he could bear, had the warm bath and clysters repeated, and half an ounce of mercurial ointment rubbed into his thighs and legs. Pills of opium were prescribed, but he did not take them. He died\nSpasms, the same night, at half an hour after 12. This patient was a man of great resolution, and could in part conquer his aversion at water. He seemed to have totally forgot the accident of the bite; and casually said, that he thought this disorder resembled the hydrophobia, without supposing that he was afflicted with that distemper at the time.\u2014The bite on the girl's leg refused to heal, baffled the art of a young surgeon who attempted to cure it, and continued a running ulcer for a long time. She did not fall into the hydrophobia. Hence Dr Fothergill thinks it probable, that keeping the wounds made by the teeth of mad animals open for a long time, would probably be of service as a preventive; but in some of Dr Wolf's patients these artificial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAINS\">drains</a> appear not to have been attended with success.\n\nOn the 16th of November 1773, Thomas Nourse, a strong healthy boy of 14, was admitted into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEICESTER\">Leicester</a> infirmary; having been that day month bitten by a mad fox-bound. The wound was a large lacerated one on the cheek, and bled very freely on being inflicted. The day after he was bit he went to the sea, where he was dipped with all the severity usually practised under so disagreeable an operation. The Ormskirk medicine was also administered with all due care. It was bought of the person in Leicester who is deputed by the proprietor to sell it for him. A common adhesive plaster was applied to the part after sea-bathing; and in the course of a month, without any further trouble, the wound was healed; excepting a small portion, somewhat more than an inch in length, and in breadth about one-tenth. This yielded no discharge, and was quite in a cicatrizing state. Five days before his admission into the infirmary, he began to complain of a tightness over his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a>, and a pain in his head: in two days the hydrophobia began to appear; and at its commencement he complained of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> heat in his stomach, which was continually ascending to the fauces. The disease was pretty strong when he came to the infirmary. He got a bolus of a scruple of musk with two grains of opium; then a composition of 15 grains of musk, one of turpith mineral, and five grains of opium, was directed to be taken every third hour; an ounce of the stronger mercurial ointment was to be rubbed on the cervical vertebrae and shoulders, and an embrocation of two ounces of laudanum, and half an ounce of acetum saturninum, was directed to be applied to the throat. But by this last he was thrown into convulsions, and the same effect followed though his eyes were first covered with a napkin. The embrocation was therefore changed for a plaster of three drams of powdered camphor, half an ounce of opium, and six drams confectio Damocritis. By these medicines the disease seemed to be somewhat suspended, but the symptoms returned with violence in the evening. His medicine was repeated at seven; and at eight five grains of opium were exhibited without musk or turpith. At nine, another ounce of mercurial ointment was rubbed upon the shoulders, and half an ounce of laudanum with six ounces of mutton-broth was injected into the intestines, but to no purpose. A larger dose of opium was then given, but with as little effect as the former, and he died the same night.\n\nIn the month of September 1774, a farmer, aged 25, was bit by a mad dog, whose teeth made a slight wound in the fore finger of the left hand. He was dipped, as usual, in the sea; and drank the sea-water for some time on the spot, which operated briskly as a purge. He continued well till the 6th of June following, when he first felt a pain in that hand and arm; for which he bathed in a river that evening, supposing that it had been a rheumatic complaint. The next day he was sick; and in the evening was seized with a violent vomiting, which continued all that night and till the middle of the next day, when it was succeeded by the hydrophobia. He was treated with the warm bath; had a purgative elyser injected; and as soon as it had operated, a second was given, consisting of four ounces of oil, and half an ounce of laudanum; half an ounce of strong mercurial ointment was rubbed on the fauces, and the part was afterwards covered with the cataplasmum cynimiv, to which was added an ounce of opium. An embrocation was applied to the region of the stomach with continued friction, consisting of half an ounce of spirit of sal ammoniac, ten drams of olive oil, six drams of oil of amber, and ten drams of laudanum. Two ounces of strong mercurial ointment were rubbed upon the shoulders and back; and as a further means of inducing a ptyalism speedily, he received the smoke of cinnabar into the mouth by throwing a dram of that substance now and then upon a hot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>: he was also directed to take every four hours a bolus of 15 grains of musk, three grains of turpith mineral, and four grains of opium. He was easier while in the warm bath, and during the application of the ointment; but died the same night about two o'clock.\n\nMany other instances might be adduced of the inefficacy of this pretended specific: which will, it is hoped, create a due degree of caution in those to whom they who are so unfortunate as to be bit by a mad animal may commit themselves. Another remedy may also be mentioned as having had the reputation of being sometimes successful in this disease; which is chiefly employed in different parts of India, particularly in the territory of Tanjore. The medicine to which we now allude contains indeed several articles which are altogether unknown in our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MATERIA_MEDICA\">materia medica</a>: but it contains at least one very powerful substance well known to us, viz. arsenic. This medicine, known by the name of the Snake Pills, as being principally employed against the bite of the most venomous snakes, is directed to be prepared in the following manner:\n\nTake white arsenic, of the roots of nelli navi, of nevi visham, of the kernels of the ner valum, of pepper, of quicksilver, each an equal quantity. The quicksilver is to be rubbed with the juice of the wild cotton till the globules are perfectly extinguished. The arsenic being first levigated, the other ingredients, reduced to a powder, are then to be added, and the whole beat together with the juice of the wild cotton to a consistence fit to be divided into pills.\n\nThough these pills are principally used against the bite of the cobra de capello, yet they are said also to be successful in the cure of other venomous bites; and, for the prevention of rabies canina, one is taken every morning for some length of time. Of this remedy European practitioners have, we believe, as yet no experience; and if, in the accounts transmitted by\nby East India practitioners, it cannot be said that we have authentic evidence of its want of success; it can as little be pretended that there is indubitable evidence of its efficacy in any instance; and it is by no means improbable, that it will be found equally inefficacious with others at one time considered as infallible.\n\nOf the great variety of remedies which have had their day of reputation, there is not one which has not possessed the credit, some time or other, of preventing the noxious effects arising from the bite of a mad dog. A more adequate experience has with all of them discovered the deception. It was above observed, that rabies is by no means the infallible consequence of being bit by a mad animal; and that of between 25 and 30 persons who were bit by the dog which gave the fatal wound to one of Dr Vaughan's patients, not one felt the least ill effect but himself. \"In the above number (says the doctor) were some who took the Ormskirk medicine; others went to the salt water; and part of them used no remedy, who yet fared equally well with the most attentive to their injury. The same thing has often happened before; and much merit, I doubt not, has been attributed to the medicine taken, from that celebrated one of Sir George Cobb down to the infallible one which my good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">Lady</a> Bountiful's receipt-book furnishes.\"\n\nFrom all that has been said, the reader will judge how far the hydrophobia is capable of being subdued by any of the medicinal powers which have yet been tried. Some eminent physicians assert that it is totally incurable; and allege that the instances recorded by different authors of its cure have not been the genuine kind, but that which comes on spontaneously, and which is by no means so dangerous. Indeed two of Dr Wolf's patients recovered, where the disease seems to have been perfectly genuine: but in these the poison seemed to vent itself partly on some other place besides the nervous system. In one the blood was evidently infected, as it had an abominable fetor; and the other had a violent pain and swelling in the belly. In all the others, it seemed to have attacked only the nervous system; which perhaps has not the same ability to throw off any offending matter as the vascular system.\n\nThere is, however, a possibility that the prodigious affections of the nerves may arise only from a vitiated state of the gastric juices; for it is well known, that the most terrible convulsions, nay the hydrophobia itself, will arise from an affection of the stomach, without any bite of a mad animal. This seems to be somewhat confirmed from one of Dr Wolf's patients, who, though he vomited more than 50 times, yet still threw up a frothy matter, which was therefore evidently secreted into the stomach, just as a continual vomiting of a bilious matter shows a continual and extraordinary secretion of bile. Dr Wolf himself adopts this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> so far as to say, that perhaps the serum may become frothy; but in blood drawn from a vein not the least fault appears either in the serum or crassamentum. He affirms, however, that the duodenum appears to be one of the parts first and principally affected; and as it is not inflamed, it would seem that the affection it sustains must arise from the vitiated state of its juices.\n\nBe this as it will, however, in the hydrophobia, the stomach seems totally, or in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, to lose Hydrophobia the power which at other times it possesses. Two grains of cuprum ammoniacum were repeatedly given to a child of eight years of age without effect; but this dose would occasion violent vomiting in a strong healthy man. Something or other therefore must have prevented this substance from acting on the nervous coat of the stomach; and this we can only suppose to have been the exceedingly disordered state of the gastric juice, which occasioned such violent irritation through the whole body, that the weaker stimulus of the medicine was entirely lost. It would seem proper therefore to consider the stomach in hydrophobic cases as really containing a poisonous matter, which could not be expelled by vomiting, because it is renewed as fast as evacuated. The indication therefore must be, to change its nature by such medicines as are certainly more powerful than the poison; and this indication will naturally lead us to think of large doses of alkaline salts. These, it is certain, will destroy any animal substance with which they come in contact, and render even the poison of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERPENTS\">serpents</a> inactive. By exhibiting a few doses of them, larger no doubt than what can be safely done on other occasions, we would be certain to change the state of the stomach juices; and this might free the patient from those intolerable spasms which always occasion death in such a short time. Dr Wolf seems inclined to think that volatile alkalies were of service; but the above hypothesis would incline us to use rather the fixed kind. At any rate, it seems vain for physicians to trust much to the power of opium, mercury, musk, or cinnabar, either singly or combined in any possible way. Cinchona has also failed, and the most celebrated specifics have been found ineffectual. Alkalies are the next most powerful remedies which the materia medica affords, and they cannot be more unsuccessful than the others have generally been.\n\nAnother remedy which seems adapted to change the nature of the gastric juices is ardent spirits. In one of Dr Wolf's patients two bottles of brandy seem to have effected a cure. The oil mixed with it was of no efficacy in other cases, and the opium and turpith seem not to have been exhibited till the worst was past. In this case the disease seems to have attacked the vascular as well as the nervous system.\n\nIn all the patients the warm bath seems to have been a palliative, and a very powerful one, and as such it ought never to be omitted, though we can by no means trust to it as a radical cure; and the above histories abundantly show, that though the warm bath and opium may palliate for a short time, the cause on which the spasms depend is still going on and increasing, till at last the symptoms become too strong to be palliated even for a moment by any medicine however powerful. At any rate, the above-mentioned hypothesis suggests a new indication, which, if attended to, may perhaps lead to useful discoveries. In cases where putrescent bile is abundantly secreted, columbo root and vegetable acids are recommended to change the nature of the poison which the body is perpetually producing in itself. Where corrosive mercury has been swallowed, alkaline salt is recommended to destroy the poison which nature cannot expel by vomiting; and why\nwhy should not something be attempted to destroy the poison which the stomach seems to secrete in the hydrophobia, and which nature attempts to expel, though in vain, by violent efforts to vomit?\n\nBut whatever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> may be pursued in the hopes of curing this dreadful malady after any of the symptoms have made their appearance, we ought, in every instance, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> our immediate care to prevention, as being perhaps the only real ground of hope: And the most certain and efficacious way of preventing the ill consequences, is instantly (if it can be done) to cut out the piece that happens to be bitten. Dr James, indeed, says, that he would have little opinion of cutting or cauterizing, if ten minutes were suffered to elapse from the receiving of the bite before the operation was performed. But in an inaugural dissertation lately published at Edinburgh by Dr Parry, the author is of opinion that excision will be of use a considerable time after the bite is received. He adopts this opinion from what happens in the smallpox, where the blood does not seem to receive the infection till some days after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INOCULATION\">inoculation</a> has been performed. A second inflammation, he tells us, then takes place, and the infection is conveyed into the blood. In like manner, when the hydrophobous infection is about to be conveyed into the blood, according to him, the wound, or its cicatrix, begins again to be inflamed; and it is this second inflammation which does all the mischief. Excision, or the cautery, will therefore be effectual any time between the bite and the second inflammation of the wound. Without implicitly trusting to this doctrine, however, or considering it as in any degree ascertained in what manner the poison diffuses itself, by what marks its progress may be known, or how soon the system may be irremediably tainted with its malignity, it is undoubtedly safest not to lose unnecessarily a moment's time in applying the knife. This, or a dilation of the wound if it be small, Dr Vaughan considers as the only prophylactics that can be depended upon. In the latter case, he directs to fill the wound with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a>, and set fire to it; which would produce a laceration of the part, and possibly the action of ignited powder upon the poison may have its use. In all cases, likewise, after these practices have been employed, the wound should be prevented from healing for some length of time.\n\nSp. II. The Spontaneous Hydrophobia.\n\nHydrophobia spontanea, Sauv. sp. 2.\n\nThis disease very much resembles the former, so that it has undoubtedly been often mistaken for it. It has been known to come on from an inflammation of the stomach, where it was cured by repeated and large bloodletting; in hysteria, where it was cured by opium, musk, or other antispasmodics; and in putrid fevers, where it was cured by evacuating the intestinal canal of the putrid matters by repeated clysters. A very good method of distinguishing the two is, that in the spontaneous hydrophobia the patient is much more delirious than in the genuine species. In the instance mentioned in the Medical Essays of this symptom attending the inflammation of the stomach, the patient raved in the most extraordinary manner. Dr Raymond says he remembers a spontaneous hydrophobia attended with madness; and in almost all the cases of hydrophobia which are said to have been cured, the patient was very delirious. Dr Nugent's patient was very frequently delirious, and dreaded dogs as well as water. In the Medical Transactions a case is communicated by W. Wrightson surgeon in Sedgefield, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURHAM\">Durham</a>, of canine madness successfully treated. This madness indeed came on after the bite of a dog said to be mad: but it appeared only four days after the accident happened, and was attended with symptoms very unlike any of those above-mentioned; for he suddenly started up in a fit of delirium, and ran out of the house, and after being brought in, caught hold of the hot bars of the grate which held the fire: Whereas, in the true hydrophobia, the patients dread the fire, light, or anything which makes a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> on the senses. It is probable, therefore, that this was only a spontaneous hydrophobia, especially as it readily yielded to venesection, 30 drops of laudanum, and pills of a grain and a half of opium given every three hours, some boluses of musk and cinnabar, &c., while in some of the former cases as much opium was given to a boy as would have deprived of life the strongest healthy man had he swallowed it; and yet this amazing quantity produced scarcely any effect. This patient also dreaded the sight of a dog.\n\nORDER IV. VESANL\u00c6.\n\nParanoiae, Vog. Class IX.\nDeliria, Sauv. Class VIII. Ord. III. Sag. Class XI.\nOrd. III.\nIdeales, Lin. Class V. Ord.

Battie on Madness.\nParaphrosyne, Lin. 66.\nAlthough these distempers may be considered as distinct genera, yet they are so nearly allied, and so readily change into each other, that it sufficiently justifies the treating all of them together.\n\nThe distinguishing characteristic of madness, according to Dr Battie, is a false perception; and under this general character may be comprehended all kinds of what is called madness, from the most silly stupidity and idiotism to the most furious lunacy. Frequently the different kinds of madness are changed into each other by the casual excitement of some passion: thus, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IDIOT\">idiot</a> may become furiously mad, by being put in a violent passion; though this does not so often happen as the change of melancholy into the raving madness, and vice versa.\n\nIt is a very surprising circumstance, that mad people are not only less liable to be seized with infectious disorders than those who are in perfect health; but even when labouring under other diseases, if the patients chance to be seized with madness, they are sometimes freed from their former complaints. Of this kind Dr Mead relates two very remarkable instances.\n\nOn the other hand, it has been known, that an intermittent fever, supervening upon madness of long standing, has proved a cure for the madness; the senses having returned when the fever terminated. Dr Monro saw two instances of this himself; and mentions it as an observation made also by his predecessor in the care of Bethlehem <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">hospital</a>.\n\nAnother remarkable circumstance is, that immoderate joy, long continued, as effectually disorders the mind as anxiety and grief. For it was observable in the famous South Sea year, when so many immense fortunes were suddenly gained, and as suddenly lost, that more people had their heads turned, from the prodigious flow of unexpected <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a>, than from the entire loss of their whole substance.\n\nMad people, especially of the melancholic kind, sometimes obstinately persevere in doing things which must excite great pain; whence it should seem as if their minds were troubled with some distracting notions, which make them patiently bear the present distress, lest more severe tortures should be inflicted; or possibly they may think, that, by thus tormenting the body, they render themselves more acceptable to the divine Being, and expiate the heinous sins of which they may imagine themselves to have been guilty.\n\nIt is, however, also highly probable that their feelings differ exceedingly from what they are in a natural state; at least they are every day observed to endure, apparently without the smallest uneasiness, watching, hunger, and cold, to an extent which in a state of health would not only be highly distressing, but to the greater part of individuals would even prove fatal. And this resistance of hunger, cold, and sleep, affords perhaps the best test for distinguishing cases of real insanity, from cases where the disease is only feigned, and appearances of it put on, to answer particular purposes; at least where this power of resistance is present, we have good reason to conclude that the affection is not feigned.\n\nCure. Although we be well acquainted with many of the remote causes of this disease, some of the principal of which have already been mentioned, yet we are still so ignorant of the influence of these upon the system, as giving a derangement of the mental faculties, that no general principles on which the cure may be conducted, can with any confidence be pointed out.\n\nIt may, however, be observed, that while some remedies seem to operate by producing an artificial termination of this complaint, many others have effect only as aiding a natural termination. And where a recovery from this disease does take place, it most frequently happens in consequence of a natural convalescence. All the species and degrees of madness which are hereditary, or that grow up with people from their early youth, are out of the power of physic; and so for the most part, are all maniacal cases of more than one year's standing, from whatever source they may arise. Very often mere debility, the dregs of some particular disease, such as an ague, the small-pox, or a nervous fever, shall occasion different degrees of foolishness or madness. In these cases, the cure must not be attempted by evacuations; but, on the contrary, by nourishing diet, clear air, moderate exercise, and the use of wine: whereas, in almost all the other maniacal cases, which arise from different sources, and which come on in consequence of intemperate living, violent passions, or intense thinking, it is generally held, that evacuations of every kind are necessary, unless the constitution of the patient be such as absolutely forbids them.\n\nBlood is most conveniently drawn either from the arm or jugulars; and if the weakness be such as renders it improper to take away much blood, we may apply cupping-glasses to the occiput.\n\nVomiting, in weakly people, must be excited by the vinum ipecacuanhae; but in the more robust by emetic tartar or antimonial wine: the most efficacious cathartics are the infusion or tincture of black-hellebore, or infusion of senna quickened with tincture of jalap; but if there be suppression of the messes, or of an habitual hemorrhoidal discharge, then aloetic purges will be more proper; and in some instances cooling saline purgatives, such as lixiviated tartar, are of great service. In general, mad people require very large doses, both of the emetics and cathartics, before any considerable operation ensues.\n\nDr Monro assures us, that the evacuation by vomiting is infinitely preferable to any other: the prodigious quantity of phlegm with which the patients in this disease abound, he says, is not to be overcome but by repeated emetics; and he observes, that the purges have not their right effect, or do not operate to so good purpose, until the phlegm be broken and attenuated by frequent emetics. He mentions the case of a gentleman who had laboured under a melancholy for three years, from which he was relieved entirely by the use of vomits and a proper regimen. Increasing the discharge by urine, is also of the greatest moment, especially when any degree of fever is present. The cutaneous discharges are also to be promoted; for which purpose the hot bath is of the highest service in maniacal cases. Hoffman asserts, that he has seen numerous instances, both of inveterate melancholy and raging madness, happily cured by means of warm bathing;\nbleeding and nitrous medicines having been premised.\n\nCamphor has also been highly commended; but, if we can believe Dr Locker of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIENNA\">Vienna</a>, not very deservedly. Having found very good effects from a solution of this medicine in vinegar, he took it for granted that all the success was owing to the camphor; therefore, in order to give it a fair trial, he selected seven patients, and gave it in large doses of half a dram twice a-day. This was continued for two months, and the doctor was surprised to find that only one of his patients received any benefit. He then returned the other six back to the camphorated julep made with vinegar, and in a few weeks four of them recovered the use of their reason. This inclined him to think that the virtue depended solely on the vinegar, and accordingly he began to make the trial. Common vinegar was first given; but after a little while he fixed on that which had been distilled, and gave about an ounce and a half of it every day; the patients having been previously prepared by bleeding and purging, which was repeated according as it was found necessary. He gives a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of eight patients who were cured by this method; some in six weeks, others in two months, and none of them took up more than three months in perfecting the cure. He does not indeed give the ages of the patients, nor mention the circumstances of the cases; he only mentions the day on which the use of the vinegar was begun and the day on which they were discharged; and he adds, that they all continued well at the time of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>.\n\nDr Locker informs us, that this medicine acts chiefly as a sudorific; and he observed, that the more the patients sweated, the sooner they were cured: it was also found to promote the menstrual discharge in such as had been obstructed, or had too little of this salutary evacuation.\n\nBoth reason and experience show the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of confining such as are deprived of their senses; and no small share of the management consists in preventing them from hurting either themselves or others. It has sometimes been usual to chain and to beat them; but this is both cruel and absurd; since the contrivance called the strait-waistcoat answers every purpose of restraining without hurting them.\n\nThese waistcoats are made of ticken, or some such strong stuff; are open at the back, and laced on like a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of stays; the sleeves are made tight, and long enough to cover the ends of the fingers, where they are drawn close with a string like a purse mouth, by which contrivance the patient has no power of his fingers; and when laid on his back in bed, and the arms brought across the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEST\">chest</a>, and fastened in that position by tying the sleeve-strings round the waist, he has no use of his hands. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> strap of girth-web is then carried across the breast, and fastened to the bolsterhead, by which means the patient is confined on his back; and if he should be so outrageous as to require further restraint, the legs are secured by ligatures to the foot of the bed; or they may be secured by being both put into one bag not very wide, which may be more easily fixed than the feet themselves, at least without giving pain.\n\nIt is of great use in practice to bear in mind, that all mad people are cowardly, and can be awed even by the menacing look of a very expressive countenance; and when those who have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of them once impress them with the notion of fear, they easily submit to anything that is required. The physician, however, should never deceive them in any thing, but more especially with regard to their distemper: for as they are generally conscious of it themselves, they acquire a kind of reverence for those who know it; and by letting them see that he is thoroughly acquainted with their complaint, he may very often <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> such an ascendant over them that they will readily follow his directions.\n\nIt is a more difficult matter to manage those whose madness is accompanied either with excessive joy or with great dejection and despondency, than those who are agitated with rage: and all that can be done is to endeavour to excite contrary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a>, by repressing the immoderate fits of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAUGHTER\">laughter</a> in the one kind by chiding or threatening (taking care, however, not absolutely to terrify them, which can never be done without danger, and has often added to the misery of the unhappy sufferer); and dispelling the gloomy thoughts in the other, by introducing pleasing concerts of music, or any other species of entertainment, which the patients have been known to delight in while they had the use of their reason. Upon the whole, in the cure of insanity, more is perhaps to be effected by moral than by medical treatment. And this moral treatment should be as gentle as is consistent with safety. Chains, bolts, and severity of every kind are to be avoided as much as possible. But while great benefit is often derived from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> and amusement, so also, on the other hand, solitary confinement is in not a few cases productive of the best effects.\n\nThough blistering the head has generally been directed, Dr Mead says he has oftener found it to do harm than service: but he recommends issues in the back; and advises to keep the head always close shaved, and to wash it from time to time with warm vinegar. Opium has by many been forbidden in maniacal cases, from a supposition that it always increases the disturbance; but there are instances where large doses of this medicine have been found to prove a cure, and perhaps if it were tried oftener we should find powerful effects from it: there certainly cannot much harm ensue from a few doses, which may be immediately disused if they should be found to exasperate the disease.\n\nThe diet of maniacal patients ought to be perfectly light and thin: their meals should be moderate; but they should never be suffered to live too low, especially while they are under a course of physic: they should be obliged to observe great regularity in their hours: even their amusements should be such as are best suited to their disposition. After the disease appears to be subdued, chalybeate waters and the cold bath will be highly proper to strengthen their whole frame, and secure them against a relapse.\n\nGENUS LXVIII. ONEIODYNIA.\n\nUNEASINESS in SLEEP.\n\nSomnium, Vog. 339.\nSomnambulismus, Somn. gen. 221. Lin. 77. Sag. 333.\nHypnobatasis, Vog. 340. Noctambulatio,\nThe greatest uneasiness which people feel in sleep is that commonly called the incubus or night-mare. Those seized with it seem to have a weight on their breasts and about their precordia. Sometimes they imagine they see spectres of various kinds which oppress or threaten them with suffocation. Neither does this uneasiness continue only while they are asleep; for it is some time after they awake before they can turn themselves in their beds or speak; nay, sometimes, though rarely, the distemper has proved mortal.\u2014The incubus rarely seizes people except when the stomach is oppressed with aliment of hard digestion, and the patient lies on his back. It is to be cured by eating light suppers, and raising the head high; or, if it become very troublesome, antispasmodic medicines are to be administered, and the body strengthened by chalybeates. The same method is to be followed by those who are subject to walking in their sleep; a practice which must necessarily be attended with the greatest danger; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOMNAMBULISM\">somnambulism</a> may justly be considered as merely a different modification of this disease. Accordingly Dr. Cullen has distinguished the one by the title of oneirodynia activa, and the other by that of oneirodynia gravis.\n\n**Class III. CACHEXIAE.**\n\nCachexiae, Sauv.

TABES.**\n\nWasting of the Body.\n\nTabes, Sauv. gen. 275. Lin. 209. Vog. 306. Sag. 100.\n\nThis disorder is occasioned by the absorption of pus from some ulcer, external or internal, which produces an hectic fever. The primary indication therefore must be to heal the ulcer, and thus take away the cause of the disease. If the ulcer cannot be healed, the patient will certainly die in an emaciated state. But the proper treatment of the tabes proceeding from this cause, falls to be considered under the head of Ulcer in Surgery, and likewise under the genera Syphilis, Scrofula, Scorbutus, &c., diseases in which ulcers are at least a very common symptom.\n\n**Genus LXX. ATROPHIA.**\n\nNervous Consumption.\n\nDescription. This affection consists principally in a wasting of the body, without any remarkable fever, cough, or difficulty of breathing; but attended with want of appetite and a bad digestion, whence the whole body grows languid, and wastes by degrees.\u2014Atrophia.\n\nDr. Cullen, however, asserts, that some degree of fever, or at least of increased quickness of the pulse, always attends this disease.\n\nCauses. Sometimes this distemper will come on without any evident cause. Sometimes it will arise from passions of the mind; from an abuse of spirituous liquors; from excessive evacuations, especially of the semen, in which case the distemper has got the name of tabes dorsalis. It may arise from mere old age, or from famine.\n\nPrognosis. This distemper, from whatever cause it may arise, is very difficult to cure, and often terminates in a fatal dropsey.\n\nCare. The general principles on which the treatment of this disease is to be regulated, very much depend on the cause by which it is induced; and it is unnecessary to add, that this must be removed as far as possible. Next to this, the disease is most effectually combated by the introduction of nutritious aliment into the system, and by obtaining the proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASSIMILATION\">assimilation</a> and digestion of this. With the first of these intentions, recourse must be had to the diet which is most nutritious, and at the same time of easiest digestion. But from the condition of the stomach commonly attending this disease, it is necessary that small quantities only should be taken at a time, and that it should be frequently repeated. With the second intention, stomachic and nervous medicines are the articles chiefly at least to be depended upon in this case. The Peruvian bark, sulphuric acid, and chalybeates, are excellent; and these should be conjoined with gentle exercise, as far as the strength and other circumstances of the patient will admit. In that species of the distemper occasioned by venereal excesses, it is so essentially necessary to abstain from them, that without it the best remedies will prove altogether useless.\n\n**Order II.

Steatites, Vog. 390.\n\nIn a natural and healthy state, the fat, or animal oil, is not allowed to diffuse itself throughout the cellular interstices at large, but is confined to the places where such an oily fluid is necessary, by a particular apparatus of distinct vesicles. But in some constitutions the oily part of the blood appears to exceed the requisite proportion, and easily separates from the other constituent parts; or there is an uncommon tendency to the separation of oily matter. In these cases it is apt to accumulate in such quantities, that we may suppose it to burst those vesicles which were originally destined to hinder it from spreading too far; or almost every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CELL\">cell</a> of the membrana adiposa, many of which are in ordinary cases altogether empty, may be completely filled and distended with fat.\n\nThe increase of the omentum particularly, and the accumulation...\naccumulation of fat about the kidneys and mesentery, swell the abdomen, and obstruct the motions of the diaphragm; whence one reason of the difficulty of breathing which is peculiar to corpulent people; while the heart, and the large vessels connected with it, are in like manner so encumbered, that neither the systolic nor subsylistic motion can be performed with sufficient freedom, whence weakness and slowness of the pulse: but when the whole habit is in a manner overwhelmed with an oily fluid, the enlargement of the cellular interstices will necessarily interrupt the general distribution and circulation throughout the nervous and vascular systems; impeding the action of the muscular fibres, and producing insensibility, somnolency, and death.\n\nThese cases are the more deplorable, as there is but little prospect of a cure. For the animal oil is of too gross a nature to be easily taken up by absorption; and we know, that when fluids are accumulated in the cellular system, there are only two ways in which they can be carried off or escape; namely, by the absorbents, which take their rise from the cellular interstices, and through the pores of the skin by transudation.\n\nAnother misfortune is, that the disease steals on so imperceptibly, that it becomes inveterate before people begin to think of pursuing the proper means of relief.\n\nIn this disease the cure must turn upon two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>: First, on preventing the farther deposition of fat, by avoiding the introduction of superfluous aliment, particularly of fatty matters, into the system; and, secondly, on promoting and forwarding the absorption of fat. On these grounds, besides what may be done by proper regimen, a variety of articles have been recommended in the way of medicine.\n\nSoap has been proposed as a remedy to melt down and facilitate the absorption of the fat in corpulent people; and Dr Fleming some years ago published a little treatise, wherein he recommends this medicine, and relates the case of a gentleman who is said to have received considerable benefit from it. But perhaps the soap-leys would be more powerful, and might be more easily taken, sheathed in the manner directed when used as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISSOLVENT\">dissolvent</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>.\n\nLieutaud advises to take acetum scillitum in small doses, with frequent purging and brisk exercise. But it will seldom happen that the patients will be found sufficiently steady to persist in any of these courses, it being the nature of the disorder to render them irsolute and inattentive to their condition. Therefore the principal use of rules must be with a view to prevention; and persons who are disposed to corpulency should take care in time to prevent it from becoming an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> disease by using a great deal of exercise, not indulging in sleep, and abridging their meals, especially that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUPPER\">supper</a>. Salted meats are less fattening than such as are fresh; and drinking freely of coffee is recommended to corpulent people.\n\nBut Dr Fothergill observes, that a strict adherence to vegetable diet reduces exuberant fat more certainly than any other means that he knows; and gives two cases in which this regimen succeeded remarkably well. The famous Dr Cheyne brought himself down in this way, from a most unwieldy bulk to a reasonable degree of weight; as he himself informs us. It deserves, however, to be remarked, that every practice for the removal or prevention of fatness must be used with great caution and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a>; for not a few, anxious to prevent this affection, have had recourse to a regimen and to medicine which have proved fatal. This has particularly arisen from the excessive use of acids, probably operating by entirely destroying the action of the chylopoietic viscera.\n\nGENUS LXXII.

Vog. 392.\nLeucophlegmatia, Lin. 214.\n\nThe emphysema sometimes comes on spontaneously; but more frequently is occasioned by wounds of the lungs, which, giving vent to the air, that fluid insinuates itself into the cellular texture, and often blows it up to a surprising degree. It must be observed, however, that it is only in cases of laceration of the lungs where this disease can take place; for in a simple wound, the effusion of blood always prevents the air from getting out. The cure is to be accomplished by scarifications and compresses; but in some cases only by the paracentesis of the thorax. When air introduced from the lungs is collected in a considerable quantity in the cavity of the thorax, the operation of the paracentesis is perhaps the only means of cure. Upon an opening being thus made, the air sometimes rushes out with incredible violence; and the patient receives at least immediate relief from circumstances the most distressing imaginable. In some instances it is followed even by a complete cure.\n\nGENUS LXXIII. TYMPANITES.\n\nTympany.\n\nTympanites, Sauv. gen. 291. Lin. 219. Vog. 316.\nSag. 118. Boerh. 226. Junc. 87.\nAffectio tympanitica, Hoffm. III. 339.\nMeteorismus, Sauv. gen. 292.\n\nThis is an inflation of the abdomen, and is of two kinds: 1. That in which the flatus is contained in the intestines, in which the patient has frequent explosions of wind, with a swelling of the belly commonly unequal. 2. When the flatus is contained in the cavity of the abdomen; in which case the swelling is more equal, and the belly sounds when struck, without any considerable emission of flatus. Of these two, however, the former disease is by much the most common; insomuch, that many, even extensively engaged in practice, have never met with an instance of true abdominal tympanites. In both cases the rest of the body falls away.\n\nCauses, &c. The tympany sometimes takes place in those who have been long troubled with flatulencies in the stomach and intestines. It happens frequently to women after abortion; to both sexes after the suppression of the hemorrhoids; and sometimes from tedious febrile disorders injudiciously treated.\n\nPrognosis. This disease is generally very obstinate, and for the most part proves fatal by degenerating in\nto an ascites. Sometimes, if the patient be healthy and strong, the disease may terminate favourably, and that the more readily if it has followed from some disorder. A hectic consumption, dry cough, and emaciated countenance in a tympany, with a swelling of the feet, denote approaching death in a very short time.\n\nCure. With a view to the prevention of this affection, it is necessary, in the first place, to avoid, as far as it can be done, causes giving rise to an uncommon extrication of air, by preserving the proper tone of the alimentary canal. After the affection has taken place, the indications are, first, to expel the air already extricated and confined in different cavities; and, secondly, to prevent further accumulation. On these grounds different remedies are employed. The cure, however, is principally attempted by carminative, resolvent, and stomachic medicines, gentle laxatives, and at last tonics, especially chalybeates. In the Edinburgh Medical Essays, vol. i. we have a very remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of a tympany by Dr Monro senior. The patient was a young woman of 22 years of age, who fell into the distemper after a tertian ague, in which she was badly treated. She became a patient in the Edinburgh Infirmary the 24th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 1730, took several purgatives, and some doses of calomel; used the warm bath; and had an antihysteric plaster applied over the whole belly, but with very little effect. She was monstrously distended, insomuch that the skin seemed to be in danger of bursting: her breathing was much strained; but the swelling sometimes gradually decreased without any evacuation. The returns and degree of this swelling were very uncertain; and when the belly was most distended, several unequal and protuberant balls could be felt over the whole abdomen, but especially at its sides. Her stomach was good, she had no thirst, and her urine was in proportion to the quantity she drank. She was very costive, had her menses at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> periods, but no edematous swellings appeared in the feet or anywhere else. In this situation she continued from the time of her admission till the 21st of June, during which interval she had only menstruated twice. Throughout the space of time, the following circumstances were observed, 1. Several times, upon the falling of the swelling, she complained of a headache; once of pains throughout all her body, once of a giddiness, twice of a nausea and vomiting, and the last time threw up green bile; and once her stomach swelled greatly, whilst the rest of the abdomen subsided. 2. During the flowing of the menses she did not swell, but became very big upon their stopping. 3. Blood-letting and emetics, which were made use of for some accidental urgent symptoms, had no very sensible effect in making the tympany either better or worse. 4. She never had passage of wind either way, except a little belching some days before the monthly evacuation.\n\nSome time before the last eruption of the menses, the purgatives were given more sparingly; and anti-hysteries of the strongest kinds, such as asafoetida, oleum corn. cerv. &c. mixed with soap, were given in large doses, accompanied with the hotter antiscorbutics as they are called, as horseradish and ginger-root infused in strong-ale with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a>. The patient was ordered to use frequent and strong frictions to all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a> of her body and extremities, and to use moderate exercise. Immediately before the menses began to flow, Physometra of the same kind of medicines were injected. The menses were in sufficient quantity; but as soon as they ceased, her belly increased in its circumference four inches and a half, but soon subsided. She then complained of pains, which a gentle sweat carried off. Borborygmus were for the first time observed on the same day, June 25th; and having taken some tinctura sacra at night, she passed a small quantity of blood next day by stool. This was the first appearance of the return of the hemorrhoids, to which she had been formerly subject.\n\nThe two following days her saponaceous, antihysteric, and antiscorbutic medicines being still continued, she had such explosions of wind upwards and downwards, that none of the other patients would remain in the same room, nay scarce on the same floor with her. Her belly became less and softer than it had been from the first attack of the disease; her medicines, with a dose of syrup of buckthorn at proper intervals, still were continued, only the proportion of steel was increased; her flatus discharge went on successfully, and she gradually recovered her former health.\n\nGENUS LXXIV.

It is however, upon the whole, a very rare disease; and when it takes place, very seldom if ever admits of a cure.\n\nGENUS LXXV.

Millman Animadversiones de hydropoe 1779.\nPhlegmatia, Sauv. gen. 282.\nAngina aquosa, Boerh. 791.\n\nIn this disease the feet first begin to swell, especially in the evening, after exercise, and when the patient has stood or sat long; this swelling rises frequently to the thighs. By lying in bed, the swelling becomes less, or even almost disappears. In the progress of the disease, the swelling often rises to the hips, loins, and belly, and at last covers the whole body. This disease, besides the other symptoms afterwards mentioned under ASCITES, is attended with a remarkable difficulty of breathing. In the cure of this, as well as other species of dropsy, the general intentions are, first, the evacuation of the water already effused either by natural or artificial outlets; and, secondly, the prevention of fresh accumulation, which is chiefly to be expected from supporting a due action of the absorbents, and from keeping up a proper discharge by the serous excretories.\n\nThe remedies employed with these intentions are much the same with what are employed against the more\nmore important genus of ascites. Only it may be here noticed, that in anaesarea it has by many been recommended to scarify the feet and legs. By this means the water is often discharged; but the operator must be cautious not to make the incisions too deep; they ought barely to penetrate through the skin; and special care must be taken, by spirituous fomentations and proper digestives, to prevent a gangrene. Dr Fothergill observes, that the safest and most efficacious way of making these drains is by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> used for cupping, called a scarificator; and he always orders it to be so applied as to make the little wounds transversely; as they not only discharge better, but are also longer in healing, than when made longitudinally.\n\nNotwithstanding every precaution, however, gangrene will often ensue; and it is upon the whole a much safer practice to evacuate the water by the natural outlets, the valvular lymphatic absorbents; and with this intention emetics and cathartics, but particularly diuretics, are often employed with success.\n\nGENUS LXXVI. HYDROCEPHALUS.\n\nWater in the Head.\n\nExternal or Chronic Hydrocephalus.\n\nHydrocephalus, Sauv. gen. 285. Lin. 216. Boerh. 1217.\n\nHydrocephalus, Vog. 384.\n\nThis differs from the hydrocephalus formerly treated of at some length under the title of Appoplexia Hydrocephalica, chiefly in the water being collected in the external parts of the head, whereas the former is entirely within the skull. In the fifth volume of the Medical Observations we have an account of a very extraordinary case of this kind. The patient was a child only of a few days old, and had a tumor on his head about the size of a common tea-cup, which had the appearance of a bladder distended with water; near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APEX\">apex</a> was a small opening, through which a bloody serum was discharged. In other respects the child was healthy. No application was used but a piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> dipt in brandy. The tumor continued to increase for many months; at the end of which time the membrane containing the water appeared equally thick with the other part of the scalp, except at one place about the size of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHILLING\">shilling</a>, which continued thin, and at times appeared as if it would burst. He remained in this situation for about 17 months, when the circumference of the head was 20 inches, the base 16\u00bd, the middle 18\u00bd, and from the base to the apex near 8\u00bd. The water was then drawn off, and the child died in two days. Almost all other cases of this distemper have proved fatal; the sutures of the skull generally give way, and the whole external part of the head is equally enlarged; but in the instance just now given there was a deficiency of part of the bones. Although, however, in some instances where the head is thus enlarged to an enormous size, the water is exterior to the brain, and therefore entitled to the appellation of hydrocephalus exterior, yet much more frequently in those instances where there is a manifest separation of the bones of the cranium at the sutures, the water is still contained within the ventricles; and accordingly the disease may be much more properly distinguished into the acute and chronic hydrocephalus, than as is commonly done into the internal and external. Although the latter be much slower in its progress, sometimes subsisting even for years, yet it is equally difficult of cure with the former, and very often it proves fatal in a few days if the water be drawn off by an artificial opening, which may be very easily performed by a mere puncture with a common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANCET\">lancet</a>, without either pain or any immediate hazard from the operation itself, although the water be lodged in the ventricles; for these are distended to an enormous size, and the substance of the brain almost totally destroyed, so that hardly anything is to be punctured but membrane.\n\nGENUS LXXVII.

HYDROTHORAX.\n\nDropsy of the Breast.\n\nHydrothorax, Sauv. gen. 150. Vog. 311. Boerh. 1219.\n\nThis affection, particularly with respect to its causes, is in many circumstances similar to other kinds of dropsy, particularly to ascites. But from the situation of the water, which is here deposited in the cavity of the thorax, it may naturally be supposed that some peculiar symptoms will occur. Besides the common symptoms of dropsy, paleness of the countenance, scarcity of urine, and the like, this disease is, in some instances, attended with a fluctuation of water within the breast; which, when it does occur, may be considered as a certain distinguishing mark of this affection. But besides this, it is also distinguished by the remarkable affections of circulation and respiration with which it is attended.\n\nThe breathing is peculiarly difficult, especially in a recumbent posture; and in many instances patients cannot breathe with tolerable ease, unless when sitting erect, or even stooping somewhat forwards. The pulse is very irregular, and has often remarkable intermissions. But the disease has been thought to be principally characterized by a sudden starting from sleep, in consequence of an almost inexpressible uneasy sensation referred to the breast, and attended with strong palpitation, which may probably arise from an affection either of circulation or of respiration.\n\nThat these symptoms are common attendants of this disease, is undeniable; and they are certainly the best characteristics of this affection with which we are yet acquainted: but it must be allowed that they are present in some cases where there is no water in the breast;\nand that in other instances where the disease exists, they are either altogether wanting, or occur only to a very slight degree. Certain diagnostics, therefore, of this disease still remain to be discovered.\n\nWhen hydrothorax is present, from the affection of the vital functions with which it is attended, it may readily be concluded that it is a dangerous disease, and in many instances it proves fatal. The cure, as far as it can be accomplished, is obtained very much on the same principles as in other dropsies. Here, however, probably from the uncertainty of the diagnostics, the artificial abstraction of water, by paracentesis of the thorax, is less frequently had recourse to than in ascites; though in some instances, after other means have failed, it has been said not only to give relief of symptoms highly urgent, particularly dyspnea, but even to produce a complete cure. Benefit is often obtained from an artificial discharge of water by the application of blisters to the breast: but in this, as well as other dropsies, a discharge is chiefly effected by the natural outlets, particularly from the use of cathartics and diuretics. In this species of dropsy, more perhaps than in any other, recourse has been had to the use of the digitalis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PURPUREA\">purpurea</a>, or foxglove, so strongly recommended as a diuretic by Dr Withering in his treatise respecting the use of it. There can be no doubt that this article, though sometimes productive of inconvenience from the distressing sickness and severe vomiting which it not unfrequently excites, though used even but in small doses, often operates as a powerful diuretic, and produces a complete evacuation of water, after other articles have failed. From the effects mentioned above, however, as well as from its influence on the pulse, which it renders much slower, it is necessary that it should be employed with great caution, and in small doses. A dram of the dried leaves of the digitalis, macerated for four hours in half a pint of warm water, forms an infusion which may be given in doses of an ounce, and the dried powder of the leaves in doses of one or two grains: these doses may be gradually increased, and repeated twice or oftener in the day; but this requires to be done with great caution, lest severe vomiting, or other distressing symptoms, should take place.\n\nGENUS LXXIX.

Vog. 305.\nSag. gen. 135. Boerh. 1285. Hoffm. iii. 311.\nJunck. 86.\n\nOf this genus also Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CULLEN\">Cullen</a> thinks there is but one idiopathic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>: viz. what some distinguish by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of chlorosis virginea, others of chlorosis amatoria.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">Description</a>. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> usually attacks girls a little after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of puberty, and first shows itself by symptoms of dyspepsia. But a distinguishing symptom is, that the appetite is entirely vitiated, and the patient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> eat lime, chalk, ashes, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>, &c. very greedily; while at the same time there is not only a total inappetence to proper food, but it will even excite nausea and vomiting. In the beginning of the disease, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-URINE\">urine</a> is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a>, and afterwards turbid; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a> becomes pale, and then assumes a greenish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>; sometimes it becomes livid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a>; the eyes are sunk, and have a livid circle round them; the lips lose their fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> colour; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULSE\">pulse</a> is quick, weak, and low, though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> is little short of a fever, but the veins are scarcely filled; the feet are frequently <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, swell at night, and the whole body seems covered with a soft swelling; the breathing is difficult; nor is the mind free from affection more than the body; it becomes irritated by the slightest causes; and sometimes the patients <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> solitude, become sad and thoughtful. There is a retention of the menses throughout the whole course of the disorder; and at last all the bad symptoms increasing, a leucophlegmasia, anasarca, atrophy, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> succeed.\n\nCauses. The cause of chlorosis is thought to be an atony of the muscular fibres of the alimentary canal, especially of the stomach, joined with a similar atony of the perspiratory vessels over the whole surface of the body, and the whole depending on an atony of those small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ARTERIES\">arteries</a> which pour out the menstrual blood. This atony may be occasioned by the same causes which bring on dyspepsia and hypochondriasis, but very frequently arises from love and other passions of the mind.\n\nPrognosis. The chlorosis in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> is tedious, though it does not generally prove fatal; but we can never <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> a certain cure unless the menses make their appearance.\n\nCure. The remedies here in general are the same as in the dyspepsia and hypochondriasis; only in the chlorosis stronger purgatives may be made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of; those which stimulate the rectum are useful by stimulating\nlating also the vessels of the uterus; and for this reason <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a> in venery has sometimes been said to produce a cure, particularly with love-sick maids.

In both, the vital actions are very imperfectly performed, most of those which are called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> being as it were suspended at once; and so far is the patient from being able to execute any voluntary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, that the whole machine undergoes the most excruciating distortions, from the violent and unnatural contractions of the muscles. Happy it is for the inhabitants of the more temperate climates, that such diseases appear rarely among them; but in those countries which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> in the more southern and warmer latitudes, they are endemic, especially to negro slaves. In South Carolina, they show themselves at all seasons, but not so often in winter, more frequently in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> and autumn; and are most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, when people <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> abroad and are alternately exposed to the scorching heat of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> and heavy showers, which often happen suddenly, and greatly alter the temperature of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>. Others are seized with the opisthotonos after sleeping without doors, that they may enjoy the deceitful refreshment of the cool night-air, when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> is warm: one youth chose to cut off his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> and shave his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> on a warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a>, and went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a> without a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>, but the weather changed, and became cold in the night, and he was found rigid with tetanus next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>.\n\n\"These diseases so rarely appear as originals in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, that a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of them cannot be expected from the physicians who practise in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the world; nor has any thing like a full description been given of them by any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> author which I have seen. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HIPPOCRATES\">Hippocrates</a> indeed takes notice of them in many places, and seems to regard them only as consequences of other diseases, or of wounds or ulcers of the nervous or tendinous parts; of which symptomatic kind of opisthotonos he gives three remarkable cases in lib. v. \u00a7 vii. de Morb. eulg. and repeats them in another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>: but the few symptoms he recounts do not show themselves with us. Galen, Celsus Aurelius, Aretaeus, &c. seem only to have copied Hippocrates, with the addition of some supposititious symptoms, which really do not appear; and the little that Bontius says of it is very faulty.\n\n\"Among the numerous class of spasmodic diseases, there are three which distinguish themselves in a very particular manner, on which the names of emprosthotonos, opisthotonos, and tetanus, have been justly enough bestowed, as being expressive of the posture into which they throw and confine the patient. When therefore those muscles which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEND\">bend</a> the head, neck, and body forwards, suffer such involuntary, violent, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> contractions, as to fix the chin to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>, incurvate the spine and body, and retain the sick in this painful and prone posture, the disease is called emprosthotonos. When the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POSTERIOR\">posterior</a> muscles are similarly affected, so that the head is drawn towards the spine, and the spine itself is recurvated, it has then the name of opisthotonos; although in fact, in this, all those muscles which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> in deglutition, bend the head forwards, or turn it to either side, are equally contracted with those which raise the head and spine. The tetanus differs from, or rather is compounded of, both the others; for in this the patient is found rigid and inflexible, being as it were braced between the opposite contractions of the anterior and posterior muscles; yet even here the head is much retracted.\n\n\"I never <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> the emprosthotonos; and shall only speak of the opisthotonos and tetanus, the first being by far the most common, and in the last stage of which the tetanus frequently intervenes. Let it be observed, that the following description by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> means respects such symptomatic contractions as often happen immediately before death, both in acute and chronic diseases; neither will it agree with that spurious opisthotonos or tetanus which appear sometimes in the first and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> stages of quotidian intermittents in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, however they may emulate the true diseases in some of their symptoms.\n\n\"Stab. I. The opisthotonos, contrary to what Bontius asserts, often comes on gradually and by slight approaches, the patient complaining rather of an uneasy stiffness in the back part of the neck and about the shoulders, than of any acute pain, with some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of a general lassitude. These increase, and become so troublesome when he attempts to turn his head, or to bend it forward, as to oblige him to walk very erect; for he can by no means look downward, nor to either side, without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> his whole body. He cannot open his jaws without pain; and has some difficulty in swallowing, which discourages him from attempting to eat. At times he feels a sudden and painful traction under the cartilago ensiformis, which strikes through to the back, and instantly increases the rigidity about the neck and shoulders, draws the head backward a little, and shuts the jaws closer. The pain under the sternum returns more frequently and with greater violence;\nand the other contractions become so strong, that the head from this time continues much retracted, and he now refuses nourishment, as swallowing is attended with great pain, and occasions a return of the spasm; which extends along the spine quite to the lower extremities, so that they will no longer support him, and he is under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of going to bed.\n\nIn this manner passes over the first stage of the episthotonos, which sometimes takes up three or four days; the patient, as well as those about him, mistaking the first appearances of it for that rheumatic complaint, which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> called a crick in the neck; but it sometimes forms itself much quicker, and invades the unfortunate person with the whole train of its mischievous symptoms in a few hours: in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, the danger may truly be estimated from the violence of the first attack; for such generally die in 24, 36, or 48 hours, and very rarely survive the third day. But when it is less acute, few are lost after the ninth or eleventh: which number of days it would not be possible for them to complete, unless the violence of the disease was in a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> subdued; although I had one who recovered, after having been subject to its tyrannical attacks daily for six weeks. In this stage the pulse is slow, and very hard, and the belly is bound; blood taken away seems not to be altered from the natural state, so that no indication can be deduced therefrom, and it only varies with regard to laxity or compaction, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of the person and season of the year.\n\nSTAD. II. The spasm under the sternum (which is the pathognomonic symptom of this disease) becomes more violent, returning every 10 or 15 minutes; and never fails to be instantly succeeded by a stronger retraction of the head, with great rigidity and pain all round the neck, and along the spine to the lower extremities, which are suddenly put to the stretch. The countenance is very pale and contracted; the jaws are that moment snapped together, and cannot afterwards be opened so wide as to receive the end of one's little finger; an attempt to do which, by way of experiment, almost constantly hurries on the spasm. The mastoid, coraco-hyoid and sterno-hyoid muscles, as well as all the others concerned in deglutition, and the deltoid and pectorals, are most violently contracted, so that the shoulders are strongly raised forward, and the arms are stretched out or drawn across the body; but the wrists and fingers seem not to be affected.\n\nSuch is the condition of the patient in the time of the spasm, which ceases in a few seconds: after which the shoulders and arms recline, and the inferior extremities relax; yet not so entirely, but that such a degree of rigidity for the most part remains as will not permit them to bend when this is attempted by another person; for as to the sick himself, he cannot at all move them. The muscles on the sides and forepart of the neck continue still contracted, although not so strongly; but their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> is overcome by the number and strength of the posterior ones; so that the retraction of the head constantly remains. The patient breathes quick for some minutes, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he had been excessively exercised; and the pulse is small, fluttering, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a>, but both become more calm and slow. The face is sometimes pale in the intervals, but oftener flushed; and the whole countenance expresses strong appearances of the most melancholy distress, as well because of the dread he has of a return of the spasm, which he is sure will soon happen, as from the pain he suffers by the present contractions, and the more general and severe ones which he has so lately sustained. The tongue is stiff and torpid; but so far as it can be seen, is not foul. The belly is always bound, and cannot easily be loosened. In drinking, the liquid passes with great difficulty to the stomach, even in the smallest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a>; and if the spasm should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> him at that time, which an attempt to swallow for the most part occasions, the liquor returns through the nose with some force. The patients desire to lie still as much as possible; and avoid drinking, speaking, or being moved, either of which are apt to occasion a return of the spasm.\n\nSTAD. III. In this last stage, the patient is reduced to the most calamitous and distressful circumstances: for he is on a continual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACK\">rack</a>, according to the most literal meaning of that word; the spasm returning oftener than once in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a>, is much more violent, and holds him longer, so that he has scarcely any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REMISSION\">remission</a>. The anterior muscles of the whole body now suffer equal contractions with the posterior; but the last overcome the force of the others, so that the spine is strongly recurvated, and forms a hollow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> with the bed, and he rests on the back part of the head and the heels. The belly is flat, and is drawn inward; and the muscles are so rigidly contracted, that they will not give way to pressure, and do not seem in the least to yield to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> of the diaphragm in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSPIRATION\">inspiration</a>; the several muscles about the neck, sides, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ABDOMEN\">abdomen</a>, being plainly distinguishable from each other. Although the lower extremities are always rigid in this state, yet are they so suddenly and violently distended in the time of the spasms, that were it not for the standers by, the patient would be projected feet foremost off the bed; while others again are as it were pushed upwards with such a spring, that the head is struck with great force against whatever happens to be in the way, the thighs and legs being in this case no less rigid than the other parts. The tongue is spasmodically darted out, and is often miserably torn, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a> are that moment snapped together; so that it is necessary to prevent this by keeping the handle of a spoon, wrapped round with soft rags, between the teeth, when this can be done. At the time that the tongue is thus thrust out, the muscular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>, which lies between the arch of the lower jaw and head of the trachea, seems to be drawn upwards within the throat. The countenance is very much contracted, and he is in a foam of sweat, the heat being very great; and the pulse between the spasms is exceedingly quick, small, and irregular, although the heart throbs so strongly, that its motions may be plainly seen, and a palpitating subsultory kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNDULATION\">undulation</a> may not only be felt, but perceived all over the epigastric region. The eyes are watery and languid, and a pale or bloody <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FROTH\">froth</a> bubbles out from between the lips. The jaws are for the most part locked fast, so that it is impossible to give drink or nourishment, nor could be swallow any thing that was put into his mouth. In this state patients are commonly delirious: and as they cannot subsist many hours under so great a suspension of the vital and natural functions, a mortal anxiety ensues and releases...\nreleases them; oftener a continued and severe spasm finishes the tragedy, when it was before almost at an end; but most frequently a general convulsion puts a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> to their sufferings; and whichever way this happens, they for the most part relax <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> before death.\n\n\"In the tetanus, the general symptoms are nearly the same as in the opisthotonus, except that from the first attack, the lateral, abdominal, and other anterior muscles, are equally contracted with the posterior ones; and the arms become rigid as well as the lower extremities. The abdomen is always flat and rigid as in the last stage of the opisthotonus, and its contents seem to be thrust up into the thorax, which at the same time appears to be much dilated. There are here also some intervals between the spasms, in the time of which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEEKS\">cheeks</a> are drawn towards the ears, so that all the teeth may be seen as in the spasmodus cynicus. Deglutition is more free in this than in the other disease; yet so far is the sick from being equally balanced between the contractions of the opposite muscles, that the head is retracted and the spine is recurvated, although not quite so much as in the opisthotonus. And the spasm, which commences under the sternum, is likewise common to the tetanus, which terminates as the other, and on the same fatal days. But whoever recovers from either, labours <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> under a general atonia; and they cannot for some months raise themselves from a supine or recumbent posture without pain, nor without help for some time.\"\n\nPrognosis and Cure. There has never been any thing like a crisis observed in these frightful cases; or favourable termination from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> efforts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>; and therefore all the physician's dependence must be upon art. As in cases of tetanic affections, the disease often arises from some particular irritation, the removal of this must necessarily be an important <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> in the cure: But where it cannot be removed, benefit may often be obtained by the prevention of its influence being communicated to the brain. When, however, that influence is communicated to the brain, a cure is to be expected only by diminishing and obviating it. This is principally brought about by the use either of those means which have a general tendency to diminish action, or of those which induce a different state of action. On these grounds the operation of those remedies which are employed with greatest success in this affection, may, we apprehend, be explained. Fortunately it has been found, that opium is capable of giving some relief, if administered in proper time, and if the disease happens not to be in the most violent degree: the warm bath must also be brought in aid; and the patients should lie horizontally in the bath, and while in it have the whole body extremely well rubbed: when taken out, they are not to be dried, but immediately be put to bed wrapped in the softest blankets; and while they remain there, the belly ought either to be stumped, or two or three bladders filled with warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> kept constantly lying on it. The bowels at the same time must, if possible, be kept open, by solutions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANNA\">manna</a> and sal polycherest, or some other purging salt, mixed with oleum ricini; or if that should not be at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> of sweet almonds and a little tincture of senna. The opiates are to be given in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> and frequently repeated doses; such as a grain of the extractum thebaicum, or 20 drops of the tincture, every second or third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>; and it will be safest not to trust to the thebaic tincture which is kept ready prepared in the shops, but to order the necessary dose of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> opium, and either give it in pills or dissolve it in some convenient liquid. If swallowing should be difficult, or the jaws closed up, the opium must be given in clysters; for during the whole course of the disease it will be of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> to order emollient clysters to be injected from time to time, since these will answer not only as a relaxing fomentation, but also contribute to keep the intestinal canal perfectly free.\n\nWhen the patients recover, they continue for a long time very relaxed and weak; and no wonder, since it is the nature of all spasmodic affections to leave behind them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> weakness and relaxation of the muscular fibres. In order to perfect the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a>, a course of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CINCHONA\">cinchona</a> and the Peruvian balsam is to be tried; and the spine may be rubbed with spirituous liniments, or with a mixture of rum and Barbadoes tar: but those and all other stimulating things, either internally or externally, during the violence of the spasms, must, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of some practitioners, be omitted, since all of them as well as blisters have been alleged to exasperate the disease.\n\nThis, in general, is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of treatment recommended by Dr Chalmers.\n\nThe same dreadful disorders frequently attack young children in the warm climates. Dr Hillary tells us, that they will there arise from the same causes which usually produce convulsions with children in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, viz. from a retention of the meconium or first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCREMENT\">excrement</a> after birth; or from a glutinous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> which is too often found in the intestines of young children soon after the other is discharged; or from a cheesy matter from the coagulation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILK\">milk</a> by an acid in the stomach; or from hard excrements; or from something taken in by the mouth which is over acid, or too hard to digest, which irritates their tender bowels, and so produces startings and convulsive spasms, with all the other symptoms which precede and accompany convulsions in young children in Britain. And this shows how much more readily and easily the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NERVES\">nerves</a> are affected and irritated in that warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, and the tetanus produced from a much less cause there, than it is in Britain, where it is but seldom seen. But these causes not being timely removed, their acrimony is increased, partly by the heat of the climate, and partly by the fever which they produce, which still renders them more acid, and so increases the irritation of their bowels, that it first brings on startings, then convulsive spasms, and regular convulsion fits; which, if not soon removed, usually end in a perfect tetanus, and the disease is but seldom cured in such young children when it arrives at that state: for when the child lies in this miserable, rigid, immovable condition, upon moving its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> or feet in the most gentle manner, or softly touching any part of its body, or giving it the least motion, even feeling its pulse in the most tender manner, or the least noise, or even touching its clothes, will bring on the convulsive spasms, and cause it to be strongly convulsed backwards or drawn into a rigid straight line, strongly extended and immovable like a statue, and will so remain immovable out of either of those postures for a considerable time, a minute or two; and when the disease is arrived at this degree, Dr Hillary thinks\nthinks it is never cured. But if the physician be called in time, before the tetanus has come on (which is too seldom the case there), though he finds strong convulsive spasms have seized the child, or that it has had a convulsive fit or two, it may most commonly be relieved, the coming of the tetanus be prevented, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> of the babe saved, as Dr Hillary has more than once seen, by removing and carrying off the irritating cause which stimulates their tender bowels, by such gentle evacuations as are suitable to their age; and then quieting and composing the irritation of their nerves by proper anodynes, and correcting the remaining acrimony of the nutritious juices in the prima via.\n\nTo answer these intentions, the following method, with variations pro re nata et pro ratione statatis, as the cause is different, has been found to answer the desired effect the best: R. Seri lactis 3ij. Sapon. Venet. 3ij. Manna Calab. 3ij. vel 3ij. Ol. amygd. dul. 3ss. Ol. feniculi dul. gut. ij. Bals. Peruvi. gut. v. Misc. Fi enema quam primum injiciendum.\n\nAnd if the symptoms of the approaching tetanus will permit, he gives something of the following nature to assist the operation of the clyster, and to carry off the acrimony the sooner: R. Ag. sem. feniculi 3ijj. Magnes. albae 3ss. Ocul. caner. prep. 3j. Syr. e echior. cum rheo. Rosar. solan. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANA\">ana</a> 3ijj. Misc. Or, R. Ag. sem. feniculi 3ijj. Sapon. amygdal. 3ss. Magnes. albae 3ss. Syr. e echior. cum rheo. Manna opt. ana 3ijj. Ol. amygd. dul. 3ijj. Misc.: Exhibe cochl. parvo vel duo pro ratione statatis, omni semihora, vel omnem hora, donec respond. alves.\n\nTwo or three stools being obtained by these, the following is exhibited in order to abate the convulsive twitchings, and prevent the tetanus from coming on: R. Ag. sem. feniculi 3ijj. Magnes. albae 3ss. Ocul. caner. prep. 3j. Moschit orient. gr. liij. Spir. C. C. gutt. xv. Syr. e mecon. 3ss. Misc.: Exhibe cochl. parvo (a child's spoonful) ter quaterve de die, vel septius, urgent. convuls. vel spasm.\n\nBut if the symptoms show that the tetanus is more immediately coming on, so that we have no time to wait till the operation of the clyster and opening laxative be over, something of the following nature must be immediately given; or the tetanus will come on, and most probably prove fatal to such tender babes. R. Ag. feniculi 3ijj. Moschit orient. gr. j. Tinct. thebaica gut. iiiij. Syr. e mecon. 3ijj. Misc. pro duabus dos. de quibus exhibe unam quam primum, et alteram si convul. spasmi. reducant.\n\nThis, Dr Hillary observes, may be thought a bold attempt, to give tinct. thebaica to such a tender young infant: but it is to be considered that the little patient will certainly die if the tetanus seize it, and that it will come on if this do not prevent it: and he has known a bold ignorant old midwife give four or five drops of that tincture to a very young infant without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> more than its dosing three or four hours, though not in this case, but in one much less violent.\n\nThe clyster may be given at the same time, and the opening laxative not long after it; though it may retard the operation of that for some time, yet it operates soon after, and gives relief; after which the other medicines, and fomenting the body and anointing it as before, may be used, if the physician finds it necessary; also a little of the laxative mixture may be given once or twice a-day, if the above julep does not answer the intention of keeping the child's body open for a few days afterwards, which in this case is generally found necessary to be observed.\n\nThese methods and medicines may be varied according to circumstances. For neither the same method nor the same medicines will answer in all cases, though the disease be the same; but they must be changed as the causes differ, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of the sick, or the time of the disease, or as some other circumstances may require: which is a thing of great importance, not only in this, but in the cure of most other diseases.\n\nWhen proper medicines are thus timely and judiciously given in this case, they seldom fail to carry off the irritating cause, quiet and ease the nerves, remove the convulsions and spasms: and consequently prevent the tetanus from coming on, and the death of the patient. But if calling in the physician be deferred till the tetanus has already strongly seized the child, as is too often the case here, neither warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATHING\">bathing</a>, fomenting, nor any other methods or medicines whatever, will remove it or its causes, nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> the life of the little tender patient.\n\nDr Chalmers gives an account of his having cured one child seized with a tetanus, by purging with an infusion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-RHUBARB\">rhubarb</a>: to which a few grains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MUSK\">musk</a>, and a little ol. tartar. per deliq. were added, together with the warm bath, and the frequent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INJECTION\">injection</a> of clysters made with an infusion of chamomile <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a>, to each of which was added a small portion of Castile <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOAP\">soap</a>. It is much to be regretted, however, that in those cases where the assistance of the medical art is most wanted, it most generally fails. We have been assured by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> who practised for some time in the warm parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>, that out of 30 cases of the tetanus he had seen, not one of the patients recovered, though he had given opium to the quantity of 20 grains thrice a-day; and others, he was assured, had taken 30 grains thrice a-day. In the beginning of the disease, the medicine produced a violent headache; but towards the end, it had no manner of effect whatever. In two patients, the disease came on from the slightest causes imaginable. The one accidentally fell in attempting to avoid a loaded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CART\">cart</a>, and put the heel of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHOE\">shoe</a> upon one of his thumbs in rising; the other, in avoiding the same cart, slightly ruffled the skin of his nose. Both were seized with the tetanus; and both died, notwithstanding all possible assistance was given. The former had his thumb amputated without effect.\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> Physical and Literary Essays vol. iii. Dr Donald Monro describes a new method of cure, communicated to him by a gentleman who was formerly a practitioner in Jamaica. While this gentleman practised in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>, he had under his care a great number of cases of tetanus attended with the locked jaw. At first, he used to give very freely of opium, musk, and other medicines of this class; to bleed, and make other evacuations; while he used <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATHS\">baths</a>, fomentations, embrocations, and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> applications, but all without the least success; and, as he had lost a great many patients without being so lucky as to make one cure, he began to believe that this disorder always proved fatal, and was not to be cured by medicine, notwithstanding what some practitioners\ntitioners had alleged. However, having received an unexpected hint concerning the good effects of the mercurial ointment in such cases, he resolved to try it; and ordered the first patient that offered to be put into a warm room, and to be rubbed two or three times a day with the ointment, till such time as a salivation was raised; when he with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> observed, that, as soon as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a> began to affect the mouth, the convulsions of the muscles of the jaws, as well as all the other spasms and convulsions, ceased, and the patient was freed of all his complaints. After this, he treated every case of this kind, which came under his care in the same manner, and cured twelve, which were all who applied to him for advice so early in the disorder that there was time to bring the mercury to the mouth before the fatal period was expected. A few died, in whom the disease was so far advanced before he saw them that there was no time to raise a salivation. None of the cases which were under this gentleman's care in the West Indies were the consequences of wounds or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> operations; nor has he had any opportunity of trying it since in cases of the locked jaw, which sometimes follows capital operations, owing to his having given over practice: but he thinks, that from the similarity of the complaint, there is no doubt that the mercurial frictions would be equally efficacious in such cases, as when the disorder comes from catching cold or other such causes.\n\nIn the second volume of the Medical Transactions, we have an account of a cure performed by Dr William Carter of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CANTERBURY\">Canterbury</a>, by means very different from any of those above related.\u2014On the 17th of May 1767, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a> was called to a strong healthy man, in the 21st year of his age, and who had been confined to his bed for three weeks. What gave rise to his present disorder was an wound on the inner ankle of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> leg, which he had received six weeks before from a joiner's chisel. At that time his mouth was so far closed, as to admit only the most liquid nourishment, which he constantly sucked through his teeth: but his legs and jaw, and the whole length of the spina dorsi, were quite immoveable, being as stiff and rigid as those of a person long dead; his head was drawn backward, and he was frequently strongly convulsed. The motion indeed of both his arms was but little impaired. From the beginning to the end, his sight, hearing, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>, continued perfect; his appetite was good; and his senses, in the daytime, entire, though sometimes wandering in the night. As to his pulse, it was regular; if it deviated at all from the pulse of a person in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, it was rather slow than quick, and somewhat fuller than natural. Such was the situation of the patient; a detail of which had been given before the doctor set out on his journey, which he undertook with a determined <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> to make use of the method recommended by Dr Silvester, in the first volume of Medical Observations and Inquiries, published in the year 1737, (and which has been related from Dr Chalmers and Dr Hillary.) But, on his arrival at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, he found great quantities of the extractum thebaicum dissolved had been already given him; and that, for the five last days, he had taken no less than 28 grains of that medicine, with 50 grains of musk, in the space of 24 hours, without any sensible effect, except the bringing on a confused <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a>, out of which he frequently awoke in great hurries, attended with a violent pain in the head, which almost deprived him of his senses. The doctor was afraid to extend the dose; and soon determined to take some other method, though at a loss what method to pursue, as, during a course of almost 30 years practice, nothing of the same kind had ever fallen under his cognizance before. Reflecting, however, that this disorder had always been deemed of the spasmodic kind, and that the good effects produced by the extractum thebaicum must probably be owing to the relaxing and resolving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> of that medicine, he directed a blister to be applied between the shoulders, the whole length of the spine; the jaw to be anointed with the oleum lateritium; and a purge consisting of the tinctura sacra, tinctura jalapae, and the syrupus de rhanno cathartico, to be given him. This was repeated three several times afterwards, at the distance of three or four days between each dose. On the intermediate days, he was ordered the oleum succini, the fetid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUM\">gum</a>, and the oleum amygdalatum. Of the first he took 30 drops, of the gum 20 grains, and of the last four ounces, in 24 hours. By these means, and these only, the convulsions soon ceased; and he grew daily better and better, till at the end of a fortnight he was able to walk about his room, and in less than three weeks became in all respects well, some small weakness in the parts only excepted. The jaw was relieved first, after that the spine, and last of all the legs. A pain and uneasiness in the places affected, neither of which he had felt before, were the forerunners of his approaching amendment.\n\nFrom all this it seems reasonable to conclude, either that there is no certain remedy for tetanus in all cases, or that the medicines which prove effectual in one constitution will fail in another. Thus, it is possible, that in cases where opium proves ineffectual, mercury may be a remedy; and, on the contrary, where mercury fails, opium may be effectual; and even where both are ineffectual, the antispasmodics recommended by Dr Carter may be of use. It is therefore necessary for physicians to be extremely careful to observe the effects of the first doses of their remedies: for if the symptoms show not the least appearance of remission after a large dose of opium, it is improbable that it can be cured by a repetition of the medicine; and as no time can be lost with safety, it will then be proper to apply mercurial ointment, or whatever else may be judged proper.\u2014In the Edinburgh Medical Commentaries we have an account of the cold bath being used as a remedy, by Dr Thomas Cochrane, at that time physician at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEVIS\">Nevis</a>. The patient was an East <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> boy, who had been gored by a cow, and afterwards exposed to a rainy damp air for some hours. Dr Cochrane ascribes his cure to the cold bath, which was applied by dashing the water upon his body. But as the patient at the same time got laudanum, at first in the quantity of 200 drops a-day, and afterwards in still larger doses; and had besides his throat and shoulders anointed with warm oil of turpentine, was bled, and had lenient clysters and laxatives; it is by no means easy to say what share the cold bath had in his cure. Dr Cochrane, however, says he has heard of some cases being treated successfully by cold water and cinchona.\ncinchona in St Eustatia and St Kitt's, and in another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> mentions his having used the cold bath in other cases of tetanus with success. But since Dr Cochrane's publication, a more full and satisfactory account of the benefit of this practice has been communicated in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> published by Dr Wright, in the sixth volume of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> Medical Observations. Dr Wright gives a particular account of six cases, in which the best effects were obtained from dashing cold water upon the patient; and he observes, that since he first used this method of cure he never failed in one instance to effect a recovery, and that in a shorter time than by any other method hitherto proposed. This practice has on some occasions been adopted by practitioners in Britain, although here the disease is a much less frequent occurrence. It has particularly been employed with success by Dr Currie of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIVERPOOL\">Liverpool</a>; and we hope that still more extensive practice will confirm the benefit to be derived from it, although not in every instance, yet in many cases of this affection. We are, however, sorry to say that we have of late heard of several cases in which it has been tried in Britain, and which, notwithstanding the use of it, had a fatal termination.\n\nVery lately a different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of cure in this affection has been recommended by Dr Rush, professor of medicine in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILADELPHIA\">Philadelphia</a>, in a paper entitled Observations on the Cause and Cure of Tetanus, published in the second volume of the Transactions of the American Philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a>. Dr Rush, viewing tetanus as being a disease occasioned by relaxation, thinks the medicines indicated to cure it are such only as are calculated to remove this relaxation, and to restore tone to the system. On this ground he recommends the liberal use of wine and cinchona; and tells us, that he has employed them with success in actual practice. When the disease arises from an wound of any particular place, he recommends stimulants to the part affected; such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DILATATION\">dilatation</a> of the wound, and filling it with the oil of turpentine. How far this practice will be confirmed by more extensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, we cannot take upon us to determine. We may only observe, that a very contrary practice has been recommended as highly successful by some practitioners in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, where tetanic affections are a very frequent occurrence in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of slight accidents. There gentle emollients are strongly recommended, particularly immersing the wounded part in tepid oil for the space of an hour or so at a time, and repeating this application at short intervals. By this mode many cases, after very alarming appearances had taken place, are said to have been completely and speedily removed. While the practice is very simple, it appears at the same time in many respects very rational, and may perhaps be considered as well deserving a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> in the first instance.\n\nAmong other remedies employed in tetanus it has been said that the spasms have sometimes been allayed by a strong electric shock. And in obstinate cases <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTRICITY\">electricity</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GALVANISM\">galvanism</a> certainly well deserve a trial.\n\nGENUS XLIX.

When convulsions attack only particular parts of the body, they are generally attended with some kind of paralysis at the same time, by which means the affected parts are alternately convulsed and relaxed; a permanent convulsion, or unnatural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a> of particular muscles, is called a spasm or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CRAMP\">cramp</a>. These partial convulsions may attack almost any part of the body; and are not unfrequently symptomatic, in fevers, the cholera morbus, &c. The involuntary startings of the tendons, the picking of the bedclothes, &c. in acute diseases are all of them convulsive disorders. Convulsions, even when most generally extended, differ from epilepsy in not being attended with any mental affection or abolition of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, and not followed by the same torpid state.\n\nCauses. Convulsions, not only of particular parts, but also over the whole body, often take place from causes not very evident. Sometimes they seem to de-\npend on a certain delicacy or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRRITABILITY\">irritability</a> of the nervous system, which is framed with such exquisite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a> as to be strongly affected by the slightest causes. Delicate women are often subject to hysterical convulsions, and also hypochondriac people. Convulsions, however, often take their rise from wounds, irritations of the stomach and intestines by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORMS\">worms</a>, poisons, violent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHARTICS\">cathartics</a> and emetics, &c.; and very often they are symptomatic, as in dentition, the smallpox, and many kinds of fevers.\n\nPrognosis. Except in some few cases, convulsive disorders are always to be dreaded; but less in young people than in such as are advanced in life. Those which attack girls under the age of puberty, will generally cease on the appearance of the menses; and boys have likewise a chance of being relieved as they advance in life: but in grown-up people, unless the cause be very evident, a cure is hardly to be expected, especially after the disease has been of long continuance.\n\nCure. The treatment is very much the same with that of epilepsy, afterwards to be considered: but a recovery is most frequently obtained by the removal of the existing cause.\n\nGENUS LI. CHOREA.\n\nSt Vitus's Dance.\n\nScelotybe, Sauv. gen. 136. Sag. 243.\nChorea, Lin. 139.\nScelotybe chorea Viti, Sauv. sp. 1.\nChorea St Viti, Sydenh. Sched. Monit.\n\nDescription. This disease shows itself first by a kind of lameness or instability of one of the legs, which the patients draw after them in a ridiculous manner: nor can they hold the arm of the same side still for a moment; for if they lay it on their breast, or any other part of their body, it is immediately forced away by a convulsive motion. If they be desirous of drinking, they use a number of odd gesticulations before they can bring the cup to their mouths, because their arms are drawn this way and that by the convulsions which affect them.\n\nCauses, &c. The general cause of St Vitus's dance is a debility of the system; and hence we find it attacks only weakly boys, and more especially girls, when under the age of puberty. But the particular causes determining the muscles to be affected in such and such a manner are entirely unknown.\n\nPrognosis. As this disorder scarce ever attacks any persons but such as are under the age of puberty, there is almost a certain prospect of its being then cured, though generally the disorder is easily removed before that time.\n\nChorea, however, in some instances, proves an obstinate affection; but is hardly in any instance attended with danger.\n\nCure. It has hitherto been almost universally the common practice to treat this disease with antispasmodics and tonics, particularly opium, hyoscyamus, valerian, cinchona, preparations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZINC\">zinc</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>, and cold bathing; and under the use of these the disease has, in general, been removed. But Dr James <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAMILTON\">Hamilton</a>, senior physician to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> Infirmary of Edinburgh, in a treatise which he has lately published on the use of purgative medicines, has recommended a very different practice in this disease, the use, viz. of brisk cathartics: these he advises to be repeated daily for some time. The great object, however, which he has in view, is not to evacuate from the system, but to produce a thorough and complete evacuation of the intestinal canal. He finds, that by the first doses, large quantities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>-coloured matter are discharged; and he recommends that the use of the purgatives should be persisted in till the stools assume a natural appearance. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> of the utility of this practice, he has related several cases in which it produced a speedy and complete cure; and equal success has attended this practice when directed by several others. There can therefore be no hesitation in recommending it at least in every obstinate instance of chorea.\n\nGENUS LII. RAPHANIA.\n\nRaphania, Lin. 155. Vog. 143. Lin. Amoen.

According to Sauvages, this distemper begins with a lassitude of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a>, transient colds and shiverings, pain of the head, and anxieties of the precordia. Then come on spasmodic startings of the fingers and feet; also of the tendons and muscles, conspicuous below the skin. The disease is attended with heat, fever, delirium, stupor, constriction of the breast, suffocating dyspnoea, loss of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a>, horrid convulsions of the limbs, preceded by a formication, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a> as of ants or other small insects creeping on the parts. In this state of the disease, the convulsive paroxysms are attended with most violent pains in the limbs, vomiting, or diarrhoea, with the passing of worms, thirst, and in young people an unnatural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUNGER\">hunger</a>. It continues from ten days to three months. About the eleventh or twentieth day, some are relieved by copious sweats, or purple exanthemata: while others <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> into a tabes, with stupor, or stiffness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a>.\n\nCauses, &c. This disease is frequently epidemic in Suabia and other parts of Germany; where it is said to be produced by seeds of radishes, which are often mixed with rye in that country; and from this supposed cause the disease takes its name. It is also, however, a very common opinion, that this disease depends on the rye used in diet being of a bad <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, and particularly containing a large proportion of what is called spurred rye.\n\nCure. In this affection, the cure, as far as it has yet been discovered, is very much the same with that of epilepsy; the disease next to be considered. But from what has been said of the advantages derived from the use of purgatives in chorea, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> us to make a trial of them also in cases of raphania.\nGENUS LIII.

The catarrh is an increased excretion of mucus from the mucous membrane of the nose, fauces and bronchiae, attended with pyrexia.\n\nPractical writers and nosologists have distinguished the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> by different appellations, according as it happens to affect different parts of the mucous membrane, one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> less than the other: but Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CULLEN\">Cullen</a> is of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> that the disease in those different parts is always of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, and proceeds from the same cause in the one as in the other. Very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> indeed, those different parts are affected at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>; and therefore there is little room for the distinction mentioned. The disease has been frequently treated of under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of tussis or cough; and a cough, indeed, always attends the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> form of catarrh, that is, the increased excretion from the bronchiae; but as it is so often also a symptom of many other affections, which are very different from one another, it is improperly used as a generic title.\n\nThe disease generally begins with some difficulty of breathing through the nose, and with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of some fulness stopping up that passage. This again is often attended with some dull pain and a sense of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> in the forehead, as well as a stiffness in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of the eyes. These feelings, sometimes at their very first beginning, and always soon after, are attended with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTILLATION\">distillation</a> of a thin fluid from the nose, and sometimes from the eyes; and these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a> are often found to be somewhat acid, both by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> and by their fretting the parts over which they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a>. These symptoms constitute the coryza and gravedo of authors, and are commonly attended with a sense of lassitude over the whole body. Sometimes cold shiverings are felt; at least the body is more sensible than usual to the coldness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>; and with all this the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULSE\">pulse</a> is more frequent than ordinary, especially in the evenings.\n\nThese symptoms have seldom <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> before they are accompanied with some hoarseness, and a sense of roughness and soreness in the trachea, with some difficulty of breathing, expressed by a sense of straitness in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEST\">chest</a>, and with a cough which seems to arise from some irritation felt at the glottis. This cough is generally at first dry and painful, occasioning pains about the chest, and more especially in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>; sometimes, together with these symptoms, pains resembling those of the rheumatism are felt in several parts of the body, particularly about the neck and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>. With all these symptoms, the appetite is impaired, some thirst arises, and a feverish lassitude is felt all over the body. These symptoms mark the height and violence of the disease; but commonly it does not continue long. By degrees the cough comes to be attended with a more copious excretion of catarrh mucus; which is at first thin, but gradually becoming thicker, is brought up with less frequent and less laborious coughing. The hoarseness and soreness of the trachea are also relieved or removed; and the febrile symptoms abating, the expectoration becomes again less considerable, and the cough less frequent, till at length they cease altogether.\n\nSuch is generally the course of this disease, neither tedious nor dangerous; but it is sometimes in both respects otherwise. The body subjected to catarrh seems to be more than usually liable to be affected by cold air; and upon exposure of the body to fresh cold, the disease, which seemed to be yielding, is often brought back with greater violence than before, and is rendered not only more tedious than otherwise it would be, but also more dangerous by the supervening of other diseases. Some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of the cynanche tonsillaris often accompanies the catarrh; and when this is aggravated by a fresh application of cold, the cynanche also becomes more violent and dangerous from the cough which is present at the same time. When a catarrh has been occasioned by a violent cause, when it has been aggravated by improper management, and especially when it has been rendered more violent by fresh and repeated applications of cold, it often passes into a pneumonic inflammation, attended with the utmost danger.\n\nUnless, however, such accidents as these happen, a catarrh, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> persons not far advanced in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, is always a slight and safe disease; but in persons of a phthisical disposition, a catarrh may readily produce a haemoptysis, or perhaps form <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TUBERCLES\">tubercles</a>, in the lungs; and still more readily in persons who have tubercles already formed in the lungs, an accidental catarrh may occasion the inflammation of these tubercles, and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> produce a phthisis pulmonalis.\n\nIn elderly persons, a catarrh sometimes proves a dangerous disease. Many persons, as they advance in life, and especially after they have arrived at old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, have the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> mucus of the lungs poured out in greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a>, and requiring a frequent expectoration. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a>, therefore, a catarrh happen to such persons, and increase the influx of fluids to the lungs, with some degree of inflammation, it may produce the peripneumonia notha, or more properly chronic catarrh, a disease continuing often for many years, or at least returning regularly every winter; which in such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> is very often fatal.\n\nCauses, &c. The proximate cause of catarrh seems to be an increased influx of fluids to the mucous membrane of the nose, fauces, and bronchiae, along with some degree of inflammation affecting the same. The latter circumstance is confirmed by this, that, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of catarrh, the blood drawn from a vein commonly exhibits the same inflammatory crust which appears in the case of phlegmasiae. The remote cause of catarrh is most commonly cold applied to the body. This application of cold producing catarrh is generally evident; and Dr Cullen is of opinion that it would always be so, were men acquainted with and attentive to the circumstances which determine cold to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> upon the body.\n\nThe application of cold which occasions a catarrh probably operates by stopping the discharge usually made\ngoing off they are renewed by any fresh application of catarrhus cold.\n\n**Prognosis.** Considering the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of persons who are affected with catarrh, of either the one species or the other, and escape from it quickly without any hurt, it may be allowed to be a disease commonly free from danger; but it is not always to be treated as such; for in some persons it is accompanied with pneumonic inflammation. In the phthisically disposed, it often accelerates the coming on of phthisis; and in elderly persons it often proves fatal in the manner we have explained above, viz. by degenerating into its chronic state. But though chronic catarrh be often the termination of that species which arises from cold, we have not, in any case, observed it to arise as a consequence of a catarrh from contagion. This species of catarrh, however, is not unfrequently followed by phthisis; or rather, where a phthisical tendency before existed, the affection has been begun and its progress accelerated from this cause.\n\n**Cure.** The cure of catarrh is nearly the same, whether it proceeds from cold or contagion; only in the latter case remedies are commonly more necessary than in the former. In the cases of a moderate disease, it is commonly sufficient to avoid cold, or to abstain from animal food for some days. In some cases, where the febrile symptoms are considerable, it is proper for that length of time to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a>, and, by taking frequently some mild and diluted drink, a little warmed, to promote a very gentle sweat; and after this to take care to return very gradually only to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of the free air. When the disease is more violent, not only the antiphlogistic regimen, exactly observed, but various remedies also, become necessary. To take off the phlogistic diathesis which always attends this disease, blood-letting, more or less, according as the symptoms shall require, is the proper remedy. After blood-letting, for restoring the determination of the fluids to the surface of the body, and at the same time for expediting the secretion of mucus in the lungs, which may take off the inflammation of its membrane, vomiting is the most effectual means. For the last-mentioned purpose, it has been supposed that squills, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUM\">gum</a>-ammoniac, the volatile alkali, and some other medicines, might be useful; but their efficacy has never been found considerable: and if squills have ever been very useful, it seems to have been rather by their emetic than by their expectorant powers. When the inflammatory affections of the lungs seem to be considerable, it is proper, besides blood-letting, to apply blisters to the back or sides.\n\nAs a cough is often the most troublesome circumstance of this disease, so demulcents may be employed to alleviate it. But after the inflammatory symptoms are much abated, if the cough still remains, opiates afford the most effectual means of relieving it; and, in the circumstances <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> now mentioned, they may be very safely employed. Very considerable advantage is often derived from employing opiates in such a manner as to act more immediately on the head of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>-pipe. For this purpose, opium may often be advantageously conjoined with demulcents, melting slowly in the mouth. And perhaps <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> form is more convenient, or answers the purpose better, than the *trochisci glycyrrhizae cum opio* of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> Pharmacopoeia.","sp":409,"ep":411},{"h":"HYPOCHONDRIAC AFFECTION","t":"Hypochondriasis, Sauv. gen. 220.

It is evident from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, that the part b of the tooth ab of the wheel, does not act on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a> m of the pinion till they arrive at the line of centres AB; and that all the action is carried on after they have passed this line, and is completed when the leaf m comes into the situation n. When this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of action is adopted, the acting faces...\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICS\">Mechanics</a>.\n\n398. But when one circle rolls within another whose diameter is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> that of the rolling circle, the line generated by any point of the latter is a straight line, tending to the centre of the larger circle. Therefore, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the generating circle above mentioned should be taken with its diameter equal to the radius of the pinion, and be made to roll upon the concave superficies \\(a'd'h\\) of the pinion, it will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATE\">generate</a> a straight line tending to the pinion's centre, which will be the form of the faces of its leaves; and the teeth of the wheel will be exterior epicycloids, formed by a generating circle, whose diameter is equal to the radius of the pinion, rolling upon the convex superficies \\(o'd'p\\) of the wheel. This rectilinear form of the teeth is exhibited in fig. 2, and is perhaps the most advantageous, as it requires less trouble, and may be executed with greater accuracy, than if the epicycloidal form had been employed, though the teeth are evidently weaker than those in fig. 1; it is recommended both by De la Hire and Camus as particularly advantageous in clock and watch-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>.\n\n399. The attentive reader will perceive from fig. 1, that in order to prevent the teeth of the wheel from acting upon the leaves of the pinion before they reach the line of centres \\(AB\\); and that one tooth of the wheel may not quit the leaf of the pinion till the succeeding tooth begins to act upon the succeeding leaf, there must be a certain proportion between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of leaves in the pinion and the number of teeth in the wheel, or between the radius of the pinion and the radius of the wheel, when the distance of the leaves \\(AB\\) is given. But in machinery the number of leaves and teeth is always known from the velocity which is required at the working point of the machine: It becomes a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> therefore of great importance to determine with accuracy the relative radii of the wheel and pinion.\n\n400. For this purpose, let \\(A\\), fig. 2, be the pinion having the acting faces of its leaves straight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> tending to the centre, and \\(B\\) the centre of the wheel. \\(AB\\) will be the distance of their centres. Then as the tooth \\(C\\) is supposed not to act upon the leaf \\(Am\\) till it arrives at the line \\(AB\\), it ought not to quit \\(Am\\) till the following tooth \\(F\\) has reached the line \\(AB\\). But since the tooth always acts in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of a line drawn perpendicular to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of the leaf \\(Am\\) from the point of contact, the line \\(CH\\), drawn at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> to the face of the leaf \\(Am\\), will determine the extremity of the tooth \\(CD\\), or the last part of it which should act upon the leaf \\(Am\\), and will also mark out \\(CD\\) for the depth of the tooth. Now, in order to find \\(AH\\), \\(HB\\), and \\(CD\\), put \\(a\\) for the number of teeth in the wheel, \\(b\\) for the number of leaves in the pinion, \\(c\\) for the distance of the pivots \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), and let \\(x\\) be the radius of the wheel, and \\(y\\) that of the pinion. Then, since the circumference of the wheel is to the circumference of the pinion, as the number of teeth in the one to the number of leaves in the other, and as the circumferences of circles are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to their radii, we shall have \\(a : b = c : y\\), then by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> (Eucl. v. 18.) \\(a + b : b = c : y\\) (c being equal to \\(x + y\\)), and consequently the radius of the pinion, viz. \\(y = \\frac{c}{a + b}\\); then by inverting the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a>, we have \\(b : a = y : x\\), and consequently the radius of the wheel, viz. \\(x = \\frac{<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AY\">ay</a>}{b}\\); \\(y\\) being now a known number.\n\nNow, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a> \\(AHC\\), right-angled at \\(C\\), the side \\(AH\\) is known, and likewise all the angles (\\(HAC\\) being equal to \\(\\frac{360}{b}\\)); the side \\(AC\\), therefore, may be found by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIGONOMETRY\">trigonometry</a>. Then, in the triangle \\(ACB\\), the \\(\\<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> CAB\\), equal to \\(HAC\\), is known, and also the sides \\(AB\\), \\(AC\\), which contain it; the third side, therefore, viz. \\(CB\\), may be determined; from which \\(DB\\), equal to \\(HB\\), already found, being subtracted, there will remain \\(CD\\) for the depth of the teeth. When the action is carried on after the line of centres, it often happens that the teeth will not work in the hollows of the leaves. In order to prevent this, the \\(\\angle CBH\\) must always be greater than half the \\(\\angle HBP\\). The \\(\\angle HBP\\) is equal to \\(360\\) degrees, divided by the number of teeth in the wheel, and \\(CBH\\) is easily found by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> trigonometry.\n\n401. If the teeth of wheels and the leaves of pinions be formed according to the directions already given, they will act upon each other, not only with uniform force, but nearly without friction. The one tooth rolls upon the other, and neither slides nor rubs to such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> as to retard the wheels, or wear their teeth. But as it is impossible in practice to give that perfect curvature to the faces of the teeth which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> requires, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of friction will remain after every precaution has been taken in the formation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> parts.\n\n402. 2. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> mode of action is not so advantageous as that which we have been considering, and should, if possible, always be avoided. It is represented in fig. 3, where \\(A\\) is the centre of the pinion, \\(B\\) that of the wheel, and \\(AB\\) the line of centres. It is evident from the figure, that the tooth \\(C\\) of the wheel acts upon the leaf \\(D\\) of the pinion before they arrive at the line \\(BA\\); that it quits the leaf when they reach this line, and have assumed the position of \\(E\\) and \\(F\\); and that the tooth \\(C\\) works deeper and deeper between the leaves of the pinion, the nearer it comes to the line of centres. From this last circumstance a considerable quantity of friction arises, because the tooth \\(C\\) does not, as before, roll upon the leaf \\(D\\), but slides upon it; and from the same cause the pinion soon becomes foul, as the dust which lies upon the acting faces of the leaves is pushed into the interjacent hollows. One advantage, however, attends this mode of action: It allows us to make the teeth of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> wheel rectilineal, and thus renders the labour of the mechanic less, and the accuracy of his work greater, than if they had been of a curvilineal form. If the teeth \\(C, E\\), therefore of the wheel \\(BC\\) are made rectilineal, having their surfaces directed to the wheel's centre, the acting faces of the leaves \\(D, F, &c.\\) must be epicycloids formed by a generating circle, whose diameter is equal to the radius \\(Bo\\) of the circle \\(o.p\\), rolling upon the circumference \\(m.n\\) of the pinion \\(A\\). But if the teeth of the wheel and the leaves of the pinion are made curvilineal as in the figure, the faces of the teeth of the wheel must be portions of an interior epicycloid formed by any gene...\nNow, in the triangle APB, AB is known, and also PB, which is the cosine of the angle ABD; PC being perpendicular to DB; AP or the radius of the pinion therefore may be found by plane trigonometry. The reader will observe that the point P marks out the parts of the tooth D and the leaf SP where they commence their action; and the point I marks out the parts where their mutual action ceases (E); AP therefore is the proper radius of the pinion, and BI the proper radius of the wheel, the parts of the tooth L without the point I, and of the leaf SP without the point P, being superfluous. Now, to find BI, we have ES : CS = m : n, and CS = \\(\\frac{ES \\times n}{m}\\); but ES was shewn to be \\(\\frac{360}{b}\\), therefore, by substitution, CS = \\(\\frac{360 \\times n}{b \\times m}\\). Now the arch ES, or \\(EAS\\), being equal to \\(\\frac{360}{b}\\), and CS, or \\(CAS\\), being equal to \\(\\frac{360 \\times n}{b \\times m}\\), their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> EC, or the angle EAC, will be equal to \\(\\frac{360}{b} - \\frac{360 \\times n}{b \\times m}\\), or \\(\\frac{360 \\times n}{b \\times m}\\). The \\(EAC\\) being thus found, the triangle EAB, or IAB, which is almost equal to it, is known, because AB is given, and likewise AI, which is equal to the cosine of the angle IAB, AC being radius, and AIC being a right angle, consequently IB the radius of the wheel may be found by trigonometry. It was formerly shewn that \\(AC\\), the radius of what is called the primitive pinion, was equal to \\(\\frac{c \\times b}{a + b}\\), and that BC the radius of the primitive wheel was equal to \\(\\frac{AC \\times a}{b}\\). If then we subtract AC or AS from AP, we shall have the quantity SP which must be added to the radius of the primitive pinion, and if we take the difference of BC (or BL) and DE, the quantity LE will be found, which must be added to the radius of the primitive wheel. We have all along supposed that the wheel drives the pinion, and have given the proper form of the teeth upon this supposition. But when the pinion drives the wheel, the form which was given to the teeth of the wheel in the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, must in this be given to the leaves of the pinion; and the shape which was formerly given to the leaves of the pinion must now be transferred to the teeth of the wheel.\n\n405. Another form for the teeth of wheels, different from any which we have mentioned, has been recommended by Dr Robison. He shews that a perfect uniformity of action may be secured, by making the acting faces of the teeth involutes of the wheel's circumference, which are nothing more than epicycloids, the centres of whose generating circles are infinitely distant. Thus, in fig. 1, let AB be a portion of the wheel on which\n\n(E) The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> L marks the intersection of the line BL with the arch em, and the letter E the intersection of the arch BO with the upper surface of the leaf m. The letters D and S correspond with L and E respectively, and P with I.\nMechanics.\n\nPractical which the tooth is to be fixed, and let A p a be a thread lapped round its circumference, having a loop hole at its extremity a. In this loop hole fix the pin a, and with it describe the curve or involute a b c d e f, by unlapping the thread gradually from the circumference A p m. This curve will be the proper shape for the teeth of a wheel whose diameter is A B. Dr Robison observes, that as this form admits of several teeth to be acting at the same time (twice the number that can be admitted in M. de la Hire's method), the pressure is divided among several teeth, and the quantity upon any one of them is so diminished, that these dents and impressions which they unavoidably make upon each other are partly prevented. He candidly allows, however, that the teeth thus formed are not completely free from sliding and friction, though this slide is only \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\)th of an inch, when a tooth three inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> fixed on a wheel ten feet in diameter drives another wheel whose diameter is two feet. Append. to Ferguson's Lectures.\n\n406. On the Formation of Exterior and Interior Epicycloids, and on the Disposition of the Teeth on the Wheel's Circumference.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICAL\">Mechanical</a> Nothing can be of greater importance to the practical mechanic, than to have a method of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> epicycloids with facility and accuracy; the following, we trust, is the most simple mechanical method that can be employed.\u2014Take a piece of plain wood G H, fig. 6, and fix upon it another piece of wood E, having its circumference m b of the same curvature as the circular base upon which the generating circle A B is to roll. When the generating circle is large, the segment B will be sufficient: in any part of the circumference of this segment, fix a sharp pointed nail a, sloping in such a manner that the distance of its point from the centre of the circle may be exactly equal to its radius; and fasten to the board G H a piece of thin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>, or tinplate, a b, distinguished by the dotted lines. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">Place</a> the segment B in such a position that the point of the nail a may be upon the point b, and roll the segment towards G, so that the nail a may rise gradually, and the point of contact between the two circular segments may advance towards m; the curve a b described upon the brass plate will be an accurate exterior epicycloid. In order to prevent the segments from sliding, their peripheries should be rubbed with resin or chalk, or a number of small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> may be fixed on the circumference of the generating segment. Remove, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FILE\">file</a>, the part of the brass on the left <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> of the epicycloid, and the remaining concave arch or gage a b will be a pattern tooth, by means of which all the rest may be easily formed. When an interior epicycloid is wanted, the concave side of its circular base must be used. The method of describing it is represented in fig. 7, where C D is the generating circle, F the concave circular base, M N the piece of wood on which this base is fixed, and c d the interior epicycloid formed upon the plate of brass, by rolling the generating circle C, or the generating segment D, towards the right hand. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CYCLOID\">cycloid</a>, which is useful in forming the teeth of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACK\">rack</a>-work, is generated precisely in the same manner, with this difference only, that the base on which the generating circle rolls must be a straight line.\n\nIn order that the teeth may not embarrass one another before their action commences, and that one tooth may begin to act upon its corresponding leaf of the pinion, before the preceding tooth has ceased to act upon the preceding leaf, the height, breadth, and distance of the teeth must be properly proportioned. For this purpose the pitch-line or circumference of the wheel, which is represented in fig. 2. and 3. by the dotted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a>, must be divided into as many equal spaces as the number of teeth which the wheel is to carry. Divide each of these spaces into 16 equal parts; allow 7 of these for the greatest breadth of the teeth, and 9 for the distance between each; or the distance of the teeth may be made equal to their breadth. If the wheel drive a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUNDLE\">trundle</a>, each space should be divided into 7 equal parts, and 3 of these allotted for the thickness of the tooth, and 3\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) for the diameter of the cylindrical stave of the trundle. If each of the spaces already mentioned, or if the distance between the centres of each tooth, be divided into three equal parts, the height of the teeth must be equal to two of these. These distances and heights, however, vary according to the mode of action which is employed. The teeth should be rounded off at the extremities, and the radius of the wheel made a little larger than that which is deduced from the rules in Art. 400, 404. But when the pinion drives the wheel, a small addition should be made to the radius of the pinion.\n\nOn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">Nature</a> of Bevelled Wheels, and the method of giving an epicycloidal form to their Teeth.\n\n407. The principle of bevelled wheels was pointed out by De la Hire, so long ago as the end of the 17th century. It consists in one fluted or toothed cone acting upon another, as is represented in fig. 8, where the cone O D Fig. 8. drives the cone O C, conveying its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> in the direction O C. If these cones be cut <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to their bases at A and B, and if the two small cones between A B and O be removed, the remaining parts A C and B D may be considered as two bevelled wheels, and B D will act upon A C in the very same manner, and with the same effect, that the whole cone O D acted upon the whole cone O C. If the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> be made nearer the bases of the cones, the same effect will be produced: this is the case in fig. 9, where C D and D E Fig. 9. are but very small portions of the imaginary cones A C D and A D E.\n\n408. In order to convey motion in any given direction, and determine the relative size and situation of the wheels for this purpose, let A B, fig. 10, be the axis of a wheel, and C D the given direction in which it is required to convey the motion by means of a wheel fixed upon the axis A B, and acting upon another wheel fixed on the axis C D, and let us suppose that the axis Fig. 10. C D must have four times the velocity of A B, or must perform four revolutions while A B performs one. Then the number of teeth in the wheel fixed upon A B must be four times greater than the number of teeth in the wheel fixed upon C D, and their radii must have the same proportion. Draw c d parallel to C D at any convenient distance, and draw a b parallel to A B at four times that distance, then the lines i m and i n drawn perpendicular to A B and C D respectively, will mark the situation and size of the wheels required.\nMechanics.\n\nThe formation of the teeth of bevelled wheels is more difficult than one would at first imagine. The teeth of such wheels, indeed, must be formed by the same rules which have been given for other wheels; but since different parts of the same tooth are at different distances from the axis, these parts must have the curvature of their acting surfaces proportioned to that distance. Thus, in fig. 12, the part of the tooth at \\( r \\) must be more incurvated than the part at \\( i \\), as is evident from the inspection of fig. 9; and the epicycloid for the part \\( i \\) must be formed by means of circles whose diameters are \\( i m \\) and \\( F f \\); while the epicycloid for the part \\( r \\) must be generated by circles whose diameters are \\( C n \\) and \\( D d \\).\n\nLet us suppose a plane to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> through the points \\( O, A, D \\); the lines \\( AB, AO \\), will evidently be in this plane, which may be called the plane of centres. Now, when the teeth of the wheel \\( DE \\), which is supposed to drive \\( CD \\) the smallest of the two, commence their action on the teeth of \\( CD \\), when they arrive at the plane of centres, and continue their action after they have passed this plane, the curve given to the teeth of \\( CD \\) at \\( C \\), should be a portion of an interior epicycloid formed by any generating circle rolling on the concave superficies of a circle whose diameter is twice \\( C n \\) perpendicular to \\( CA \\), and the curvature of the teeth at \\( i \\) should be part of a similar epicycloid, formed upon a circle, whose diameter is twice \\( i m \\). The curvature of the teeth of the wheel \\( DE \\) at \\( D \\), should be part of an exterior epicycloid formed by the same generating circle rolling upon the concave circumference of a circle whose diameter is twice \\( D d \\) perpendicular to \\( DA \\); and the epicycloid for the teeth at \\( F \\) is formed in the same way, only instead of twice \\( D d \\), the diameter of the circle must be twice \\( F f \\). When any other mode of action is adopted, the teeth are to be formed in the same manner that we have pointed out for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> wheels, with this difference only, that different epicycloids are necessary for the parts \\( F \\) and \\( D \\). It may be sufficient, however, to find the form of the teeth at \\( F \\), as the remaining part of the tooth may be shaped by directing a straight ruler from different points of the epicycloid at \\( F \\) to the centre \\( A \\), and filling the tooth till every part of its acting surface coincide with the side of the ruler. The reason of this operation will be obvious by attending to the shape of the tooth in fig. 8. When the small wheel \\( CD \\) impels the large one \\( DE \\), the epicycloids which were formerly given to \\( CD \\) must be given to \\( DE \\), and those which were given to \\( DE \\) must be transferred to \\( CD \\).\n\nThe wheel represented in fig. 11, is sometimes called a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> wheel, though it is evident from the figure that it belongs to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of wheels which we have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> been considering; for the acting surfaces of the teeth both of the wheel \\( MB \\) and of the pinion \\( EDG \\) are directed to \\( C \\) the common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERTEX\">vertex</a> of the two cones \\( CMB, CEG \\). In this case the rules for bevelled wheels must be adopted, in which \\( AS \\) is to be considered as the radius of the wheel for the profile of the tooth at \\( A \\), and \\( MN \\) as its radius for the profile of the tooth at \\( M \\); and the epicycloids thus formed will be the sections or profiles of the teeth in the direction \\( MP \\), at right angles to \\( MC \\) the surfaces of the cone. When the vertex \\( C \\) of the cone \\( MCG \\) approaches to \\( N \\) till it Practical be in the same plane with the points \\( M, G \\), some of the curves will be cycloids and others involutes, as in the case of rack-work, for then the cone \\( CEG \\) will revolve upon a plane surface. Appendix to Ferguson's Lectures.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">Sect</a>. II. On the Wipers of Stampers, &c., the Teeth of Rack-work, &c., &c.\n\n411. In fig. 12, let \\( AB \\) be the wheel which is employed to elevate the rack \\( C \\), and let their mutual action not commence till the acting teeth have reached the line of centres \\( AC \\). In this case \\( C \\) becomes as it were the pinion or wheel driven, and the acting faces of its teeth must be interior epicycloids formed by any generating circle rolling within the circumference \\( p q \\); but as \\( p q \\) is a straight line, these interior epicycloids will be cycloids, or curves generated by a point in the circumference of a circle, rolling upon a straight line or plane surface. The acting face \\( o p \\), therefore, will be part of a cycloid formed by any generating circle, and \\( m n \\), the acting face of the teeth of the wheel, must be an exterior epicycloid produced by the same generating circle rolling on \\( m r \\) the convex surface of the wheel. If it is required to make \\( o p \\) a straight line, as in the figure, then \\( m n \\) must be an involute of the circle \\( m r \\) formed in the manner represented in fig. 5.\n\n412. Fig. 12, likewise represents a wheel depressing the rack \\( c \\) when the third mode of action is used. In this case also \\( c \\) becomes the pinion, and \\( DE \\) the wheel; \\( e h \\) therefore must be part of an interior epicycloid formed by any generating circle rolling on the concave side \\( e x \\) of the wheel, and \\( b c \\) must be an exterior epicycloid produced by the same generating circle rolling upon the circumference of the rack. The remaining part \\( c d \\) of the teeth of the wheel must be an exterior epicycloid described by any generating circle moving upon the convex side \\( e x \\), and \\( b a \\) must be an interior epicycloid engendered by the same generating circle rolling within the circumference of the rack. But as the circumference of the rack is in this case a straight line, the exterior epicycloid \\( b c \\) and the interior one \\( b a \\) will be cycloids formed by the same generating circles which are employed in describing the other epicycloids. Since it would be difficult, however, as has already been remarked, to give this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> curvature to the teeth of the wheel and rack, we may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> a generating circle whose diameter is equal to \\( D x \\) the radius of the wheel, for describing the interior epicycloid \\( e h \\), and the exterior one \\( b c \\); and a generating circle whose diameter is equal to the radius of the rack, for describing the interior epicycloid \\( a b \\), and the exterior one \\( c d \\); \\( a b \\) and \\( e h \\), therefore, will be straight lines, and \\( b c \\) will be a cycloid, and \\( c d \\) an involute of the circle \\( e x \\), the radius of the rack being infinitely great.\n\n413. In the same manner may the form of the teeth of rack-work be determined, when the second mode of action is employed, and when the teeth of the wheel or rack are circular or rectilineal. But if the rack be part of a circle, it must have the same form of its teeth as that of a wheel of the same diameter with the circle of which it is a part.\nIn machinery, where large weights are to be raised, such as fulling-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MILLS\">mills</a>, mills for pounding ore, &c., or where large pistons are to be elevated by the arms of levers, it is of the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> that the power should raise the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> with an uniform force and velocity; and this can be effected only by giving a proper form to the wiper.\n\nNow there are two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> in which this uniformity of motion may be required, and each of these demands a different form for the communicating parts. 1. When the weight is to be raised vertically, as the piston of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PUMP\">pump</a>, &c. 2. When the weight to be raised or depressed moves upon a centre, and rises or falls in the arch of a circle, such as the sledge hammer in a forge, &c.\n\n414. 1. Let AH be a wheel moved by any power which is sufficient to raise the weight MN by its extremity O, from O to c, in the same time that the wheel moves round one-fourth of its circumference, it is required to fix upon its rim a wing OBCEH which shall produce this effect with an uniform effect. Divide the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRANT\">quadrant</a> OH into any number of equal parts Om, mn, &c. the more the better, and oe into the same number ob, bc, cd, &c. and through the points m, n, p, H draw the indefinite lines AB, AC, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-AD\">AD</a>, AE, and make AB equal to Ab, AC to Ac, AD to Ad, and AE to Ae; then through the points O, B, C, D, E, draw the curve OBCDE, which is a portion of the spiral of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHIMEDES\">Archimedes</a>, and will be the proper form for the wiper or wing OHE. It is evident that when the point m has arrived at O, the extremity of the weight will have arrived at b; because AB is equal to A b, and for the same reason, when the points n, p, H have successively arrived at O, the extremity of the weight will have arrived at the corresponding points c, d, e. The motion therefore will be uniform, because the space described by the weight is proportional to the space described by the moving power, Ob being to Oc as Om to On. If it be required to raise the weight MN with an accelerated or retarded motion, we have only to divide the line Oe according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ACCELERATION\">acceleration</a> or retardation, and divide the curve OBCDE as before.\n\n415. 2. When the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEVER\">lever</a> moves upon a centre, the weight's weight will rise in the arch of a circle, and consequently a new form must be given to the wipers or wings. Let AB, fig. 14, be a lever lying horizontally, which is required to raise uniformly through the arch BC into the position AC, by means of the wheel BFH furnished with the wing BNOP, which acts upon the extremity C of the lever; and let it be required to raise it through BC in the same time that the wheel BFH moves through one-half of its circumference; that is, while the point M moves to B in the direction MFB. Divide the chord CB into any number of equal parts, the more the better, in the points 1, 2, 3, and draw the lines 1a 2b 3c parallel to AB, or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> line passing through the point B, and meeting the arch BC in the points a, b, c. Draw the lines CD, aD, bD, cD, and BD <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> the circle BFH in the points m, n, o, p.\n\nHaving drawn the diameter BM, divide the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEMICIRCLE\">semicircle</a> BFH into as many equal parts as the chord CB, in the points q, r, s. Take Bm, and set it from g to r; Take Bn and set it from s to t; Take Bo and set it from u to v, and lastly set Bp from M to E. Through the points r, t, v, E, draw the indefinite lines DN, DO, DP, DQ, and make DN equal to DC; DO equal to Db; DP equal to Da; and DQ equal to DC. Then through the points Q, P, O, N, B, draw the spiral B, N, O, P, Q, which will be the proper form for the wing of the wheel when it moves in the direction EMB.\n\nThat the spiral BNO will raise the lever AC, with an uniform motion, by acting upon its extremity c, will appear from the slightest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of the figure. It is evident, that when the point q arrives at B, the point r will be in m, because Bm is equal to qr, and the point N will be at c, because DN is equal to DC; the extremity of the lever therefore, will be found in the point c, having moved through Be. In like manner, when the point s has arrived at B, the point t will be at n, and the point O, in b, where the extremity of the lever will now be found; and so on with the rest, till the point M has arrived at B. The point E will then be in p, and the point Q in c; so that the lever will now have the position AC, having moved through the equal heights Be, eb, ba, ac, (r) in the same time that the power has moved through the equal spaces qB, sG, uS, Mm. The lever, therefore, has been raised uniformly, the ratio between the velocity of the power, and that of the weight, remaining always the same.\n\n416. If the wheel D turn in a contrary direction, according to the letters MHB, we must divide the semicircle BH EM, into as many equal parts as the chord cB, viz. in the points e, g, h. Then, having set the arch Bm from e to d, the arch Bn from g to f, and the rest in a similar manner, draw through the points d, f, h, E, the indefinite lines DR, DS, DT, DQ; make DR equal to De; DS equal to Db; DT equal to Da, and DQ equal to DC; and through the points B, R, S, T, Q, describe the spiral BRSTQ, which will be the proper form for the wing, when the wheel turns in the direction MEB. For, when the point e arrives at B, the point d will be in m, and R in c, where the extremity of the lever will now be found, having moved through Be in the same time that the power, or wheel, has moved through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> eB. In the same manner it may be shewn, that the lever will rise through the equal heights eb, ba, ac, in the same time that the power moves through the corresponding spaces eg, gf, fi, iM. The motion of the lever, therefore, and also that of the power, are always uniform. Of all the positions that can be given to the point B, the most disadvantageous are those which are nearest the points F, H; and the most advantageous position is when the chord Be is vertical, and passes, when prolonged, through D, the centre\n\n(f) The arches Bc, cb, &c. are not equal; but the perpendiculars let <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> from the points c, a, b, &c. upon the horizontal lines, passing through ab, &c. are equal, being proportional to the equal lines c1, 1, 2.

He was of a Jewish origin, as both his names discover, and probably Galilean. Before his call to the apostolate, he was a publican or toll-gatherer to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>; an office of bad repute among the Jews, on account of the covetousness and exaction of matters, those who managed it; St Matthew's office particularly consisting in gathering the customs of all merchandise that came by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> of Galilee, and the tribute that passengers were to pay who went by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>. And here it was that Matthew sat at the receipt of customs, when our Saviour called him to be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a>.

St Matthew <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> with the rest of the apostles till after our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a>'s ascension. For the first eight years afterwards, he preached in Judea. Then he betook himself to propagating the gospel among the Gentiles, and chose Ethiopia as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of his apostolical ministry; where it is said he suffered martyrdom, but by what kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> is altogether uncertain.

He was, probably, one of the 70 disciples. After our Lord's resurrection, he preached the gospel first in Judea. Afterwards\nAfterwards it is probable he travelled eastward, his residence being principally near the irruption of the river Apsarus and the haven Hyssus. The barbarous people treated him with great rudeness and inhumanity; and, after many labours and sufferings in converting great numbers to Christianity, he obtained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> of martyrdom; but by what kind of death, is uncertain.\u2014They pretend to show the relics of St Matthias at Rome; and the famous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABBEY\">abbey</a> of St Matthias near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREVES\">Treves</a> boasts of the same advantage; but doubtless both without any foundation.

D. an eminent physician and polite writer, was born in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a> in the year 1718. He was the son of a clergyman, and was originally intended for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>; but in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of some mortifications his father met with from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYNOD\">synod</a>, on account of the peculiar sentiments he entertained about the doctrine of the Trinity, turned his thoughts to physic. He took his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of M. D. at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEYDEN\">Leyden</a>; and in 1740 came to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> in England, his father having determined to quit Holland for ever. In order to make himself known, he began in 1749 to publish in French an account of the productions of the English press, printed at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAGUE\">Hague</a> under the name of the Journal Britannique. This journal, which continues to hold its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> amongst the best of those which have appeared since the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of Bayle, answered the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> end he intended by it, and introduced him to the acquaintance of some of the most respectable literary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> he had made his own. It was to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> and uninterrupted friendship he owed the places he afterwards possessed. In 1758 he was chosen fellow, and in 1765, on the resignation of Dr Birch, who died a few months after, and had made him his executor, secretary to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a>. He had been appointed one of the under librarians of the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSEUM\">museum</a> at its first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> in 1753, and became <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> librarian at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNIGHT\">Knight</a> in 1772. Useful in all these situations, he promised to be eminently so in the last, when he was seized with a languishing disorder, which in 1776 put an end to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> which had been uniformly devoted to the pursuit of science and the offices of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>. He was an early and active advocate for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INOCULATION\">inoculation</a>; and when there was a doubt entertained that one might have the smallpox this way a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> time, tried it upon himself unknown to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>. He was a member of the medical club (with the Drs Parsons, Templeman, Maty, Fothergill, Watson and others), which met every Mauberge, fortnight in St Paul's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCHYARD\">Churchyard</a>. He was twice married, viz. the first time to Mrs <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a> Boisragon; and the second to Mrs <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a> Deners. He left a son and three daughters. He had nearly finished the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of Chesterfield; which were completed by his son-in-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a> Mr Justamond, and prefixed to that nobleman's Miscellaneous Works, 1777, 2 vols 4to.\n\nMaty, Paul Henry, M. A. F. R. S. son of the former, was born in 1745, and was educated at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WESTMINSTER\">Westminster</a> and Trinity <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>, and had their travelling fellowship for three years. He was afterwards chaplain to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Stormont at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, and soon after vacated his next fellowship by marrying one of the three daughters of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a> Clerk, Esq. and sister of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> Clerk (who succeeded to the command on the death of Captain Cook). On his father's death in 1776, he was appointed to the office of one of the under librarians of the British Museum, and was afterwards preferred to a superior department, having the care of the antiquities, for which he was eminently qualified. In 1776 he also succeeded his father in the office of secretary to the Royal Society. On the disputes respecting the reinstatement of Dr Hutton in the department of secretary for foreign correspondence in 1784, Mr Maty took a warm and distinguished <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a>, and resigned the office of secretary; after which he undertook to assist gentlemen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> ladies in perfecting their knowledge of the Greek, Latin, French, and Italian classics. Mr Maty was a thinking conscientious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>; and having conceived some doubts about the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> he had subscribed in early life, he never could be prevailed upon to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> himself in the way of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> preferment, though his connexions were amongst those who could have served him essentially in this point; and soon after his father's death he withdrew himself from ministering in the established church, his reasons for which he published in the 27th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the Gent. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGAZINE\">Magazine</a>, p. 466. His whole life was thenceforwards taken up in literary pursuits. He received 100l. from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARLBOROUGH\">Marlborough</a>, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> of that beautiful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, the Gramma Marlboroughensis, of which only 100 copies were worked off for presents; and of which Mr Maty wrote the French account, as Mr Bryant did the Latin. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1782 he set on foot a Review of publications, principally foreign, which he carried on, with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> to himself and satisfaction to the public, for near five years, when he was obliged to discontinue it from ill <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>. He had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> laboured under an asthmatic complaint, which at times made great ravages in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>, and at last put a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> to his life in Jan. 1787, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of 42; leaving behind him one son.\u2014Mr Maty was eminently acquainted with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> literature, and particularly conversant in critical researches.

He soon discovered a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> for mathematical studies, and particularly for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">geometry</a>. He likewise practised instrumental music in his early years with great success, but fixed on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> profession till he was 20, when he entered into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>. He first served in the Grey musqueteers; but in the year 1720, his father purchased for him a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> of cavalry in the regiment of La Rochequoyon. He remained but five years in the army, during which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> he pursued his mathematical studies with great vigour; and it was soon remarked by M. Freret and other academicians, that nothing but geometry could satisfy his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> and unbounded thirst for knowledge. In the year 1723, he was received into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> Academy of Sciences, and read his first performance, which was a memoir upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> and form of musical instruments, November 15, 1724. During the first years of his admission, he did not wholly confine his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a>; he dived into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\"><a class=\"xref\" hr</a>ef=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> philosophy, and discovered great knowledge and dexterity in observations and experiments upon animals. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> of travelling into remote climates, like the sages of antiquity, in order to be initiated into the learned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MYSTERIES\">mysteries</a> of those times had still subsisted, no one would have conformed to it with greater eagerness than M. de Maupertuis. His first gratification of this passion was to visit the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> which had given birth to Newton; and during his residence at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> he became as zealous an admirer and follower of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> as any one of his own countrymen. His next excursion was to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BASIL\">Basil</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWITZERLAND\">Switzerland</a>, where he formed a friendship with the famous John Bernouilli and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. At his return to Paris, he applied himself to his favourite studies with greater zeal than ever:\u2014And how well he fulfilled the duties of an academician, may be gathered by running over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMOIRS\">memoirs</a> of the academy from the year 1724 to 1736; where it appears that he was neither idle nor occupied by objects of small importance. The most sublime questions in geometry and the relative sciences received from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> that elegance, clearness, and precision, so remarkable in all his writings. In the year 1736, he was sent by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> of France to the polar circle to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, in order to ascertain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, accompanied by Messrs Clairault, Camus, Le Monnier, l'Abbe Outhier, and Celsius the celebrated professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a> at Upsal. This distinction rendered him so famous, that at his return he was admitted a member of almost every academy in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>.\n\nIn the year 1740 Maupertuis had an invitation from the king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUSSIA\">Prussia</a> to go to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BERLIN\">Berlin</a>; which was too flattering to be refused. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> among men of letters had not wholly effaced his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> for his first profession, namely that of arms. He followed his Prussian majesty into the field, and was a witness of the dispositions and operations that preceded the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> of Molwitz; but was deprived of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> of being present, when victory declared in favour of his royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a>, by a singular kind of adventure. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>, during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, running away with him, he fell into the hands of the enemy; and was at first but roughly treated by the Austrian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a>, to whom he could not make himself known for want of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>; but being carried prisoner to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIENNA\">Vienna</a>, he received such honours from their Imperial Majesties as were never effaced from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>. From Vienna he returned to Berlin; but as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REFORM\">reform</a> of the academy which the king of Prussia then meditated was not yet mature, he went again to Paris, where his affairs called him, and was chosen in 1742 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTOR\">director</a> of the Academy of Sciences. In 1753 he was received into the French academy; which was the first instance of the same person being a member of both the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ACADEMIES\">academies</a> at Paris at the same time. M. de Maupertuis again assumed the soldier at the siege of Fribourg, and was pitched upon by Marshal Cogny and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> d'Argenson to carry the news to the French king of the surrender of that citadel.\n\nHe returned to Berlin in the year 1744, when a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> was negotiated and brought about by the good offices of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a>-mother, between our author and Mademoiselle de Boreck, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a> of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> and merit, and nearly related to M. de Boreck, at that time minister of state. This determined him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> at Berlin, as he was extremely attached to his new spouse, and regarded this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> as the most fortunate circumstance of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>.\n\nIn the year 1746, M. de Maupertuis was declared by his Prussian majesty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">president</a> of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Berlin, and soon after by the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> was honoured with the order of Merit: However, all these accumulated honours and advantages, so far from lessening his ardour for the sciences, seemed to furnish new allurements to labour and application. Not a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> passed but he produced some new project <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSAY\">essay</a> for the advancement of knowledge. Nor did he confine himself to mathematical studies only: <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METAPHYSICS\">metaphysics</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">chemistry</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTANY\">botany</a>, polite literature, all shared his attention, and contributed to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>. At the same time, he had, it seems, a strange inquietude of spirit, with a morose temper, which rendered him miserable amidst honours and pleasures.\u2014Such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEMPERAMENT\">temperament</a> did not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> a very pacific life, and he was engaged in several quarrels. He had...\nMaupertuis, a quarrel with Koenig the professor of philosophy at Franeker, and another more terrible with Voltaire. Maupertuis had inserted into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of Memoirs of the Academy of Berlin for 1746, a discourse upon the laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>; which Koenig was not content with attacking, but attributed to Leibnitz. Maupertuis, stung with the imputation of plagiarism, engaged the academy of Berlin to call upon him for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a>; which Koenig failing to produce, he was struck out of the academy, of which he was a member. Several pamphlets were the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of this; and Voltaire, for some reason or other, engaged against Maupertuis. We say, for some reason or other; because Maupertuis and Voltaire were apparently upon the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMICABLE\">amicable</a> terms; and the latter respected the former as his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> in the mathematics. Voltaire, however, exerted all his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WIT\">wit</a> and satire against him; and on the whole was so much transported beyond what was thought <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>, that he found it expedient in 1753 to quit the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of Prussia.\n\nOur philosopher's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> been considerably impaired by the great fatigues of various kinds in which his active mind had involved him; though from the amazing hardships he had undergone in his northern expedition, most of his future bodily sufferings may be traced. The intense sharpness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> could only be supported by means of strong liquors, which served to increase his disorder, and bring on a spitting of blood, which began at least 12 years before he died. Yet still his mind seemed to enjoy the greatest vigour; for the best of his writings were produced, and most sublime <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> developed, during the time of his confinement by sickness, when he was unable to occupy his presidial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a> at the academy. He took several journeys to St Malo, during the last years of his life, for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>: And though he always received benefit by breathing his native air, yet still, upon his return to Berlin, his disorder likewise returned with greater violence.\u2014His last journey into France was undertaken in the year 1757; when he was obliged, soon after his arrival there, to quit his favourite retreat at St Malo, on account of the danger, and confusion which that town was thrown into by the arrival of the English in its neighbourhood. From thence he went to Bordeaux, hoping there to meet with a neutral ship to carry him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAMBURG\">Hamburg</a>, in his way back to Berlin; but being disappointed in that hope, he went to Thoulouse, where he remained <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> months. He had then thoughts of going to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, in hopes a milder <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> would restore him to health; but finding himself grow worse, he rather inclined towards Germany, and went to Neufchatel, where for three months he enjoyed the conversation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Marischal, with whom he had formerly been much connected. At length he arrived at Basil, October 16, 1758, where he was received by his friend Bernouilli and his family with the utmost tenderness and affection. He at first found himself much better here than he had been at Neufchatel: but this amendment was of short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>; for as the winter approached, his disorder returned, accompanied by new and more alarming symptoms. He languished here many months during which he was attended by M. de la Condamine; and died in 1759.\n\nHe wrote in French, 1. The figure of the earth determined. 2.

But this life is considered as apocryphal. In rejecting it, however, as well as the circumstances of the mission, we must beware of denying the mission itself. It is certain that it was believed in France as early as the 9th century; and notwithstanding the silence of Bede, Gregory of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TOURS\">Tours</a>, and others, there are several documents which prove this, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> at least render it extremely probable. A celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENEDICTINES\">Benedictines</a>, took the name of St Maur in the beginning of the last century, and received the sanction of Pope Gregory XV. in 1621. This society was early distinguished by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> and the knowledge of its members, and it still supports the character. There are, perhaps, fewer eminent men in it than formerly; but this may be ascribed to the levity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, and partly to the little encouragement for the researches of learned men. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> persons of ingenuity which this society has produced are, the Fathers Menard, d'Acheri, Mabillon, Ruinart, Germain, Lami, Montfaucon, Martin, Vaissette, le Nouvri, Martianay, Martenne, Massuet, &c. &c.

It was sent by Dionysius to check the Bagaudae, who had excited some disturbances in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAUL\">Gaul</a>. Maurice having carried his troops over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALPS\">Alps</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> Maximilian commanded him to employ his utmost exertions to extirpate Christianity. This proposal was received with horror both by the commander and by the soldiers. The emperor, enraged at their opposition, commanded the legion to be decimated; and when they still declared\nMaurice, declared that they would sooner die than do anything prejudicial to the Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>, every tenth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of those who remained was put to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. Their perseverance excited the emperor to still greater cruelty; for when he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> that nothing could make them relinquish their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, he commanded his troops to surround them, and cut them to pieces. Maurice, the commander of these Christian heroes, and Exuperus and Candidus, officers of the legion, who had chiefly instigated the soldiers to this noble resistance, signalized themselves by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a> and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to the doctrines of the Christian religion. They were massacred, it is believed, at Agaune, in Chablais, the 22d of September, 286.\n\nNotwithstanding many proofs which support this transaction, Dubordier, Hottinger, Moyle, Burnet, and Mosheim, are disposed to deny the fact. It is defended, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, by Hicks an English writer, and by Dom <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a> de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LISLE\">Lisle</a> a Benedictine monk de la <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONGREGATION\">congregation</a> de Saint Vannes, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of his, entitled Defense de la Verite du Martyre de la Legion Thebienne, 1737. In defense of the same fact, the reader may consult Historia de S. Mauritio, by P. Rosignole Jesuit, and the Acta Sanctorum for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of September. The martyrdom of this legion, written by St Eucherius bishop of Lyons, was transmitted to posterity in a very imperfect manner by Surius. P. Chiflet a Jesuit, discovered, and gave to the public, an exact <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> of this work. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DON\">Don</a> Rainart maintains, that it has every mark of authenticity. St Maurice is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a> of a celebrated order in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SARDINIA\">Sardinia</a>'s dominions, created by Emmanuel Philibert <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Savoy, to reward <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> merit, and approved by Gregory XIII. in 1572. The commander of the Theban legion must not be confounded with another St Maurice, mentioned by Theodoret, who suffered martyrdom at Apamea in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYRIA\">Syria</a>.\n\nMaurice (Mauritius Tiberius), was born at Arasissus in Cappadocia, A.D. 539. He was descended from an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>. After he had filled several offices in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of Tiberius Constantine, he obtained the command of his armies against the Persians. His gallantry was so conspicuous that the emperor gave him his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> Constantina in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a>, and invested him with the purple the 13th August 582. The Persians still <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to make inroads on the Roman territories, and Maurice sent Philippicus, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>-in-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, against them. This general conducted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> with various success. At first he gained several splendid victories, but he did not continue to have a decided superiority. As there was a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> for soldiers in these unfortunate times, the emperor issued a mandate in 592, forbidding any soldier to become a monk till he had accomplished the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> of his military <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>. Maurice acquired much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> in restoring Chosroes II. king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a>, to the throne, after he had been deposed by his subjects. The empire was in his reign harassed by the frequent inroads of the Arabian tribes. He purchased peace from them, by granting them a pension nearly equal to 100,000 crowns; but these barbarians took frequent opportunities to renew the war. In different engagements the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> destroyed 50,000, and took 17,000 prisoners. These were restored, on condition that the king of the Abari should return all the Roman captives in his dominions. Maurice, regardless of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a>, he demanded a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RANSOM\">ransom</a> of 10,000 crowns. Maurice, full of indignation, refused the sum: and the barbarian, equally enraged, put the captives to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>. While the emperor, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a> this cruelty, was making preparations against the Abari, Phocas, who from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CENTURION\">centurion</a> had attained the highest military preferment, assumed the purple, and was declared emperor. He pursued Maurice to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHALCEDON\">Chalcedon</a>, took him prisoner, and condemned him to die. The five sons of this unfortunate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> were massacred before his eyes, and Maurice, humbling himself under the hand of God, was heard to exclaim, Thou art <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a>, O <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a>, and thy judgments are without partiality. He was beheaded on the 26th November 602, in the 63rd year of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> and 20th of his reign. Many writers have estimated the character of this prince by his misfortunes instead of his actions. They believed him guilty without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a>, and condemned him without reason. It cannot be denied, however, that he allowed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a> to be harassed; but he was a father to the rest of the empire. He restored the military <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a>, humbled the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a> of his enemies, supported the Christian religion by his laws, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a> by his example. He loved the sciences, and was the patron of learned men.\n\nMaurice, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTOR\">elector</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAXONY\">Saxony</a>, son of Henry le Pieux, was born A.D. 1521. He was early remarkable for his courage, and during his whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> he was engaged in warlike pursuits. He served under the emperor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> V. in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAMPAIGN\">campaign</a> of 1544 against France; and in the year following against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a> of Smalkalde; with which, although a Protestant, he would have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> manner of connexion. The emperor, as a reward for his services, in the year 1547, made him elector of Saxony, having deprived his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUSIN\">cousin</a> John Frederick of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELECTORATE\">electorate</a>. Ambition had led him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> the views of Charles, in the hope of being elector, and ambition again detached him from that prince. In 1551 he entered into a league against the emperor, together with the elector of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRANDENBURG\">Brandenburg</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> Palatine, the duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WURTEMBERG\">Wurtemberg</a>, and many other princes. This league, encouraged by the young and enterprising Henry II. of France, was more dangerous than that of Smalkalde. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRETEXT\">pretext</a> for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">association</a> was the deliverance of the landgrave of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HESSE\">Hesse</a>, whom the emperor kept prisoner. Maurice and the confederates marched, in 1552, to the defiles of Tyrol, and put to flight the Imperial troops who guarded them. The emperor and his brother Ferdinand narrowly escaped, and fled from the conquerors in great disorder. Charles having retired into Passau, where he had collected an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, brought the princes of the league to terms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a>. By the famous peace of Passau, which was finally ratified the 12th of August 1552, the emperor granted an amnesty without exception to all those who had carried arms against him from the year 1546. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROTESTANTS\">Protestants</a> not only obtained the free <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of their religion, but they were admitted into the imperial chamber, from which they had been excluded since the victory of Mulberg. Maurice soon after united himself with the emperor against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MARGRAVE\">margrave</a> of Brandenburg, who laid waste the German provinces. He engaged him in 1553, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a>-\nMaurice, ed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> of Sivershausen, and died of the wounds he had received in the engagement two days after. He was one of the greatest protectors of the Lutherans in Germany, and a prince equally brave and politic. After he had profited by the spoils of John Frederick, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> of the Protestants, he became himself the leader of the party, and by these means maintained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> of power against the emperor in Germany.\n\nMaurice de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NASSAU\">Nassau</a>, Prince of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">Orange</a>, succeeded to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of the Low Countries after the death of his father William, who was killed in 1584 by the fanatic Gerard. The young prince was then only eighteen years of age, but his courage and abilities were above his years. He was appointed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">captain</a> general of the United Provinces, and he reared that edifice of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> of which his father had laid the foundation. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREDA\">Breda</a> submitted to him in 1590; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZUTPHEN\">Zutphen</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEVENTER\">Deventer</a>, Hulst, Nimeguen, in 1591. He gained several important advantages in 1592, and in the year following he made himself <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of Gertrudenburg. When he had performed these splendid services, he returned to the Low Countries by the way of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZEALAND\">Zealand</a>. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a> was attacked by a dreadful tempest, in which he lost forty vessels, and he himself had very nearly perished. His death would have been considered by the Hollanders as a much greater calamity than the loss of their vessels. They watched over his safety with exceeding care. In 1594, one of his guards was accused of an intention to take away his life; and it was generally believed that he was bribed to this service by the enemies of the republic. He fell a sacrifice at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRUGES\">Bruges</a>, either to his own fanaticism <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> to the jealous anxiety of the friends of Maurice.\n\nThe prince of Orange, increasing in reputation, defeated the troops of the archduke Albert in 1597, and drove the Spaniards entirely out of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>. In 1600 he was obliged to raise the siege of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUNKIRK\">Dunkirk</a>; but he took ample vengeance on Albert, whom he again defeated in a pitched battle near Nieuport. Before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, this great general sent back the ships which had brought his troops into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLANDERS\">Flanders</a>: My brethren (said he to his army), we must conquer the enemy or drink up the waters of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>. Determine for yourselves; I have determined I shall either conquer by your bravery, or I shall never survive the disgrace of being conquered by men in every respect our inferiors. This speech elevated the soldiers to the highest pitch of enthusiasm, and the victory was complete. Rhinberg, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAVE\">Grave</a>, and Ecluse, cities in Flanders, submitted to the conqueror the following year. Maurice, however, not only laboured for the commonwealth, but also for himself. He coveted the sovereignty of Holland, and was opposed in the prosecution of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> by the pensioner Barneveldt. The zeal and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> of this wise republican cost him his life. He was an Arminian; and at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> Maurice defended Gomar against Arminius.\n\nTaking advantage of the general odium under which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMINIANS\">Arminians</a> lay, he found means to get Barneveldt condemned in 1619. His death, wholly owing to the cruel ambition of the Prince of Orange, made a deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> on the minds of the Hollanders. The truce with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a> being expired, Spinola laid siege to Breda in 1624, and in six months, by the proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of his great talents, though with great slaughter of his troops, he took the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>. The prince of Maurice, Orange, unsuccessful in every attempt to raise the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MAURITANIA\">Mauritania</a> siege, died of vexation in 1625, aged 55 years, with the reputation of the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WARRIOR\">warrior</a> of his time.\n\n\"The life of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STADTHOLDER\">stadtholder</a> (says the able Raynal) was almost an uninterrupted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of battles, of sieges, and of victories. Of moderate abilities in every thing else, he shone conspicuous in his military capacity. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAMP\">camp</a> was the school of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>; and those who received their military <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> in his armies augmented, perhaps, the glory of their master. Like Montecucculi, he discovered inimitable skill in his marches and encampments; like Vauban, he possessed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a> of fortifying places, and of rendering them impregnable; like Eugene, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> of finding subsistence for great armies in countries barren by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, or ravaged by war; like Vendome, the happy talent of calling forth, in the moment they became necessary, greater exertions from his soldiers than could reasonably be expected; like Cond\u00e9, that infallible quickness of eye which decides the fortune of battles; like Charles XII., the art of rendering his troops almost invincible to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUNGER\">hunger</a>, and fatigue; like Turenne, the secret of making war with the least possible expense of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> blood.\" The Chevalier Folard maintains, that Maurice was the greatest commander of infantry since the time of the Romans. He studied the military art of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>, and applied their rules with great exactness in the various occurrences of war. He not only took advantage of the inventions of others, but he enriched the science of war with several improvements. Telescopes were first used by him for a military purpose; and, besides a kind of gallery in conducting a siege, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of blockading a strong place, which were of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>, he greatly improved the whole art by his method of pushing an attack with great vigour, and of defending, for the greatest length of time, and in the best manner, a place besieged. In short, the many useful things which he practised or invented, placed him in the highest rank among men of a military character. On one occasion, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> asked him, Who was the first general of the age? Spinola (replied he) is the second. It was his constant practice, during <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a>, to have two guards placed by his bedside, not only to defend him in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of danger, but to awake him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> there should be the least occasion. The war betwixt Spain and Holland was never carried on with greater keenness and animosity than during his administration.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">Grand</a> Signor, hearing of the vast torrents of blood shed in this contest, thought that a great empire must depend on the decision. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of so many battles was pointed out to him on a map, and he said coldly, If it were my business, I would send my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIONEERS\">pioneers</a>, and order them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> this little corner of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> into the sea. Maurice, like many great men, was impatient under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a>, and too much devoted to women. He was succeeded by Frederick Henry his brother.","sp":29,"ep":31},{"h":"MAURICEAU","t":"Francis, a French surgeon, who applied himself with great success and reputation to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> and practice of his art for several years at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>.

It is certain, that this region, as well as the others to the eastward of it, had many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a> planted in it by the Phoenicians. Procopius tells us, that in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> two pillars of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> were to be seen there, with the following inscription in the Phoenician <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> and character upon them: \"We are the Canaanites, that fled from Joshua the son of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUN\">Nun</a>, that notorious robber.\" Ibn Rachic, or Ibn Roquiz, an African writer cited by Leo, together with Evagrius and Nicephorus Callistus, assert the same thing.\n\nThe Mauritians, according to Ptolemy, were divided into several cantons or tribes. The Metagonitae were seated near the straits of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERCULES\">Hercules</a>, now those of Gibraltar. The Succosii, or Cocossii, occupied the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of the Iberian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>. Under these two petty nations the Massaces, Veruces, and Verbice or Vercices, were settled. The Salise or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SALINES\">Salines</a>, were situated lower, towards the ocean; and, still more to the south, the Volubiliani. The Mauritani and Herpiditani possessed the eastern part of this country, which was terminated by the Mulucha. The Angacauani, or Jangacauani, Neetiberes, Zagrenzii, Banibae, and Faeculer, extended themselves from the southern foot of Ptolemy's Atlas <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINOR\">Minor</a> to his Atlas <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJOR\">Major</a>. Pliny mentions the Banibae, whom Father Hardouin takes to be Ptolemy's Banibae; and Mela, the Atlantes, whom he represents as possessed of the western part of this district.\n\nThe earliest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> of Mauritania mentioned in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEPTUNE\">Neptune</a>; and next to him were Atlas and Anteus his two sons, both famous in the Grecian fables on account of their wars with Hercules. Anteus, in his contention with that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERO\">hero</a>, seems to have behaved with great bravery and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a>. Having received <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> reinforcements of Libyan troops, he cut off great numbers of Hercules's men. But that celebrated commander, having at last intercepted a strong body of Libyans sent to the relief of Anteus, gave him a total overthrow, wherein both he and the best part of his forces were put to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>. This decisive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> put Hercules in possession of Libya and Mauritania, and consequently of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a> of all these kingdoms. Hence came the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FABLE\">fable</a>, that Hercules, finding Anteus, a giant of an enormous size with whom he was engaged in single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBAT\">combat</a>, to receive fresh strength as often as he touched his mother <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> when thrown upon her, at last lifted him up in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> and squeezed him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. Hence likewise may be deduced the fable intimating that Hercules took the globe from Atlas upon his own shoulders, overcame the dragon that guarded the orchards of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HESPERIDES\">Hesperides</a>, and made himself <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> Mauritians en fruit there. Bochart thinks that the fable alluded chiefly to naval engagements, wherein Hercules, for the most part, was victorious; though Anteus from time to time received succours by sea. But at last Hercules, coming up with one of his squadrons which had a strong reinforcement on board, made himself master of it, and thus rendered Anteus incapable for the future of making <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> against him. The same author likewise insinuates, that the notion of Anteus's gigantic stature prevailing for so many centuries amongst the Tingitanians, pointed out the size of the vessels of which his fleets and squadrons were composed. As for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> apples so frequently mentioned by the old mythologists, they were the treasures that fell into Hercules's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> upon the defeat of Anteus; the Greeks giving the oriental word \u1f00\u03c1\u03b3\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03af riches, the signification affixed to their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> \u03c7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03bf\u03af, apples.\n\nWith regard to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> in which Atlas and Anteus lived, the most probable supposition seems to be that of Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Newton. According to that illustrious author, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMMON\">Ammon</a> the father of Sesac was the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> of Libya, or that vast tract extending from the borders of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a> to the Atlantic ocean; the conquest of which country was effected by Sesac in his father's lifetime. Neptune afterwards excited the Libyans to a rebellion against Sesac, and slew him; and then invaded Egypt under the command of Atlas or Anteus, the son of Neptune, Sesac's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ADMIRAL\">admiral</a>. Not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> after, Hercules, the general of Thebais and Ethiopia for the gods or great men of Egypt, reduced a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> time the whole continent of Libya, having overthrown and slain Anteus near a town in the Thebais, from that event called Antea or Anteopolis: this, we say, is the notion advanced by Sir Isaac Newton, who endeavours to prove, that the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> of Libya, by Sesac, happened a little above a thousand years before the birth of Christ, as the last, by Hercules, did some few years after. Now, though we do not pretend to adopt every particular circumstance of Sir Isaac Newton's system, yet we cannot forbear observing, that it appears undeniably <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> from Scripture, that neither the western extremity of Libya, nor even the other parts of that region, could possibly have been so well peopled before the time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAVID\">David</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLOMON\">Solomon</a>, as to have sent a numerous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> to invade Egypt. For Egypt and Phoenicia, from whence the greatest part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a> of the Libyans came, and which were much nearer the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> from whence the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISPERSION\">dispersion</a> of mankind was made, could not themselves have been greatly overstocked with inhabitants any considerable time before the reign of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAUL\">Saul</a>. And that such an invasion happened in the reign of Neptune, or at least of his son Anteus, has been most fully evinced by this most excellent chronologer.\n\nFrom the defeat of Anteus, nothing remarkable occurs in the history of Mauritania till the times of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, who at last brought the whole kingdom under their jurisdiction; for which see the article ROME. 1. With regard to the customs, &c. of this people, it would seem, from what Hyginus insinuates, that they fought only with clubs, till one Belus, the son of Neptune, as that author calls him, taught them\nSir Issac Newton makes this Belus to have been the same person with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SESOSTRIS\">Sesostris</a> king of Egypt, who overran a great part of the then known world. 2. All persons of distinction in Mauritania went richly attired, wearing much gold and silver in their clothes. They took great pains in cleansing their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>, and curled their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> in a curious and elegant manner. They combed their beards, which were very long, and always had their nails pared extremely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a>. When they walked out in any numbers, they never touched one another, for fear of disconcerting the curls into which their hair had been formed. 3. The Mauritanian infantry, in time of action, used shields made of elephants skins, being clad in these of lions, leopards, and bears, which they kept on both night and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>. 4. The cavalry of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> was armed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> short lances, and carried targets or bucklers, made likewise of the skins of wild beasts. They used <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> saddles. Their horses were small and swift, had wooden collars about their necks, and were so much under the command of their riders, that they would follow them like dogs. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of these horsemen was not much different from that of the foot above mentioned, they constantly wearing a large tunic of the skins of wild beasts. The Phutaei, of whom the Mauritanians were a branch, were eminent for their shields, and the excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> they made of them, as we learn from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOMER\">Homer</a>, Xenophon, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERODOTUS\">Herodotus</a>, and Scripture. Nay, Herodotus seems to intimate, that the shield and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HELMET\">helmet</a> came from them to the Greeks. 5. Notwithstanding the fertility of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, the poorer sort of the Mauritanians never took care to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANURE\">manure</a> the ground, being strangers to the art of husbandry; but roved about the country in a wild <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> manner, like the ancient Scythians or Arabes Scenite. They had tents, or mapalia, so extremely small, that they could scarce breathe in them. Their food was corn, herbage, &c. which they frequently did eat green, without any manner of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a>, being destitute of wine, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>, and all the elegancies as well as many necessaries of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. Their habit was the same both in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> and winter, consisting chiefly of an old tattered, though thick garment, and over it a coarse rough tunic; which answered probably to that of their neighbours the Numidians. Most of them lay every night upon the bare ground; though some of them strewed their garments thereon, not unlike the present African Kabyles and Arabs, who, according to Dr Shaw, use their hykes for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a> and covering in the night. 6. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> the most approved <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> of Horace may be admitted, the Mauritanians <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a> poisoned arrows; which clearly intimates, that they had some skill in the art of preparing poisons, and were excellent dartmen. This last observation is contemnanced by Herodian and Athen, who entirely come into it, affirming them to have been in such continual danger of being devoured by wild beasts, that they durst not stir out of their tents or mapalia without their darts. Such perpetual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> must render them exceedingly skilful in hurling that weapon. 7. The Mauritanians sacrificed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> victims to their deities, as the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, &c. did.\n\nThe country people were extremely rude and barbarous; but those inhabiting cities must undoubtedly have had at least some smattering in the literature of the several nations they deduced their origin from. That Mauritania the Mauritanians had some knowledge in naval affairs, seems probable, not only from the intercourse they had with the Phoenicians and Carthaginians, as well as the situation of their country; but likewise from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORPHEUS\">Orpheus</a>, or Onomacritus, who asserts them to have made a settlement at the entrance into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLCHIS\">Colchis</a>, to which place they came by sea. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGIC\">Magic</a>, sorcery, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVINATION\">divination</a>, &c. they appear to have applied themselves to in very early times. Cicero and Pliny say, that Atlas was the inventor of astrology, and the doctrine of the sphere, i.e. he first introduced them into Mauritania. This, according to Diodorus Siculus, gave rise to the fable of Atlas <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> the heavens upon his shoulders. The same author relates that Atlas instructed Hercules in the doctrine of the sphere and astrology, or rather <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a>, who afterwards brought those sciences into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>.","sp":31,"ep":33},{"h":"MAURITIA","t":"the Ginkgo, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Maidenhair Tree; a genus of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> belonging to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> order of palms.

It is about 150 miles in circumference. In the beginning of the 16th century it was discovered by the Portuguese, who knowing that Pliny and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> writers had mentioned the island of Cerne in these seas, took it for granted that this must be it; and accordingly we find it styled Cerne or Sirne, in their maps; but, notwithstanding this, they did not think fit to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> it; and indeed their force was so small, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of the vast dominions they grasped, that it was very excusable. However, according to their laudable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>, they put some hogs, goats, and other cattle, upon it, that in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> any of their ships either going to the Indies or returning to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PORTUGAL\">Portugal</a> should be obliged to touch there, they might meet with refreshments. The Dutch, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> voyage they made to the East Indies under their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ADMIRAL\">admiral</a> James Cornelius Vanneck, came together with five ships on the 15th of September 1668; anchored in a commodious port, to which they gave the name of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARWICK\">Warwick</a> Haven; and gave a very good account of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in their journals. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> Samuel Castleton, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEARL\">Pearl</a>, an English East <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> ship, arrived there on the 27th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 1612; and taking it to be an island undiscovered before, bestowed upon it the name of England's Forest, though others of his crew called it Pearl Island; and in the account of their voyage, written by John Tatton the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of the ship, celebrated it as a place very convenient for shipping, either outward or homeward bound, to refresh at. This they sometimes accordingly did, and brought some cargoes of ebony, and rich wood from thence; but without fixing any settlement.\n\nAt length, in 1638, the Dutch seated themselves here; and it is highly remarkable, that at the very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> they were employed in making their first settlement, the French sent a vessel to take possession of it, who found the Dutch beforehand with them, and refused the assistance of an English Indiaman, wooing and watering in another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the island, who very frankly offered it, to drive the Dutch from their half settled posts. They <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> for some time in quiet possession.\nMauritius, possession of the places they fortified in this island, to which they gave the name of Mauritius, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">Prince</a> Maurice their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STADTHOLDER\">stadtholder</a>. But having engaged the French, who were settled on Madagascar, to steal 50 of the natives, and sell them for slaves, for the improvement of the Dutch settlements here, this proved the ruin of both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a>; for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NEGROES\">negroes</a> surprised and massacred the French in Madagascar; and the slaves in Mauritius fled into the centre of the island; from whence they so much and so incessantly molested those who had been formerly their masters, that they chose to quit a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> where they could <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> longer remain in any tolerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of safety. The East India <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">Company</a>, however, from motives of convenience, and a very imperfect notion of its value, disapproved this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, and therefore ordered it to be resettled; which was accordingly done, and three forts erected at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> havens. Things now went on somewhat better than they did before; but they were still very much disturbed by the revolted negroes in the heart of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLE\">isle</a>, whom they could never subdue. One principal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> that the company made of this place, was to send thither state prisoners, who, as they were not men of the best morals, quickly corrupted the rest of the inhabitants, and rendered them such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of outrageous smugglers, the situation of the place concurred with their bad disposition, that after various ineffectual attempts made to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REFORM\">reform</a> them, orders were at length given to abandon Mauritius a second time, which after some delays, were put in execution in the year 1710.\n\nTwo years after this, the French took possession of it, and named it the isle de France. This name has obtained among themselves, but the Europeans in general continue to call it Mauritius. It lies in 8\u00b0 Lat. 20\u00b0 13' E. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">Long</a>. 6\u00b0 15'. The inconveniences arising from the want of a port at the island of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOURBON\">Bourbon</a>, induced the French to take possession of Mauritius, it having two very good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HARBOURS\">harbours</a>, to fortify which no expense has been spared. That on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>-west is called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PORT_LOUIS\">Port <a cl</a>ass=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a>, that on the south-east side of the island is called Port Bourbon. The trade-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> from the south-east in these latitudes blows all the year round, excepting for a few days at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> solstice, when it is interrupted by hard gales and hurricanes from the north. The ease with which this wind enables ships to enter the port of Bourbon, caused the French, when they first took possession of this spot, to esteem it the best port in the island; but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> pointing out to them, that the same wind often rendered the passage out of the harbour so difficult, that a ship was sometimes obliged to wait a considerable time before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> admitted of her putting to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, this harbour is in a great measure abandoned, and the principal town and seat of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> is now fixed at Port Louis, which is nearly in the middle of the north side of the island, and its entrance is through a channel formed by two shoals, which advance about two miles into the sea. When a ship arrives opposite to this channel, the south-east wind hinders her from entering the port under sail, and she must either warp in with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CABLES\">cables</a> or be towed in with boats. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of this operation, joined to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> narrowness of the channel, which does not admit of two ships <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABREAST\">abreast</a> of each other entering at the same time, is one of the best defences the harbour has against an attack by sea; for, from these obstacles, an enemy would find it a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of the greatest difficulty to force the port; and in addition to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> strength, they have built two forts and as many batteries, which are mounted with heavy cannon, and entirely command the approach to the harbour, should ships presume to force an entry under sail. This port is capable of containing 100 sail of ships, and is well provided with every requisite for repairing and even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> of ships. This port has proved of the greatest advantage to France in the several wars which have been carried on between Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> and her; and has proved of great utility to the French East India Company's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>; for here their ships and crews were sure to meet with all necessary refreshment after a long voyage. The port of Bourbon is also fortified; and an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> landed here would find it an extremely difficult task to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> to the different parts of the island. There are several places between the north-east extremity and Port Louis where boats may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, but all these are defended by batteries; and the country behind them is a continued thicket: The rest of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> is inaccessible. In the north-eastern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> extending about 10 miles from east to west, and in some places five miles inland from the northern coast. All the rest of the island is full of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> and steep mountains, lying so near to one another, and the intervals between them so narrow, that, instead of valleys, they rather resemble the beds of torrents; and these are choked with huge fragments of rocks which have fallen from the steep sides of the impending mountains. On the summits of the mountains <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ICE\">ice</a> is frequently to be found, and they are covered with forests of ebony and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> trees. The ground they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a> produces herbage, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHRUBS\">shrubs</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> of various sorts, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> grass to the strongest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THORN\">thorn</a>, and that in such profusion, that they form a thicket so closely interwoven, that no progress can be made but by means of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HATCHET\">hatchet</a>. Notwithstanding these difficulties, plantations have been formed on these mountains, and very considerable progress has been made in the plains; but the productions, although mostly of the same kind, are not only in less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a>, but of an inferior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> to those produced at Bourbon island.\n\nIn a course of years, however, the settlement cost so much, and was considered in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> worth so little, that it had been more than once under deliberation, whether, after the example of the Dutch, they should not leave it again to its old negro inhabitants; which sooner or later in all likelihood would have been its fate; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a>, in 1735, the famous M. de la Bourdonnais had not been sent thither with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of governor-general of the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>.\n\nHe found this isle in the worst state possible, thinly inhabited by a set of lazy people, who equally hated industry and peace, and who were continually flattering this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a>, and betraying him wherever and as far as they durst. He gave himself no trouble about this, having once found the means to make himself obeyed; he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> the vast importance of the island; he conceived that it might be settled to great advantage; and, without so much as expecting the thanks of those for whom he laboured, he began to execute this great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>. His first step was to bring over <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>\nMauritius, black boys from Madagascar, whom he carefully trained up in good principles, and in continual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a>; by which he rendered them so good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a>, that he very quickly obliged the Marones, or wild negroes, either to submit or to quit the island: he taught the planters to cultivate their lands to advantage; he, by an aqueduct, brought fresh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> to the sea side; and whereas they had not so much as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a> at his coming thither, he made a very fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOCK\">dock</a>, where he not only built sloops and large vessels, but even a ship of the burden of 500 tons. However incredible it may seem, yet it is certainly fact, that in the space of five years he converted this country into a paradise, that had been a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> wilderness for 5000; and this in spite of the inhabitants, and of the company, who being originally prejudiced by them, behaved ill to him at his return. He soon made the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARDINAL\">cardinal</a> de Fleury, however, sensible of the true state of things; and compelled the company to acknowledge, though they did not reward, his services.\n\nHe afterwards returned into the Indies, and perfected the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> he had begun, and to him it is owing that the isle of France was rendered one of the finest and most important spots upon the globe. Here no coffee is raised; but by the indefatigable industry of M. de Bourdonnais, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIGO\">indigo</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEPPER\">pepper</a>, and cotton (which are not at Bourbon), came to be cultivated with success. Since the departure of that most excellent governor, the plantations have been neglected, and are fallen off; but if a proper spirit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> was raised among the inhabitants, they might soon be made to resume their flourishing appearance. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINES\">Mines</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> have been discovered in the mountains near the great plain, in the north-east part of the island; and these mountains affording in great abundance the necessary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a>, forges have been erected: but the iron produced is of a very inferior quality, it being brittle, and only fit for making cannon-balls and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOMB\">bomb</a>-shells. Black cattle, sheep, and goats, are preserved with difficulty; the first generally die before they have been a year in the island, and this occasions frequent importations of them from Madagascar and other parts. Common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POULTRY\">poultry</a> breed in great plenty; and, with fish and turtle, furnish a great part of the food of the European inhabitants.\n\nThe approach to the island is extremely dangerous, it being surrounded with ledges of rocks, and many of them covered by the sea. The shore abounds with coral and shells. This island is said to contain 60 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>; some are considerable streams, and most of them have their sources from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>, of which there are several in the middle part of the island. The rivers afford plenty of various kinds of fish, particularly eels. These are of an enormous size, some having been found that were six feet long, and six inches in circumference, and so extremely voracious, that it is dangerous to bathe in those parts of the river where they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIE\">lie</a>, as they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> a man without fear, and have strength sufficient to keep him under water till he is drowned. Here is a great variety of birds, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATS\">bats</a> as large as a young kitten: the inhabitants esteem them a delicate morsel. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> is both hot and moist, but not unwholesome. The place abounds with insects, which are very troublesome; but there are no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERPENTS\">serpents</a>. It has been discovered, that off Port Louis the south-west wind generally blows with least strength about Mauritius sunrise; and it also happens, on four or five days at intervals, in the course of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>, that early in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> the wind ceases in the northern part of the island for an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> or two, when a breeze rises, although but faintly, from the north-west; during which, a ship stationed at the entrance of the channel to avail herself of this breeze, may enter the harbour and attack the forts.\n\nThis island, during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of the French revolution, did not entirely escape from the storm which then agitated the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a> country. In the year 1799, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSPIRACY\">conspiracy</a> was formed, and broke out, for the purpose of resisting the government which had been established under the authority of the republic. It was, however, soon suppressed by the activity of the civil authorities, supported by the majority of the inhabitants.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> of this island in 1799 amounted to 65,000, viz. 55,000 slaves, and 10,000 whites and mulattoes. The following is a state of the produce of this island in 1800: viz. coffee, 6000 bales, of 100 lbs. French; indigo, 300,000 lbs. from 2s. to 8s. per lb.; cotton, 2000 bales, of 250 lbs.; raw sugar, 20,000,000 lbs.; cloves, 20,000 lbs. The island of Mauritius, as well as the other French islands in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> ocean, were taken by the British in 1811; and their possession was confirmed to Britain by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> in 1814.","sp":33,"ep":35},{"h":"MAURUA","t":"one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a> in the South <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>.

He afterwards invited his father to reassume his imperial authority; and in a perfidious manner destroyed Severus, who had delivered himself into his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, and relied upon his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> for the safety of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>.

He went well to rest over night, after a cheerful bottle as usual, and died in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a> before <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>: upon which his death was imputed to his tying his nightcap too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> under his fat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEEKS\">cheeks</a> and chin, which caused his suffocation; but the factious Andrew Marvel has written a poem of 100 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a>, to make him a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARTYR\">martyr</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACCHUS\">Bacchus</a>, and die by the force of good wine. He was interred near Camden in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WESTMINSTER\">Westminster</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABBEY\">Abbey</a>; which caused Dr Fuller to say, that \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he were a biased and partial writer, yet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> lieth buried near a good and true historian indeed.\" Soon after the Restoration, his body, with those of several others, was dug up, and buried in a pit in St Margaret's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCHYARD\">churchyard</a>; and his monument, which was erected by the appointment of parliament, was taken down and thrown aside.\n\nMayer, Tobias, one of the greatest astronomers and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a> the 18th century produced, was born at Masbach, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUCHY\">duchy</a> of W\u00fcrttemberg, 1723. He taught himself <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a>, and at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of fourteen designed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACHINES\">machines</a> and instruments with the greatest dexterity and justness. These pursuits did not hinder him from cultivating the belles lettres. He acquired the Latin tongue, and wrote it with elegance. In 1750, the university of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOTTINGEN\">Gottingen</a> chose him for their mathematical professor; and every year of his short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> was thenceforward marked with some considerable discoveries in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">geometry</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a>. He published several works in this way, which are all reckoned excellent; and some are inserted in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> of the university of Gottingen.\" His labours seem to have exhausted him; for he died worn out in 1762.\n\nMayerne, Sir Theodore de, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARON\">baron</a> of Aubone, was the son of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEWIS\">Lewis</a> de Mayerne, the celebrated author of the General History of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, and of the Monarchie aristocrate-d\u00e9mocratique, dedicated to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>-general. He was born in 1573, and had for his godfather Theodore Beza. He studied physic at Montpelier, and was made physician in ordinary to Henry IV. who promised to do great things for him, provided he would change his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>. James I. of England invited him over, and made him first physician to himself and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a>, in which office he served the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MAYENNE\">Mayenne</a> whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> family to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of his death in 1655. His works were printed at London in 1700, and make a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> folio, divided into two books; the first containing his Consilia, Epistolae, et Observationes; the second his Pharmacopoeia variaeque medicamentorum formule.\n\nMayhem. See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAIM\">Maim</a>.\n\nMayne, Jasper, an eminent English poet and divine in the 17th century, who was bred at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a>, and entered into holy orders. While his majesty resided at Oxford, he was one of the divines appointed to preach before him. He published in 1647 a piece entitled Oxaomaxia, or The people's war examined according to the principles of reason and scripture, by Jasper Mayne. In 1648 he was deprived of his studentship at Christ <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, and two livings he had; but was restored with the king, who made him his chaplain and archdeacon of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHICHESTER\">Chichester</a>; all which he held till he died. Dr Mayne was held in very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> esteem both for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> parts and his acquired accomplishments. He was an orthodox preacher, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of severe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> and exemplary behaviour; yet of a ready and factious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WIT\">wit</a>, and a very singular turn of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a>. From some stories that are related of him, he seems to have borne some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of resemblance in his manner to the celebrated Dr Swift; but if he did not possess those very brilliant parts that distinguished the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAN\">Dean</a>, he probably was less subject to that capricious and those unaccountable whimsies which at times so greatly eclipsed the abilities of the latter. Yet there is one anecdote related of him, which, although it reflects <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> great honour on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>, as it seems to carry some degree of cruelty with it, yet it is a strong mark of his resemblance to the Dean, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> that his propensity for drollery and joke did not quit him even in his latest moments. The story is this: The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">Doctor</a> had an old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a>, who had lived with him some years, to whom he had bequeathed an old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a>, in which he told him he would find something that would make him drink after his death. The servant, full of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a> that his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>, under this familiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>, had left him somewhat that would be a reward for the assiduity of his past services, as soon as decency would permit, flew to the trunk; when, behold, to his great disappointment, the boasted legacy proved to be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERRING\">herring</a>. The doctor, however, bequeathed many legacies by will to pious uses; particularly 50 pounds towards the rebuilding of St Paul's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHEDRAL\">cathedral</a>, and 200 pounds to be distributed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> of the parishes of Cassington and Pyrton, near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-WATLINGTON\">Watlington</a>, of both which places he had been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VICAR\">vicar</a>. In his younger years he had an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a>; and wrote two plays, the latter of which may be seen in the tenth volume of Dodsley's Collection, viz. 1. Amorous war, a tragi-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMEDY\">comedy</a>. 2. The city-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATCH\">match</a>, a comedy. He published a poem upon the naval victory by the duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a> over the Dutch, printed in 1665. He also translated into English from the Greek, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of Lucian's Dialogues.\n\nMaynooth, or Manoath, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POST\">post</a> town in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KILDARE\">Kildare</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>, 12 miles from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUBLIN\">Dublin</a>. At this place there is a catholic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a>, established by\nMaynooth the Irish parliament in 1795. Young men destined for the catholic church had formerly gone to the continent for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>. This had now become nearly impossible, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the war with France and Spain; and for this reason, as well as to prevent those foreign attachments which grow out of a foreign education, it was thought prudent to provide the means of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> instruction for the catholics. They had only petitioned for leave to establish a seminary; but the parliament also granted 800l. per annum for its support, which was afterwards enlarged to 13,000l.; but has since been diminished. There were in 1808, eight professorships and three lectureships; and there was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a> for 200 students, to whom the establishment afforded commons and instruction.","sp":36,"ep":38},{"h":"MAYNWARING","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTHUR\">ARTHUR</a>, an eminent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> writer in the beginning of the 18th century, staid several years at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a>, and then went to Cheshire, where he lived some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> with his uncle Mr Francis Cholmondeley, a very honest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>, but extremely averse to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">King</a> William III., to whom he refused the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OATHS\">oaths</a>.

Upon the conclusion of the peace he went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, where he became acquainted with Mr Boileau. After his return he was made one of the commissioners of the customs, in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POST\">post</a> he distinguished himself by his skill and industry. He was a member of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-KIT_CAT_CLUB\"><a class=\"xr</a>ef\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KIT\">Kit</a>-cat club, and was looked upon as one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> supports of it by his pleasantry and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WIT\">wit</a>.

The same year he was elected physician of St Thomas's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">hospital</a>, and was also employed by the surgeons to read anatomical lectures in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HALL\">hall</a>, which obliged him to remove into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a>. In 1707 his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PADUAN\">Paduan</a> diploma for doctor of physic was confirmed by the university of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a>; and being patronized by Dr Radcliffe, on the death of that famous physician he succeeded him in his house at Bloomsbury-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>, and in the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his business. In 1727 he was made physician to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">King</a> George II. whom he had also served in that capacity while he was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a>; and he had afterwards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> of seeing his two sons-in-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, Dr Nichols and Dr Wilmot, his coadjutors in that eminent station.\n\nDr Mead was not more to be admired for the qualities of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> than he was to be loved for those of his heart. Though he was himself a hearty whig, yet, uninfluenced by party principles, he was a friend to all men of merit, by whatever denomination they might happen to be distinguished. Thus he was intimate with Garth, with Arbuthnot, and with Freind; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> kept up a constant correspondence with the great Boerhaave, who had been his fellow student at Leyden: they communicated to each other their observations and projects, and never loved each other the less for being of different sentiments. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time, intent as Dr Mead was on the duties of his profession, he had a greatness of mind that extended itself to all kinds of literature, which he spared neither pains nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> to promote. He caused the beautiful and splendid edition of Thuanus's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> to be published in 1713, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> volumes folio: and by his interposition and assiduity, Mr Sutton's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> foul <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> from ships and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> places was carried into execution, and all the ships in his majesty's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">navy</a> provided with this useful machine. Nothing pleased him more than to call hidden talents into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>; to give encouragement to the greatest projects; and to see them executed under his own eye. During almost half a century he was at the head of his business, which brought him one year about seven thousand pounds, and for several years between five and six thousand; yet clergymen, and in general all men of learning, were welcome to his advice. His library consisted of 10,000 volumes, of which his Latin, Greek, and oriental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUSCRIPTS\">manuscripts</a>, made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> inconsiderable part. He had a gallery for his pictures and antiquities, which cost him great sums. His reputation, not only as a physician, but as a scholar, was so universally established, that he corresponded with all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> literati in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>: even the king of Naples sent to desire a complete collection of his works; and in return made him a present of the two first volumes of Signior Bajardi, which may be considered as an introduction to the collection of the antiquities of Herculaneum. At the same time that prince invited him to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a>, that he might have an opportunity of showing him those valuable monuments of antiquity; and nothing but his great age prevented his undertaking a journey so suited to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>. No foreigner of learning ever came to London without being introduced to Dr Mead; and on these occasions his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> was always open, and the magnificence of princes was united with the pleasures of philosophers. It was principally to him that the several counties of England and our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a> abroad applied for the choice of their physicians, and he was likewise consulted by foreign physicians from Russia, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUSSIA\">Prussia</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DENMARK\">Denmark</a>, &c. He wrote, besides the above works, 1. A Treatise on the Scurvy. 2. De variolis et morbillis dissertatio. 3. Medica sacra: sive de Morbis insignioribus, quae in Bibliis commemorantur. Commentarius. 4. Monita et Praecepta medica. 5. A Discourse concerning pestilential contagion, and the methods to be used to prevent it.

This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> begins with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> stage, which is soon followed by a hot, with the ordinary symptoms of thirst, anorexia, anxiety, sickness, and vomiting; and these are more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> less considerable in different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>. Sometimes from the beginning the fever is sharp and violent; often, for the first two days, it is obscure and inconsiderable; but always becomes violent before the eruption, which commonly happens on the fourth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>. This eruptive fever, from the beginning of it, is always attended with hoarseness, a frequent hoarse dry cough, and often with some difficulty of breathing. At the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, the eyelids are somewhat swelled; the eyes are a little inflamed, and pour out tears; and with this there is a coryza, and frequent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SNEEZING\">sneezing</a>. For the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a>, a constant drowsiness attends the beginning of this disease. The eruption, as we have said, commonly appears upon the fourth day, first on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a>, and successively on the lower parts of the body. It appears first in small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>; but soon after, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of these appear in clusters, which do not arise in visible pimples, but, by the touch, are found to be a little prominent. This is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> on the face; but, in other parts of the body, the prominency, or roughness, is hardly to be perceived. On the face, the eruption retains its redness, or has it increased, for two days; but on the third, the vivid redness is changed to a brownish red; and in a day or two more the eruption disappears, while a mealy desquamation takes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>. During the whole time of the eruption, the face is somewhat turgid, but seldom considerably swelled. Sometimes, after the eruption has appeared, the fever ceases entirely; but this is seldom the case; and more commonly the fever continues or is increased after the eruption, and does not cease till after the desquamation. Even then the fever does not always cease, but continues with various <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> and effect. Though the fever happen to cease upon the eruption's taking place, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> for the cough to continue till after the desquamation, and sometimes much longer. In all cases, while the fever continues, the cough also continues, generally with an increase of the difficulty of breathing; and both of these symptoms sometimes arise to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> which denotes a pneumonic affection. This may happen at any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of the disease; but very often it does not come on till after the desquamation of the eruption.\n\nAfter the same period, also, a diarrhoea frequently comes on, and continues for some time.\n\nIt is common for measles, even when they have not been of a violent kind, to be followed by inflammatory affections, particularly ophthalmia and phthisis. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> blood be drawn from a vein in the measles, with circumstances necessary to favour the separation of the fibrine, this always appears separated, and lying on the surface of the crassamentum, as in inflammatory diseases. For the most part, the measles, even when violent, are without any putrid tendency; but in some cases, such a tendency appears both in the course of the disease, and especially after the ordinary course of it is finished.\n\nCauses. The measles are occasioned by a peculiar kind of contagion, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of which is not understood; and which, like that of the smallpox, affects a person only once in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>.\n\nPrognosis. From the description of this distemper already given, it appears that the measles are attended with a catarrhal affection, and with an inflammatory diathesis to a considerable degree; and therefore the danger of them is to be apprehended chiefly from the coming on of a pneumonic inflammation.\n\nCure. In measles, as well as in smallpox, the disease from its nature must necessarily run a determined course; and therefore the sole aim of a practitioner is to conduct this course in the easiest manner, by preventing and obviating urgent symptoms.\n\nFrom the consideration mentioned in the prognosis,\nit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be obvious, that the remedies especially necessary are those which may obviate and diminish the inflammatory diathesis; and therefore, in a particular manner, blood-letting. This remedy may be employed at any time in the course of the disease, or after the ordinary course of it is finished. It is to be employed more or less according to the urgency of the symptoms of fever, cough, and dyspnea; and generally may be employed very freely. But as the symptoms of pneumonic inflammation seldom come on during the eruptive fever, and as this is sometimes violent immediately before the eruption, though a sufficiently mild disease be to follow; bleeding is seldom very necessary during the eruptive fever, and may often be reserved for the times of greater danger which are perhaps to follow.\n\nIn all cases of measles, where there are marks of putrescence, and where there is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> reason, from the known nature of the epidemic, to apprehend putrescence, bleeding is the remedy most to be depended upon: but assistance may also be drawn from cooling purgatives; and from blistering on the sides or between the shoulders. The dry cough may be alleviated by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of demulcent pectorals, mucilaginous, oily, or sweet. It may, however, be observed, with respect to these demulcents, that they are not so powerful in involving and correcting the acrimony of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of blood as has been imagined; and that their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> operation is by lubricating the fauces, and thereby defending them from the irritation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a>, either arising from the lungs or distilling from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>. For moderating and quieting the cough in this disease, opiates certainly prove the most effectual means, whenever they can be safely employed. In the measles, in which an inflammatory state prevails in a considerable degree, opiates have indeed by some been supposed to be inadmissible: but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> abundantly demonstrates, that the objection made to their use is merely hypothetical: and even in cases where, from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> degree of pyrexia and of dyspnea, there is reason to fear the presence, or at least the danger, of pneumonic inflammation, opiates are highly useful, after bleeding, to obviate or abate the inflammatory state, has been duly employed: in such cases, while the cough and watchfulness are the urgent symptoms, opiates may be safely exhibited, and with great advantage. In all the exanthemata, there is an acrimony diffused over the system, which gives a considerable irritation; and for obviating the effects of this, opiates are useful, and always proper, when no particular contraindication prevails.\n\nWhen the desquamation of the measles is finished, though then there should be no disorder remaining, physicians have thought it necessary to purge the patient several times, with a view to draw off what have been called the dregs of this disease; that is, a portion of the morbid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> which is supposed to remain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> in the body. Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CULLEN\">Cullen</a> does not reject this supposition; but at the same time cannot believe that the remains of the morbid matter, diffused over the whole mass of blood, can be wholly drawn off by purging; and therefore thinks, that, to avoid the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the measles, it is not the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> off the morbid matter which we need to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a>, so much as to obviate and remove the inflammatory state of the system which had been induced by the disease. With this last view, indeed, purging may still be a proper remedy; but miliary bleeding, in proportion to the symptoms of inflammatory disposition, is still more so.\n\nFrom our late experience of the use of cold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> in the eruptive fever of the smallpox, some physicians have been of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> that the practice may be transferred to the measles; but this point has not yet been determined by sufficiently extensive experience. We are certain, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> may be very hurtful in the measles, as in most other inflammatory diseases; and therefore, that the body ought to be kept in a moderate temperature during the whole course of the disease: but how far, at any period of the disease, cold air may be applied with safety, is still uncertain. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">Analogy</a>, though so often the resource of physicians, is frequently fallacious; and further, though the analogy with the smallpox might <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> to the application of cold air during the eruptive fever of the measles, the analogy with catarrh seems to be against the practice.\n\nWhen the eruption is upon the skin, there are many instances of cold air making it disappear, and thereby producing much disorder in the system; and there are also frequent instances of these symptoms being removed by restoring the heat of the body, and thereby again bringing out the eruption.\n\nUpwards of 20 years ago, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INOCULATION\">inoculation</a> for the measles was proposed, and practised in several instances with success, by Dr Home of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>. His method of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> the infection was, by applying to an incision in each arm cotton moistened with the blood of a patient labouring under the measles; but with others who have made similar trials, the attempt has not yet succeeded. Attempts have been made to inoculate this disease by means of the fluid discharged under the form of tears, the squame falling from the surface and the like; but there is reason to believe, that where it was imagined the infection had thus been communicated, the contagion was only carried about the person inoculating and communicated in the ordinary way.\n\nFrom inoculation of the measles, it is imagined that several advantages may be obtained; and among others, it is thought the soreness of the eyes may be mitigated, the cough abated, and the fever rendered less severe.

This disease is said to have been unknown to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>, and that it appeared for the first time in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAXONY\">Saxony</a> about the middle of the last century. It is said to have since spread from thence into all the other countries of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>; and since the period mentioned, to have appeared in many countries in which it had never appeared before.\n\nFrom the time of its having been first taken notice of, it has been described and treated of by many different writers; and by all of them, till very lately, has been considered as a peculiar idiopathic disease. It is said to have been constantly attended with peculiar symptoms. It comes on with a cold stage, which is often considerable. The hot stage, which follows, is attended with great anxiety, and frequent sighing. The heat of the body becomes great, and soon produces profuse sweating, preceded, however, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of pricking, as of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PIN\">pin</a> points in the skin; and the sweat is of a peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> and disagreeable odour. The eruption appears sooner or later in different persons, but at no determined period of the disease. It seldom or never appears upon the face; but appears first upon the neck and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>, and from thence often spreads over the whole body.\n\nThe eruption named miliary, is said to be of two kinds; the one named the red, the other the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> miliary. The former, which in English is strictly named a rush, is commonly allowed to be a symptomatic affection; and as the latter is the only one that has any pretensions to be considered as an idiopathic disease, it is this only that we shall more particularly describe and treat of under this genus.\n\nWhat is then called the white miliary eruption, appears at first like the red, in very small red pimples, for the most part distinct, but sometimes clustered together. Their little prominence is better distinguished by the finger than by the eye. Soon after the appearance of this eruption, and, at least, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> day, a small vesicle is visible upon the top of the pimples. At first the vesicle is whey-coloured; but soon becomes white, and stands out like a little globule. In two or three days, these globules <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a>, or are rubbed off; and are succeeded by small crusts, which soon after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> off in small scales. While one set of pimples takes this course, another set arises to run the same; so that the disease often continues upon the skin for many days together. Sometimes when one crop of this eruption has disappeared, another, after some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a>, is produced. And it has been further observed, that in Miliaria, some persons there is such a disposition to this disease, that they have been affected with it several times in the course of their lives.\n\nThis disease is said to affect both sexes, and persons of all ages and constitutions; but it has been observed at all times to affect especially, and most frequently, lying-in women.\n\nIt is often accompanied with violent symptoms, and has frequently proved fatal. The symptoms, however, attending it are very various; but no symptom, or concourse of symptoms, are steadily the same in different persons, so as to give any specific character to the disease. When the disease is violent, the most common symptoms are phrenetic, comatose, and convulsive affections, which are also symptoms of all fevers treated by a very warm regimen.\n\nWhile there is such a variety of symptoms appearing in this disease, it is not to be expected that any one particular method of cure can be proposed; and, accordingly, we find in different writers different methods and remedies prescribed; frequent disputes about the most proper; and those received and recommended by some, opposed and deserted by others.\n\nIt appears, however, to Dr Cullen, very improbable, that this was really a new disease, when it was first considered as such. There are very clear traces of it in authors who wrote long before that period; and though there were not, we know that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> descriptions were often inaccurate and imperfect, particularly with respect to cutaneous affections; and we know also that those affections which commonly appeared as symptomatic only, were often neglected, or confounded together under a general appellation.\n\nThe antecedent symptoms of anxiety, sighing, and pricking of the skin, which have been spoken of as peculiar to this disease, are, however, common to many others; and perhaps to all those in which sweatings are forced out by a warm regimen. Of the symptoms said to be concomitant of this eruption, there are none which can be affirmed to be constant and peculiar but that of sweating. This, indeed, always precedes and accompanies the eruption: and, while the miliary eruption attends many different diseases, it never, however, appears in any of these but after sweating; and in persons labouring under the same diseases it does not appear, if in such persons sweating be avoided. It is therefore probable, that the eruption is the effect of sweating; and that it is the effect of a matter not before prevailing in the mass of blood, but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> under particular circumstances in the skin itself. That it depends upon particular circumstances of the skin, is also probable from its being observed that the eruption seldom or never appears upon the face, although it affects the whole of the body besides; and that it comes upon those places especially which are more closely covered; and that it can be brought out upon particular places by external applications.\n\nIt is to be observed, that this eruptive disease differs from the other exanthemata in many circumstances, especially the following; that it is not contagious, and therefore never epidemic; that the eruption appears at no determined period of the disease; that the eruption has no determined duration; that successive eruptions frequently appear in the course of the same fever.\nExanthematous fever, and that such eruptions frequently recur in the course of the same person's life. All this renders it very probable, that, in the miliary fever, the morbid matter is not a subsisting contagion communicated to the blood, and thence, in consequence of fever and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASSIMILATION\">assimilation</a>, thrown out upon the surface of the body, but a matter occasionally produced in the skin itself by sweating.\n\nThis conclusion is further rendered probable from hence, that, while the miliary eruption has no symptoms or concourse of symptoms peculiar to itself, it, upon occasions, accompanies almost every febrile disease, whether inflammatory or putrid, if these happen to be attended with sweating; and from thence it may be presumed, that the miliary eruption is a symptomatic affection only, produced in the manner we have said.\n\nBut as this symptomatic affection does not always accompany every instance of sweating, it may be proper to inquire, what are the circumstances which especially determine this eruption to appear? And to this Dr Cullen gives no full and proper answer. He cannot say that there is any one circumstance which in all cases gives occasion to this eruption; nor can he say what different causes, in different cases, may give occasion to it. There is only one observation that can be made to the purpose; and it is, that these persons, sweating under febrile diseases, are especially liable to the miliary eruption, who have been previously weakened by large evacuations, particularly of blood. This will explain why it happens to lying-in women more frequently than to any other persons; and to confirm this explanation, he has observed, that the eruption has happened to other women, though not in childbed, but who had been much subjected to a frequent and copious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-MENSTRUATION\">menstruation</a>, and to an almost constant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLUX\">flux</a> of blood. He has also observed it to have happened to men in fevers, after wounds from which they had suffered a great loss of blood.\n\nFurther, That this eruption is produced by a certain state of debility, is, he thinks, probable, from its so often attending fevers of the putrid kind, which are always accompanied with great debility. It is true, that it also sometimes attends inflammatory diseases, when it cannot be accounted for in the same manner; but he believes it may be observed, that it especially attends those inflammatory diseases in which the sweats have been long protracted, or frequently repeated, and which have thereby produced a debility, and perhaps a debilitating putrid diathesis.\n\nThat, however, the miliary eruption is not necessarily or even generally connected with a certain state of debility, is abundantly evident from its being entirely wanting in by much the greater number of instances of typhoid fever, and in a variety of other diseases where every possible degree of debility occurs: And that it is not connected with any certain state of debility, still farther appears, both from the condition of those affected with it in different instances, which in point of strength is very various; and likewise from the continuance of fresh eruptions with the same individual, although during that time in very different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> with respect to debility. It appears, therefore, much more probable, that it depends on some peculiar state of the surface, induced by the concurring influence of certain predisposing and occasional causes.\n\nIt appears so clearly that this eruption is always a symptomatic and factitious affection, that Dr Cullen is persuaded it may be, in most cases, prevented merely by avoiding sweats. Spontaneous sweatings, in the beginning of diseases, are very rarely critical; and all sweatings not evidently critical should be prevented, or at least moderated; and the promoting them, by increasing external heat, is commonly very pernicious. Even critical sweats should hardly be encouraged by such means. If, therefore, spontaneous sweats arise, they are to be checked by the coolness of the chamber; by the lightness and looseness of the bedclothes; by the persons laying out their arms and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>; and by their taking cold drink: and in this way Dr Cullen thinks he has frequently prevented miliary eruptions, which were otherwise likely to have appeared, particularly in puerperal women.\n\nBut it may happen, when these precautions have been neglected, or from other circumstances, that a miliary eruption does actually appear; and the question will then be put, how the case is to be treated? This is a question of consequence; as there is reason to believe that the matter here generated is often of a virulent kind; it is often the offspring of putrescence; and, when treated by increasing the external heat of the body, it seems to acquire a virulence which produces those symptoms mentioned above, and proves certainly fatal.\n\nIt has been an unhappy opinion with most physicians, that eruptive diseases were ready to be hurt by cold; and that it was therefore necessary to cover up the body very closely, and thereby increase the external heat. We now know that this is a mistaken opinion; that increasing the external heat of the body is very generally mischievous; and that several eruptions not only admit, but require the application of cold air. Dr Cullen is persuaded, therefore, that the practice which formerly prevailed in the case of miliary eruptions, of covering up the body closely, and both by external means and internal remedies encouraging the sweatings which accompany this eruption, was highly pernicious, and commonly fatal. He is therefore of opinion, that even when a miliary eruption has appeared, in all cases in which the sweating is not manifestly critical, we should employ all the means of stopping the sweating that are mentioned above; and he has sometimes had occasion to observe, that even the admission of cool air was safe and useful.\n\nThis is, in general, the treatment of miliary eruptions: but at the same time, the remedies suited to the primary disease are to be employed; and therefore when the eruption happens to accompany inflammatory affections, and the fulness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULSE\">pulse</a> or other symptoms show an inflammatory state present, the case is to be treated by blood-letting, purging, and other antiphlogistic remedies.\n\nOn the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, when the miliary eruption attends diseases in which debility and putrescence prevail, it will be proper to avoid all evacuations, and to employ tonic and antiseptic remedies, particularly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CINCHONA\">cinchona</a>, cold drink, and cold air.\n\nThe most distressing circumstance attending this affection, is the almost unsupportable sickness at stomach which frequently occurs, and which is often observed to proceed fresh eruptions taking place during\nGENUS XXXII.

Their loaves were sometimes baked under the ashes, and sometimes in an oven. They also used a sort of bread called \u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03c4\u03c5\u03c1\u03af\u03b1. Barley meal was used amongst the Greeks, which they called \u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03c4\u03c5\u03c1\u03af\u03b1. They had a frequent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISH\">dish</a> called \u1f00\u03c1\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2, which was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICE\">rice</a>, cheese, eggs, and honey, wrapped in fig leaves. The \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03ba\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 was made of cheese, garlic, and eggs, beaten and mixed together. Their bread, and other substitutes for bread, were baked in the form of hollow plates, into which they poured a sauce. Garlic, onions, and figs, seem to have been a very common food amongst the poorer Athenians. The Greeks, especially in the heroical times, ate flesh roasted; boiled meat seldom was used. Fish seems not to have been used for food in the early ages of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>. The young people only, amongst the Lacedemonians, ate animal food; the men and the old men were supported by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> soup called \u03c0\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03cc\u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1, which to people of other nations was always a disagreeable mess. Grasshoppers and the extremities or tender shoots of trees were frequently eaten by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> among the Greeks. Eels dressed with beet root were esteemed a delicate dish, and they were food of the jowl and belly of salt-fish. Neither were they without their sweet-meats; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESSERT\">dessert</a> consisted frequently of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>, almonds, nuts, figs, peaches, &c. In every kind of food we find salt to have been used.\n\nThe diet of the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> consisted wholly of milk, herbs, and roots, which they cultivated and dressed with their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>; they also had a kind of gruel, or coarse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> pap, composed of meal and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>; this served for bread: And when they began to use bread, they had none for a great while but of unmixed rye. Barley-meal was eaten by them, which they called polenta. When they began to eat animal food, it was esteemed a piece of luxury, and an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a> not to be justified but by some particu-\nMethod of Preserving Flesh-Meat without spices, and with very little salt. Jones, in his Miscellanea Curiosa, gives us the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of the Moorish Etcholle, which is made of beef, mutton, or camel's flesh, but chiefly beef, which is cut in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> slices, and laid for 24 hours in a pickle. They then remove it out of those jars or tubs into others with water; and when it has lain a night, they take it out, and put it on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROPES\">ropes</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> to dry. When it is thoroughly dried and hard, they cut it into pieces of two or three inches long, and throw it into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAN\">pan</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CALDRON\">caldron</a>, which is ready with boiling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> and suet sufficient to hold it, where it boils till it be very clear and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> when cut. After this they take it out, and set it to drain; and when all is thus done it stands to cool, and jars are prepared to put it up in, pouring upon it the liquor in which it was fried; and as soon as it is thoroughly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, they stop it up <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a>.

Tuathal Tetethomar, by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECREE\">decree</a> of the Tarah <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a>, separated certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> tracts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> from each of the four provinces, where the borders joined together; whence, under the notion of adopting this spot for demesne lands to support the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSEHOLD\">household</a>, he formed the county or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of Meath, which afterwards became the peculiar inheritance of the monarchs of Ireland. In each of the portions thus separated from the four provinces, Tuathal caused palaces to be erected, which might adorn them, and commemorate the name in which they had been added to the royal domain. In the tract taken out of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUNSTER\">Munster</a>, he built the palace called Flachtaga, where the sacred fire, so called, was kindled, and where all the priests and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRUIDS\">druids</a> annually met on the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> of October; on the evening of which day it was enacted, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> other fire should be used throughout the kingdom, in order that all the fires might be derived from this, which being lighted up as a fire of sacrifice, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a> led them to believe would render all the rest propitious and holy; and for this privilege every family was to pay threepence, by way of acknowledgment to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> of Munster. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> royal palace was erected in the proportion taken out of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONNAUGHT\">Connaught</a>, and was built for the assembly called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVOCATION\">convocation</a> of Visneach, at which all the inhabitants were summoned to appear on the 1st day of May, to offer sacrifice to Beal, or Bel, the god of fire, in whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> two large fires being kindled, the natives used to drive their cattle between them, which was supposed to be a preservative for them against accidents and distempers, and this was called Beal-Tinne, or Bel-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TINE\">Tine</a>, or the festival of the god of fire.

The third was that which Tailtean erected in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> taken from Ulster, where the fair of that name was held, which was remarkable for this particular circumstance, that the inhabitants brought their children thither, males and females, and contracted them in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a>, where the parents having agreed upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a>, the young people were joined accordingly; every couple contracted at this meeting paid the king of Ulster an ounce of silver by way of acknowledgment. The royal mansion of Tarah, formerly destroyed by fire, being rebuilt by Tuathal, on the lands originally belonging to the king of Leinster, was reckoned as the fourth of these palaces; but as a fabric of that name had stood there before, we do not find that any acknowledgment was made for it to the king of Leinster.\n\nMeath, with Clanmacnois, is a bishop's see, valued in the king's books at 373l. 7s. 0\u00bdd. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">sterling</a>, by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> returned anno 28th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a>; but, by a former extent taken anno 30th Henry VIII., the valuation amounts to 373l. 12s. being the largest and most profitable for the king, is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> at this day. This see is reputed to be worth annually 3400l. There were formerly many episcopal sees in Meath, as Clonard, Duleek, Kells, Trim, Ardbraccan, Donaghclun, Slaine, and Foure, besides others of less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a>; all these, except Duleek and Kells, were consolidated, and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> see was fixed at Clonard, before the year 1152; at which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> the divisions of the bishoprics in Ireland were made by John Paparo, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARDINAL\">cardinal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a>, entitled Cardinal of St Lawrence in Damaso, then legate from Pope Eugene III. to the Irish. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> was made in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYNOD\">synod</a> held on the 6th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABBEY\">abbey</a> of Melifont, or, as some say, at Kells; and the two sees of Duleek and Kells afterwards submitted to the same fate. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIOCESE\">diocese</a> is singular, hav-","sp":54,"ep":54},{"h":"MECCA","t":"an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> and very famous town of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARABIA\">Arabia</a> Felix; seated on a barren spot, in a valley surrounded with little hills, about a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>'s journey from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-RED_SEA\"><a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">Red</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>. It is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> strength, having neither walls nor gates; and the buildings are very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a>. That which supports it is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a> of a great many thousand pilgrims annually, for the shops are scarcely open all the year besides. The inhabitants are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>, very thin, lean, and swarthy. The hills about the town are very numerous; and consist of a blackish rock, some of them half a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> in circumference. On the top of one of them is a cave, where they pretend Mahomet usually retired to perform his devotions, and hither they affirm the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALCORAN\">Alcoran</a> was brought him by the angel Gabriel. The town has plenty of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, and yet little garden-stuff; but there are several sorts of good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> to be had, such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAPES\">grapes</a>, melons, water melons, and cucumbers. There are also plenty of sheep brought thither to be sold to the pilgrims. It stands in a very hot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>; and the inhabitants usually <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a> on the tops of their houses for the sake of coolness. In order to protect themselves from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> through the day, they carefully shut the windows, and water the streets to refresh the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>. There have been instances of persons suffocated in the middle of the town by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> called Simoon.\n\nAs a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of the people of distinction in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of Hedsjas stay in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, it is better built than any other in Arabia. Amongst the beautiful edifices it contains, the most remarkable is the famous Kaba <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Caaba, \"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of God,\" which was held in great veneration by the Arabs even before Mahomet's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>.\n\nNo Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DARES\">dares</a> go to Mecca; not that the approach to it is prohibited by any express <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, or that the sensible part of the Mahometans have any thing to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> to it; but on account of the prejudices of the people, who regarding this ground as sacred, think <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> unworthy of setting their foot on it; it would be profaned in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of the superstitious, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> it was trod upon by infidels. The people even believe, that Christians are prevented from approaching by some supernatural power; and they tell the story of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFIDEL\">infidel</a>, who having got so far as the hills that surround Mecca, all the dogs of the city came out and fell upon him; and who, being struck with this miracle, and the august appearance of the Kaba, immediately became a musulman. It is therefore to be presumed that all the Europeans who describe Mecca as eye-witnesses, have been renegades escaped from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TURKEY\">Turkey</a>. A recent example confirms this supposition. On the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> of being allowed to preserve his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, a French surgeon was prevailed on to accompany the Emir Hadsin to Mecca, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of physician; but at the very first station, he was forced to submit to circumcision, and then he was permitted to continue his journey.\n\nAlthough the Mahometans do not allow Europeans to go to Mecca, they do not refuse to give them descriptions of the Kaba, and information with regard to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>; and there are persons who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a> by making designs and little pictures of the Kaba; and selling them to pilgrims. See CAABA.\n\nThe Mahometans have so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> an opinion of the sanctity\nsanctity of Mecca, that they extend it to the places in the neighbourhood. The territory of that city is held sacred to certain distances, which are indicated by particular marks. Every caravan finds in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> a similar mark, which gives notice to the pilgrims when they are to put on the modest garb in which they must appear in those sacred regions. Every Mussulman is obliged to go once in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> at least to Mecca, to perform his devotions there. If that law was rigorously enforced, the concourse of pilgrims would be prodigious, and the city would never be able to contain the multitudes from all the countries where the Mahometan religion prevails. We must therefore, suppose, that devotees alone perform this duty, and that the others can easily dispense with it. Those whose circumstances do not permit a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> absence, have the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> of going to Mecca by a substitute. A hired pilgrim, however, cannot go for more than one person at a time; and he must, to prevent frauds, bring an attestation in proper form, from an imam of Mecca, that he has performed the requisite devotions on behalf of such a person, either alive or dead; for, after the decease of a person who has not obeyed the law during his life, he is still obliged to perform the journey by proxy.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CARAVANS\">caravans</a>, which are not numerous, when we consider the immense multitude of the faithful, are composed of many people who do not make the journey for purposes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a>. These are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a>, who think they can transport their merchandises with more safety, and dispose of them more easily; and contractors of every kind, who furnish the pilgrims and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> who escort the caravans, with necessaries. Thus it happens, that many people have gone often to Mecca, solely from views of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>. The most considerable of those caravans is that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYRIA\">Syria</a>, commanded by the pacha of Damascus. It joins at some distance the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>, which is conducted by a bey, who takes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of Emir Hadsji. One comes from Yemen, and another, less numerous, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> of Lachsa. Some scattered pilgrims arrive by the Red sea from the Indies, and from the Arabian establishments on the coasts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>. The Persians come in that which departs from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAGDAD\">Bagdad</a>; the place of conductor to this last is bestowed by the pacha, and is very lucrative, for he receives the ransoms of the heretical Persians.\n\nIt is of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> to a pilgrim to arrive early at the holy places. Without having been present from the beginning at all the ceremonies, and without having performed every particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of devotion, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> cannot acquire the title of Hadsji: this is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> very much coveted by the Turks, for it confers real advantages, and makes those who attain it to be much respected. Its infrequency, however, in the Mahometan dominions, shows how much the observation of the law commanding pilgrimages is neglected. A similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> prevails among the Oriental Christians, who are exceedingly emulous of the title of Hadsji, or Mokdasi, which is given to pilgrims of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNION\">communion</a>. In order to acquire this title, it is not sufficient that the person has made the journey to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a>; he must also have kept the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PASSOVER\">passover</a> in that city, and have assisted at all the ceremonies of the holy weeks.\n\nAfter all the essential ceremonies are over, the pilgrims next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> move to a place where they say <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABRAHAM\">Abraham</a> went to offer up his son <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a>, which is about two or three miles from Mecca: here they pitch their tents, and then throw <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> against a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> building. This, as they affirm, is performed in defiance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEVIL\">devil</a>. Every one then purchases a sheep, which is brought for that purpose, eating some of it themselves, and giving the rest to the poor people who attend upon that occasion. Indeed these are miserable objects, and such starved creatures, that they seem ready to devour each other. After all, one would imagine that this was a very sanctified place; and yet a renegade who went in pilgrimage thither, affirms there is as much debauchery practised here as in any part of the Turkish dominions. It is 25 miles from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JIDDA\">Jidda</a>, the sea port town of Mecca, and 220 south-east of Medima. E. Long. 40\u00b0 55'. N.

When a roller is used, however, a curve must always be drawn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to the spiral described according to the preceding method, the distance between it and the spiral being everywhere equal to the radius of the roller.\n\nIf it should be required to raise the roller with an accelerated or retarded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, we have only to divide the chord BC, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of retardation or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ACCELERATION\">acceleration</a> required, and the circle into the same number of equal parts as before.\n\n417. As it is frequently more convenient to raise or depress weights by the extremity of a constant radius, furnished with a roller, instead of wings fixed upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIPHERY\">periphery</a> of a wheel; we shall now proceed to determine the curve which must be given to the arm of the lever which is to be raised and depressed, in order that this elevation or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPRESSION\">depression</a> may be effected with an uniform motion.\n\nLet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">AB</a> be a lever, which it is required to raise uniformly through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> BC, into the position AC, by means of the arm or constant radius DE, moving upon D as a centre, in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> that the extremity E describes the arch Ec F. From the point C draw CH at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> to AB, and divide it into any number of equal parts, suppose three, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> 1, 2, 3; and through the points 1, 2, draw 1 a 2 b, parallel to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> line AB, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> the arch CB in the points a, b, through which draw a A, b A. Upon D as a centre, with the distance DE, describe the arch Ec F, and upon A as a centre, with the distance <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-AD\">AD</a>, describe the arch c O D, cutting the arch Ec F in the point e. Divide the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a> Ec F, and F s e, each into the same number of equal parts as the perpendicular c H, in the points k, i, s, m, and through these points about the centre A, describe the arches k z, i g, q r, m n. Make z x and set it from k to k, and take g f, and set it from i to h. Take r q also, and set it from s to t, and set n m from o to p, and d c from e to O. Then through the points E, I, h, O, and O, t, p, F, draw the two curves E l h O, and O t p F, which will be the proper form that must be given to the arm of the lever. If the handle DE moves from E towards F, the curve EO must be used, but if in the contrary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>, we must employ the curve OF.\n\nIt is evident, that when the extremity E of the handle DE, has run through the arch E k, or rather E l, the point l will be in k, and the point z in x, because z x is equal to k l, and the lever will have the position A b. For the same reason, when the extremity E of the handle has arrived at i, the point h will be in i, and the point g in f, and the lever will be raised to the position A a. Thus it appears, that the motion of the power and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> are always <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a>. When a roller is fixed at E, a curve parallel to EO, or OF, must be drawn as formerly. See Appendix to Ferguson's Lectures.\n\nCHAP. VI. On the First Movers of Machinery.\n\n418. The powers which are generally employed as the first movers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACHINES\">machines</a> are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEAM\">steam</a>, and animal exertion. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of employing water as an impelling power has already been given at great length in the article <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HYDRODYNAMICS\">HYDRODYNAMICS</a>. The application of wind to turn machinery will be discussed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> on Windmills; and what regards steam will be more properly introduced into the article <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEAM_ENGINE\">STEAM-ENGINE</a>. At present, therefore, we shall only make a few general remarks on the strength of men and horses; and conclude with a general view of the relative powers of the first movers of machinery. The following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> contains the weight which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> is able to raise through a certain height in a certain time, according to different authors.\n\n| Number of pounds raised | Height to which the weight is raised | Time in which it is raised | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">Duration</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">Work</a> | Names of the authors |\n|------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| 1000                   | 180                                | 60 minutes               | Euler               |\n| 60                     | 11                                 | 1 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>                 | Bernouilli          |\n| 25 French              | 220                                | 1.45 seconds             | Amontons            |\n| 175                    | 1                                  | 1 second                 | Coulomb             |\n| 1000                   | 330                                | half an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>             | Desagliers          |\n| 1000                   | 225                                | 60 minutes               | Smeaton             |\n| 30                     | 3\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)                  | 1 second                 | Emerson             |\n| 29 or 30               | 2.45 feet.                         | 1 second                 | Schulze             |\n\n(g) In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> we have taken the point B in a disadvantageous position, because the intersections are in this case more distinct.\nAccording to Amontons, a man weighing 133 pounds French, ascended 62 feet French by steps in 34 seconds, but was completely exhausted. The same author informs us that a sawer made 200 strokes of 18 inches French each, with a force of 25 pounds, in 145 seconds; but that he could not have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> the exertion above three minutes.\n\nIt appears from the observations of Desaguliers, that an ordinary man can, for the space of ten hours, turn a winch with a force of 30 pounds, and with a velocity of two feet and a half per second; and that two men working at a windlass with handles at right angles to each other, can raise 70 pounds more easily than one man can raise 30. The reason of this is, that when there is only one man, he exerts variable efforts at different positions of the handle, and therefore the motion of the windlass is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a>; whereas in the case of two men, with handles at right angles, the effect of the one man is greatest when the effect of the other is least, and therefore the motion of the machine is more uniform, and will perform more work. Desaguliers also found, that a man may exert a force of 80 pounds with a fly when the motion is pretty quick, and that by means of a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PUMP\">pump</a>, he may raise a hogshead of water 10 feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a>, and continue the exertion during a whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>.\n\nA variety of interesting experiments upon the force of men were made by the learned M. Coulomb. He found that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of a man who ascended stairs with nothing but his own weight, was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> that of a man loaded with 223 pounds avoirdupois, both of them continuing the exertion for a day. In this case the total or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> effect of the unloaded man is the greatest possible; but the useful effect which he produces is nothing. In the same way, if he were loaded to such a degree that he was almost incapable of moving, the useful effect would be nothing. Hence there is a certain load with which the man will produce the greatest useful effect. This load M. Coulomb found to be 173.8 pounds avoirdupois, upon the supposition that the man is to ascend stairs, and continue the exertion during a whole day. When thus loaded, the quantity of action exerted by the labourer is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to 183.66 pounds avoirdupois raised through 3282 feet. This method of working is however attended with a loss of three-fourths of the total action of the workman.\u2014It appears also from Coulomb's experiments, that a man going up stairs for a day raises 205 chilogrammes (a chilogramme is equal to three ounces five drams avoirdupois) to the height of a chilometre (a chilometre is equal to 39571 English inches); that a man carrying wood up stairs raises, together with his own weight, 100 chilogrammes to one chilometre;\u2014that a man weighing 150 pounds French, can ascend by stairs three feet French in a second, for the space of 15 or 20 seconds;\u2014that a man cultivating the ground, performs \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) as much labour as a man ascending stairs, and that his quantity of action is equal to 328 pounds avoirdupois raised through the space of 3282 feet;\u2014that a man with a winch does \\( \\frac{6}{7} \\) as much as by ascending stairs;\u2014and that in a pile-engine, a man by means of a rope drawn horizontally, raised for the space of five hours 55\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) pounds French through one foot French in a second.\u2014When men walk on a horizontal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a>, Coulomb found that the quantity of action was a maximum when they were loaded, and that this maximum quantity of action is to that which is exerted by a man loaded with 192.25 pounds avoirdupois as 7 to 4.\u2014The weight which a man ought to carry in order that the useful effect may be a maximum, is 165.3 pounds avoirdupois. When the workman, however, returns unloaded for a new burden, he must carry 200.7 pounds avoirdupois.\n\nAccording to Dr Robison a feeble old man raised <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> cubic feet of water=437.5 pounds avoirdupois, 11\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) feet high, in one minute, for eight or ten hours a day, by walking backwards and forwards on a lever;\u2014and a young man weighing 135 pounds, and carrying 30 pounds, raised 9\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) cubic feet of water =578.1 pounds avoirdupois, 11\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) feet high, for 10 hours a day, without being fatigued.\n\nFrom the experiments of Mr Buchanan, it appears that the forces exerted by a man pumping, acting at a winch, ringing and rowing, are as the numbers 1742, 2836, 3883, 4995.\n\nAccording to Desaguliers and Smeaton, the power of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> is equal to the power of five men. Several French authors suppose a horse equal to seven men, while M. Schulze considers one horse as equivalent to 14 men.\u2014Two horses, according to the experiment of Amontons, exerted a force of 150 pounds French, when yoked in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLOUGH\">plough</a>. According to Desaguliers, a horse is capable of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a>, with a force of 200 pounds, two miles and a half an hour, and of continuing this action eight hours in the day. When the force is 240 pounds he can work only six hours. It appears from Smeaton's reports, that by means of pumps a horse can raise 250 hogsheads of water, 10 feet high, in an hour.\u2014The most disadvantageous way of employing the power of a horse is to make him carry a load up an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-INCLINED_PLANE\">inclined <a cl</a>ass=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a>, for it was observed by De la Hire, that three men, with 100 pounds each, will go faster up the inclined plane than a horse with 300 pounds. When the horse walks on a good road, and is loaded with about two hundred weight, he may easily travel 25 miles in the space of seven or eight hours.\n\nWhen a horse is employed in raising coals by means of a wheel and axle, and moves at the rate of about two miles an hour, Mr Fenwick found that he could continue at work 12 hours each day, two and a half of which were spent in short intervals of rest, when he raised a load of 1000 pounds avoirdupois, with a velocity of 13 feet per minute;\u2014and that he will exert a force of 75 pounds for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> hours and a half, when moving with the same velocity. Mr Fenwick also found that 230 ale gallons of water delivered every minute on an overshot water-wheel, 10 feet in diameter; that a common steam-engine, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a> eight inches in diameter, and an improved engine with a cylinder 6.12 inches in diameter, will do the work of one horse, that is, will raise a weight of 1000 pounds avoirdupois, through the height of 13 feet in a minute. It appears from Mr Smeaton's experiments, that Dutch sails in their common position with a radius of 9 feet and a half, \u2014that Dutch sails in their best position with a radius of eight feet, and that his enlarged sails with a radius of seven feet, perform the same work as one man; or per-\n### Table showing the relative strength of Overshot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHEELS\">Wheels</a>, Steam Engines, Horses, Men, and Wind-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MILLS\">mills</a> of different kinds.\n\n| Number of ale gallons delivered on an overshot wheel, 10 feet in diameter, every minute. | Diameter of the cylinder in the common steam-engine, in inches. | Diameter of the cylinder of the improved steam-engine, in inches. | Number of horses working 12 hours per day, and moving at the rate of two miles per hour. | Number of men working 12 hours a-day. | Radius of Dutch sails in their common position, in feet. | Radius of Dutch sails in their best position, in feet. | Radius of Mr Smeaton's enlarged sails, in feet. | Height to which these different powers will raise 1000 pounds avoirdupois in a minute. |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 230 | 8 | 6.12 | 1 | 5 | 21.24 | 17.89 | 15.65 | 13 |\n| 390 | 9.5 | 7.8 | 2 | 10 | 30.04 | 25.30 | 22.13 | 26 |\n| 528 | 10.5 | 8.2 | 3 | 15 | 36.80 | 30.98 | 27.11 | 39 |\n| 660 | 11.5 | 8.8 | 4 | 20 | 42.48 | 35.78 | 31.30 | 52 |\n| 790 | 12.5 | 9.35 | 5 | 25 | 47.50 | 40.00 | 35.00 | 65 |\n| 970 | 14 | 10.55 | 6 | 30 | 52.03 | 43.82 | 38.34 | 78 |\n| 1170 | 15.4 | 11.75 | 7 | 35 | 56.90 | 47.33 | 41.41 | 90 |\n| 1350 | 16.8 | 12.8 | 8 | 40 | 60.09 | 50.60 | 44.27 | 104 |\n| 1445 | 17.3 | 13.6 | 9 | 45 | 63.73 | 53.66 | 46.96 | 117 |\n| 1584 | 18.5 | 14.2 | 10 | 50 | 67.17 | 56.57 | 49.50 | 130 |\n| 1740 | 19.4 | 14.8 | 11 | 55 | 70.46 | 59.33 | 51.91 | 143 |\n| 1900 | 20.2 | 15.2 | 12 | 60 | 73.59 | 61.97 | 54.22 | 156 |\n| 2100 | 21 | 16.2 | 13 | 65 | 76.59 | 64.5 | 56.43 | 169 |\n| 2300 | 22 | 17 | 14 | 70 | 79.49 | 66.94 | 58.57 | 182 |\n| 2500 | 23.1 | 17.8 | 15 | 75 | 82.27 | 69.28 | 60.62 | 195 |\n| 2686 | 23.9 | 18.3 | 16 | 80 | 84.97 | 71.55 | 62.61 | 208 |\n| 2870 | 24.7 | 19 | 17 | 85 | 87.07 | 73.32 | 64.16 | 221 |\n| 3055 | 25.5 | 19.6 | 18 | 90 | 90.13 | 75.90 | 67.41 | 234 |\n| 3240 | 26.25 | 20.1 | 19 | 95 | 92.00 | 77.98 | 68.23 | 247 |\n| 3420 | 27 | 20.7 | 20 | 100 | 95.00 | 80.00 | 70.00 | 260 |\n| 3750 | 28.5 | 22.2 | 22 | 110 | 99.64 | 83.90 | 73.42 | 286 |\n| 4000 | 29.8 | 23 | 24 | 120 | 104.06 | 87.63 | 76.68 | 312 |\n| 4460 | 31.7 | 23.9 | 26 | 130 | 108.32 | 91.22 | 79.81 | 338 |\n| 4850 | 32.4 | 24.7 | 28 | 140 | 112.20 | 94.66 | 82.82 | 364 |\n| 5250 | 33.6 | 25.5 | 30 | 150 | 116.35 | 97.98 | 85.73 | 390 |\n\n426. Dutch sails are always constructed so that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> may diminish from the centre to the extremity of the sail. They are concave to the wind, and are in their common position when their extremities are parallel to the plane in which they move, or perpendicular to the direction of the wind. Dutch sails are in their best position when their extremities make an angle of seven degrees with the plane of their motion. Mr Smeaton's enlarged sails are Dutch sails in their best position, but enlarged at their extremities.\n\n427. It appears from M. Coulomb's experiments on Dutch wind-mills, with rectangular sails, that when the distance between the extremities of two opposite sails is 66 feet French, and the breadth of each sail six feet, a wind moving at the rate of 20 feet per second will produce an effect equivalent to 1000 pounds raised through the space of 218 feet in a minute.\n\nAccording to Watt and Boulton, one of their steam engines, with a cylinder 31 inches in diameter, and which makes 17 double strokes per minute, is equivalent to 40 horses working day and night; that is, to 101 horses working nine hours and a half, the time of constant exertion in the preceding table. When the cylinder is 19 inches in diameter, and the engine makes 25 strokes of four feet each per minute, its power is equivalent to twelve horses working constantly, or thirty horses working nine hours and a half\u2014and when the cylinder is 24 inches in diameter, and the engine makes 22 strokes, of five feet each, in a minute, its power is equal to that of 20 horses working constantly, or 50 horses working nine hours and a half.\n\n**CHAP. VII. On the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">Construction</a> of Wind-mills.**\n\n428. A wind-mill is represented in fig. 1, where MN is the circular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> that contains the machinery, E the extremity of the windshaft, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> axis, which is generally inclined from 8 to 15 degrees to the horizon; and EA, EB, EC, ED four rectangular frames upon which sails of cloth of the same form are stretched. At the lower extremity G of the sails their surface is inclined to the axis 72\u00b0; and at their farthest extremities A, D, &c. the inclination of the sail is about 83\u00b0. Now, when the sails are adjusted to the wind, which happens when the wind blows in the direction of the windshaft E, the impulse of the wind...\nMechanics.\n\nPractical forces, one of which acts at right angles to the windshaft, and is therefore employed solely in giving a motion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROTATION\">rotation</a> to the sails and the axis upon which they are fixed. When the mill is used for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRINDING\">grinding</a> corn, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> wheel, fixed to the principal axis E, gives motion to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANTERN\">lantern</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUNDLE\">trundle</a>, whose axis carries the moveable millstone.\n\nMethods of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> the sails to the wind:\n\n429. That the wind may act with the greatest efficacy upon the sails, the windshaft must have the same direction as the wind. But as this direction is perpetually changing, some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> is necessary for bringing the windshaft and sails into their proper position. This is sometimes effected by supporting the machinery on a strong vertical axis, whose pivot moves in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a> socket firmly fixed into the ground, so that the whole machine, by means of a lever, may be made to revolve upon this axis, and be properly adjusted to the direction of the wind. Most wind-mills, however, are furnished with a moveable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a> which revolves upon friction rollers inserted in the fixed kerb of the mill; and the adjustment is effected by the assistance of a simple lever. As both these methods of adjustment require the assistance of men, it would be very desirable that the same effect should be produced solely by the action of the wind. This may be done by fixing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> wooden vane or weather-cock at the extremity of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> horizontal arm which lies in the same vertical plane with the windshaft. By this means when the surface of the vane, and its distance from the centre of motion, are sufficiently great, a very gentle breeze will exert a sufficient force upon the vane to turn the machinery, and will always bring the sails and windshaft to their proper position. This weather-cock, it is evident, may be applied either to machines which have a moveable roof, or which revolve upon a vertical arbor.\n\nOn the Form and Position of Wind-mill Sails.\n\n430. It appears from the investigations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">Parent</a>, that a maximum effect will be produced when the sails are inclined $54\\frac{1}{2}$ degrees to the axis of rotation; or when the angle of weather is $35\\frac{1}{2}$ (g) degrees. In obtaining this conclusion, however, M. Parent has assumed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATA\">data</a> which are inadmissible, and has neglected several circumstances which must materially affect the result of his investigations. The angle of inclination assigned by Parent is certainly the most efficacious for giving motion to the sails from a state of rest, and for preventing them from stopping when in motion; but he has not considered that the action of the wind upon a sail at rest is different from its action upon a sail in motion; for since the extremities of the sails move with greater rapidity than the parts nearer the centre, the angle of weather should be greater towards the centre than at the extremity, and should vary with the velocity of each part of the sail. The reason of this is very obvious. It has been demonstrated by Bossut, and established by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, that when any fluid acts upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> surface, the force of impulsion is always exerted most advantageously when the impelled surface is in a state of rest, and that this force diminishes as the velocity of the surface increases. Now, let us suppose with Parent, that the most advantageous angle of weather for the sails of wind-mills is $35\\frac{1}{2}$ degrees for that part of the sail which is nearest the centre of rotation, and that the sail has everywhere this angle of weather; then, since the extremity of the sail moves with the greatest velocity, it will in a manner withdraw itself from the action of the wind, or, to speak more properly, it will not receive the impulse of the wind so advantageously as those parts of the sail which have a less degree of velocity. In order therefore to counteract this diminution of force, we must make the wind act more perpendicularly upon the sail, by diminishing its obliquity or its angle of weather. But since the velocity of every part of the sail is proportional to its distance from the centre of motion, every elementary portion of it must have a different angle of weather diminishing from the centre to the extremity of the sail. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a> or rate of diminution, however, is still to be discovered, and we are fortunately in possession of a theorem of Euler's, afterwards given by Maclaurin, which determines this law of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a>. Let $a$ represent the Euler's velocity of the wind, and $c$ the velocity of any given part of the sail; then the effort of the wind upon that part of the sail will be greatest when the tangent of the angle of the wind's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INCIDENCE\">incidence</a>, or of the sail's inclination to the axis, is to radius, as $\\sqrt{2 + \\frac{9}{4}c + \\frac{3}{2}c^2} = 1$.\n\n431. In order to apply this theorem, let us suppose that the radius or whip ED of the sail $a$ is divided in six equal parts; that the point $n$ is equidistant from E and D, and is the point of the sail which has the same velocity as the wind; then, in the preceding theorem, we shall have $c = a$, when the sail is loaded to a maximum; and therefore the tangent of the angle, which the surface of the sail at $n$ makes with the axis, when $a = 1$, will be $\\sqrt{2 + \\frac{9}{4} + \\frac{3}{2}} = 3.561 = \\text{tangent of } 74^\\circ 19'$, which gives $15^\\circ 41'$ for the angle of weather at the point $n$. Since, at $\\frac{1}{2}$ of the radius $c = a$, and since $c$ is proportional to the distance of the corresponding part of the sail from the centre, we will have, at $\\frac{1}{2}$ of the radius $s m$, $c = \\frac{a}{3}$, at $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the radius, $c = \\frac{2a}{3}$; at $\\frac{1}{4}$, $c = \\frac{4a}{3}$; at $\\frac{1}{5}$, $c = \\frac{5a}{3}$; and at the extremity of the radius, $c = 2a$. By substituting these different values of $c$, instead of $c$ in the theorem, and by making $a = 1$, the following table will be obtained, which exhibits the angles of inclination and weather which must be given to different parts of the sails.\n\n(g) The weather of the sails is the angle which the surface forms with the plane in which they move, and is equal to the complement of the angle which that surface forms with the axis.\nMr Smeaton found, from a variety of experiments, that the common practice of inclining plane sails from 72\u00b0 to 75\u00b0 to the axis, was much more efficacious than the angle assigned by Parent, the effect being as 45 to 31. When the sails were weathered in the Dutch manner, that is, when their surfaces were concave to the wind, and when the angle of inclination increased towards their extremities, they produced a greater effect than when they were weathered either in the common way, or according to Euler's theorem. But when the sails were enlarged at their extremities, as represented at \\( \\alpha \\beta \\) in fig. 2, so that \\( \\alpha \\beta \\) was one-third of the radius ED, and \\( \\alpha D \\) to \\( D \\beta \\) as 5 to 3, their power was greatest of all, though the surface acted upon by the wind remained the same. If the sails be farther enlarged, the effect is not increased in proportion to the surface; and besides, when the quantity of cloth is great, the machine is much exposed to injury by sudden squalls of wind. In Mr Smeaton's experiments, the angle of weather varied with the distance from the axis; and it appeared from several trials, that the most efficacious angles were those in the following table.\n\n| Parts of the radius | Angle with the axis | Angle of weather |\n|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------|\n| 1                   | 72                 | 18              |\n| 2                   | 71                 | 19              |\n| 3                   | 72                 | 18 middle       |\n| 4                   | 74                 | 16              |\n| 5                   | 77\u00bd                | 12\u00bd             |\n| 6                   | 83                 | 7               |\n\nIf the radius ED of the sail be 30 feet, then the sail will commence at \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) ED, or 5 feet from the axis, where the angle of inclination will be 72\u00b0. At \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) ED, or 10 feet from the axis, the angle will be 71\u00b0, and so on.\n\nOn the Effect of Wind-mill Sails.\n\nThe following maxims deduced by Mr Smeaton from his experiments, contain the most accurate information upon this subject.\n\nMaxim 1. The velocity of wind-mill sails, whether unloaded or loaded, so as to produce a maximum effect, is nearly as the velocity of the wind, their shape and position being the same.\n\nMaxim 2. The load at the maximum is nearly, but somewhat less than, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> of the velocity of the wind, the shape and position of the sails being the same.\n\nMaxim 3. The effects of the same sails at a maximum, are nearly, but somewhat less than, as the cubes of the velocity of the wind.\n\nMaxim 4. The load of the same sails at the maximum is nearly as the squares, and their effects as the cubes of their number of turns in a given time.\n\nMaxim 5. When sails are loaded, so as to produce a maximum at a given velocity, and the velocity of the wind increases, the load continuing the same: 1stly, The increase of effect, when the increase of the velocity of the wind is small, will be nearly as the squares of those velocities; 2dly, When the velocity of the wind is double, the effects will be nearly as 10 : 27\u00bd; But, 3dly, When the velocities compared are more than double of that where the given load produces a maximum, the effects increase nearly in the simple ratio of the velocity of the wind.\n\nMaxim 6. In sails where the figure and positions are similar, and the velocity of the wind the same, the number of turns in a given time will be reciprocally as the radius or length of the sail.\n\nMaxim 7. The load at a maximum that sails of a similar figure and position will overcome at a given distance from the centre of motion, will be as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUBE\">cube</a> of the radius.\n\nMaxim 8. The effects of sails of similar figure and position are as the square of the radius.\n\nMaxim 9. The velocity of the extremities of Dutch sails, as well as of the enlarged sails, in all their usual positions when unloaded, or even loaded to a maximum, are considerably quicker than the velocity of the wind.\n\nA new mode of constructing the sails of windmills has been recently given by Mr Sutton, and fully described by Mr Heselden of Barton, in a work exclusively devoted to the subject.\n\nThe limits of this article will not permit us to enter into any discussion respecting the principles upon which Mr Sutton's gravitated sails are constructed; but the subject shall be resumed under the article Windmill. It may be proper however to remark that Mr Sutton gives his sails the form represented in fig. 4, and makes the angle of weather at the point M, equidistant from A and B, equal to 22\u00b0 30\u2032. The inclination of the sail at any other point N of the sail, is an angle whose sine is the distance of that point from the centre of motion A, the radius being the breadth of the sail at that point. Fig. 3 shows the angles at the different points of the sail; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> and absolute breadth of the sail at these points. Mr Sutton's mode of regulating the velocity of the sails, and of bringing them to a state of rest, is particularly ingenious.\n435. Various opinions have been entertained respecting the relative advantages of horizontal and vertical wind-mills. Mr Smeaton, with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, gives a decided preference to the latter; but when he asserts that horizontal wind-mills have only \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) or \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of the power of vertical ones, he certainly forms too low an estimate of their power. Mr Beaton, on the contrary, who has received a patent for the construction of a new horizontal wind-mill, seems to be prejudiced in their favour, and greatly exaggerates their comparative value. From an impartial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>, it will probably appear, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> lies between these two opposite opinions; but before entering on this discussion, we must first consider the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> and form of horizontal wind-mills.\n\n436. In fig. 4, CK is the windshaft, which moves upon pivots. Four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> bars, CA, CD, IB, FG, are fixed to this arbor, which carry the frames APIB, DEFG. The sails AI, EG, are stretched upon these frames, and are carried round the axis CK, by the perpendicular impulse of the wind. Upon the axis CK, a toothed wheel is fixed, which gives motion to the particular machinery that is employed. In the figure, only two sails are represented; but there are always other two placed at right angles to these. Now, let the sails be exposed to the wind, and it will be evident that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> motion will ensue; for the force of the wind upon the sail AI, is counteracted by an equal and opposite force upon the sail EG. In order then, that the wind may communicate motion to the machine, the force upon the returning sail EG must either be removed by screening it from the wind, or diminished by making it present a less surface when returning against the wind.\n\nThe first of these methods is adopted in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TARTARY\">Tartary</a>, and in some provinces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>; but is objected to by Mr Beaton, from the inconvenience and expense of the machinery and attendance requisite for turning the screens into their proper positions. Notwithstanding this objection, however, I am disposed to think that this is the best method of diminishing the action of the wind upon the returning sails, for the moveable screen may easily be made to follow the direction of the wind, and assume its proper position, by means of a large wooden weathercock, without the aid either of men or machinery. It is true, indeed, that the resistance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> in the returning sails is not completely removed; but it is at least as much diminished as it can be by any method hitherto proposed. Besides, when this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> is resorted to, there is no occasion for any moveable flaps and hinges, which must add greatly to the expense of every other method.\n\n437. The mode of bringing the sails back against the wind, which Mr Beaton invented, is perhaps, the simplest and best of the kind. He makes each sail AI to consist of six or eight flaps or vanes, AP b 1, b 1 c 2, &c., moving upon hinges represented by the dark <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a>, AP, b 1, c 2, &c., so that the lower side b 1 of the first flap overlaps the hinge or higher side of the second flap, and so on. When the wind, therefore, acts upon the sail AI, each flap will press upon the hinge of the one immediately below it, and the whole surface of the sail will be exposed to its action. But when the sail AI returns against the wind, the flaps will revolve round upon their hinges, and present only their edges to the wind, as is represented at EG, so that the resistance occasioned by the return of the sail must be greatly diminished, and the motion will be continued by the great superiority of force exerted upon the sails in the position AI. In computing the force of the wind upon the sail AI, and the resistance opposed to it by the edges of the flaps in EG, Mr Beaton finds, that when the pressure upon the former is 1872 pounds, the resistance opposed by the latter is only about 36 pounds, or \\( \\frac{1}{52} \\) part of the whole force; but he neglects the action of the wind upon the arms CA, &c. and the frames which carry the sails, because they expose the same surface in the position AI, as in the position EG. This omission, however, has a tendency to mislead us in the present case, as we shall now see, for we ought to compare the whole force exerted upon the arms, as well as the sail, with the whole resistance which these arms and the edges of the flaps oppose to the motion of the windmill. By inspecting fig. 4, it will appear, that if the force upon the edges of the flaps, which Mr Beaton supposed to be 12 in number, amounts to 36 pounds, the force spent upon the bars CD, DG, GF, FE, &c. cannot be less than 60 pounds. Now, since these bars are acted upon with an equal force, when the sails have the position AI, 1872 + 60 = 1932 will be the force exerted upon the sail AI, and its appendages, while the opposite force upon the bars and edges of the flaps when returning against the wind will be 36 + 60 = 96 pounds, which is nearly \\( \\frac{1}{20} \\) of 1932, instead of \\( \\frac{1}{52} \\) as computed by Mr Beaton. Hence we may see the probable advantages of a screen over moveable flaps, as it will preserve not only the sails, but the arms and the frame which support it, from the action of the wind.\n\n438. We shall now conclude this chapter with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of the power of horizontal and vertical wind-mills. It was already stated, that Mr Smeaton rather underrated the former, while he maintained that they have only \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) or \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) the power of the latter. He observes, that when the vanes of a horizontal and a vertical mill are of the same dimensions, the power of the latter is four times that of the former, because, in the first case, only one sail is acted upon at once, while, in the second case, all the four receive the impulse of the wind. This, however, is not strictly true, since the vertical sails are all oblique to the direction of the wind. Let us suppose that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a> of each sail is 100 square feet; then the power of the horizontal sail will be 100, and the power of a vertical sail may be called \\( 100 \\times \\sin 70^\\circ \\) (70\u00b0 being the common angle of inclination) = 88 nearly; but since there are four vertical sails, the power of them all will be \\( 4 \\times 88 = 352 \\); so that the power of the horizontal sail is to that of the four vertical ones as 1 to 3.52, and not as 1 to 4, according to Mr Smeaton. But Mr Smeaton also observes, that if we consider the farther disadvantage which arises from the difficulty of getting the sails back against the wind, we need not wonder if horizontal wind-mills have only about \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) or \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) the power of the common sort. We have already seen, that the resistance occasioned by the return of the sails amounts to \\( \\frac{1}{20} \\) of the whole force which they receive; by subtracting \\( \\frac{1}{20} \\), therefore, from \\( \\frac{1}{3.52} \\), we shall find that\nthe power of horizontal wind-mills is only $\\frac{1}{4}$, or little more than $\\frac{1}{2}$ that of vertical ones. This calculation proceeds upon a supposition, that the whole force exerted upon vertical sails is employed in turning them round the axis of motion; whereas a considerable part of this force is lost in pressing the pivot of the axis or windshaft against its gudgeon. Mr Smeaton has overlooked this circumstance, otherwise he could never have maintained that the power of four vertical sails was quadruple the power of one horizontal sail, the dimensions of each being the same. Taking this circumstance into the account, we cannot be far wrong in saying, that in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> at least, if not in practice, the power of a horizontal wind-mill is about $\\frac{1}{4}$ or $\\frac{1}{2}$ of the power of a vertical one, when the quantity of surface and the form of the sails is the same, and when every part of the horizontal sails has the same distance from the axis of motion as the corresponding parts of the vertical sails. But if the horizontal sails have the position AI, EG, in fig. 4. instead of the position CA dm, CD o n, their power will be greatly increased, though the quantity of surface is the same, because the part CP 3 m being transferred to BI 3 d, has much more power to turn the sails.\n\n**Chap. VIII. On the Construction of Wheel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARRIAGES\">Carriages</a>.**\n\nIt is evident from Art. 60. that when a wheel carriage surmounts an obstacle, it acts as a lever of the first kind, and that its power to overcome such resistances increases with its diameter. The power of the force P, for example, to raise the wheel NB over the eminence C, is proportional to the vertical lever FC, which increases with the diameter of the wheel, while the lever of resistance FA, by which the weight of the wheel acts, remains unchanged; hence we see the advantages of large wheels for overcoming such obstacles as generally resist the motion of wheel carriages. There are some circumstances, however, which, independent of the additional weight and expense of large wheels, prescribe limits to their size. If the radius AC of the wheel exceeds the height of that part of the horse to which the traces are attached, the line of traction DA will be oblique to the horizon, and part of the power P will be employed in pressing the wheel upon the ground. A wheel exceeding four and a half feet radius, which is the general distance from the ground of that part of the horse to which the traces are attached, has still the advantage of a smaller wheel; but when we consider that the traces or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-POLES\">poles</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CART\">cart</a> will, in this case, rub against the flanks of the horses, so that the power of the wheel is diminished by the increase of its weight, we shall be convinced that no power is gained by making the radius of the wheels greater than four and a half feet. Even this size is too great, as shall be afterwards shown, when we treat of the line of traction, so that we may safely assert, that the diameter of wheels should never be greater than six feet. The fore wheels of our carriages are still unaccountably small, and it is not uncommon to see carts moving upon wheels scarcely 14 inches in diameter. The convenience of turning is urged as the reason for diminishing the fore wheels of carriages; and the facility of loading the cart is considered as a sufficient reason for using wheels so small as 14 inches. The first of these advantages, however, may be obtained by going to the end of a street, or to a proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> for turning the carriage; and a few additional turns of a windlass will be sufficient to convey the heaviest loads into carts mounted on high wheels.\n\nThe next thing to be determined is the shape of the wheels. Now it is certainly a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of surprise how the unnatural shape which is at present given to them could ever have been brought into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>. A cylindrical wheel, with the spokes perpendicular to the naves, is undoubtedly the form which every mechanic would give to his wheels, before he had heard of the pretended advantages of concave or dishing wheels, or those which have inclined spokes and conical rims. It has been alleged, indeed, that the form represented in fig. 5, when A r, B s is the conical rim, and o A, p B the inclined spokes, renders the wheel stronger than it would otherwise be; that by extending the base of the carriage it prevents it from being overturned; that it hinders the felloes from rubbing against the load or the sides of the cart; and that when one wheel falls into a rut, and therefore supports more than one half of the load, the spokes are brought into a vertical position, which renders them more capable of sustaining the additional weight. Now it is evident that the second of these advantages is very trifling, and may be obtained, when required, by interposing a piece of board between the wheel and the load.\n\nThe other two advantages exist only in very bad <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a>; and if they are necessary, which we much question, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> like this, where the roads are so excellently made, and so regularly repaired, they can easily be procured, by making the axle-tree a few inches longer, and increasing the strength of the spokes. But it is allowed on all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> that perpendicular spokes are preferable on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> ground. The inclination of the spokes, therefore, which renders concave wheels advantageous in rugged and unequal roads, renders them disadvantageous when the roads are in good order; and where the good roads are more numerous than the bad ones, as they certainly are in this country, the disadvantages of concave wheels must overbalance their advantages. It is true indeed that in concave wheels, the spokes are in their strongest position, when they are exposed to the severest strains, that is, when one wheel is in a deep rut, and sustains more than one half of the load: but it is equally true that on level ground, where the spokes are in their weakest position, a less severe strain, by continuing for a much longer time, may be equally if not more detrimental to the wheel.\n\nUpon these observations we might rest the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> which we have been maintaining, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> for its truth to the judgment of every intelligent and unbiased mind; but we shall go a step farther, and endeavour to show that concave dishing wheels are more expensive, more injurious to the roads, more liable to be broken by accidents, and less durable in general, than those wheels in which the spokes are perpendicular to the naves. By inspecting fig. 5, it will appear that the whole of the pressure which the wheel AB sustains is exerted along the inclined spoke p s, and therefore acts obliquely upon the level ground n D, whether the rims are conical or cylindrical. This oblique action must necessarily\nMechanics necessarily injure the roads, by loosening the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> more between B and D than between B and n, and if the load were sufficiently great, the stones would start up between s and D. The texture of the roads, indeed, is sufficiently firm to prevent this from taking place; but in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the oblique pressure, the stones between s and D will at least be loosened, and by admitting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> the whole of the road will be materially damaged. But when the spokes are perpendicular to the nave as pn, and when the rims mA, nB are cylindrical, or parallel to the ground, the weight sustained by the wheel will act perpendicularly upon the road; and however much that weight is increased, its action can have no tendency to derange the materials of which it is composed, but is rather calculated to consolidate them, and render the road more firm and durable.\n\n442. It was observed that concave wheels are more expensive than plane ones. This additional expense arises from the greater quantity of wood and workmanship which the former require; for in order that dishing wheels may be of the same perpendicular height as plane ones, the spokes of the former must exceed in length those of the latter, as much as the hypotenuse oA of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a> oAn exceeds the side om; and therefore the weight and the resistance of such wheels must be proportionably great. The inclined spokes, too, cannot be formed nor inserted with such facility as perpendicular ones. The extremity of the spoke which is fixed into the nave is inserted at right angles to it, in the direction o p, and if the rims are cylindrical, the other spoke should be inserted in a similar manner; while the intermediate portion has an inclined position. There are therefore two flexures or bendings in the spokes of concave wheels, which requires them to be formed out of a larger piece of wood than if they had no such flexures, and renders them liable to be broken by any sudden strain at the points of flexure.\n\n443. We shall now dismiss the subject of concave wheels with one observation more, and we beg the reader's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to it, because it appears to be decisive of the question. The obstacles which carriages have to encounter, are almost never spherical protuberances that permit the elevated wheel to resume by degrees its horizontal position. They are generally of such a nature, that the wheel is instantaneously precipitated from their top to the level ground. Now the momentum with which the wheel strikes the ground is very great, arising from a successive accumulation of force. The velocity of the elevated wheel is considerable when it reaches the top of the eminence, and while it is tumbling into the level ground, it is receiving gradually that proportion of the load which was transferred to the other wheel, till having recovered the whole, it impinges against the ground with great velocity and force. But in concave wheels the spoke which then strikes the ground is in its weakest position, and therefore much more liable to be broken by the impetus of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a>, than the spokes of the lowest wheel by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> transference of additional weight. Whereas, if the spokes be perpendicular to the nave, they receive this sudden shock in their strongest position, and are in no danger of giving way to the strain.\n\n444. In the preceding observations we have supposed the rims of the wheels to be cylindrical. In concave wheels, however, the rims are uniformly made of twisted conical form, as A r, B s, fig. 5, which not only increases the disadvantages which we have ascribed to them, but adds many more to the number. Mr Cuming, in a late Treatise on Wheel Carriages, solely devoted to the consideration of this single point, has shewn with great ability the disadvantages of conical rims, and the propriety of making them cylindrical; but we are of opinion that he has ascribed to conical rims several disadvantages which arise chiefly from an inclination of the spokes. He insists much upon the injury done to the roads by the use of conical rims; yet though we are convinced that they are more injurious to pavements and highways than cylindrical rims, we are equally convinced, that this injury is occasioned chiefly by the oblique pressure of the inclined spokes. The defects of conical rims are so numerous and palpable, that it is wonderful they should have been so long overlooked. Every cone that is put in motion upon a plane surface will revolve round its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERTEX\">vertex</a>, and if force is employed to confine it to a straight line, the smaller parts of the cone will be dragged along the ground and the friction greatly increased. Now when a carriage moves upon conical wheels, one part of the cone rolls while the other is dragged along, and though confined to a rectilineal direction by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> force, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> tendency to revolve round their vertex occasions a great and continued friction upon the pinch <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PIN\">pin</a>, the shoulder of the axle-tree, and the sides of deep ruts.\n\n445. The shape of the wheels being thus determined, we must now attend to some particular parts of their construction. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> plates of which the rims are composed should never be less than three inches in breadth, as narrow rims sink deep into the ground, and therefore injure the roads and fatigue the horses. Mr Walker, indeed, attempts to throw <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIDICULE\">ridicule</a> upon the act of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> which enjoined the use of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> wheels; but he does not assign any sufficient reason for his opinion, and ought to have known that several excellent and well devised experiments were lately instituted by Boulard and Margueron, which evince in the most satisfactory manner, the great utility of broad wheels. Upon this subject an observation occurs to us, which has not been generally attended to, and which appears to remove all the objections which can be urged against broad rims. When any load is supported upon two points, each point supports one half of the weight; if the points are increased to four, each will sustain one-fourth of the load, and so on; the pressure upon each point of support diminishing as the number of points increases. If a weight therefore is supported by a broad surface, the points of support are infinite in number, and each of them will bear an infinitely small portion of the load; and, in the same way, every finite portion of this surface will sustain a part of the weight inversely proportional to the number of similar portions which the surface contains. Let us now suppose that a cart carrying a load of sixteen hundred weight is supported upon wheels whose rims are four inches in breadth, and that one of the wheels passes over four stones, each of them an inch broad and equally high, and capable of being pulverized only by a pressure of four hundred pounds weight. Then as each wheel sustains one half of the load, and as the wheel which passes over\nMechanics.\n\nOn the Line of Traction, and the Method by which Horses exert their strength.\n\n449. M. Camus attempted to show that the line of traction should always be parallel to the ground on which the carriage is moving, both because the horse can exert his greatest strength in this direction, and because the line of draught being perpendicular to the vertical spoke of the wheel, acts with the largest possible lever. M. Couplet, however, considering that the roads are never perfectly level, and that the wheels are constantly surmounting small eminences even in the best of roads, recommends the line of traction to be oblique to the horizon. By this means the line of draught HA, (which is by far too much inclined in the figure) Fig. 6, will in general be perpendicular to the lever AC which mounts the eminence, and will therefore act with the longest lever when there is the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> for it. We ought to consider also, that when a horse pulls hard against any load, he always brings his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a> nearer the ground, and therefore it follows, that if a horizontal line of traction be preferable to all others, the direction of the traces should be inclined to the horizon when the horse is at rest, in order that it may be horizontal when he lowers his breast and exerts his utmost force. The particular manner, however, in which living agents exert their strength against great loads, seems to have been unknown both to Camus and Couplet, and to many succeeding writers upon this subject. It is to M. Deparcieux, an excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> and ingenious mechanic, that we are indebted for the only accurate information, with which we are furnished; and we are sorry to see that philosophers who flourished after him have overlooked his important instructions. In his memoir on the draught of horses he has shewn in the most satisfactory manner, that animals draw by their weight, and not by the force of their muscles. In four-footed animals, the hinder feet is the fulcrum of the lever by which their weight acts against the load, and when the animal pulls hard, it depresses its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEST\">chest</a> and thus increases the lever of its weight, and diminishes the lever by which the load resists its efforts. Thus, in fig. 6, let P be the load, AD the line of traction, and let us suppose FC to be the hinder leg of the horse, and AE part of its body, A its chest or centre of gravity, and CE the level road. Then AFC will represent the crooked lever by which the horse acts, which is equivalent to the straight one AC. But when the horse's weight acts downwards at A, so as to drag forward the rope AD and raise the load P, CE will represent the power of the lever in this position, or the lever of the horse's weight, and CF the lever by which it is resisted by the load, or the lever of resistance. Now if the horse lowers its centre of gravity A, which it always does when it pulls hard, it is evident that CE, the lever of its weight, will be increased, while CF the lever of its resistance will be diminished, for the line of traction AD will approach nearer to CE. Hence we see the great benefit which may be derived from large horses; for the lever AC necessarily increases with their size, and their power is always proportioned to the length of this lever, their weight remaining the same. Large horses, therefore, and other animals, will draw more than small ones, even though they have less muscular force.\nMechanics.\n\nPractical force, and are unable to carry such a heavy burden.\n\nMechanics. The force of the muscles tends only to make the horse carry continually forward his centre of gravity, or, in other words, the weight of the animal produces the draught, and the play and force of its muscles serve to continue it.\n\n450. From these remarks, then, we may deduce the proper position of the line of traction. When the line of traction is horizontal, as AD, the lever of resistance is CF; but if this line is oblique to the horizon, as A'd, the lever of resistance is diminished to C'f, while the lever of the horse's weight always remains the same. Hence it appears, that inclined traces are much more advantageous than horizontal ones, as they uniformly diminish the resistance to be overcome. Deparcieux, however, has investigated experimentally the most favourable angle of inclination, and found, that when the angle DAF made by the trace A'd and a horizontal line is fourteen or fifteen degrees, the horses pulled with the greatest facility and force. This value of the angle of draught will require the weight of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>-tree <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a>, to which the traces are attached in four-wheeled carriages, to be one-half of the height of that part of the horse's breast to which the fore end of the trace is connected.\n\n451. When several horses are yoked in the same carriage as represented in fig. 7, and when the declivity changes, the length of the traces has a considerable influence upon the draught. From the point E where the traces are fastened to the horse next the load, draw ER to the same point in the second horse R, and let R' be another position of the second horse; it is required to find the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of effect that will be produced by placing the second horse at R or at R', or the comparative advantages of short and long traces. From R', the point where the traces are fixed, draw R'FE; and from E draw Emn parallel to the declivity DA. Take EF = EF' to represent the power of the horse in the direction of the traces, which will be the same whether he is yoked at R or at R'; draw EA perpendicular to DA; F'm, F'm parallel to EA, and F'f, F'f parallel to En. Then since the second horse when at R pulls with a force represented by FE, in the direction FE, we may resolve this force into the two forces, En, Ef, one of which En is solely employed in dragging the cart, up the inclined plane DA, while the other Ef is solely employed in pressing the first horse E to the ground. Let the horse be now removed from R to R', the direction of the traces becomes R'FE, and F'E = FE is the power exerted by the horse at R' and the direction in which it is exerted. But this force is equivalent to the forces Em, Ef, the first of which acts directly against the load, while the other presses the horse against the ground. Hence we see the disadvantages of long traces, for the force which draws the load when the horse is at R' is to the force when the horse is at R, as Em to En, and the forces which press the horse upon the ground as Ef to Ef, or as F'm to F'n. Now Ef = F'n = FE \u00d7 sin. n EF; hence F'f = FE \u00d7 sin. (n E'g' - F'E'g') (g' being parallel to AB') and Em = EF \u00d7 cos. (n E'g' - F'E'g'). In like manner we have Ef = FE \u00d7 sin. (n E'g' - F'E'g'), and Em = EF \u00d7 cos. (n E'g' - F'E'g'). Now sin. F'E'g' = sin. FEg = ER, and sin. F'E'g' = ER' = ER; but Rg\n\n\\[ Rg' = BR \\times EQ = BR \\times BR \\times \\cos. n E_g' = BR \\times (1 - \\cos. n E_g) \\]\n\nBy substituting this value in the Mechanics equations which contain the values of E\u03c6, En, Ef, Em, and considering that the angles F'E'g', F'E'g' are always so small that their arcs differ very little from their sines, we have\n\n\\[ F'E'g' = \\frac{BR \\times 1 - \\cos. n E_g}{ER} \\]\n\nBy substituting these values in the preceding equations, we have\n\n\\[ E\u03c6 = EF \\times \\sin. (n E_g - \\frac{BR \\times 1 - \\cos. n E_g}{ER}) \\]\n\\[ Ef = EF \\times \\sin. (n E_g - \\frac{BR \\times 1 - \\cos. n E_g}{ER'}) \\]\n\\[ En = EF \\times \\cos. (n E_g - \\frac{BR \\times 1 - \\cos. n E_g}{ER}) \\]\n\\[ Em = EF \\times \\cos. (n E_g - \\frac{BR \\times 1 - \\cos. n E_g}{ER'}) \\]\n\nIf AB is horizontal, and the declivity AD = 9\u00b0 28', or in parts of the radius = 0.16524, and cos. n E_g = 0.98388. Then, if ER = 200 pounds, BR = 3 feet, ER = 8 feet, ER' = 12 feet, then we shall have from the preceding formulae, E\u03c6 = 31.716 pounds, Ef = 32.350 pounds, En = 197.470 pounds, and Em = 197.404. Hence an additional length of four feet to traces eight feet long, presses the horse E to the ground with an additional force of 32.250 - 31.716 = 0.534 pounds, and diminishes the effect of the other horse by 0.666 pounds.\n\nOn the Position of the Centre of Gravity, and the manner of disposing the load.\n\n452. If the axle-tree of a two-wheeled carriage <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> through the centre of gravity of the load, the carriage will be in equilibrium in every position in which it can be placed with respect to the axle-tree; and in going up and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> hill the whole load will be sustained by the wheels, and will have no tendency either to press the horse to the ground or to raise him from it. But if the centre of gravity is above the axle-tree, as it must necessarily be, according to the present construction of wheel-carriages, a great part of the load will be thrown on the back of the horses from the wheels when going down a steep road, and thus tend to accelerate the motion of the carriage which the animal is striving to prevent; while, in ascending steep roads, a part of the load will be thrown behind the wheels, and tend to raise the horse from the ground, when there is the greatest necessity for some weight on his back to enable him to fix his feet in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, and overcome the great resistance which is occasioned by the steepness of the road. On the contrary, if the centre of gravity is below the axle, the horse will be pressed to the ground in going up hill, and lifted from it when going down. In all these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, therefore, where the centre of gravity is either on the axle-tree or directly above it or below,\nThe horse will bear no part of the load in level ground. In some situations the animal will be lifted from the ground when there is the greatest necessity for his being pressed to it; and he will sometimes bear a great proportion of the load when he should rather be relieved of it.\n\n453. The only way of remedying these evils, is to assign such a position to the centre of gravity, that the horse may bear some portion of the weight when he must exert great force against the load, that is, in level ground, and when he is ascending steep roads; for no animal can pull with its greatest effort unless it is pressed to the ground.\u2014Now this may be in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> effected in the following manner. Let BCN be the wheel of a cart, AD one of the shafts, D that part of it where the cart is suspended on the back of the horse, and A the axle-tree; then, if the centre of gravity of the load is placed at m, a point equidistant from the two wheels, but below the line DA, and before the axle-tree,\u2014the horse will bear a certain weight on level ground,\u2014a greater weight when he is going up hill and has more occasion for it, and less weight when he is going down hill, and does not require to be pressed to the ground: All this will be evident from the figure.\u2014When we recollect that the shaft DA is horizontal, the centre of gravity will press more upon the point of suspension D the nearer it comes to it; or the pressure upon D, or the horse\u2019s back, will be proportional to the distance of the centre of gravity from A. If m, therefore, be the centre of gravity, b A will represent its pressure upon D, when the shaft DA is horizontal. When the cart is ascending a steep road, AH will be the position of the shaft, the centre of gravity will be raised to a, and a A will be the pressure upon D. But if the cart is going down hill, AC will be the position of the shaft, the centre of gravity will be depressed to n, and c A will represent the pressure upon the horse\u2019s back. The weight sustained by the horse, therefore, is properly regulated by placing the centre of gravity at m. We have still, however, to determine the proper length of b a and b m, the distance of the centre of gravity from the axle, and from the horizontal line DA; but as these depend upon the nature and inclination of the roads, upon the length of the shaft DA, which depends on the size of the horse, on the magnitude of the load, and on other variable circumstances, it would be impossible to fix their value.\u2014If the load, along with the cart, weighs 400 pounds; if the distance DA be eight feet, and if the horse should bear 50 pounds of the weight, then b A should be one foot, which, being one-eighth of DA, will make the pressure upon D exactly 50 pounds. If the road slopes four inches in a foot, b m must be four inches, or the angle b A m should be equal to the inclination of the road; for then the point m will rise to a when ascending such a road, and will press with its greatest force on the back of the horse.\n\n454. When carts are not made in this manner, we may, in some degree obtain the same end by judiciously disposing the load. Let us suppose that the centre of gravity is at O when the cart is loaded with homogeneous materials, such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>, lime, &c. then if the load is to consist of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HETEROGENEOUS\">heterogeneous</a> substances, or bodies of different weights, we should place the heaviest at the bottom and nearest the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONT\">front</a>, which will not on-\n\nly lower the point o, but will bring it forward, and practically nearer the proper position m. Part of the load, too, might be suspended below the fore part of the carriage in dry weather, and the centre of gravity would approach still nearer the point m. When the point m is thus depressed, the weight on the horse is not only judiciously regulated, but the cart would be prevented from overturning; and in rugged roads the weight sustained by each wheel would be in a great degree equalised.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">Description</a> of different Carriages.\n\n455. In figure 8. is represented a carriage invented by Mr Richard, a physician in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROCHELLE\">Rochelle</a>, which moves without horses, merely by the exertion of the passengers\u2019 legs. The machinery by which this is effected is placed in a box behind the carriage, and is shown in figure 9. where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AA\">AA</a> is a small axis fixed into the box, and B a pulley over which a rope passes whose two extremities are tied to the ends of the levers or tredles C, D: the other ends of the levers are fixed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a> to the cross beam MF. The cranks FF are fixed to the axle KL, and move upon it as a centre. Each of them has a detent tooth at F which catches in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a> of the wheels H, H, so that they can move from F to H without moving the wheel, but the detent tooth catches in the teeth of the wheels when the cranks are brought backward, and therefore bring the wheel along with them. When the foot of the passenger, therefore, is placed upon the tredle D, it brings down the crank F and along with it the wheel H, so that the large wheels fixed on the same axis perform part of a revolution; but when D is depressed, the rope DA descends, the extremity C of the other tredle rises, and the crank F rising along with it, takes into the teeth of the wheel H, so that when the elevated tredle C is depressed, the wheels H, H, and consequently the wheels I, I, perform another part of a revolution. In this way, by continuing to work at the tredles, the machine advances with a regular pace.\n\n456. A carriage of this kind, where the mechanism is much more simple and beautiful than that which we have described, has been lately invented and constructed by Mr Nasmyth of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> genius is scarcely inferior to his talents as a painter. The pulley B and axle AA, are rendered unnecessary; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a> straps are substituted in place of the cranks F, F, and the whole mechanism is contained in two small cylindrical boxes about six inches in diameter, and one and a half broad.\n\n457. A carriage driven by the action of the wind is exhibited in fig. 10. It is fixed on four wheels, and moved by the impulse of the wind upon the sails C, D, being guided by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RUDDER\">rudder</a> E. Carriages of this kind will answer very well in a level country where the roads are good and the wind fair; and are said to be much used in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHINA\">China</a>. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a> they sometimes use similar vehicles for travelling upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ICE\">ice</a>; but they have a sledge instead of wheels, so that if the ice should happen to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a>, there will be no danger of sinking. Stephanus, a Dutchman, is said to have constructed one of these carriages with wheels, which travelled at the rate of 21 miles an hour with a very strong wind.\n\n458. The carriage represented in fig. 11. is made so as to sail against the wind by means of the spiral sails\n\nDescription E, F, G, H, one of which F, is expanded by the wind. The impulse of the wind upon the sails gives a rotatory motion to the axle M, furnished with a cog-wheel K, whose trundles act upon teeth placed on the inside of the fore-wheels.\n\nFig. 12. A carriage which cannot be overturned is represented in figure 12, where AB is the body of the carriage, consisting of a hollow globe, made of leather or wood, at the bottom of which is placed an immoveable weight proportioned to the load which the carriage is to bear. Two horizontal circles of iron D, E, connected with bars HI, and two vertical circles F, G, surround the globe; and the wheels are fastened by a handle K to the perpendicular bars HI. Then since the body of the carriage moves freely in every direction within the iron circles, the centre of gravity will always be near C, and the carriage will preserve an upright position even if the wheels and frame were overturned.\n\nPART III. DESCRIPTION OF MACHINES.\n\nCHAP. I. Machines which illustrate the doctrines of Mechanics, or are connected with them.\n\n1. Atwood's Machine.\n\nAtwood's ingenious machine invented by Mr Atwood for illustrating the doctrines of accelerated and retarded motion, is represented in figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, Fig. 1, 2, 3, and enables us to discover, 1. The quantity of matter moved. 2. The moving force. 3. The space described. 4. The time of description; and, 5. The velocity acquired at the end of that time.\n\n460. Of the quantity of matter moved.\u2014In order to observe the effects of the moving force, which is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of any experiment, the interference of all other forces should be prevented: the quantity of matter moved, therefore, considering it before any impelling force has been applied, should be without weight; for though it be impossible to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> weight from any substance whatever, yet it may be so counteracted as to produce no sensible effect. Thus in the machine fig. 1, A, B represent two equal weights affixed to the extremities of a very fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a> thread: this thread is stretched over a wheel or fixed pulley a b c d, moveable round a horizontal axis: the two weights A, B being equal, and acting against each other, remain in equilibrio; and when the least weight is superadded to either (setting aside the effects of friction), it will preponderate. When A, B are set in motion by the action of any weight m, the sum A+B+m, would constitute the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> moved, but for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INERTIA\">inertia</a> of the materials which must necessarily be used in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> of motion. These materials consist of, 1. The wheel a b c d, over which the thread sustaining A and B passes. 2. The four friction wheels on which the axle of the wheel a b c d rests. 3. The thread by which the bodies A and B are connected, so as when set in motion to move with equal velocities. The weight and inertia of the thread are too small to have any sensible effect on the experiments; but the inertia of the other materials constitute a considerable proportion of the mass moved, and must therefore be taken into account. Since when A and B are put in motion, they must move with a velocity equal to that of the circumference of the wheel a b c d to which the thread is applied; it follows, that if the whole mass of the wheels were accumulated in this circumference, its inertia would be truly estimated by the quantity of matter moved; but since the parts of the wheels move with different velocities, their effects in resisting the communication of motion to A and B by their inertia will be different; those parts which are furthest from the axis resisting more than those which revolve nearer, in a duplicate proportion of those distances, (see Rotation). If the figures of the wheels were regular, the distances of their centres of gyration from their axes of motion would be given, and consequently an equivalent weight, which being accumulated uniformly in the circumference a b c d, would exert an inertia equal to that of the wheels in their constructed form, would also be given. But as the figures are irregular, recourse must be had to experiment, to assign that quantity of matter, which being accumulated uniformly in the circumference of the wheel a b c d, would resist the communication of motion to A in the same manner as the wheels.\n\nIn order to ascertain the inertia of the wheel a b c d, with that of the friction wheels, the weights AB being removed, the following experiment was made.\n\nA weight of 30 grains was affixed to a silk thread of inconsiderable weight; this thread being wound round the wheel a b c d, the weight 30 grains by descending from rest communicated motion to the wheel, and by many trials was observed to describe a space of about 38.5 inches in 3 seconds. From these data the equivalent mass or inertia of the wheels will be known from this rule.\n\nLet a weight P, fig. 2, be applied to communicate motion to a system of bodies by means of a very slender and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEXIBLE\">flexible</a> thread going round the wheel SLDIM, through the centre of which the axis passes (G being the common centre of gravity, R the centre of gravity of the matter contained in this line, and O the centre of oscillation). Let this weight descend from rest through any convenient space s inches, and let the observed time of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> be t seconds; then if l be the space through which bodies descend freely by gravity in one second, the equivalent weight sought:\n\n\\[ \\frac{W \\times SR \\times SO}{SD^2} = \\frac{P \\times t^2}{s} - P. \\]\n\nHere we have \\( p = 30 \\) grains, \\( t = 3 \\) seconds, \\( l = 193 \\) inches, \\( s = 38.5 \\) inches; and \\( \\frac{P \\times t^2}{s} = \\frac{30 \\times 9 \\times 193}{385} = 1323 \\) grains, or 2 ounces.\n\nThis is the inertia equivalent to that of the wheel a b c d, and the friction wheels together: for the rule extends to the estimation of the inertia of the mass contained in all the wheels.\n\nThe resistance to motion therefore arising from the wheel's inertia, will be the same as if they were absolutely\n\nThis being premised, let the boxes A and B be replaced, being suspended by the silk thread over the wheel or pulley a b c d, and balancing each other; suppose that any weight m be added to A so that it shall descend, the exact quantity of matter moved, during the descent of the weight A, will be ascertained, for the whole mass will be \\(A + B + m + \\frac{1}{2} oz\\).\n\nIn order to avoid troublesome computations in adjusting the quantities of matter moved and the moving forces, some determinate weight of convenient magnitude may be assumed as a standard, to which all the others are referred. This standard weight in the subsequent experiments is \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of an ounce, and is represented by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> m. The inertia of the wheels being therefore = 24 ounces, will be denoted by 11 m. A and B are two boxes constructed so as to contain different quantities of matter, according as the experiment may require them to be varied: the weight of each box, including the hook to which it is suspended, = \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) oz. or, according to the preceding estimation, the weight of each box will be denoted by 6 m; these boxes contain such weights as are represented by fig. 3, each of which weighs an ounce, so as to be equivalent to 4 m; other weights of \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) oz. = 2 m, \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) m, and aliquot parts of m, such as \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) m, \\(\\frac{1}{16}\\) m, may be also included in the boxes, according to the conditions of the different experiments hereafter described.\n\nIf \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) oz. or 19 m, be included in either box, this with the weight of the box itself will be 25 m; so that when the weights A and B, each being 25 m, are balanced in the manner above represented, their whole mass will be 50 m, which being added to the inertia of the wheels 11 m, the sum will be 61 m. Moreover, three circular weights, such as that which is represented at fig. 4, are constructed; each of which = \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) oz. or m; if one of these be added to A and one to B, the whole mass will now become 63 m, perfectly in equilibrium, and moveable by the least weight added to either (setting aside the effects of friction), in the same manner precisely as if the same weight or force were applied to communicate motion to the mass 63 m, existing in free space and without gravity.\n\n462. 2. The moving force. Since the weight of any substance is constant, and the exact quantity of it easily estimated, it will be convenient here to apply a weight to the mass A as a moving force: thus, when the system consists of a mass = 63 m, according to the preceding description, the whole being perfectly balanced, let a weight \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) oz. or m, such as is represented in fig. 3, be applied on the mass A; this will communicate motion to the whole system; by adding a quantity of matter m to the former mass 63 m, the whole quantity of matter moved will now become 64 m; and the moving force being = m, this will give the force which accelerates the descent of \\(A = \\frac{m}{64 m}\\), or \\(\\frac{1}{64}\\) part of the accelerating force of gravity.\n\nBy the preceding construction, the moving force may be altered without altering the mass moved; for suppose the three weights m, two of which are placed on A and one on B, to be removed, then will A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> B. If the weights 3 m be all placed on A, the moving force will become 3 m, and the mass moved \\(= \\frac{3 m}{64 m}\\) as before, and the force which accelerates the descent of \\(A = \\frac{3 m}{64 m}\\) = \\(\\frac{3}{64}\\) parts of the force by which gravity accelerates falling bodies.\n\nSuppose it were required to make the moving force 2 m, the mass moved continuing the same. Let the three weights, each of which = m, be removed; A and B will balance each other; and the whole mass will be 61 m; let \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) m, fig. 5, be added to A, and \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) m to B, the equilibrium will be preserved, and the mass moved will be 62 m; now let 2 m be added to A, the moving force will be 2 m; and the mass moved 64 m as before; wherefore the force of acceleration = \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) part of the acceleration of gravity. These alterations in the moving force may be easily made in the more elementary experiments, there being no necessity for altering the contents of the boxes A and B: but the proportion and absolute quantities of the moving force and mass moved, may be of any assigned magnitude, according to the conditions of the proposition to be illustrated.\n\n463. 3. Of the space described. The body A, fig. 1, Fig. 2, descends in a vertical line; and a scale about 64 inches in length divided into inches and tenths of an inch is adjusted vertical, and so placed that the descending weight A may fall in the middle of a square stage, fixed to receive it at the end of the descent: the beginning of the descent is estimated from o on the scale, when the bottom of the box A is on a level with o. The descent of A is terminated when the bottom of the box strikes the stage, which may be fixed at different distances from the point o; so that by altering the position of the stage, the space described from rest may be of any given magnitude less than 64 inches.\n\n464. 4. The time of description is observed by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PENDULUM\">pendulum</a>, vibrating seconds; and the experiments intended to illustrate the elementary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a>, may easily be so constructed that the time of motion shall be a whole number of seconds. The estimation of the time, therefore, admits of considerable exactness, provided the observer takes care to let the bottom of the box A begin its descent precisely at any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> of the pendulum; then the coincidence of the stroke of the box against the stage, and the beat of the pendulum at the end of the time of motion, will show how nearly the experiment and the theory agree. There might be various devices for letting the weight A begin its descent at the instant of a beat of the pendulum W; for instance, let the bottom of the box A, when at o on the scale, rest on a flat rod, held in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> horizontally; its extremity being coincident with o; by attending to the beats of the pendulum; and with a little practice, the rod which supports the box A may be removed at the moment the pendulum beats, so that the descent of A shall commence at the same instant.\n\n465. 5. Of the velocity acquired. It remains only to describe in what manner the velocity acquired by the descending weight A, at any given point of its path, is made evident to the senses. The velocity of A's descent being continually accelerated will be the same in two points of the space described. This is occasioned by the constant action of the moving force; and since the velocity of A at any instant is measured by the space\nDescription which would be described by it moving uniformly for a given time with the velocity it had acquired at that instant, this measure cannot be experimentally obtained, except by removing the force by which the descending body's acceleration was caused.\n\nIn order to show in what manner this is effected particularly, let us again suppose the boxes A and B = 25 m each, so as together to be = 50 m; this with the wheel's inertia 11 m will make 61 m; now let m be added to A, and an equal weight m to B, these bodies will balance each other, and the whole mass will be 63 m. If a weight m be added to A, motion will be communicated, the moving force being m, and the mass moved 64 m. In estimating the moving force, the circular weight = m was made use of as a moving force: but for the present purpose of showing the velocity acquired, it will be convenient to use a flat rod, the weight of which is also = m. Let the bottom of the box A be placed on a level with o on the scale, the whole mass being as described above = 63 m, perfectly balanced. Now let the rod, the weight of which = m, be placed on the upper surface of A; this body will descend along the scale in the same manner as when the moving force was applied in the form of a circular weight. Suppose the mass A, fig. 6, to have descended by constant acceleration of the force m, for any given time, or through a given space: let a circular frame be so affixed to the scale, contiguous to which the weight descends, that A may pass centrally through it, and that this circular frame may intercept the rod m by which the body A has been accelerated from rest. After the moving force m has been intercepted at the end of the given space or time, there will be no force operating on any part of the system which can accelerate or retard its motion: this being the case, the weight A, the instant after m has been removed, must proceed uniformly with the velocity which it had acquired that instant: in the subsequent part of its descent, the velocity being uniform will be measured by space described in any convenient number of seconds.\n\n466. Mr Atwood's machine is also useful for estimating experimentally the velocities communicated by the impact of bodies <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> and nonelastic; the quantity of resistance opposed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a>, as well as for various other purposes. These uses we shall not insist on; but the properties of retarded motion being a part of the present subject, it may be necessary to show in what manner the motion of bodies resisted by constant forces are reduced to experiment by means of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> above described, with as great ease and precision as the properties of bodies uniformly accelerated. A single instance will be sufficient: Thus, suppose the mass contained in the weights A and B, fig. 6, and the wheels to be 61 m, when perfectly in equilibrium; let a circular weight m be applied to B, and let two long weights or rods, each = m, be applied to A, then will A descend by the action of the moving force m, the mass moved being 64 m: suppose that when it has described any given space by constant acceleration, the two rods m are intercepted by the circular frame above described, while A is descending through it, the velocity acquired by that descent is known; and when the two rods are intercepted, the weight A will begin to move on with the velocity acquired, being now retarded by the constant force m; and since the mass moved is 62 m, the force of retardation will be \\( \\frac{m}{62} \\) part of that force where-\n\nby gravity retards bodies thrown perpendicularly upwards. The weight A will therefore proceed along the graduated scale in its descent, with an uniformly retarded motion, and the spaces described, times of motion, and velocities destroyed by the resisting force, will be subject to the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> as in the examples of accelerated motion already described.\n\nIn the preceding descriptions, two suppositions have been assumed, neither of which is mathematically true: but it might be easily shown that they are so in a physical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>; the errors occasioned by them being insensible in practice.\n\n2. Machine for illustrating the Theory of the Wedge.\n\n467. This machine is represented in fig. 7, where KILM and LMNO are two flat pieces of wood joined together by a hinge at LM; P is a graduated arch on which these pieces of wood can be moved so as to subtend any angle not greater than 60\u00b0, and a, b two screws for fixing them at the required angle. The back of the wedge will therefore be represented by IKNO, its sharp edge by LM, and its two sides by KILM, LMNO. The weight p suspended to the wedge by the hook M, and the weight of the wedge itself, may be considered as the force employed to drive the wedge. The wooden cylinders AB, CD, have their extremities made like two flat circular plates to prevent the wedge from slipping off at one side. To the pivots of these cylinders, two of which are represented at e and f, are fastened the cords EW, FU, CV, AX, which passing over the pulleys U, V, X, W are fastened to the two bars uv, xw, on which any equal weights Y, Z may be hung at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>. The tendency of these weights is evidently to draw the cylinders towards each other, and they may therefore be regarded as the resistance of the wood acting against the sides of the wedge. The cylinders themselves are suspended by their pivots to the threads E, F, G, H, which may be fixed to the ceiling of the room, or to the horizontal beam of a frame made on purpose.\u2014By placing various equal weights at Y and Z, it may be easy to determine the proportion between the power and the resistance when the wedge is in equilibrium.\u2014In this machine the impelling power is the pressure of the weight p, whereas, in the real wedge, the impelling power is always an impulsive force which is infinitely more powerful.\n\n3. Machine for illustrating the effects of the centrifugal force in flattening the poles of the Earth.\n\n468. Fig. 8 represents this machine, which consists of two flexible circular hoops, AB and CD, crossing one another at right angles, and fixed to the vertical axis EF at its lower extremity, but left loose at the pole or intersection c. If this axis be made to revolve rapidly by means of the winch m, and the wheel and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PINION\">pinion</a> n, o, the middle parts A, B, C, D will, by their centrifugal force, swell out and strike against the frame at F and G; if the pole c, when sinking, is not stopped by means of a pin F fixed in the vertical axis. The hoops, therefore, will have a spheroidal form; the equatorial being larger than the polar diameter.\n\n4. Machine for trying the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRENGTH_OF_MATERIALS\">Strength of Materials</a>.\n\n469. The piece of wood, whose strength is to be tried,\n\nDescription tried, is represented by EF, and the force is applied to it by means of the winch A, which winds up the rope BC, passing over the pulley n, and below the pulley m, and attached to the point D of the beam EF. The pulleys slide on two parallel bars fixed in a frame, held down by a projecting point, at G, of the lever GR, which is graduated like a steelyard, and measures the force employed. The beam EF is held by a double vice IK with four screws, two of which are invisible. When a wire is to be torn it is fixed to the cross bar LM; and when any body is to be crushed, it must be placed beneath the lever NO, the rope BC being fixed to the hook N, and the end O being held down by the click which acts on the double ratchet OP.\u2014The lever is double from O to Q, and acts on the body by a loop fixed to it by a pin. See Young's Nat. Philos. vol. i. p. 768, from which this drawing and description are taken.\n\n5. Machine in which all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICAL_POWERS\">Mechanical powers</a> are combined.\n\n470. The lever AB, whose centre of motion is C, is fixed to the endless screw DE, which drives the wheel and axle FHG. Round the axle G is coiled a rope GHI, which passes round the four pulleys K, L, m, n, and is fixed to a hook at m on the lower <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLOCK\">block</a>, which carries the weight W. When equal weights are suspended on the lever at equal distances from the fulcrum C, the lever becomes a balance, and the wedge and inclined plane are evidently included in the endless screw DE. If the wheel F has 30 teeth, if the lever AB is equal to twice the diameter of the wheel FH, and if the diameter of the axle G is one-tenth of the diameter of the wheel, a power of 1 exerted at P will raise a weight of 2400, suspended at the lower block of the four pulleys.\n\n6. Fidler's Balance.\n\n471. The balance represented in fig. 3, was made by Fidler for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">Institution</a>, and does not differ much from those which have been constructed by Ramsden and Troughton. The middle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> A can be raised at pleasure by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NUT\">nut</a> B, and supports the round ends of the axis in the forks at its upper extremity, in order to remove the pressure on the sharp edges of the axis within the forks. C and D are pillars which occasionally support the scales, and may be elevated or depressed by turning the nut E. The screw F raises or depresses a weight within the conical beam, for the purpose of regulating the position of the centre of gravity. The graduated arc G measures the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of the vibrations. See Young's Nat. Philos. vol. i. p. 765.\n\n7. Improvement on the Balance.\n\n472. An improvement on the balance is represented in fig. 4, where DC is a micrometer screw fixed to the arm FA, so that when it is turned round by the nut D, it neither approaches to, nor recedes from, the centre of motion F. The screw DC works in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> screw in the small weight n, and by revolving in one direction, carries this weight from S to R, and thus gives the preponderance to the scale G. The recession of the weight n from the centre F is measured as in the common micrometer, and a weight x placed in the scale suspended at A, will be in equilibrium with n placed at any distance Sn, when \\( \\frac{Sn \\times n}{FA} \\).\u2014Appendix to Ferguson's Lectures.\n\n8. Machine for showing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">Composition</a> of Forces.\n\n473. The part BEFC is made to draw other parts into Machine BEFC so as to turn on an axis which will be at H when the square BEFC is pushed in, and at p when it is drawn out. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> G is made to slide on the wire k which is fixed to BEFC, and the thread m attached to the ball goes over the pulley to I, where it is fixed. Now, when the piece BEFC is pulled out, the pulley, wire, and ball, move along with it, in the direction DCF, and it is evident that the ball G will slide gradually up the wire k. It is therefore acted upon by two forces: one in the direction GH, and the other in the direction GC; and will be found at the end of the motion at g, having moved in the direction Gg, the diagonal of a parallelogram whose sides are GH, GC.\n\n9. Smeaton's Machine for experiments on Windmill Sails.\n\n474. In the experiments with this machine, the sails Apparatus were carried round in the circumference of a circle, so that the same effect was produced as if the wind had struck the sails at rest with the velocity which was then given them. In the pyramidal frame ABC is fixed to the axis DE, which carries the arm FG with the sails GI. By pulling the rope Z, which coils round the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARREL\">barrel</a> H, a motion of rotation is given to the sails, so that they revolve in the circumference of a circle, whose radius is DI. At L is fixed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CORD\">cord</a> which passes round the pulleys M, N, O, and coils round a small cylinder on the axis of the sails and raises the scale C, in which different weights are placed for trying the power of the sails, and which, being in the direction of the axis DF, is not affected by the circular motion of the arm DG. The scale C is kept steady by the pillars Q, R, and prevented from swinging by the chains S, T, which hang loosely round the pillars. VX is a pendulum composed of two leaden balls moveable upon a wooden rod, so that they can be adjusted to vibrate in any given time. The pendulum hangs upon a cylindrical wire, on which it vibrates as on a rolling axis.\n\n10. Smeaton's Machine for experiments on Rotatory Motion.\n\n475. This machine is exhibited in fig. 1, where the Apparatus vertical axis NB is turned by the rope M passing over the pulley R, and carrying the scale S. The axis NB carries two equal leaden weights K, D, moveable at pleasure on the horizontal bar HI. The upper part N of the axis is one half the diameter of the part M, so that when the rope is made to wind round N, it acts at half the distance from the axis, at which it acts when coiled round M.\u2014When the rope is wound round N, the same force will produce in the same time but half the velocity which is produced when the rope coils round M, the situation of the leaden weights being the same: But when the weights K, L are removed to a double distance from the axis, a quadruple force will be required in order to produce an equal angular velocity in a given time.\n1. Prony's Condenser of Forces.\n\n476. The object of this machine is to obtain a maximum effect from an impelling power which is subject to variation in its intensity. Let us suppose that wind is the first mover, and that O, O is the vertical axis of a windmill; c, c, c, c, are several radii issuing from this axis, and carrying a wiper b d, which acts upon the corresponding wipers a f, and gives a motion of rotation to the axis a, a, a, a, to which they are attached. The wipers b d, a f must be so constructed that when b d ceases to press on one wiper a f, it shall at the same moment begin to act upon the next wiper. Each of the axes, a, a, a, a, carries a drum t r r, round which is coiled a cord t p F, passing over the pulley p, and supporting a weight Q which can be placed at different distances from G on the lever FG. The axes a, a, a, a also pass through the pinions g q, to which they are not fixed; but these pinions carry ratchet wheels that bear against the teeth r r, so that when the weight Q rises, the rope merely coils round the drum without moving the pinion g q. But when the wiper b d ceases to act upon a f, the weight Q descends, and then the toothed wheel r r acts against the ratchet, so that Q cannot descend without turning the pinion g q along with the drum. The pinion g q drives the wheel a b, which again drives the wheel CE by means of the bevelled teeth CD, and elevates the load at P. Hence, when the axis OO is put in motion by the wind acting on the sails, it will first raise a number of weights Q sufficient to put the machine in motion, and will continue to raise new weights while those before raised are fallen, so that the motion once impressed will be continued.\n\n2. Portable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">Stone</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CRANE\">Crane</a>, for loading and unloading Carts.\n\n477. This crane is mounted on a wooden stage, and is so constructed that it may be taken to pieces. The frame A, A, A, A is about ten feet high, nine feet long and nine feet wide. The wheels B, B are of iron, and about three feet in diameter. The pinion D that is fixed to the axis of the first wheel B is eight inches diameter, and the other pinion C is about the same diameter. When the stones are suspended to the rope that coils round the barrel, the workman turns a winch on the axis of the wheel C, and raises or lowers the weight according to the direction in which he turns it.\n\n3. Portable Cellar Crane.\n\n478. This crane is represented in fig. 5, where A, A are two wooden supports about six feet high, which are joined at F, and connected by the iron cylinder C and the wooden bar D. The supports A, A are fastened to the edge of the cellar by the iron prongs E, E, and the two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROPES\">ropes</a> which support the barrel and pass round it are fixed to the iron clamp G, G. These ropes coil round the cylindrical bar F, which is put in motion by the winch K, driving the pinion I about four inches diameter, which gives motion to the wheel H, about three feet in diameter. The barrel, therefore, will rise or fall according to the direction in which the winch is moved.\n\n4. Weighing Crane.\n\n479. This crane represented in fig. 6, was invented by Mr Andrews, and weighs the body at the time that it is raising it. The weight W is elevated by means of the levers M, N, O, P which coil the rope HR round the barrel H. The jib ED stands on a horizontal beam moveable in a vertical plane round the centre FA, and the distance of the upright beam E from the centre of motion A is \\( \\frac{1}{12} \\) of BF. The weight of the body W is then ascertained by the weight at B, which keeps it in equilibrium. The piece of wood C projects from the vertical beam CT, in order to prevent the beam from rising too high.\n\n5. Gilpin's Crane.\n\n480. In fig. 1, where this machine is represented, Gilpin's AB is the perpendicular stand, formed of two oaken crane planks let into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> iron mortises C, D: Between these crane planks is fixed the barrel E with spiral grooves on its surface, on which the chain RL winds. When the winch N is put in motion it drives the pinion O, which again drives the wheel P, on whose axis is fixed the barrel F, so that the chain is coiled round the barrel and the weight raised. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> of this part of the machinery is shown in fig. 2. Figure 3 shows an enlarged view of part of the barrel, and part of the chain lying in its proper position in the spiral grooves or channels. In order to prevent the chain from twisting when it is wound upon the barrel, the lower edge of one link lies in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROOVE\">groove</a>, and the next link upon the surface of the barrel. This will be better understood from fig. 4, which is a section of the barrel F, and shows the manner in which one link lies within it, and the other link on its outside. The old method of working chains is exhibited in fig. 5. For a full account of this useful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>, see Nicholson's Journal, vol. xv. p. 126.\n\n6. Bramah's Jib for Cranes.\n\n481. The nature of this invention, for which we are indebted to the ingenious Mr Bramah, may be easily understood from a bare inspection of fig. 6, which represents a jib attached to the wall of a warehouse. The jib turns on a perforated axis or pillar. The rope by which the weight is raised, after passing over two pulleys, goes through the perforated axis, and is conducted over another pulley to the barrel of the crane, which is not represented in the figure. In jibs of the common construction which turn in two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> gudgeons, the rope passes over the upper gudgeon, and is confined between two vertical rollers; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENDING\">bending</a> of the rope occasions a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of friction, and produces a constant effort to bring the arm of the jib into a position parallel to the inner part of the rope.\n\n7. Gottlieb's Carriage Crane.\n\n482. This machine, which is useful for carrying large stones where carts and horses cannot be easily obtained, consists of two sets of crane wheels applied to the two sets of wheels belonging to the carriage, so that two men, one acting at each winch A, A give motion to the loaded carriage. The pinion B, six inches in diameter turns the wheel C, three feet in diameter. The wheel C gives motion to the pinion D one foot in diameter,\n8. Common Jack.\n\n483. The common worm jack is represented in fig. 8, and is impelled by the weight W, which is suspended to a rope passing through the pulleys V, R, and rolling round the barrel Q. When the barrel is put in motion by the action of the weight, it drives the wheel KL of 60 teeth, by means of a catch fixed to AB, which lays hold of the cross bars in KL. The wheel KL drives the pinion M of 15 teeth, fixed on the axis of the wheel N of 30 teeth, which gives motion to the endless screw O, and the fly-wheel P. On the axis of the wheel KL is fixed the pulley DG, which, by means of a rope, gives motion to the spit. The axis ET is fixed in the barrel AC; and as this axis is hollow, both it and the barrel turn round upon the axis FD, so that the rope may be coiled round the barrel by the winch H without moving the wheel K.\n\n9. Loading and Unloading Machine.\n\n484. This portable machine, invented by Mr Davis of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WINDSOR\">Windsor</a>, is put in motion by the winch A, which drives the two endless screws C, C. These screws move the wheels E, E, and consequently the barrels connected with them, so that the ropes F, F passing over the pulleys G, G are coiled round the barrels, and the load H which these ropes support is raised into the frame R, R, which shews a part of the cart. The barrels and wheels are contained in an iron box L, the sides of which are removed in the figure.\n\n10. Vaudoue's Pile Engine.\n\n485. The horses which work this engine are yoked at S, S, and by moving the wheel B and drum C, which are locked together, raise the follower GH, (carrying the ram Q by the handle R), by means of the rope HH which coils round the drum. When the follower G reaches the top of the frame, the upper legs of the tongs H are closed by pressing against the adjacent beams; and their lower legs are opened, so that they drop the ram Q, which falls and strikes the pile.\n\nWhen G is at the top of the frame, the crooked handle 6, of the follower G, presses against the cords a, a, which raise the end of the lever L (see fig. 2.) round m as a centre, and by depressing the extremity N, and consequently the bar S, S, unlock the drum C and the wheel B, so that the follower G falls by its weight and seizes the ram R. As soon as the follower drops, the horses would tumble down, having no resistance to overcome, were not this prevented by the fly O, which is moved by the wheel B and trundle X, and opposes a sufficient resistance to the horses till the follower again seizes the ram. When the follower falls, the weight L (fig. 2.) pushes up the bolt Y into the drum C, and locks the wheel and the drum;\u2014and the same operation is afterwards repeated. See Ferguson's Lect. vol. i. p. 118.\n\n11. Bunce's Pile Engine.\n\n486. A side view of this engine is shown in fig. 3, 4. Bunce's It consists of two endless ropes or chains A, connected pile engines, by cross pieces of iron B, B, &c. (fig. 4.) which pass round the wheel C, the cross pieces falling into corresponding cross grooves, cut in the periphery of the wheel. When the man at S, therefore, drives the wheel m by means of the pinion p, he moves also the wheel C fixed on the axis of m, and makes the double ropes revolve upon the wheels, C, D. The wheel D is fixed at the end of a lever DHK, whose centre of motion is H, a fixed point in the beam FT. Now, when the ram L (fig. 3, 5.) is fixed to one of the cross-pieces B by the hook M, the weight of the ram, acting by the rope, moves the lever DK round H, and brings the wheel D to G, so that, by turning the winch, the ram L (fig. 3.) is raised in the vertical line LRG. But when it reaches R, the projecting piece R disengages the ram from the cross piece B, by striking the bar Q; and as the weight is removed from the extremity D of the lever, the counterpoise I brings it back from G to its old position at F, and the ram falls without interfering with the chain. When the hook is descending, it is prevented from catching the rope by means of the piece of wood N suspended from the hook M at O; for being specifically <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a> than the iron weight L, and moving with less velocity, it does not come in contact with L till the ram is stopped at the end of its path. When N, therefore, falls upon L, it depresses the extremity M of the hook, and therefore brings the hoop over one of the cross pieces B, by which the ram is again raised.\n\n487.

The commodities of the duchy are corn, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAX\">flax</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEMP\">hemp</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-HOPS\">hops</a>, wax, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a>, cattle, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a>, cheese, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a>, and wood, a part of which is exported; but hardly any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a>.\n\nOf the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of Mecklenburg, there are two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> still subsisting, viz. that of Schwerin and that of Strelitz. The latter commenced in Duke Adolphus Frederick II., younger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> of the duke of Schwerin, and grandfather of Adolphus Frederick IV. who entered on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> in 1752, and whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> received a great additional lustre by his Britannic majesty's taking his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> sister for his consort, and by her own great merit and noble deportment in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> station. Besides the duchy of Strelitz, to this duke belong the principality of Ratzeburg, with the lordship of Stargard, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> commanderies of Miro and Nemo, and a yearly pension of 9000 dollars out of the Boitzenburg toll. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> assumed by both the dukes is duke of Mecklenburg; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WENDEN\">Wenden</a>, Schwerin, and Ratzeburg; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNT\">count</a> of Schwerin and the country of Rostock, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">lord</a> of Stargard. By the agreement concluded at Wittstock in 1442, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTOR\">elector</a> of Brandenburg, on the extinction of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> line of the dukes of Mecklenburg, is entitled to their whole succession. The duke of Schwerin has two votes both in the diet of the empire and that of the circle. The matricular assessment for the duchies of Schwerin and Gustro is 40 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> and 67 foot, or 748 florins monthly, including what is paid by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a> for Wismar, and the bailiwicks of Poll and Neukloster. To the chamber of Wetzlar, these two duchies pay each 243 rix-dollars, 43 kruitzters. For the government of Mecklenburg, the administration of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, and the management of the revenue, there is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-PRIVY_COUNCIL\">privy <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> of regency, the demesne chamber, the high and provincial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of justice, to which appeals <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> in most causes, both from the consistory and the inferior civil courts, and which are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> to both the dukes. As to the revenues, those of the Schwerin line must be very considerable, those arising from the demesne bailiwicks and regalia alone amounting to 300,000 rix-dollars per annum. There is a tax on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> that produces no contemptible sum, and that called the princess's tax is fixed at 20,000 rix-dollars: besides all these, there are also free gifts. The whole revenues of the Strelitz branch are estimated at 120,000 rix-dollars. Each of these princes maintains a body of troops.","sp":177,"ep":177},{"h":"MECONIUM","t":"the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCREMENT\">excrement</a> contained in the intestines of an infant at its birth.","sp":177,"ep":177},{"h":"MEDALEUCA","t":"a genus of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> belonging to the polydelphia class.

Her mother's name, according to the more received <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HESIOD\">Hesiod</a> and Hyginus, was Idyia; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a>, according to others, Ephyre, Hecate, Asterodia, Antiope, and Neera. She was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIECE\">niece</a> of Circe. When Jason came to Colchis in quest of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEECE\">fleece</a>, Medea became enamoured of him, and it was to her well directed labours that the Argonauts owed their preservation. Medea had an interview with her lover in the temple of Hecate; where they bound themselves by the most solemn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OATHS\">oaths</a> to eternal fidelity. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a> sooner had Jason overcome all the difficulties which \u00c6etes had placed in his way, than Medea embarked with the conquerors for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>. To stop the pursuit of her father, she tore to pieces her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> Absyrtus, and left his mangled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a> in the way through which \u00c6etes was to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a>. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of barbarity, some have attributed to Jason, and not to her. When Jason reached Iolchos his native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, the return and victories of the Argonauts were celebrated with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> rejoicings: but \u00c6son the father of Jason was unable to assist at the solemnity on account of the infirmities of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>. Medea, at her husband's request, removed the weakness of \u00c6son; and by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> away the blood from his veins, and filling them again with the juice of certain herbs, she restored him to the vigour and sprightliness of youth. This sudden change in \u00c6son astonished the inhabitants of Iolchos; and the daughters of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PELIAS\">Pelias</a> were also desirous to see their father restored by the same power to the vigour of youth. Medea, willing to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a> the injuries which her husband's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> had suffered from Pelias, increased their curiosity; and betrayed them into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> of their father as preparatory to his rejuvenescence, which she afterwards refused to accomplish. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> greatly irritated the people of Iolchos; and Medea with her husband fled to Corinth to avoid their resentment. Here they lived for 10 years with mutual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a>, when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of Jason for Glauce the king's daughter interrupted their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a>, and Medea was divorced. Medea revenged the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFIDELITY\">infidelity</a> of Jason, by causing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Glauce, and the destruction of her family. She also killed two of her children in their father's presence; and when Jason attempted to punish the barbarity of the mother, she fled through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> upon a chariot drawn by winged dragons. From Corinth Medea came to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a>, where, after she had undergone the necessary purification of her murder, she married King \u00c6geus, or (according to others) lived in an adulterous manner with him. From her conduct with \u00c6geus, Medea had a son who was called Medus. Soon after, when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THESEUS\">Theseus</a> wished to make himself known to his father, Medea, jealous of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> and fearful of his power, attempted to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POISON\">poison</a> him at a feast which had been prepared for his entertainment. Her attempts, however, failed of success, and the sight of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a> which Theseus wore by his side convinced \u00c6geus that the stranger against whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> he had so basely conspired was his own son. The father and the son were reconciled; and Medea, to avoid the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> which her wickedness deserved, mounted her fiery chariot and disappeared through the air. She came to Colchis; where, according to some, she was reconciled to Jason, who had sought her in her native country after her sudden departure from Corinth. She died at Colchis, as Justin mentions, when she had been restored to the confidence of her family. After death she married <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACHILLES\">Achilles</a> in the Elysian fields, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a> mentioned by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIMONIDES\">Simonides</a>. The murder of Mermenus and Phereus, the youngest of Jason's children by Medea, is not to be attributed to the mother, according to Elian; but to the Corinthians, who assassinated them in the temple of Juno Acroa. To avoid the resentment of the gods, and to deliver themselves from the pestilence which visited their country after so horrid a massacre, they engaged the poet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EURIPIDES\">Euripides</a> for five talents to write a tragedy, which cleared them of the murder, and represented Medea as the cruel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ASSASSIN\">assassin</a> of her own children. And besides, that this opinion might be the better credited, festivals were appointed, in which the mother was represented with all the barbarity of a fury murdering her own sons.","sp":229,"ep":229},{"h":"MEDEOLA","t":"Climbing African Asparagus, a genus of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> belonging to the hexandria class, and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> method ranking under the 11th order, Sarmentaceae.

At the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">universities</a> this has been too much the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>. It is indeed true, that for near 20 years a few lectures on this subject have been delivered at the university of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, by the professor of the institutions of medicine. But he could by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> means consider the subject on that extensive scale which its importance merited. And he had often expressed his regret, that, as in several of the foreign universities, a professorship had not been instituted for the express purpose of giving a course of lectures on medical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JURISPRUDENCE\">jurisprudence</a>.

The latter is the aggregate of all the information afforded by the different branches of medicine, which is necessary for elucidating doubtful questions in courts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a>.\n\nAlthough there are some traces of juridical medicine in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-JUSTINIAN\">Justinian</a> code; such as determining the real <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of birth, with a view to prevent the imposition of spurious children: it properly originated with the code of laws enacted by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> V. under the name of Constitutio criminalis Carolina; in which it is ordained, that the opinions of physicians should be taken, with regard to the danger of wounds, child-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a>, murder, poisoning, procured <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABORTION\">abortion</a>, concealed pregnancy, &c. These directions, and the impossibility which was found of determining many questions by simply legal means, induced some legislators to enjoin, that all tribunals and judges should procure from sworn physicians, appointed to this office, their opinions concerning all the subjects to be mentioned hereafter.\n\nSince that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, it has been treated systematically by many learned men; such as Fortunatus Fidelis, Zacchias, Alberti, Hebenstreit, Haller, Ludwig, Plenck; and lastly, in the most masterly manner, by Metzger. Numberless dissertations have been written on all its parts; and among those who contributed to its advancement, we may reckon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMBROSE\">Ambrose</a> Parry, Bohn, Butener, Morgagni, Camper, and Gruner. Collections of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, illustrating its principles, have been made by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMMAN\">Amman</a>, Daniel, Bucholz, Pyl, Scherf and Metzger. These are only a few of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> writers who have attended to this science: to enumerate more would be unnecessary.\n\nFrom its very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, it is evident how necessary a knowledge of this science must be to every medical practitioner, who is liable to be called upon to illustrate any question comprehended under it before a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>. On his answers, the fate of the accused person must often depend; both judge and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JURY\">jury</a> regulating their decision by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>. On the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, while he is delivering his sentiments, his own reputation is before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> of the public. The acuteness of the gentlemen of the law is universally acknowledged; the versatility of their genius, and the quickness of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a>, are rendered almost inconceivable, by constant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a>. It is their duty to make every possible exertion for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> of their client, and they seldom leave unnoticed any inaccurate or contradictory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a>. How cautious must, then, a medical practitioner be, when examined before such men, when it is their duty to expose his errors, and magnify his uncertainties, till his evidence seem contradictory and absurd? How often must he expose himself to such severe criticism, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he be not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of the subject on which he is giving evidence, and have not arranged his thoughts on it according to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> principles? On the other hand, he may deserve and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a>, by so public a display of judgment and professional knowledge.\n\nSome acquaintance with this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of medical science must be useful at least, and sometimes necessary, to judges and lawyers. They will thus be enabled to estimate how much they may depend on the opinion of any physician, and will know how to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> their questions, so as to arrive at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, and avoid being misled by his partiality or favourite opinions. To the lawyer who conducts the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of an accused person, in a criminal case, it is almost indispensable; without it, he cannot do justice to the cause of his client.\n\nBefore criminal courts, the questions which occur most generally are, respecting\n\n1. The cause of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, as ascertained from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of the body.\n2. The sufficiency of the supposed cause to have produced death.\n3. Probable event of wounds, contusions, &c.\n4. The importance of the part injured.\n5. Supposed child-murder; whether still-born or not.\n6. Whether death accidental or intended.\n7. Abortion; its having occurred.\n8. Spontaneously, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a>; accidentally, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> violence or passions of the mind; or intentionally, from the introduction of a sharp <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a>, use of certain drugs, &c.\n9. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RAPE\">Rape</a>; its being attempted or consummated; recent or previous defloration.\n10. The responsibility of the accused for his actions.\n\nBefore civil courts the questions generally regard,\n\n1. The state of mind; madness, melancholy, idiosyncrasy.\n2. Pregnancy; concealed, pretended.\n3. Parturition; concealed, pretended, retarded, premature.\n4. The first-born of twins.\n5. Diseases; concealed, pretended, imputed.\n6. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">Age</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>.\n\nBefore consistorial courts, the subjects investigated are;\n\n1. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOTENCE\">Impotence</a>; general, relative, curable, incurable.\n2. Sterility; curable, relatively incurable, absolutely incurable.\n3. Uncertainty of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEX\">sex</a>; hermaphrodites.\n4.

It regards not merely the welfare of individuals, but the prosperity and security of nations. It is perhaps the most important branch of general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-POLICE\">police</a>; for its influence is not confined to those whom accidental circumstances bring within its sphere, but extends over the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> of the state.\nMany of its principles have been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> acknowledged, and considered as necessary consequences of medical and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> truths; and some few of them have acquired the authority of laws. But it was reserved for the philanthropic Frank, to collect the whole into one vast and beneficent system, and to separate it from juridical medicine; in the old systems of which, it was neglected, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> mentioned only in a few short paragraphs. His enlarged mind perceived at once, and fully vindicated its importance. The very name of Medical Police, is now sufficient to attract the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of legislators and of magistrates, and to make them desirous of becoming acquainted with its principles, and anxious to see them carried into execution. In fact, its influence is already visible in the countries where it is cultivated. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> the principles of medical police were separated from the professional <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of medicine, and communicated in a form generally intelligible, in what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> have we reason to expect more beneficial effects from its influence than this? Where is the spirit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRIOTISM\">patriotism</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a> so prevalent? What <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> is more generous in its public institutions. Where does the individual sacrifice a part of his wealth so willingly for the benefit of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a>? It seems only necessary to prove that an undertaking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be of advantage to the state, to have it carried into instant execution. But, can medical knowledge be more usefully employed than in pointing out the means of preserving or improving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>; of supplying healthy nourishment to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>, especially in times of scarcity; of opposing the introduction of contagious diseases, and of checking their progress; of securing to the indigent the advantages intended by their benefactors; of rearing the orphan to be the support of the nation which has adopted him; and of diminishing the horrors of confinement to the poor maniac and the criminal? These good effects are not to be promoted so much by rigid laws, as by recommendation and example. Nor can it be reasonably objected to a system of medical police, that it is a pleasing dream, which flatters the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>, but the execution of which is in reality impracticable. As well might we entirely throw aside the rules of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>, because <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> one is able to observe them all; or live without laws, because no existing code is unexceptionable.\n\nMedical police may be defined,\u2014The application of the principles deduced from the different branches of medical knowledge, for the promotion, preservation and restoration of general health.\n\nThe effects to be expected from it are the general welfare of the state, and increase of healthy population; and are to be attained by means of public institutions, express laws, and popular instruction. Instructing the people, and convincing them of the propriety of certain precautions and attentions, in regard to their own and the general state of health, are necessary to secure the good effects of our public institutions and regulations; to obtain respect and obedience in many things, to which no express <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a> can be adapted; and, to induce them to forego what may be prejudicial to the safety of the community, and of themselves.\n\nPublic medical institutions and laws, must be adapted to the country for which they are intended. Many local circumstances, national character, habits of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, prevalent customs and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROFESSIONS\">professions</a>, situation, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, &c., make considerable varieties necessary. And many institutions, many a law which would be highly beneficial to the public health, in some circumstances, would be useless, impracticable, and even hurtful, in others. These causes and their effects, must, therefore, be particularly attended to.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> authors who have written on this subject, are Alberti, Heister, Flaz, Frank, Hussey, Metzger, and Hebenstreit; to whom we may add Howard and Rumford.\n\nThe subjects which it comprehends, cannot be classified very regularly or systematically.

But, on the contrary, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the child be low, sunk, and much weakened, repeated doses of the spirit of hartshorn, and the like reviving medicines, ought to be prescribed. Blister applied to the back, or behind the ears, will often be proper in both cases. A prudent administration of opiates, when their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> is not forbidden by costiveness or otherwise, is sometimes of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> in difficult teething, as, by mitigating pain, they have a tendency to prevent its bad effects, such as a fever, convulsions, or other violent symptoms; and often they are absolutely necessary, along with the testaceous powders, for checking an immoderate diarrhoea.\n\nWhen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHARTICS\">cathartics</a> are necessary, if the child seems too tender and weak to bear their immediate operation, they should be given to the nurse; in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> they will communicate so much of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> powers to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILK\">milk</a> as will be sufficient to purge the infant. This at least certainly holds with regard to some cathartics; such, for example, as the infusion of sena, particularly if a very weak infusion be employed, and not used to such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> as to operate as a purgative to the nurse.\n\nAs most young children, if in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, naturally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a> much, and pretty soundly, we may always be apt to suspect that something is amiss when they begin to be subject to watchings and frights; symptoms which seldom or never occur but either in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of some present disorder not perceived, or as the certain forerunners of an approaching indisposition. We should immediately, therefore, endeavour to find out the cause of watchfulness, that we may use every possible means to remove or prevent it; otherwise the want of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> rest, which is so very prejudicial to persons of all ages, will soon reduce the infant to a low and emaciated state, which may be followed by a hectic fever, diarrhoea, and all the other consequences of weakness. These symptoms, being always the effects of irritation and pain, may proceed, in very young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANTS\">infants</a>, from crudities or other affections of the producing flatulencies or gripes; about the sixth or seventh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>, they may be owing to that uneasiness which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> accompanies the breeding of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>; and after a child is weaned, and begins to use a different kind of food, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORMS\">worms</a> become frequently an additional cause of watchings and disturbed sleep. Hence, to give the necessary relief on these occasions, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> complaint must first be ascertained from the child's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> and other concomitant circumstances, and afterwards treated according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the case. Women and nurses are too apt to have recourse to opiates in the watchings of children, especially when their own rest happens to be much disturbed by their continual noise and clamour. But this practice is often prejudicial, and never ought to have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> when the belly is in the least obstructed.\n\nThere is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> complaint more frequent among children than that of worms, the general symptoms of which have been already enumerated; but it must be observed, that all the symptoms commonly attributed to worms, may be produced by a foulness of the bowels. Hence practitioners ought never to rest satisfied with administering to their patients such medicines as are possessed only of an anthelmintic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, but to join them with those which are particularly adapted for cleansing the prime via; as it is uncertain whether a foulness of the bowels may not be the cause of all the complaints. This practice is still the more advisable, on account of viscid humours in the intestines affording lodgement to the ova of worms; which, without the convenience of such a receptacle, would be more speedily discharged from the body.\n\nThe difficulty of curing what is called a worm fever, arises, according to Dr Musgrave, from its being frequently attributed to worms, when the cause of the disorder is of a quite different nature. He does not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> to deny that worms do sometimes abound in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> body, nor that the irritation caused by them does sometimes produce a fever; but he apprehends these cases to be much more uncommon than is generally imagined, and that great mischief is done by treating some of the disorders of children as worm cases, which are really not so. Dr Hunter is of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> on this point. He has, we are told, dissected great numbers of children who have been supposed to die of worm fevers, and whose complaints were of course treated as proceeding from worms, in whom, however, there appeared, upon dissection, to be not only no worms, but evident proofs of the disorder's having been of a very different nature.\n\nThe spurious worm fever, as Dr Musgrave terms it, has, in all the instances he has seen of it, arisen evidently from the children having been indulged with too great quantities of fruit. Every sort of fruit eaten in excess will probably produce it; but an immoderate use of cherries seems to be the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> cause of it. The approach of this disorder has a different appearance, according as it arises from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of eating fruit in rather too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> quantities, or from an excessive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> eaten at one time. In the former case, the patient gradually grows weak and languid; his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> becomes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> and livid; his belly swells and grows hard; his appetite and digestion are destroyed; his nights grow restless, or at least his sleep is much disturbed with startings, and then the fever soon follows, in the progress of which, the patient grows comatose, and at times convulsed; in which state, when it takes place to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, he often dies. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULSE\">pulse</a> at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WRIST\">wrist</a>, though quick, is never strong or hard; the carotids, however, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> with great violence, and elevate the skin so as to be distinctly seen at a distance. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> is at times considerable, especially in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a>; though at other times, when the brain is much oppressed, it is little more than natural. It is sometimes accompanied by a violent pain of the epigastric region, though more commonly the pain is slight, and terminates in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMA\">coma</a>; some degree of pain, however, seems to be inseparable from it, so as clearly to distinguish this disorder from other comatose affections.\n\nWhen a large quantity of fruit has been eaten at once, the attack of the disorder is instantaneous, and its progress rapid; the patient often passing, in the space of a few hours, from apparently perfect health, to a stupid, comatose, and almost dying state. The symptoms of the fever, when formed, are in both cases nearly the same; except that, in this latter sort, a little purulent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> is sometimes discharged, both by vomit\nDiseases of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-URINE\">urine</a> and stool, from the very first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>. The stools, in both cases, exhibit sometimes a kind of curd resembling carded milk; at other times a floating substance is observed in them; and sometimes a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of little threads and pellicles, and now and then a single worm.\n\nStrong purgatives, or purges frequently repeated, in this disorder, are greatly condemned by Dr Armstrong, as they in general not only aggravate the symptoms already present, but are sometimes the origin of convulsions. Bloodletting is not to be thought of in any stage of the disorder.\n\nAlthough frequent purging, however, be not recommended, yet a single vomit and purge are advised in the beginning of the disorder, with a view to evacuate such indigested matter and mucus as happens to remain in the stomach and bowels. These having operated properly, there is seldom occasion for repeating them; and it is sufficient, if the body be costive, to throw up, every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> or third day, a clyster, composed of some grains of aloes, dissolved in five or six ounces of infusion of chamomile.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the cure, however, depends upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> applications to the bowels and stomach; and as the cause of the disorder is of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> nature, the applications must be warm, cordial, and invigorating; and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> must be promoted by constant actual heat.\n\nWhen any nervous symptoms come on, or remain after the disorder is abated, they are easily removed by giving a pill with a grain or two of asafoetida once or twice a-day.\n\nThe diagnostics of worms are very uncertain; but, even in real worm cases, the treatment above recommended would, it is imagined, be much more efficacious than the practice commonly had recourse to. As worms either find the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> weakly, or very soon make it so, the frequent repetition of purges, particularly mercurials, cannot but have a pernicious effect. Bear's-foot is still more exceptionable, being in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> to be ranked rather among poisons than medicines. Worm seed and bitters are too offensive to the palate and stomach to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> persisted in, though sometimes very useful. The powder of coralline creates disgust by its quantity; and the infusion of pink root is well known to occasion now and then vertiginous complaints and fits.\n\nFomenting the belly night and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> with a strong decoction of rue and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WORMWOOD\">wormwood</a>, is much recommended. It is a perfectly safe remedy, and, by invigorating the bowels, may therefore have some influence in rendering them capable of expelling such worms as they happen to contain. After the fomentation, it is advised to anoint the belly with a liniment, composed of one part of essential <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> of rue, and two parts of a decoction of rue in sweet oil. It is, however, a matter of great doubt whether these external applications, in consequence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> with which they are impregnated, exert any influence on the worms themselves.\n\nThe diet of children disposed to worms should be warm and nourishing, consisting in part at least of animal food, which is not the worse for being a little seasoned. Their drink may be any kind of beer that is well hopped, with now and then a small draught of porter or negus. A total <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTINENCE\">abstinence</a> from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a> is not so necessary, perhaps, as is generally imagined. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">Poor</a> cheese must by all means be avoided, but such as is rich and pungent, in a moderate quantity, is particularly serviceable. In the spurious worm fever, the patient should be supported occasionally by small quantities of broth; and, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of it, when the appetite returns, the first food given should be of the kinds above recommended.\n\nThe diet here recommended will, perhaps, be thought extraordinary, as the general idea is at present, that, in the management of children, nothing is so much to be avoided as repletion and rich food. It is no doubt an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> to feed children too well, or to indulge them with wine and rich sauces; but it is equally an error to confine them to too strict or too poor a diet, which weakens their digestion, and renders them much more subject to disorders of every kind, but particularly to disorders of the bowels. In regard to the spurious worm fever, if it be true that acid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> too plentifully eaten are the general cause of it, it follows as a consequence, that a warm nutritious diet, moderately used, will most effectually counteract the mischief, and soonest restore the natural powers of the stomach. Besides, if the disorder does not readily yield to the methods here directed, as there are many examples of its terminating by an inflammation and suppuration of the navel, it is highly advisable to keep this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> in view, and, by a moderate allowance of animal food, to support those powers of nature, from which only such a happy crisis is to be expected.\n\nBesides these, many other diseases might here be mentioned, which, if not peculiar to infants, are at least peculiarly modified by the infant state. But into details respecting these we cannot propose to enter. It is sufficient to say, that due regard being paid to age and constitution, the cure is to be conducted on the same general principles as in the adult state.","sp":521,"ep":522},{"h":"MEDICIS","t":"Cosmo de, was born in the year 1389, and was in the prime of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of his father Giovanni. His conduct was distinguished for urbanity and kindness to the superior ranks of his fellow-citizens, and by a constant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to the wants of the lower class, whom his munificence abundantly relieved. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a> and moderation, however, could not repress the ambitious designs of the rival families, the Florentines and Medici; for in 1433, Rinaldo de Albizi, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of a formidable party, carried the appointment of the magistracy. On returning from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> seat he was seized upon by his adversaries, and committed to prison. The conspirators not agreeing as to the proper method of dispatching their prisoner, one Peruzzi recommended <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POISON\">poison</a>, which was heard by Cosmo, who refused to take any other sustenance than a small portion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>. In this dismal situation he remained four days, shut up from all his kindred and friends, where he soon expected to be numbered with the dead. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> employed to take him off, unexpectedly proved his friend. Malavolta, the keeper of the prison, relented, and declared that he had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> reason to be alarmed, as he hesitated not to eat of every thing that was brought him.\n\nHis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> Lorenzo, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUSIN\">cousin</a> Averardo, raised a considerable body of men in Romagna and other districts; and being joined by the commander of the republican forces, they marched to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLORENCE\">Florence</a> to relieve him. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECREE\">decree</a> was obtained from the magistracy, by which he was banished to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PADUA\">Padua</a> for ten years, his brother to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a> for five, and several of their relations shared a similar fate. Padua was in the dominions of Venice, and he received a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEPUTATION\">deputation</a> from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a> before he reached it, promising him their protection and assistance in whatever he should desire. He rather experienced the treatment of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> than of an exile, as they entertained the highest expectations from his great commercial knowledge. From this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> his life may be considered as one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of uninterrupted prosperity, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> received <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> equal to that of the greatest potentates. In his public and private charities he was almost unbounded, and perhaps possessed more wealth than any single individual in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> at that period. In his promotion of science and encouragement of learned men he was truly exemplary, and from this source he acquired the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> and esteem.\n\nHis fostering <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> protected the arts as well as the sciences; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCULPTURE\">sculpture</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a>, all flourished under his powerful protection. The countenance he showed to these arts was not such as their professors generally receive from the great; for the sums of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> which he expended on pictures, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATUES\">statues</a>, and public buildings, appear almost incredible. When he approached the period of his mortal existence, his faculties were still unimpaired; and 20 days before he died, he requested Ficino to translate from the Greek the treatise of Xenocrates on death. He died on the 1st of August 1464, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of 75, and gave strict injunctions, that his funeral should be conducted with as much privacy as possible. By public decree he was honoured with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of Pater Patriae, an appellation which was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSCRIBED\">inscribed</a> on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOMB\">tomb</a>, and was declared by competent judges, to be founded in real merit.\n\nMedici, Lorenzo de, stiled, with great propriety, the Magnificent, was the grandson of Cosmo, and about 16 years of age at his decease. In 1469 his father died, and he succeeded to his authority as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> it had constituted a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his fortune. In the year 1474, Lorenzo incurred the displeasure of the pope for the opposition\nhe made to some of his encroachments on the petty princes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, and for this reason he deprived him of the office of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURER\">treasurer</a> of the Roman see, which he conferred on one Pazzi, connected with a Florentine family, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> of which he thus secured, and intended to sacrifice Lorenzo and Juliano to his private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a>. Their assassination was fixed for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUNDAY\">Sunday</a>, April 26, 1478, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHEDRAL\">cathedral</a> was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in which a monster of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> had resolved to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> them by the instigation of the pope. When the people <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> one of their favourites (Juliano) expiring, and the other (Lorenzo) covered with blood, their rage was not to be expressed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>. The interference of the magistrates was finally victorious, who had the courage and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> to hang the archbishop from one of the windows, arrayed in his pontifical robes, which made Florence resound with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCLAMATION\">acclamation</a>\u2014Medici, Medici! <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> with their enemies!\n\nLorenzo was delivered from that part of the cathedral to which he had fled for refuge, and was triumphantly carried home, where his wounds were attended to by men of ability. His friends in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> pursued the conspirators, and spared none who happened to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> in their way. In a word, the generality of them were either hanged <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> decapitated, and very few had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOOD_FORTUNE\">good fortune</a> to escape their uncommon vigilance. Much to the honour of Lorenzo, he exerted all his influence to prevent the indiscriminate massacre of his cruel enemies, and restrain the just indignation of the people, begging that they would trust the magistrates with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> of the guilty; and the respect in which he was held had the most astonishing effect in restraining the vengeance of popular indignation.\n\nNo sooner had hostilities ceased between Pope Sextus and the Florentine republic, than Lorenzo began to develope plans for securing the internal peace and tranquillity of Italy, by which the highest honour has been conferred on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> life. But the life of this great man was again brought into imminent danger by the intrigues of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARDINAL\">Cardinal</a> Riaro, and some Florentine exiles, who determined to assassinate him in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> of the Carmeli, on the festival of the Ascension 1481; but the plot was happily discovered, the conspirators were executed, and after this Lorenzo very seldom went abroad without being surrounded by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of friends in whom he could securely confide.\n\nWhen we attentively examine the character of Lorenzo, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not perhaps appear astonishing, that Italy, Christendom, and even the Mahometans themselves, conferred upon him the most flattering approbation. Even Prince <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MIRANDOLA\">Mirandola</a> chose Florence as the place of his residence entirely upon his account, and there ended his mortal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAREER\">career</a>. To a most engaging person Lorenzo added almost every other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCOMPLISHMENT\">accomplishment</a>. He was the favourite of the ladies, the envy of his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEX\">sex</a>, and the admiration of all. He was declared to be unrivalled in chivalry, and one of the most eminent orators that the world in any age has produced. According to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of his contemporaries, he was even superior to Julius Caesar himself; except as a general, yet he would also have proved a most consummate commander had not peace been always the darling of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a>. We recollect a memorable passage in the Rambler, which may here be appositely introduced. A\n\ngreat man condescending to do little things, is like the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> in his western declination; he remits his splendor, but retains his magnitude, and pleases more though he dazzles less. To such little things did Lorenzo frequently submit, often seeking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> in his nursery, and spending hours there in all the frivolous pranks of childish diversion. The gravity of his life, if contrasted with its levity, must make him appear as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of two different persons, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a>, and, as it were, impossible to be joined the one with the other.\n\nSuch were the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> and veneration of the citizens for Lorenzo, that the physician who attended him on his deathbed, terrified to return to Florence, left the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> in a state of distraction, and plunged himself into a well. When Ferdinand <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPLES\">Naples</a> was informed of his death, he cried out, \"This man has lived <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> enough for his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>, but too short a time for Italy.\" He died on the 8th of April 1492, amidst a number of his weeping friends, who appeared deeply conscious of such an irreparable loss.\n\nMedicis, John de, on account of his bravery and knowledge in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> affairs, was surnamed the Incincible. He was the son of John, otherwise called Jourdain, de Medicis. His only son Cosmo I. styled the Great, was chosen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Florence after the murder of Alexander de Medicis, A.D. 1537. He first carried arms under Laurence de Medicis against the duke of Urbino, afterwards under Pope Leo X. Upon the death of Leo, he entered into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> of Francis I., which he quitted to follow the fortune of Francis Sforza, duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILAN\">Milan</a>. When Francis I. formed an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> with the pope and the Venetians against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a>, he returned to his service. He was wounded in the knee at Governola, a small town in the Mantuan territory, by a musket <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a>; and being carried to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANTUA\">Mantua</a>, he died the 29th of November 1526, aged 28. Brantome relates, that when his leg was to be cut off, and when he was informed that he needed some person to support him, \"Proceed without fear (said he), I need nobody!\" and he held the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a> himself during the operation. This anecdote is also mentioned by Varchi. John de Medicis was above the middle stature, strong, and nervous. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a>, to express their affection for him and their concern for his loss, assumed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOURNING\">mourning</a> dress and standards, which gave the name of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> band to the Tuscan troops whom he commanded.\n\nMedicis, Laurence or Laurencin de, was descended from a brother of Cosmo the Great, and affected the name of popular. In 1537, he killed Alexander de Medicis, whom <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> V. had made duke of Florence, and who was believed to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> son of Laurence de Medicis duke of Urbino. He was jealous of Alexander's power, and disguised this jealousy under the specious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRETEXT\">pretext</a> of love to his country. He loved men of learning, and cultivated literature. His works are, 1. Lamenti, Modem, 12mo. 2. Acidosio Commedia, Florence 1595, 12mo. He died without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a>.\n\nMedicis, Hypolitus de, natural son of Julian de Medicis and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a> of Urbino, was early remarkable for the brilliancy of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WIT\">wit</a> and the graces of his person. Pope Clement VII. his cousin, made him cardinal in 1529, and sent him as legate into Germany to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of Charles V. When that prince went into Italy, Medicis, yielding to his warlike disposition, appeared...\nappeared in the dress of an officer, and advanced before the emperor, followed by several respectable gentlemen of the court. Charles, naturally suspicious, and afraid that the legate intended to do him some ill offices with the pope, sent after him and caused him to be apprehended. But when he understood that it was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> sally of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a> in the young cardinal, he set him at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> in a few days. The character which Medicis obtained by the happy success of this appointment was of essential service to him. He was considered as one of the Supports of the Holy See; and a little before Clement's death, when the corsair Barbarossa made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> into Italy to the great terror of Rome, which was only defended by 200 of the pope's guards, Medicis was despatched to protect the coasts from the fury of the barbarians. On his arrival at the place of destination, he was fortunate enough to find that Barbarossa had withdrawn himself at that critical moment; which allowed him to claim the honour of the retreat without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> his person or his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>. When he returned to Rome, he was of great service in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a> of Paul III., who nevertheless refused to make him legate to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANCONA\">Ancona</a>, though that office had been promised to him in the conclave. Enraged also that the pope had bestowed the principality of Florence on Alexander de Medicis, supposed to be the natural son of Laurence duke of Urbino, he was prompted by his ambition to believe that he might succeed to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> by the destruction of Alexander. He entered into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSPIRACY\">conspiracy</a> against him, and determined to carry him off by a mine; but the plot was discovered before he had accomplished his purpose. Octavian Zanga, one of his guards, was arrested as his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ACCOMPLICE\">accomplice</a>. Hypolitus de Medicis, apprehensive for his own safety, retired to a castle near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIVOLI\">Tivoli</a>. On his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> to Naples, he fell sick at Itri in the territory of Fondi, and died August 13, 1535, in his 24th year, not without suspicion of being poisoned. His house was an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASYLUM\">asylum</a> for the unfortunate, and frequently for those who were guilty of the blackest crimes. It was open to men of all nations; and he was frequently addressed in twenty different languages. He had a natural son named Asdrubal de Medicis, who was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNIGHT\">knight</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALTA\">Malta</a>. This anecdote proves that his manners were more military than ecclesiastic. He wore a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>, and never put on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of cardinal except on occasions of public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a>. He was wholly devoted to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEATRE\">theatre</a>, hunting, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a>.\n\nMedicis, Alexander de, first duke of Florence in 1530, was natural son of Laurence de Medicis, surnamed the Younger, and nephew of Pope Clement VII. He owed his elevation to the intrigues of his uncle and to the arms of Charles V. This prince having made himself <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of Florence after an obstinate siege, conferred the sovereignty of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> on Alexander, and afterwards gave him in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> Margaret of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUSTRIA\">Austria</a> his natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a>. According to the terms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITULATION\">capitulation</a> granted to the Florentines, the new duke was to be only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> doge, and his authority was tempered by councils; which left them at least a shadow of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> liberty. But Alexander, who felt himself supported by the emperor and the pope, was no sooner in possession of his new dignity, than he began to govern like a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRANT\">tyrant</a>; being guided by no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a> but his own caprice, indulging the Medicis most brutal passions, and making <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> of dishonouring families, and of violating even the asylum of the cloisters to gratify his lust. Among the confidants of his debauchery was a relation of his own, Laurence de Medicis. This young man, who was only 22 years of age, at the instigation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a> Strozzi, a zealous republican, conceived the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of assassinating Alexander, and thereby of delivering his country from oppression. From the moment when he first became attached to him, he tried to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> his confidence, for no other reason but that he might the better have it in his power to take away his life. A considerable time elapsed before he found such an opportunity as he desired. At length, under pretence of procuring the duke a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with a lady of whom he was deeply enamoured, he brought him alone and unattended into his chamber, and put him under his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a>. He went out, under pretence of introducing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>; and returned along with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ASSASSIN\">assassin</a> by profession, to whom alone he had entrusted his design, only to stab him. This cruel scene happened on the night between the 5th and 6th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1537. Alexander was only 26 years of age. The Florentines derived no advantage from this crime of Laurence, for they failed in their attempt to recover their liberty. The party of the Medicis prevailed, and Alexander was succeeded by Cosmo: whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, it must be confessed, was as just and moderate, as that of his predecessors had been violent and tyrannical. Laurence de Medicis fled to Venice, to some of the leaders of the malecontents at Florence, who had taken refuge there; but not thinking himself in sufficient security, he went to Constantinople, whence he returned some time after to Venice. He was there assassinated in 1547, ten years after the duke's murder, by two soldiers, one of whom had formerly been in Alexander's guards: And these soldiers were generous enough to refuse a considerable sum of money, which was the price put upon his head.\n\nMedicis, Cosmo de, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TUSCANY\">Tuscany</a>, joined Charles V. against the French, after trying in vain to continue neutral. As a reward for his services, the emperor added to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUCHY\">duchy</a> of Tuscany <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PIOMBINO\">Piombino</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLE\">isle</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELBA\">Elba</a>, and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>. Cosmo soon after received from Pope Pius IV. the title of grand duke, and had it not been opposed by all the princes of Italy, this pontiff, who was entirely devoted to Cosmo, because he had thought proper to acknowledge him to be of his house, would have conferred on him the title of king. There never was a more zealous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a> of learning. Ambitious of imitating the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> Caesar, he like him, was fond of learned men, kept them near his person, and founded for them the university of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PISA\">Pisa</a>.

It had for some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> a school of philosophers, called the Megarici, successors of Euclid the Socratic, a native of Megara. Their dialect was the Doric; changed from the Attic, which it formerly had been, because of Peloponnesian colonists who settled there.\n\nMegara was situated at a distance from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, about midway between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a> and Corinth. Its port was called Nisera, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NISUS\">Nisus</a> son of Pandon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, who obtained Megaris for his portion, when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of Athens was divided into four lots by his father. He founded the town, which was eighteen stadia <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> two miles and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> from the city, but united with it, as the Piraeus with Athens, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> walls. It had a temple of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CERES\">Ceres</a>. \"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a> (says Pausanias) may be supposed to have fallen through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>.\" The site (as Dr Chandler informs us*) is now covered with rubbish, among which are standing some ruinous churches. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> has been named from them Dode Ecclesiis, \"The Twelve Churches;\" but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> is reduced to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a>. The acropolis or citadel, called also Nisera, was on a rock by the sea side. Some pieces of the wall remain, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> fortress has been erected on it, and also on a lesser rock near it.\n\nThe village Megara (continues the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a>) consists of low <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> cottages pleasantly situated on the slope of a brow or promontory indented in the middle. On each side of this vale was an acropolis or citadel; one named <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARIA\">Caria</a>; the other from Alcathous, the builder of the wall. They related, that he was assisted by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOLLO\">Apollo</a>, who laid his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARP\">harp</a> aside on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, which, as Pausanias testifies, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> struck with a pebble returned a musical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a>. An <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> of the wall of one citadel is seen by a windmill. The masonry is of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> called Incertum. In 1676 the city wall was not entirely demolished, but comprehended the two summits, on which are some churches, with a portion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> toward the south. The whole site, except the hills, was now green with corn, and marked by many heaps of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, the collected rubbish of buildings. A few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-INSCRIPTIONS\">inscriptions</a> are found, with pedestals fixed in the walls and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERTED\">inverted</a>; and also some maimed or mutilated\nMegara, mutilated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATUES\">statues</a>. One of the former relates to Atticus Herodes, and is on a pedestal which supported a statue erected to him when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSUL\">consul</a>, A.D. 143, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> and people of Megara, in return for his benefactions and good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> toward the city. In the plain behind the summits, on one of which was a temple of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINERVA\">Minerva</a>, is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> basin of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, with scattered fragments of marble, the remains of a bath or of a fountain, which is recorded as in the city, and remarkable for its size and ornaments, and for the number of its columns. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> was named from the local nymphs called Sithnides.\n\nThe stone of Megara was of a kind not discovered anywhere else in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HELLAS\">Hellas</a>; very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>, uncommonly soft, and consisting entirely of cockle shells. This was chiefly used; and, not being durable, may be reckoned among the causes of the desolation at Megara, which is so complete, that one searches in vain for vestiges of the many public edifices, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a>, and sepulchres, which once adorned the city.\n\nMegara was engaged in various wars with Athens and Corinth, and experienced many vicissitudes of fortune. It was the only one of the Greek cities which did not flourish under their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> benefactor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HADRIAN\">Hadrian</a>; and the reason assigned is, that the avenging <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a> of the gods pursued the people for their impiety in killing Anthemocritus, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERALD\">herald</a>, who had been sent to them in the time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERICLES\">Pericles</a>. The Athenian generals were sworn on his account to invade them twice a-year. Hadrian and Atticus were followed by another friend, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> is preserved by an inscription on a stone lying near a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> in the village:\n\n\"This too is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of the most magnificent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNT\">count</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIOGENES\">Diogenes</a> son of Archelaus, who regarding the Grecian cities as his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, has bestowed on that of the Megarensians one hundred pieces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> of their towers, and also one hundred and fifty more, with two thousand two hundred feet of marble toward re-edifying the bath; deeming nothing more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> than to do good to the Greeks, and to restore their cities.\" This person is not quite unnoticed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>. He was one of the generals employed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> Anastasius on a rebellion in Isauria. He surprised the capital Claudiopolis, and sustained a siege with great bravery, A.D. 494.\n\nMegara retains its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> name. It has been much infested by corsairs; and in 1676 the inhabitants were accustomed, on seeing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a> approach in the daytime or hearing their dogs bark at night, immediately to secrete their effects and run away. The vauvode or Turkish governor, who resided in a forsaken tower above the village, was once carried off. It is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> wonder, therefore, that Nissa has been long abandoned. The place was burned by the Venetians in 1687.\n\nMegara, in Ancient Geography, formerly called Hybla, a town towards the east <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SICILY\">Sicily</a>; extinct in Strabo's time, though the name Hybla remained on account of the excellence of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a>. It was a colony of Megareans from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>. Risus Megaricus denotes a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> laugh.\n\nMegaris, in Ancient Geography, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> of the Megareans, is described as a rough region, like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTICA\">Attica</a>; the mountain called Oenian or the Asinine, now Macriplagi or \"the long Mountain,\" extending through it towards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOEOTIA\">Boeotia</a> and Mount Cithaeron. It belonged to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IONIA\">Ionia</a> or Attica, until it was taken by the Peloponnesians in the reign of Codrus, when a colony of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DORIANS\">Dorians</a> settled in it. This territory had Attica to the east, Boeotia to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> and west, and the isthmus of Corinth to the south.\n\nMegaris, a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> in the Tuscan sea, joined to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPLES\">Naples</a> by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a>, now called Castello dell'Ovo.\n\nMegasthenes, a Greek historian in the age of Seleucus Nicanor, about 300 years before Christ.

Henry, his son, was born at Lubeck in 1638; became professor of physic at Helmstadt; and, besides works in his own profession, published Scriptores rerum Germanicarum, 3 vols. folio, 1688; a very useful collection, first begun by his father.\u2014Marcus Meibomius, of the same family, published a collection of seven Greek authors who had written upon ancient music, with a Latin version by himself, dedicated to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHRISTINA\">Christina</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a>, who invited him to her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">court</a>. But she engaging him one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> to sing an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> of ancient music, while somebody was ordered to dance to it, the immoderate noise which this occasioned in the spectators so disgusted him, that he immediately left the court of Sweden. His edition of the Greek mythologists, and notes upon Diogenes Laertius in Menage's edition, show him to have been a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of learning; but he suffered no little railing for his attempt to correct the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEBREW\">Hebrew</a> text of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIBLE\">Bible</a>, by a kind of metre he fancied he had found out in these ancient writings.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEISSEN\">Meissen</a>, a considerable town of Germany, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELECTORATE\">electorate</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAXONY\">Saxony</a>, and in the margravate of Misnia, with a castle.

His three books of Cosmography, or De situ orbis, are written in a concise, perspicuous, and elegant manner; and have been thought worthy of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> and labours of the ablest critics. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Vossius gave an edition of them in 1638, 4to, with very large and copious notes.

He lived at Pylos in Peloponnese. His servants once killed two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERPENTS\">serpents</a> who had made their nests at the bottom of a large oak; and Melampus paid so much regard to their remains, that he raised a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> pile and burned them upon it. He also took particular care of their young ones, and fed them with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>. Some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> after this, the young serpents crept to Melampus as he slept on the grass near the oak; and, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> sensible of the favours of their benefactor, they wantonly played around him, and softly licked his ears. This awoke Melampus, who was astonished at the sudden change which his senses had undergone. He found himself acquainted with the chirping of the birds, and with all their rude notes, as they flew around him. He took advantage of this supernatural gift, and soon made himself perfect in the knowledge of futurity, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOLLO\">Apollo</a> also instructed him in the art of medicine. He had soon after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> of curing the daughters of Pretus, by giving them hellebore, which from that circumstance has been called melampodium; and, as a reward for his trouble, he married the eldest of these princesses. The tyranny of his uncle Neleus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> of Pylos, obliged him to leave his native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>; and Pretus, to show himself more sensible of his services, gave him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>. About this time the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> charms of Pero, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of Neleus, had gained many admirers; but the father promised his daughter only to him who brought into his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> the oxen of Iphiclus. This condition displeased many; but Bias, who was also one of her admirers, engaged his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> Melampus to steal the oxen and deliver them to him. Melampus was caught in the attempt, and imprisoned; and nothing but his services as a soothsayer and physician to Iphiclus would have saved him from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. All this pleaded in the favour of Melampus; but when he had taught the childless Iphiclus how to become a father, he not only obtained his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, but also the oxen; and with them he compelled Neleus to give Pero in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> to Bias.

In his youth he made an admirable progress in learning, and was made Greek professor at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WITTENBERG\">Wittenberg</a> in 1529. Here his lectures upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOMER\">Homer</a> and the Greek text of St Paul's Epistle to Titus, drew to him a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of auditors, and entirely effaced the contempt to which his low stature and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> appearance had exposed him. Melancthon reduced the sciences to systems; and acquired such reputation, that he had sometimes 2500 auditors. He soon entered into an intimate friendship with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUTHER\">Luther</a>, who taught <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a> in the same university; and in 1519 they went together to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LEIPZIG\">Leipzig</a>, to dispute with Eccius. The following years he was continually engaged in various employments; he composed several books; he taught divinity; took several journeys, in order to found colleges and visit churches; and in 1530 drew up a confession of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>, which goes by the name of the Confession of Augsburg, because it was presented to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> at the diet held in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a>. All <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> was convinced that he was not, like Luther, backward to accommodate the differences between the various sects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>. He hated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> disputes, and was drawn into them only through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> he was called to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> in the world; and therefore would have sacrificed many things to have produced an union among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROTESTANTS\">Protestants</a>. For this reason, Francis I., the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a>, wrote to desire him to come and confer with the doctors of the Sorbonne, in order to agree with them about putting an end to all controversies; but though Luther endeavoured to persuade the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTOR\">elector</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAXONY\">Saxony</a> to consent to that journey, and though Melancthon himself desired it, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>, whether he distrusted Melancthon's moderation, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> was afraid of quarrelling with the emperor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> V., would never <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> his permission. The king of England also in vain desired to see him. Melancthon, in 1529, assisted at the conferences of Spires. In 1541, he was at the famous conferences at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATISBON\">Ratisbon</a>. In 1543, he went to meet the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOGNE\">Cologne</a> to assist him in introducing the reformation into his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIOCESE\">diocese</a>; but that project came to nothing; and in 1548, he assisted at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> conferences on the subject of the interim of Charles V., and wrote a censure on that interim, and all the writings presented at these conferences. He was extremely affected at the dissensions raised by Flaccus Illyricus. His last conference with those of the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNION\">communion</a> was at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORMS\">Worms</a>, in 1557. He died at Wittenberg in 1560, and was interred near Luther. Some days before he died, he wrote upon a piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> the reasons which made him look upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>; that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> of them was, that it \"delivered him from theological persecutions.\" <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">Nature</a> had given Melancthon a peaceable temper, which was but ill suited to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> he was to live in. His moderation served only to be his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a>. He was like a lamb in the midst of wolves. Nobody liked his mildness; it looked as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he was...\nwas lukewarm; and even Luther himself was sometimes angry at it.\n\nMelancthon was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> in whom many good as well as great qualities were wonderfully united. He had great parts, great learning, great sweetness of temper, moderation, contentedness, and the like, which would have made him very happy in any other times but those in which he lived. He never affected dignities, or honours, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a>, but was rather negligent of all these things; too much so in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of some, considering he had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>; and his son-in-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a> Sabinus, who was of a more ambitious temper, was actually at variance with him upon this very account. Learning was infinitely obliged to him on many accounts: on none more than this, that, as already observed, he reduced almost all the sciences which had been taught before in a vague <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> manner into systems. Considering the distractions of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, and the infinity of disputes and tumults in which he was engaged, it is astonishing how he could find leisure to write so many books. Their number is prodigious, insomuch that it was thought necessary to publish a chronological catalogue of them in the year 1582. His works indeed are not correct, and he himself owned it: but as he found them useful, he chose rather to print a great number, than to finish only a few: \"which however (as Bayle says), was postponing his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> to the advantage of others.\" His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> was very weak, and required great tenderness and management; which made Luther, as hot and zealous as he was, blame him for labouring too earnestly in the vineyard.","sp":539,"ep":540},{"h":"MELANIPPIDES","t":"in fabulous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, a Greek poet about 520 years before Christ.

The scripture tells us nothing either of his father, or of his mother, or of Melchisedec's genealogy, or of his birth, or of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. And yet in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> he was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a> Christ, as St Paul affirms, who is a priest for ever, according to the order of Melchisedec, and not according to the order of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-AARON\">Aaron</a>, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, and death, are known. When <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABRAHAM\">Abraham</a> returned from pursuing the four confederate kings, who had defeated the kings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SODOM\">Sodom</a> and Gomorrah, and had taken away <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOT\">Lot</a>, Abraham's nephew, along with them (Gen. xiv. 17, 18, 19, &c.), Melchisedec came to meet Abraham as far as the valley of Shaveh, who was afterwards named the King's valley, presented him with the refreshment of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a> and wine (or he offered bread and wine in sacrifice to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a>, for he was a priest of the most high God), and blessed him. Abraham being desirous to acknowledge in him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of priest of the Lord, offered him the tythes of all he had taken from the enemy. After this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, there is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> mention made of the person of Melchisedec: only the Psalmist (cx. 4.) speaking of the Messiah, says, \"Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.\" St Paul, in his epistle to the Hebrews, unfolds the mystery which is concealed in what is said of Melchisedec in the Old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a>. See Heb. v. 6\u201410. An infinite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of difficulties and scruples have been started on the subject of Melchisedec.\u2014St Jerome thought that Salem, of which Melchisedec was king, was not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a>, but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Salem near Scythopolis, where they still pretended to show the ruins of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>. The greatness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of these ruins are a sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the magnificence of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>. He thinks it was at this city of Salem or Shalem, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JACOB\">Jacob</a> arrived after his passage over Jordan, at his return from Mesopotamia (Gen. xxxiii. 18.). Some believe that Salem, where Melchisedec reigned, is the same as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SALIM\">Salim</a> spoken of in the gospel of St John, chap. iii. 23. From the time of Epiphanes, there were names invented for the father and mother of Melchisedec. To his father was given the name of Heracles or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERCULES\">Hercules</a>, and to his mother that of Ashtaroth or Astaria. It is generally agreed on by the learned, that when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APOSTLE\">apostle</a> says, he was \"without father and without mother,\" no more is meant, than that he is introduced into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of Abraham without acquainting us who he was, or whence he came, where he lived or when he died. Nevertheless, some have taken St Paul's words literally, and contended that he was not of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> but divine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGEN\">Origen</a> and Didymus took him to be an angel; and the author of the Questions upon the Old and New Testaments pretends, that he was the Holy Ghost, who appeared to Abraham in a human form. The Arabic Catena upon the ninth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENESIS\">Genesis</a>, makes Melchisedec to be descended from Shem by his father, and from Japheth by his mother. Heracles or Herachim his father, was, they say, son or grandson of Phaleg, and son of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEBER\">Heber</a>; and his mother, named Salathiel, was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of Gomer son of Japheth. Cedrenus and others derive Melchisedec from an Egyptian stock. They say his father was called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIDON\">Sidon</a> or Sida, and was the founder of the city of Sidon, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of Phoenicia. Snidas says he was of the cursed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CANAAN\">Canaan</a>; for which reason the scripture does not mention his genealogy. The Jews and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SAMARITANS\">Samaritans</a> believed Melchisedec to be the same\nsame with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRIARCH\">patriarch</a> Shem; which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> has been followed by a great number of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> writers. M. Jurius has undertaken to prove that he is the same as Cham or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAM\">Ham</a>. It would be endless to set <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> all the opinions upon this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>: therefore we shall only add, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a> Cumeus and Peter du Moulin have asserted, that Melchisedec who appeared to Abraham was the Son of God, and that the patriarch worshipped him and acknowledged him for the Messiah.\n\nAbout the beginning of the third century arose the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERESY\">heresy</a> of the Melchisedecians, who affirmed that Melchisedec was not a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, but a heavenly power, superior to Jesus Christ: for Melchisedec, they said, was the intercessor and mediator of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGELS\">angels</a>, but Jesus Christ was so only for men, and his priesthood only a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> of that of Melchisedec, who was the Holy Ghost.\n\nWe shall only beg leave to add here one opinion more concerning Melchisedec, which is that of the learned Heidegger, who, as the author of the Hist. Patriar. thinks, has taken the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> method of explaining the accounts of Moses and the apostle Paul relating to this extraordinary person. He supposes a twofold Melchisedec; the one historical, whereof Moses gives an account in the 14th chapter of Genesis, as that he was king as well as high priest of Jerusalem; the other allegorical, whom St Paul describes, and this allegorical person is Jesus Christ.\n\nAs the history of this prince and priest is so little known, it is no wonder, as Selden observes, that many fabulous accounts have been invented of him; of which the following may suffice as a specimen. Eutychus patriarch of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALEXANDRIA\">Alexandria</a> relates, that the body of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADAM\">Adam</a> having been embalmed according to his order, was deposited in a cave under a mountain of the children of Seth; but that Adam before his death had commanded that they should take away his remains from that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, and transport them to the middle of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>: that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOAH\">Noah</a>, to follow the orders of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>, had preserved the bodies of Adam and all the patriarchs with him in the ark: that finding himself near his death, he ordered his son Shem to take the body of Adam, to furnish himself with bread and wine for his journey, to take with him Melchisedec the son of Phaleg, and to go to the place in which an angel would show them where to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURY\">bury</a> the first man: that Noah added this order, \"Command Melchisedec to fix his residence in that place, and to live unmarried all his lifetime, because God has chosen him to do <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> in his presence; command him, that he build no temple, nor shed the blood of birds, nor four-footed beasts, or any other animal; and that he offer no other oblations to God but bread and wine.\" This is the reason, according to this author, why Melchisedec, when he met Abraham, brought forth only bread and wine.\n\nA Greek author, under the name of Athanasius, relates, that Melchisedec was the son of an idolatrous king called Melchi and of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a> called Salem.\u2014Melchi, having resolved to offer a sacrifice to the gods, sent his son Melchisedec to fetch him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> calves. In the way the young prince was enlightened by God, and immediately returned to his father, to demonstrate to him the vanity of his idols. Melchi, in wrath, sent him back to fetch the victims. While he was absent, the king sacrificed his eldest son, and a great many other children, to his gods. Melchisedec returning, and conceiving great horror at this butchery, retired to Mount Tabor, where he lived seven years, without clothes, and fed only on wild <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>. At the end of seven years, God appeared to Abraham, bid him go up to Mount Tabor, where he should find Melchisedec. He ordered him to clothe him, and to ask his blessing; which Abraham having done, Melchisedec anointed him with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>, and they came down together from the mountain.","sp":540,"ep":541},{"h":"MELCHITES","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, the name given to the Syriac, Egyptian, and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEVANT\">Levant</a>.

In the next reign the French burnt it; and it was thereby rendered so desolate, that the remaining inhabitants prayed and obtained a discharge from customs. On account of its quarrels with Weymouth, in the reign of Henry VI. its privileges as a port were removed to Poole: but in that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a> they were restored to it by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of parliament, which was confirmed in the next reign, on condition that Melcomb and Weymouth should make but one corporation, and enjoy their privileges in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a>; and to this was owing the flourishing state of both. In the two reigns last mentioned, a wooden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a> with seventeen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a> was built from hence to Weymouth; to which, as well as its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> contributors were certain citizens of London; and upon its decay it was rebuilt in 1770.

At Gesves one may trade yearly for 250 slaves, 80 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> 100 quintals of wax, and as many of ivory. Near the mouth of the river of Gesves is a village called Kurballi, where there is a considerable trade for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>; here are also some slaves and ivory.

This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>, with those of Carache, Canabae, and La Gallina, are the only ones where the Europeans may trade with some security.

The river Nunho runs 16 leagues to the south of Rio Grande; it is very considerable, and comes from a vast distance inland. One may buy here 300 quintals of ivory and 100 slaves a-year. Rice grows here admirably well, and is very cheap.

Vocal melody is called singing; and that which is performed upon instruments may be termed symphonic melody.\n\nThe idea of rhythmus necessarily enters into that of melody. An <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> is not an air but in proportion as the laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> are observed. The same succession of sounds is susceptible of as many different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a>, as many different kinds of melody, as the various ways by which its emphatic notes, and the quantities of those which intervene, may be diversified; and the change in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> of the notes alone, may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISGUISE\">disguise</a> that very succession in such a manner that it cannot be known. Thus, melody in itself is nothing; it is the rhythmus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> measure which determines it, and there can be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> air without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> then we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> measure,\nmeasure from both, we cannot compare melody with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a>; for to the former it is essential, but not at all to the latter.\n\nMelody, according to the manner in which it is considered, has a relation to two different principles. When regarded only as agreeable to the proportions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> and the rules of modulation, it has its principle in harmony; since it is a harmonical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a>, which exhibits the different gradations of the scale, the chords peculiar to each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a>, and the laws of modulation, which are the sole elements that compose an air. According to this principle, the whole power of melody is limited to that of pleasing the ear by agreeable sounds, as the eye may be pleased with an agreeable assemblage of suitable colours. But when considered as an imitative art, by which we may affect the mind with various images, excite different emotions in the heart, inflame or soothe the passions; by which, in a word, we produce different effects upon our moral faculties, which are not to be effectuated by the influence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> alone, we must explore another principle for melody: for in our whole internal frame there appears to be no power upon which either harmony alone, or its necessary results, can <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a>, to affect us in such a manner.\n\nWhat then is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> principle? It is as much founded on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> as the first; but, in order to discover its foundation in nature, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> require a more accurate though simpler observation, and a more exquisite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a> in the observer. This principle is the same which varies the tone of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a>, when we speak, according as we are interested in what we say, and according to the different emotions which we feel in expressing it. It is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCENT\">accent</a> of languages which determines the melody of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>; it is the accent which determines us to employ the emphasis of speaking while we sing, and to speak with more or less energy according as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> which we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> is more or less accented. That language whose accents are the most sensible, ought to produce a more passionate and more lively melody; that which has little accentuation, or none at all, can only produce a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> and languid melody, without character and without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>. These are the true principles: in proportion as we depart from them, when we speak of the power of music upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> heart, we shall become unintelligible to ourselves and others: our words will be without meaning.\n\nIf music does not impress the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> with images but by melody, if from thence it obtains its whole power, it must follow, that all musical sounds which are not pleasing by themselves alone, however agreeable to harmony they may be, is not an imitative music; and, being incapable, even with its most beautiful chords, either to present the images of things, or to excite the finer feelings, very soon cloy the ear, and leaves always the heart in cold indifference. It follows likewise, that notwithstanding the parts which harmony has introduced, and which the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> of music so wantonly abuses, wherever two different melodies are heard at the same time, they counteract each other, and destroy the effects of both, however beautiful each may be when performed alone: from whence it may be judged with what degree of taste the French composers have introduced in their operas the miserable practice of accompanying one air with another, as well in singing, which is the native expression of pathos and sentiment, as in instrumental performances; which is the same thing as if whimsical orators should take it in their heads to recite two orations at the same time, that the elegance of each might derive more force from the other.\n\nSo much for Rousseau. The translator, however, has reason to fear, that the causes by which national melody is diversified and characterized, are more profound and permanent than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> accentuation of language. This indeed may have great influence in determining the nature of the rhythmus, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of emphatic notes; but very little in regulating the nature of the emphasis and expression themselves. If Rousseau's principle be true in its full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, he must of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> acknowledge, that an air which was never set or intended for words, however melodious, cannot be imitative; he must likewise confess, that what is imitative in one nation cannot be such in another: nor can it be denied, upon his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>, that the recitative, which is formed upon the mode of speaking, is the most forcible of all melodies; which is absurd. His other observations are at once judicious and profound. Though it is impossible to exhibit the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> and variety of harmony by playing the same melody at the same time upon different keys, admitting those keys to form among themselves a perfect chord, which will of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> preserve all the subsequent notes in the same intervals; yet this perfect harmony would by no means be uniformly pleasing to the ear. We must therefore of necessity introduce less perfect chords to vary and increase the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>, and these chords in any complex system of music must of necessity produce dissonances. It then becomes the business of the composer to be careful that these discords may arise as naturally from, and return as naturally to perfect harmony as possible. All these causes must inevitably vary the melody of the different parts; but still, amidst all these difficulties, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a> ought to be zealous in preserving the melody of each as homogeneous with the others as possible, that the result of the whole may be in some measure uniform. Otherwise, by counteracting each other, the parts will reciprocally destroy the effects one of another.","sp":544,"ep":545},{"h":"MELOE","t":"a genus of insects of the order of coleoptera.

Judgment and ratiocination suppose something already known, and draw their decisions only from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">Imagination</a> selects <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> from the treasures of remembrance, and produces <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a> only by varied <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a>. We do not even form conjectures of distant, or anticipations of future events, but by concluding what is possible from what is past.\"\n\nOf a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> so important, many rules have been given for the regulation and improvement; of which the first is, that he who wishes to have a clear and distinct remembrance, should be temperate with respect to eating, drinking, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a>. The memory depends very much upon the state of the brain; and therefore whatever is hurtful to the latter, must be prejudicial to the former. Too much sleep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">clouds</a> the brain, and too little overheats it; therefore either of these extremes must of course hurt the memory, and ought carefully to be avoided. Intemperance of all kinds, and excess of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>, have the same ill effects; so that we rarely meet with an intemperate person whose memory is at once clear and tenacious.\n\n\"The liveliest remembrance is not so vivid as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a> that produced it\u2021; and ideas of memory do often, but not always, decay more and more, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> sensation becomes more and more remote in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>. Those sensations and those thoughts have a chance to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> remembered which are lively at first; and those are likely to be most lively which are most attended to, or which are accompanied with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> or pain, with wonder, surprise, curiosity, merriment, and other lively passions. The art of memory, therefore, is little more than the art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>. What we wish to remember we should attend to, so as to understand it perfectly, fixing our view particularly upon its importance or singular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, that it may raise within us some of the passions above mentioned. We should also disengage our minds from all other things, that we may attend more effectually to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> which we wish to remember. No man <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> read with much advantage who is not able at pleasure to evacuate his mind, or who brings not to his author an intellect defeated and pure, neither turbid with care, nor agitated with pleasure. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> the repositories of thought are already full, what can they receive? If the mind is employed on the past or the future, the book will be held before the eyes in vain.\n\n\"It is the practice of many readers, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> in the margin of their books the most important <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> of Moral Science.\"\nMemory, the strongest arguments, or the brightest sentiments.\n\nThus they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> their minds with superfluous attention, repress the vehemence of curiosity by useless deliberation, and by frequent interruption <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> the current of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NARRATION\">narration</a> or the chain of reason, and at last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> and forget the passages and the marks together. Others are firmly persuaded, that nothing is certainly remembered but what is transcribed; and they, therefore, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> weeks and months in transferring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> quotations to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>-book. Yet, why any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of a book which can be consulted at pleasure should be copied, we are not able to discover. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> has no closer correspondence with the memory than the eye. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> itself distracts the thoughts; and what is read twice, is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> better remembered than what is transcribed. This method, therefore, consumes time, without assisting the memory. But to write an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ABRIDGMENT\">abridgment</a> of a good book may sometimes be a very profitable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a>. In general, when we would preserve the doctrines, sentiments, or facts, that occur in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a>, it will be prudent to lay the book aside, and put them in writing in our own words. This practice will give accuracy to our knowledge, accustom us to recollection, improve us in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, and enable us so thoroughly to comprehend the thoughts of other men, as to make them in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> our own.\n\n\"Our thoughts have for the most part a connection; so that the thought which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> now in the mind, depends partly upon that which went before, and partly serves to introduce that which follows.\u2014Hence we remember best those things of which the parts are methodically disposed and mutually connected. A regular discourse makes a more lasting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> upon the hearer than a parcel of detached sentences, and gives to his rational powers a more salutary exercise: and this may show us the propriety of conducting our studies, and all our affairs, according to a regular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> or method. When this is not done, our thoughts and our business, especially if in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> complex, soon run into confusion.\"\n\nAs the mind is not at all times equally disposed for the exercise of this faculty, such seasons should be made choice of as are most proper for it. The mind is seldom fit for attention presently after meals; and to call off the spirits at such times from their proper employment in digestion, is apt to cloud the brain, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>. Both the mind and body should be easy and undisturbed when we engage in this exercise, and therefore retirement is most fit for it: and the evening, just before we go to rest, is generally recommended as a very convenient season, both from the stillness of the night, and because the impressions will then have a longer time to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> before they come to be disturbed by the accession of others proceeding from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> objects; and to call over in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> what has been committed to the memory overnight, must, for the same reason, be very serviceable. For, to review those ideas while they continue fresh upon the mind, and unmixed with any others, must necessarily imprint them more deeply.\n\nSome <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> writers speak of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> memory, and lay <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> rules for attaining it. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIMONIDES\">Simonides</a> the poet is said first to have discovered this, or at least to have given the occasion for it. The story they tell of him is this: Being once at a feast, he recited a poem which he had made in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of the person who gave the entertainment. But having (as is usual in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a>) made a large digression in praise of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASTOR\">Castor</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLLUX\">Pollux</a>; when he had repeated the whole poem, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a> would give him but half the sum he had promised, telling him he must get the other part from those deities who had an equal share in the honour of his performance. Immediately after, Simonides was told that two young men were without, and must needs speak with him. He had scarcely got out of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, when the room where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> was fell down, killed all the persons in it, and so mashed the bodies, that, when the rubbish was thrown off, they could not be known one from another: upon which Simonides recollecting the place where every one had sat, by that means distinguished them. Hence it came to be observed, that to fix a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of places in the mind in a certain order, was a help to the memory: As we find by experience, that, upon returning to places once familiar to us, we not only remember them, but likewise many things we both said and did in them. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> therefore of Simonides was afterwards improved into an art; and the nature of it is this: They bid you form in your mind the idea of some large place or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>, which you may divide into a great number of distinct parts, ranged and disposed in a certain order. These you are frequently to revolve in your thoughts, till you are able to run them over one after another without hesitation, beginning at any part. Then you are to impress upon your mind as many images of living creatures, or any other insensible objects which are most likely to affect you, and be soonest revived in your memory. These, like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> in shorthand, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HIEROGLYPHICS\">hieroglyphics</a>, must stand to denote an equal number of other words, which cannot so easily be remembered. When therefore you have a number of things to commit to memory in a certain order, all that you have to do is, to place these images regularly in the several parts of your building. And thus they tell you, that, by going over several parts of the building, the images placed in them will be revived in the mind; which of course will give you the things or words themselves in the order you desire to remember them. The advantage of the images seems to be this; that, as they are more like to affect the imagination than the words for which they stand, they will for that reason be more easily remembered. Thus, for instance, if the image of a lion be made to signify strength, and this word strength be one of those I am to remember, and is placed in the porch; when, in going over the several parts of the building, I come to the porch, I shall sooner be reminded of that image than of the word strength. Of this artificial memory, both Cicero and Quintilian speak; but we know not of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> orator that has ever made use of it. It seems indeed to have been a laborious way of improving the memory, if it serves that end at all, and fitter for assisting us to remember any number of unconnected words than a continual discourse, unless so far as the remembrance of one word may enable us to recollect more. It is, however, in allusion to it, that we still call the parts of a discourse places.\nBut, doubtless, the most effectual way to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> a good memory, is by constant and moderate exercise of it; for the memory, like other habits, is strengthened and improved by daily use. It is indeed hardly credible, to what a degree both active and passive remembrance may be improved by long practice. Scaliger reports of himself, that in his youth he could repeat above 100 verses, having once read them; and Berthecus declares, that he wrote his Comment upon Claudian without consulting the text. To hope, however, for such degrees of memory as these, would be equally vain as to hope for the strength of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERCULES\">Hercules</a>, or the swiftness of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACHILLES\">Achilles</a>. \"But there are clergymen who can get a sermon by heart* in two hours, though their memory, when they began to exercise it, was rather weak than strong: And pleaders, with other orators who speak in public and extempore, often discover, in calling instantly to mind all the knowledge necessary on the present occasion, and every thing of importance that may have been advanced in the course of a long debate, such powers of retention and recollection as, to the man who has never been obliged to exert himself in the same manner, are altogether astonishing.\n\nAs habits, in order to be strong, must be formed in early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, the memories of children should, therefore, be constantly exercised; but to oblige them to commit to memory what they do not understand, perverts their faculties, and gives them a dislike to learning.\" In a word, those who have most occasion for memory, as orators and public speakers, should not suffer it to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> idle, but constantly employ it in treasuring up and frequently reviving such things as may be of most importance to them; for by these means it will be more at their command, and they may place greater confidence in it upon any emergency.\"\n\n\"Men complain of nothing more frequently than of deficient memory\u2020: and indeed every one finds, that after all his efforts, many of the ideas which he desired to retain have slipped irretrievably away; that acquisitions of the mind are sometimes equally fugitive with the gifts of fortune; and that a short intermission of attention more certainly lessens knowledge than impairs an estate. To assist this weakness of our nature, many methods besides those which we have mentioned have been proposed; all of which may be justly suspected of being ineffectual: for no art of memory, however its effects may have been boasted or admired, has been ever adopted into general use; nor have those who possessed it appeared to excel others in readiness of recollection or multiplicity of attainments.\"\n\nThe reader who is desirous to try the effect of these helps, may have recourse to a treatise entitled A new Method of Artificial Memory; but the true method of memory is attention and exercise.","sp":546,"ep":549},{"h":"MEMPHIS","t":"an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> residence of the kings in the Higher <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>; distant from the Delta to the south 15 miles, according to Pliny. Called also Moph, and Noph, in scripture.\n\nThough this city is now so completely ruined, that authors greatly disagree concerning its situation; yet Strabo informs us that in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> it was the most magnificent in Egypt, next to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALEXANDRIA\">Alexandria</a>, and called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>; and there was an entire temple of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OSIRIS\">Osiris</a>, where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APIS\">Apis</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> sacred ox was kept and worshipped. In the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> was an apartment of the mother of the ox; a very magnificent temple of Vulcan; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CIRCUS\">circus</a> or space for fighting bulls; and a great colossus in the middle of the city, which was thrown <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>. There was likewise a temple of Venus, and a Scapium in a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a> place, where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> heaps up hills of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> very dangerous to travellers; together with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of sphinxes, the heads of some of them only being visible. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> of the city there were many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>; and it contained a number of palaces, at that time in ruins. These buildings formerly stood upon an eminence: they lay along the side of the hill, stretching down to the lakes and groves, 40 stadia from the city. On a mountain in the neighbourhood, there was a great number of pyramids, with the sepulchres of the kings. From this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>, Mr Bruce concludes that the celebrated capital of Egypt stood in the place where the villages of Metrahenny are now situated; in opposition to Dr Shaw's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, who thinks it was situated at Geeza or Gisa.\n\nM. Savary has also shown, that Gisa was not the situation of the ancient Memphis, which stood, he says, on the spot where the village of Memph now stands. Large heaps of rubbish are still to be seen there; but the Arabs have transported to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CAIRO\">Cairo</a> the columns and remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, which they have disposed, without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> and without order, in their mosques and public buildings. This city extended as far as Saccara; and was almost wholly encompassed by lakes, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of which are still subsisting. It was necessary to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> them to convey the dead to the sepulchres of their fathers. The tombs, hewn out of the rock, were closed up with stones of a proportionable size, and covered with sand. These bodies embalmed with so much care, preserved with so much respect, are torn from the monuments they repose in, and sold without decency to strangers by the inhabitants of Saccara. This place is called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> of mummies. There too we find the well of the birds, into which one descends by means of a rope. It leads to subterraneous galleries, filled with earthen vases containing the sacred birds. They are rarely met with entire, because the Arabs <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> them in hopes of finding idols of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>. They do not conduct travellers into the places where they have found more precious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a>. They even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> them up carefully, reserving to themselves some secret <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> by which they descend. In a journey into Egypt made by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> de Chaulnes, he advanced very far into these winding labyrinths, sometimes crawling, and sometimes scrambling on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-KNEES\">knees</a>. Informed by Mr Edward Worley Montague, who has carefully visited Egypt, he arrived at one of those passages which had an opening shut up from without by branches of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a> tree interwoven, and covered with sand. He remarked there some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HIEROGLYPHICS\">hieroglyphics</a> in relief, executed in the highest perfection. But the Arabs resisted every offer he made them to permit him to take drawings of them, or to mould them, in order to preserve their form. The duke de Chaulnes is of opinion that these hieroglyphics, sculptured with so much art that the objects they represent may be discovered at the first sight, might possibly furnish the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KEY\">key</a> of the others, whose contours are simply expressed, and form a sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-ALPHABET\">alphabet</a> of this unintelligible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>. Several pyramids are distinguishable along the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> which bound Saccara on the west, the greatest part of which appear as lofty as those of Giza.\n\nSee PYRAMIDS.","sp":549,"ep":550},{"h":"MENAGE","t":"denotes a collection of animals; whence we have derived the word menagerie.","sp":550,"ep":550},{"h":"MENANDER","t":"an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Greek poet, was born at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a> in the same year with Epicurus, which was the third of the 109th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OLYMPIAD\">Olympiad</a>. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> in introducing the new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMEDY\">comedy</a>, and refining an art which had been so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> and licentious in former times, quickly spread his name over the world. Pliny informs us, that the kings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a> and Macedon gave a noble testimony of his merit, by sending ambassadors to invite him to their courts, and even fleets to bring him over; but that Menander was so much of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>, as to prefer the free enjoyment of his studies to the promised favours of the great. Of his works, which amounted to above 100 comedies, we have had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> loss, the originals being not only vanished, but the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of them, when copied by Terence, having unfortunately perished by shipwreck before they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> Rome. Yet the four plays which Terence borrowed from him before that accident happened, are still preserved in the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a>; and it is chiefly from Terence that most people form their judgment of Menander, the fragments that remain of him not being sufficient to enable them to do it. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> have said <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> things of Menander; and we find the old masters of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHETORIC\">rhetoric</a> recommending his works as the true patterns of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> and every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a> of public speaking. Quintilian declares, that a careful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of Menander only, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> satisfy all the rules he has laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> in his Institutions. It is in Menander that he would have his orator search for a copiousness of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>, for a happy elegance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>, and especially for that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> genius which is able to accommodate itself to persons, things, and affections.\u2014But Julius Caesar has left the loftiest as well as the justest praise of Menander's works, when he calls Terence only a Half-Menander. For while the virtues of the Latin poet are so deservedly admired, it is impossible we should raise a higher notion of excellency than to conceive the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> still shining with half its lustre unreflected, and preserving an equal part of its graces, above the power of the best copier in the world. Menander died in the 3d year of the 122d Olympiad.\nMenander Olympiad, as we are taught by the same old inscription from which we learn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of his birth. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOMB\">tomb</a>, in Pausanias's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, was to be seen at Athens, in the way from the Piraeus to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> by the honorary monument of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EURIPIDES\">Euripides</a>. Quintilian, in his judgment of Afranius the Roman cenciarian, who imitated him, censures Menander's morals as much as he commends his writings; and his character, according to Suidas, is, that he was a very \"mad fellow after women.\" Phaedrus has given him the gait and dress of a most affected fop:\n\n\"Unguento delibutus, vestitu adluens,\n\"Veniebat gressu delicatulo et languido.\"\n\nLib. v. fab. 2.","sp":550,"ep":551},{"h":"MENANDRIANS","t":"the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> branch of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GNOSTICS\">Gnostics</a>; thus called from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MENANDER\">Menander</a> their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a>, said by some, without sufficient foundation, to have been a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a> of Simon Magus, and himself a reputed magician.\n\nHe taught, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> person could be saved, unless he were baptized in his name; and he conferred a peculiar sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAPTISM\">baptism</a>, which would render those who received it immortal in the next world: exhibiting himself to the world, with the phrensy of a lunatic more than the founder of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">sect</a>, as a promised saviour.

Innocent III. was the first of the popes who perceived the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of instituting such an order; and accordingly he gave such monastic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a>, as made a profession of poverty, the most distinguishing marks of his protection and favour. They were also encouraged and patronized by the succeeding pontiffs, when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> had demonstrated their public and extensive usefulness. But when it became generally known, that they had such a peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in the esteem and protection of the rulers of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, their number grew to such an enormous and unwieldy multitude, and swarmed so prodigiously in all the European provinces, that they became a burden, not only to the people, but to the church itself. The great inconvenience that arose from the excessive multiplication of the mendicant orders was remedied by Gregory X. in a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a>, which he assembled at Lyons in 1272. For here all the religious orders that had sprung up after the council held at Rome in 1215, under the pontificate of Innocent III., were suppressed; and the extravagant multitude of mendicants, as Gregory called them, were reduced to a smaller number, and confined to the four following societies or denominations, viz. the Dominican, the Franciscan, the Carmelite, and the Augustinian or hermits of St. Augustine.\n\nAs the pontiffs allowed these four mendicant orders the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> of travelling wherever they thought proper, of conversing with persons of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>, of instructing the youth and multitude wherever they went; and as those monks exhibited, in their outward appearance and manner of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, more striking marks of gravity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLINESS\">holiness</a> than were observable in the other monastic societies, they arose all at once to the very summit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>, and were regarded with the utmost esteem and veneration through all the countries of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. The enthusiastic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to these sanctimonious beggars went so far, that, as we learn from the most authentic records, several cities were divided or cantoned out into four parts, with a view to these four orders; the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> being assigned to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMINICANS\">Dominicans</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> to the Franciscans, the third to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CARMELITES\">Carmelites</a>, and the fourth to the Augustins. The people were unwilling to receive the sacraments from any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> than those of the mendicants, to whose churches they crowded to perform their devotions, while living, and were extremely desirous to deposit there also their remains after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>: nor did the influence and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> of the mendicants end here; for we find in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of this and of the succeeding ages, that they were employed not only in spiritual matters, but also in temporal and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> affairs of the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, in composing the differences of princes, concluding treaties of peace, concerting alliances, presiding in cabinet councils, governing courts, levying taxes, and other occupations, not only remote from, but absolutely inconsistent with, the monastic character and profession. However, the power of the Dominicans and Franciscans greatly surpassed that of the other two orders: insomuch that these two orders were, before the Reformation, what the Jesuits have been since that happy and glorious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, the very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HIERARCHY\">hierarchy</a>, the engines of the state, the secret <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a> of all the motions of the one and the other, and the authors and directors of every great and important event, both in the religious and political world. By very quick progression their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a> and confidence arrived at such a pitch, that they had the presumption to declare publicly, that they had a divine impulse and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> to illustrate and maintain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a>; they treated with the utmost insolence and contempt all the different orders of the priesthood; they affirmed, without a blush, that the true method of obtaining <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SALVATION\">salvation</a> was revealed to them alone; proclaimed, with ostentation, the superior efficacy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of their indulgencies; and vaunted beyond <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>, and their familiar connexions with the Supreme Being, the Virgin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>, and the saints in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>. By these impious wiles, they so deluded and captivated the miserable, and blinded the multitude, that they would not entrust any other but the mendicants with the care of their souls. They retained their credit and influence to such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of the 14th century, that great numbers of both sexes, some in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, others in a state of infirmity, and others at the point of death, earnestly desired to be admitted into the mendicant order, which they looked upon as a sure and infallible method of rendering heaven propitious. Many made it an essential part of their last wills, that their bodies after death should be wrapped in old ragged Dominican or Franciscan habits, and interred among the mendicants. For such was the barbarous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a> and wretched <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, that people universally believed they should readily obtain mercy from Christ, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> of judgment, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they appeared before his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBUNAL\">tribunal</a> associated with the mendicant friars.\n\nAbout this time, however, they fell under an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> odium; but being resolutely protected against all opposition, whether open or secret, by the popes, who regarded them as their best friends and most effectual supports, they suffered little or nothing from the efforts of their numerous adversaries. In the 15th century,\ncentury, besides their arrogance, which was excessive, a quarrelsome and litigious spirit prevailed among them, and drew upon them justly the displeasure and indignation of many. By affording refuge at this time to the Beguins in their order, they became offensive to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a>, and were hereby involved in difficulties and perplexities of various kinds. They lost their credit in the 16th century by their rustic impudence, their ridiculous superstitions, their ignorance, cruelty, and brutish manners. They discovered the most barbarous aversion to the arts and sciences, and expressed a like abhorrence of certain eminent and learned men, who endeavoured to open the paths of science to the pursuits of the studious youth, recommended the culture of the mind, and attacked the barbarism of the age in their writings and discourse. Their general character, together with other circumstances, concurred to render a reformation desirable, and to accomplish this happy event.\n\nAmong the number of mendicants are also ranked the Capuchins, Recollets, Minims, and others, who are branches or derivations from the former.\n\nBuchanan tells us, the mendicants in Scotland, under an appearance of beggary, lived a very luxurious life; whence one wittily called them, not Mendicant but Manducant friars.","sp":552,"ep":553},{"h":"MENECRATES","t":"a physician of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYRACUSE\">Syracuse</a>, who flourished about 360 B.C. is famous for his skill in his profession, but much more for his vanity.

The writings of Menno, which are almost all composed in the Dutch <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, were published in folio at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMSTERDAM\">Amsterdam</a> in the year 1651. About the year 1637, Menno was earnestly solicited by many of the sect with which he connected himself, to assume among them the rank and functions of a public teacher; and as he looked upon the persons who made this proposal to be exempt from the fanatical phrensy of their brethren at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUNSTER\">Munster</a>, (though according to other accounts they were originally of the same stamp, only rendered somewhat wiser by their sufferings), he yielded to their entreaties. From this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> to the end of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, he travelled from one country to another with his wife and children, exercising his ministry, under pressures and calamities of various kinds, that succeeded each other without interruption, and constantly exposed to the danger of falling a victim to the severity of the laws. East and West Friesland, together with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRONINGEN\">Groningen</a>, were first visited by this zealous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APOSTLE\">apostle</a> of the Anabaptists; from whence he directed his course into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, Guelderland, Brabant, and Westphalia, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> it through the German provinces that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> on the coasts of the Baltic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, and penetrated as far as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIVONIA\">Livonia</a>. In all these places his ministerial labours were attended with remarkable success, and added to his sect a prodigious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of followers. Hence he is deservedly considered as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> of almost all the Anabaptists, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a> of the sect that still subsists under that denomination. Menno was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of genius, undirected by a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> judgment: he possessed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> and persuasive eloquence, and such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of learning as made him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> for an oracle in the estimation of the multitude. He appears, moreover, to have been a man of probity, of a meek and tractable spirit, gentle in his manners, pliable and obsequious in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> with persons of all ranks and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a>, and extremely zealous in promoting practical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>, which he recommended by his example as well as by his precepts. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of doctrine and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a> drawn up by Menno was of a much more mild and moderate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> than that of the furious and fanatical Anabaptists, whose tumultuous proceedings have been recited under that article, but somewhat more severe, though more clear and consistent than the doctrine of the wiser branches of that sect, who aimed at nothing more than the restoration of the Christian church to its primitive purity. Accordingly he condemned the plan of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> discipline that was founded on the prospect of a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>, to be miraculously established by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a> Christ on the ruins of civil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> and the destruction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> rulers, and which had been the fatal and pestilent source of such dreadful commotions, such execrable rebellions, and such enormous crimes. He declared publicly his dislike of that doctrine, which pointed out the approach of a marvellous reformation in the church by the means of a new and extraordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EFFUSION\">effusion</a> of the Holy Spirit. He expressed his abhorrence of the licentious tenets, which several of the Anabaptists had maintained, with respect to the lawfulness of polygamy and divorce; and finally, considered as unworthy of toleration those fanatics who were of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> that the Holy Ghost continued to descend into the minds of many chosen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELIEVERS\">believers</a>, in an extraordinary manner as he did at the first establishment of the Christian church, and that he testified this peculiar presence to several of the faithful by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MIRACLES\">miracles</a>, predictions, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DREAMS\">dreams</a> and visions of various kinds. He retained indeed the doctrines <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> received among the Anabaptists, in relation to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAPTISM\">baptism</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANTS\">infants</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MILLENNIUM\">millennium</a>, or 1000 years reign of Christ upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCLUSION\">exclusion</a> of magistrates from the Christian church, the abolition of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, and the prohibition of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OATHS\">oaths</a> enjoined by our Saviour, and the vanity as well as the pernicious effects of human science. But while Menno retained these doctrines in a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, he explained and modified them in such a manner as made them resemble the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> tenets that were universally received in the Protestant churches; and this rendered them agreeable to many, and made them appear inoffensive even to numbers who had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> inclination to embrace them. It however so happened, that the nature of the doctrines considered in themselves, the eloquence of Menno which set them off to such advantage, and the circumstances of the times, gave a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> to the religious system of this famous teacher among the Anabaptists, so that it made a rapid progress in that sect. And thus it was in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the ministry of Menno, that the different sorts of Anabaptists agreed together in excluding from their communion the fanatics that dishonoured it, and in renouncing all tenets that were detrimental to the authority of civil government, and by an unexpected coalition formed themselves into one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a>.\n\nThough the Mennonites usually pass for a sect of Anabaptists, yet M. Herman Schyn, a Mennonite minister, who has published their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> and apology, maintains, that they are not Anabaptists either in principle or by origin. However, nothing can be more certain than this fact, viz. that the first Mennonite congregations were composed of the different sorts of Anabaptists, of those who had been always inoffensive and upright, and of those who, before their conversion by the ministry of Menno, had been seditious fanatics: besides, it is alleged that the Mennonites\nMENNONITES do actually retain, at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, some of those opinions and doctrines, which led the sedulous and turbulent Anabaptists of old to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> of so many and such enormous crimes: such particularly is the doctrine concerning the nature of Christ's kingdom, or of the church of the New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a>, though modified in such a manner as to have lost its noxious qualities, and to be no longer pernicious in its influence.\n\nThe Mennonites are subdivided into several sects; whereof the two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> are the Flemings or Flemingsians, and the Waterlandians. The opinions, says Mosheim, that are held in common by the Mennonites, seem to be all derived from this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> principle, that the kingdom which Christ established upon earth is a visible church or community, into which the holy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> alone are to be admitted, and which is consequently exempt from all those constitutions and rules of discipline that have been invented by human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>, for the correction and reformation of the wicked. This principle, indeed, was avowed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Mennonites, but it is now almost wholly renounced: nevertheless, from this ancient doctrine, many of the religious opinions that distinguish the Mennonites from all other Christian communities, seem to be derived: in consequence of this doctrine, they admit none to the sacrament of baptism but persons that are come to the full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of their reason; they neither admit civil rulers into their communion, nor allow any of their members to perform the functions of magistracy; they deny the lawfulness of repelling force by force, and consider war, in all its shapes, as unchristian and unjust; they entertain the utmost aversion to the execution of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, and more especially to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> punishments; and they also refuse to confirm their testimony by an oath. The particular sentiments that divided the more considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a> of the Mennonites are the following: The rigid Mennonites, called the Flemingsians, maintain with various degrees of rigour, the opinions of their founder Menno, as to the human nature of Christ, alleging that it was produced in the womb of the Virgin by the creating power of the Holy Ghost; the obligation that binds us to wash the feet of strangers, in consequence of our Saviour's command; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of excommunicating and avoiding, as one would do the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAGUE\">plague</a>, not only avowed sinners, but also all those who depart, even in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> instances pertaining to dress, &c., from the simplicity of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>; the contempt due to human learning, and other matters of less moment. However this austere system declines, and the rigid Mennonites are gradually approaching towards the opinions and discipline of the more moderate or Waterlandians.\n\nThe first settlement of the Mennonites, in the United Provinces, was granted them by William <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">Orange</a>, towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of the 16th century; but it was not before the following century that their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> and tranquillity were fixed upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> foundations, when, by a confession of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> published in the year 1626, they cleared themselves from the imputations of those pernicious and detestable errors that had been laid to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a>. In order to appease their intestine discords, a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the Anabaptists of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLANDERS\">Flanders</a>, Germany, and Friseland, concluded their debates in a conference held at Amsterdam, in the year 1630, and entered into the bonds of fraternal communion, each reserving to themselves a liberty of retaining certain opinions. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">association</a> was renewed and confirmed by new resolutions, in the year 1649; in consequence of which, the rigorous laws of Menno and his successors were, in various respects, mitigated and corrected.","sp":553,"ep":555},{"h":"MENOLOGY","t":"MENOLOGIUM, (from \u03bc\u03ae\u03bd, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>, and \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2, discourse), is much the same as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARTYROLOGY\">martyrology</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-CALENDAR\">calendar</a>, in the Latin.\n\nThe Greek menologium is divided into the several months in the year; and contains an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ABRIDGMENT\">abridgment</a> of the lives of the saints, with a bare enumeration of the names of such whose lives were never written.

Here is a very beautiful quay along the river, defended by several works well fortified with cannon. That <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the city which extends towards the river is most populous. The best vineyards for Rhenish wine being in this neighbourhood, Mentz has a flourishing trade in that commodity more particularly; and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> is the brisker, by reason that all the merchandise which passes up and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the Rhine stops in its harbour to change bottoms.\n\nThe northern part of the city, in which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> resides, is full of very regular buildings. Here are three regular streets, called the Bleichen, which run <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to each other from the banks of the Rhine to 600 yards within the city, and are cut almost regularly by very pretty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> streets. The archbishop's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> has a most commanding view of these streets, the Rhine, and the Rhinegau. There are also some good buildings in the old part of the city. The market of beasts is extremely well worth seeing; and you here and there meet with other agreeable spots. The market in the middle of the town, though not regular, is one of the prettiest places in Germany. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHEDRAL\">cathedral</a> is well worth notice. It is an immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> old Gothic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>, the spire of which was struck with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a> many years ago, and entirely laid in ashes. As it contained much wood, it burned 14 hours before it was entirely consumed. To prevent these accidents for the future, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> had the present one built to the same height in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, an undertaking which cost them 40,000 guilders <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> 4000l. It is a great pity (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARON\">Baron</a> Riesbeck observes) that it is overloaded with small ornaments: and a still greater, that this wonderful edifice is so choked up with shops and houses as to be hardly more than half visible. As, however, houses and shops are very dear in this part of the town, one cannot be very angry with the chapter for choosing rather to make the most of its ground, than to show off the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> to the best advantage. The rent of a shop and a single room to live in is 150 guilders or 15l. per annum in this part of the town. There is hardly another church in Germany of the height and length of this cathedral; and the inside of it is decorated with several magnificent monuments of princes and other great personages. Besides the cathedral, the city of Mentz contains several other churches in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> style, very well worth seeing. St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a>'s, and the Jesuits church, though both too much loaded with ornament, are among this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>. The church of the Augustins, of which the inhabitants of Mentz are so proud, is a masterpiece of bad <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>; but that of Ignatius, though little is said about it, would be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> of the antique, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> here likewise there had not been too much ornament lavished. Upon the whole, the palaces of the noblesse want that noble simplicity which alone constitutes true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> and magnificence. In another century the externals of the city <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be quite changed. The late <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> built a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a>, and the present has a taste for the same sort of expense. The monks and governors of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOSPITALS\">hospitals</a> also have been forced to rebuild their houses; so that when a few more streets are made broader and straighter, the whole will have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> bad appearance. The inhabitants, who together with the garrison amount to 30,000, are a good kind of people, and, like all the catholics of Germany, make great account of a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>. Their faces are interesting, and they are not deficient either in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WIT\">wit</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a>.\n\nThere are few cities in Germany besides <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIENNA\">Vienna</a> which contain so rich and numerous a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a> as this does: there are some houses here which have estates of 100,000 guilders, or 10,000l. a-year. The counts of Bassenheim, Schonborn, Stadion, Ingelheim, Elz, Ostein, and Walderdorf, and the lords of Dahlberg, Breitenbach, with some others, have incomes of from 30,000 to 100,000 guilders. Sixteen or eighteen houses have from 15,000 to 30,000 guilders annual revenue. The nobility of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> are said to be some of the oldest and most untainted in Germany. There are amongst them many persons of extraordinary merit, who join uncommon knowledge to all the duties of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. Upon the whole, they are far superior to the greater part of the German nobility. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>, however, is still too stiff. The first minister of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">court</a> was refused admittance into their assemblies for not being sufficiently noble; and they think they degrade themselves by keeping <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> with bourgeois.\n\nThe clergy of this place are the richest in Germany. A canonry brings in 3500 Rhenish guilders in a moderate year. The canonry of the provost brings him in 40,000 guilders a-year; and each of the deaneries is worth 2600 guilders. The income of the chapter altogether amounts to 300,000 guilders. Though it is forbidden by the canons of the church for any one to have more than a single prebend, there is not an ecclesiastic in this place who has not three or four; so that there is hardly a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> amongst them who has not at least 8000 guilders a-year. The last provost, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNT\">count</a> of Elz, had prebends enough to procure him an income of 75,000 guilders. Exclusive of the cathedral, there are several other choirs in which the canonries bring in from 1200 to 1500 guilders a-year. To give an idea of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a> of the monasteries of this place, Baron Riesbeck informs us, that at the destruction of the Jesuits, their wine, which was reckoned to sell extremely cheap, produced 120,000 rixdollars. A little while ago the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTOR\">elector</a> abolished one Carthusian convent and two nunneries, in the holy cellars of which there was found wine for at least 500,000 rixdollars.\n\n\"Notwithstanding this great wealth (continues our author), there is not a more regular clergy in all Germany. There is no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIOCESE\">diocese</a>, in which the regulations made by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRENT\">Trent</a> have been more strictly adhered to than they have here; the archbishops having made a particular point of it both at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of the reformation and ever since. One thing which greatly contributes to keep up <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a> is the not suffering any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a> to remain in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>\nwho has not fixed and stated duties, and a revenue annexed to them. Most of the irregularities in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAVARIA\">Bavaria</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUSTRIA\">Austria</a>, and other countries, arise from abb\u00e9s who are obliged to subsist by their daily industry and any masses which they can pick up. These creatures are entirely unknown here. The theological tenets of this court are also much purer than those of any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> prince in Germany. I was pleased to see the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIBLE\">Bible</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of so many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> people, especially in the country. I was told that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> of it was not forbidden in any part of the diocese; only persons were enjoined not to read it through, without the advice of their confessors. For a long time <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a> has been hunted through its utmost recesses; and though it is not quite possible to get entirely clear of pilgrimages and wonder-working images, you will meet with no priest bold enough to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> or to preach such nonsense as we hear in the pulpits of other German churches.\"\n\nThough the trade of this place has been constantly on the increase for these 18 or 20 years past, yet it is by no means what it ought to be from the situation and other advantages. The persons here who call themselves <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a>, and who make any considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, are in fact only brokers. A few toy-shops, five or six druggists, and four or five manufacturers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOBACCO\">tobacco</a>, are all that can possibly be called traders. There is not a banker in the whole town; and yet this country enjoys the staple privilege, and commands by means of the Maine, Necker, and Rhine, all the exports and imports of Alsatia, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PALATINATE\">Palatinate</a>, Franconia, and a part of Suabia and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HESSE\">Hesse</a>, as far as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NETHERLANDS\">Netherlands</a>. The port too is constantly filled with ships, but few of them contain any merchandise belonging to the inhabitants of the place. The French took it by surprise in October 1792; it surrendered to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUSSIA\">Prussia</a> in 1793; but the French again got possession of it in October 1797; and it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> united to the French empire till 1814, when it passed into the hands of the allies.

He assisted Peter in all his projects; and was rewarded for his services with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of Ingria, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJOR\">major</a>-general. He signalized himself in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLAND\">Poland</a> in 1708 and 1709; but in 1713 he was accused of embezzling the public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, and fined in 300,000 crowns. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CZAR\">czar</a> remitted the fine; and having restored him to favour, gave him the command of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> in the Ukraine in 1719, and sent him as his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMBASSADOR\">ambassador</a> into Poland in 1722. Constantly employed about the means of preserving his influence after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of his master, who was then evidently on the decline, Menzikoff discovered the person to whom the czar intended to leave the succession. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> was highly offended, and his penetration cost him the principality of Plescoff. Under the czarina Catherine, however, he was higher in favour than ever; because, on the death of the czar in 1725, he was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> in bringing different parties in Russia to agree to her succession. This princess was not ungrateful. In appointing her son-in-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a> Peter II. to be her successor, she commanded him to marry the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of Menzikoff, and gave the czar's sister to his son. The parties were actually betrothed: and Menzikoff was made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Cozel and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEWARD\">steward</a> to the czar. But this summit of elevation was the prelude to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a>. The Dolgoroukis, favourites of the czar, had influence enough to procure his banishment, together with that of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, to one of his own estates at the distance of 250 leagues from Moscow. He had the imprudence to leave the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> with the splendor and magnificence of a governor going to take possession of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a>. His enemies took advantage of this circumstance to inflame the indignation of the czar. At some distance from Moscow he was overtaken by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DETACHMENT\">detachment</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a>. The officer who commanded them made him alight from his chariot, which he sent back to Moscow; and placed him and his whole family in covered waggons, to be conducted into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIBERIA\">Siberia</a>, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of peasants. When he arrived at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of his destination, he was presented with cows and sheep big with young, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POULTRY\">poultry</a>, without knowing from whom he received the favour. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> was a simple cottage; and his employment was to cultivate the ground, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> to superintend its cultivation. New causes of sorrow were added to the severities of exile. His wife died in the journey; he had the misfortune to lose\nMenzikoff one of his daughters by the smallpox; and his other two children were seized with the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>, but recovered. He sunk under his misfortunes, November 2, 1729; and was buried beside his daughter, in a little chapel which he had built. His misfortunes had inspired him with sentiments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a>, which, amid the splendor of his former situation, he had altogether neglected. His two surviving children enjoyed greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> after the death of their father. The officer permitted them to attend public worship on Sundays by turns. One <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> when his daughter was returning from the village, she heard herself accosted by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEASANT\">peasant</a> from the window of a cottage, and, to her great surprise, recognised in this peasant the persecutor of her family, Dolgorouki; who, in his turn, had fallen a sacrifice to the intrigues of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">court</a>.

Maknassa, its founder, built it first at the bottom of a valley; but Muley Ismael extended it considerably over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> that lies to the west of the valley. It is surrounded with well cultivated fields and hills, adorned with gardens and olive plantations, and abundantly watered with rivulets. Accordingly, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KITCHEN\">kitchen</a> stuffs thrive here exceedingly, and even the superior urbanity of the inhabitants announces the temperature of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>. The winter indeed is very inconvenient, on account of the dirtiness of the town, the streets not being paved, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> being slimy.\n\nMequinez is surrounded with walls; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> itself is fortified with two bastions, on which formerly some small guns were mounted. Muley Ismael, and Muley <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-ABDALLAH\">Abdallah</a>, often in this city resisted the efforts of the Brebes, the sworn enemies of their tyranny. To the west are seen some walls of circumvallation, six feet in height, which were probably <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> intrenchments for the infantry; the attacks of the Brebes being only sudden and momentary inroads, which did not require a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>. There is at Mequinez, as well as at Morocco, a walled and guarded suburb for the Jews. The houses are neater here than at Morocco. The Jews here are more numerous; and they can turn their industry to greater account, because the Moors in this city are more polished, and (being nearer to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>) more visited, than those in the southern parts. Near the Jewry, there is another enclosed and separate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>, called the Negro town. It was built by Muley Ismael, for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a> of those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> families which composed his soldiery. This town is now uninhabited, as are all those destined for the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> through the rest of the empire.\n\nAt the south-east extremity of the city stands the palace of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a>, which was built by Muley Ismael. The space occupied by this palace is very great; it includes several gardens, elegantly disposed, and well watered. There is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> garden in the centre, surrounded by a vast and pretty regular gallery resting on columns, which communicates with the apartments. Those of the women are very spacious, and have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> with a large chamber which looks into the garden. As you <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> from one apartment to another, you find at intervals regular courts paved with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> pieces of black and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> marble; in the middle of these courts is a marble basin, from the centre of which rises a jet d'eau, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> falls <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> into this basin. These fountains are numerous in the palace; they are useful for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> purposes, and they serve for the ablutions, which the scruples of the Mahometans have exceedingly multiplied. The palaces of the Moorish kings are large, because they are composed only of one range of apartments; these are long and narrow, from 18 to 20 feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>; they have few ornaments, and receive the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> by two large folding doors, which are opened more or less as occasion requires. The rooms are always lighted from a square <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">court</a> in the centre, which is generally encompassed with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLONNADE\">colonnade</a>.\n\nThe Moors here are more courteous than those in the southern parts; they are civil to strangers, and invite them into their gardens, which are very neat. The women in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the empire are beautiful; they have a fair <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a>, with fine black eyes, and white <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>.

He had the year before killed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANNA\">Anna</a> king of the East Angles in battle, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-ETHELRED\">Ethelred</a> notwithstanding took <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> with Penda. On the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, Penda, the eldest son of Penda, to whom his father had given the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> kingdom of the Mid Angles, had two years before married the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of King Oswy, and had been baptized at his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">court</a>. At that time it should seem that Oswy and Penda were upon good terms; but after the latter had conquered the East Angles, he resolved to turn his arms against the kingdom of Northumberland. Oswy by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> means had provoked this rupture; on the contrary, Bede tells us that he offered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> sums of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, and jewels of great value, to purchase peace; these offers being rejected, he was reduced to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of deciding the quarrel by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>. The river near which the battle was fought overflowing, there were more drowned than killed. Amongst these, as the Saxon chronicle says, there were thirty princes of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> line, some of whom bore the title of kings; and also Ethelred king of the East Angles, who fought on the side of Penda against his family and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>.\n\nHis son Penda, who married the daughter of that conqueror became a Christian, and was not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> after murdered, as is said, by the malice of his mother. His brother Wolfher becoming king of Mercia, embraced in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of time the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> of the gospel, and proved a very victorious and potent monarch; and is, with no fewer than seven of his immediate successors, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> styled king of the Anglo-Saxons, though none of them are owned in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> by the Saxon chronicle. But though possibly none of them might enjoy this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a>, they were undoubtedly very puissant princes, maintaining great wars, and obtaining many advantages over the sovereigns of other Saxon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, and especially the East Angles, whom they reduced. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of the Mercian territories was so ample as to admit, and so situated as to require, the constituting subordinate rulers in several provinces; to whom, especially if they were of the royal line, they gave the title of kings; which occasions some confusion in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>. Besides the establishing episcopal sees and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONVENTS\">convents</a>, the Saxon monarchs took other methods for improving and adorning their dominions; and as Mercia was the largest, so these methods were most conspicuous therein. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COVENTRY\">Coventry</a>, as being situated in the centre, was usually, but not always, the royal residence. Penda, who was almost continually in a state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, lived as his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> operations directed, in some great town on the frontiers. Wolfher built a castle or fortified <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> for his own residence, which bore his name.\u2014Offa kept his court at Sutton Walls near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEREFORD\">Hereford</a>.\n\nIn each of the provinces there resided a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a>; and if he was of the royal blood, had usually the title of king. Penda, at the time he married Oswy's daughter, had the title of king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEICESTER\">Leicester</a>.\u2014Ethelred\nEthelred made his brother Merowald king of Hereford; who, dying without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a>, bequeathed it to his younger brother Mercelm. The like honours were sometimes conferred upon the princesses; and hence, in Mercia especially, we occasionally read of vice-queens. By these means the laws were better executed, the obedience of the subjects more effectually secured, and the splendour of these residences constantly kept up and augmented.\n\nAt length the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> devolving sometimes on minors and sometimes on weak princes, intestine factions also prevailing, the force of this hitherto mighty kingdom began sensibly to decline. This falling out in the days of Egbert, the most prudent as well as the most potent monarch of the West Saxons, he took advantage of these circumstances; and having encouraged the East Angles to make an attempt for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a> of their independence, he, in a conjuncture every way favourable to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>, broke with the Mercians, and after a short war obliged them to submit. But this was not an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> conquest, the kings of Mercia being allowed by him and his successors to retain their titles and dominions, till the invasion of the Danes put an end to their rule, when this kingdom had subsisted above 250 years; and when the Danes were afterwards expelled by the West Saxons, it sunk into a province, or rather was divided into many.\n\n**MERCURIAL,** something consisting of, or relating to, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a>.","sp":584,"ep":585},{"h":"MERCURIALIS","t":"DOGS <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">MERCURY</a>;** a genus of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> belonging to the dicca class; and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> method ranking under the 38th order, Tricocce.

However, there have been many claimants besides Mercury to the seven-stringed lyre. See Lyre.\n\nHis most magnificent temple was on Mount <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CYRENE\">Cyrene</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCADIA\">Arcadia</a>.

The animals sacred to him, were the dog, the goat, and the cock. In all the sacrifices offered to him, the tongues of the victims were burnt; and those who escaped imminent danger sacrificed to him a calf with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILK\">milk</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a>.\n\n**MERCURY,** \u00a7 in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">Astronomy</a>.

The brightness of this planet alters sometimes very considerably in 24 hours.

The latter, he thinks, is very plainly the Astaboras of the ancients; and Pliny says, that this stream encloses the left side of Mero\u00eb as the Nile does the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>, in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> we must suppose him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> southward from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALEXANDRIA\">Alexandria</a>, otherwise the words would not apply.\n\nWe are told by Diodorus Siculus, that Mero\u00eb had its name from a sister of Cambyses <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a>, who died there in the expedition undertaken by that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> against the Ethiopians. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> perished with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUNGER\">hunger</a> and thirst in the deserts beyond Mero\u00eb, which could not have happened <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they had reached Gojam, the latter being one of the most plentiful countries in the world. A further <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> that Gojam cannot be the ancient Mero\u00eb is, that the latter was enclosed between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> Nile and Astaboras, while Gojam is almost entirely surrounded by the Nile. If the ancients were acquainted with Gojam, they must also have been acquainted with the fountains of the Nile, which we certainly know they were not. Pliny says that Mero\u00eb, the most considerable of all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a> of the Nile, was called Astaboras, from the name of its left channel, which cannot be supposed any other than the junction of the Nile and Atbara. He informs us moreover, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> was vertical twice in the year, viz. when proceeding northward he entered the 18th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of Taurus, and when returning he came to the 14th degree of Leo; but this could never be the case with Gojam, which lies in about 10 degrees <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> latitude.\n\nAgain, the poet Lucan describes Mero\u00eb by two circumstances which cannot apply to any other than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENINSULA\">peninsula</a> of Atbara. One is, that the inhabitants were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>; which was the case with the Gymnosophists and first inhabitants, and which has been the case with all the rest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to the Saracen conquest: but the inhabitants of Gojam, as well as the other Abyssinians, are fair, at least greatly different in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a> from the blacks; they are also <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a>-haired, and nobody imagined that they ever had philosophers <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> science among them, which was eminently the case with the ancient inhabitants of Mero\u00eb. The other circumstance is, that the ebony tree grew in the island of Mero\u00eb, which at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> grows plentifully in the peninsula of Atbara, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the province of Kuara, but not in Gojam, where the tree could not subsist on account of the violent rains which take <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> during six months in the year. Mr Bruce mentions another circumstance quoted from the poet Lucan, which likewise tends to prove the identity of Mero\u00eb and Atbara; viz. that though there are many trees in it, they afford <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a>. This our traveller found by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, when returning from Abyssinia through Atbara. \"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> (says he) is flat, and has very little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>. The forests, though thick, afforded no sort of shade, the hunters for the sake of their sport, and the Arabs for destroying the flies, having set fire to all the dry grass and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHRUBS\">shrubs</a>; which passing with great rapidity in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> from east to west, though it had not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> to destroy the trees, did yet hinder, and occasion every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a> that was upon them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a>, unless in those spaces where villages had been, and where water was. In such spots a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> spreading trees remained full of foliage; which, from their great height and being cleared of underwood, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> in full verdure, loaded with large, projecting, and exuberant branches. But even here the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> that their shade afforded was very temporary, so as to allow us no time for enjoyment. The sun, so near the zenith, changed his azimuth so rapidly, that every few minutes I was obliged to change the carpet on which I lay, round the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a> of the tree to which I had fled for shelter; and though I lay down to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a> perfectly screened by the trunk or branches, I was presently awakened by the violent rays of a scorching sun, the shade having passed beyond me. In all other places, though we had travelled constantly in a forest, we never met with a tree that could shade us for a moment, the fire having deprived them of all their leaves.\" The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of Atbara is excessive, the thermometer having been observed at 119\u00b0: two of Mr Bruce's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> died of thirst, or at least of the consequences of drinking after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> thirst. The inhabitants live in the greatest misery, and are continually in danger from the neighbouring Arabs, who, by destroying and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> their corn, are able to reduce them to a starving condition.

At last, both consulted the oracle at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DELPHI\">Delphi</a>; and received for answer, \"that whoever should first dedicate 100 tripods in the temple of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a> at Ithome, a strong hold of the Messenians, should be masters of the country.\" The inhabitants of Messenia, on hearing this, having <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> to make the tripods of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a>, fell to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> them out in wood; but before this could be accomplished, a Spartan having got into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> by stratagem, dedicated 100 little tripods of clay: which threw the Messenians into such despair, that they at last submitted to the Spartans.\n\nThe new subjects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPARTA\">Sparta</a> were treated with the utmost barbarity by these cruel tyrants: so that a new war commenced under Aristomenes, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of unconquerable valour, and enthusiastically fond of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>. He perceived that the Argives and Arcadians, who were called the allies of the Lacedaemonians, adhered to them only through fear of their power; but that in reality they hated them, and wished to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a> the injuries they had done them. To these Aristomenes applied; and receiving an answer conformable to his wishes, he engaged his countrymen unanimously to take up arms. About a year after the revolt began, and before either party had received any auxiliaries, the Spartans and Messenians met at a village called Dera, where an obstinate engagement ensued. Aristomenes was conceived to have performed more than mortal achievements: in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> therefore, respect being also had to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a>, his countrymen unanimously saluted him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a>; which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> he modestly waved, alleging, that he took up arms to set them free, and not to make himself great; he consented, however, to accept the title of general, with a power of doing whatsoever he thought requisite for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> of the public. Knowing well the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> in which he lived, he resolved to intimidate the Spartans, by showing them what he was sure they would take for an ill <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OMEN\">omen</a>. Disguising himself therefore, he went privately to the city, where, in the night, he hung up a shield on the wall of the temple of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINERVA\">Minerva</a>, with this inscription: Aristomenes dedicates this, out of the spoils of the Spartans, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GODDESS\">goddess</a>. It was easily perceived that this war would be both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> and bloody: the Lacedaemonians therefore sent deputies to Delphi, to inquire of the oracle concerning its event: the answer they received was, That it behoved the Spartans to seek a leader from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a>. The Athenians naturally envious of the Spartans, granted their request indeed, but in such a manner as manifested their spite; for they sent them for a general Tyrteus, a schoolmaster and poet, lame of one foot, and who was suspected to be a little out of his wits. But here their skill failed them; for this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">captain</a>, notwithstanding his despicable appearance, proved of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> to Sparta, teaching them how to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> good, and how to bear up under ill fortune.\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time, Aristomenes had drawn together a mighty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, the Eleans, Argives, Sicyonians, and Arcadians, having sent troops to his assistance; the Spartans in this, as in the former war, having no ally but Corinth. The Spartan kings, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>...\ncustom of their city, no sooner took the field, than, notwithstanding their inferiority in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, they offered the enemy battle, which Aristomenes readily accepted. It was long, obstinate, and bloody; but in the end the Messenians were victorious, and the Lacedemonians put to flight with a great slaughter. It is scarce to be conceived how much the Spartans were struck with this defeat: they grew weary of the war, dissatisfied with their kings, diffident of their own power, and in a word sunk into a state of general uneasiness and want of spirit. It was now that the Athenian general convinced them, that he was capable of fulfilling all the promises of the oracle; he encouraged them by his poems, directed them by his counsels, and recruited their broken armies with chosen men from among the Helotes. Aristomenes, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, acted with no less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a> and vigour. He thought it not enough to restore the reputation of the Messenians, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he did not also restore their wealth and power: he therefore taught them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> offensively against their enemies; and, entering the territories of Sparta, he took and plundered Phara, a considerable borough in Laconia, putting all such as made any resistance to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>, carrying off at the same time an immense booty. This, however, was an injury which the Spartans could not brook with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a>; they therefore sent immediately a body of forces to overtake the Messenians, which accordingly they did: but Aristomenes routed these pursuers, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to make a mighty slaughter of them, till such time as he was disabled by having a spear thrust in his side, which occasioned his being carried out of the battle. His cure, which took up some time, being finished, he resolved to carry the war even to the gates of Sparta; and to that purpose raised a very great army; but, whether he found his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> impracticable, or was really diverted by some dream, he gave out, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASTOR\">Castor</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLLUX\">Pollux</a>, with their sister Helena, had appeared to him, and commanded him to desist. A short time after this retreat, going with a small party to make an incursion, and attempting to take prisoners some women who were celebrating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RITES\">rites</a> near Eghla, a village in Laconia, those zealous matrons fell upon him and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> with such fury, that they put them to flight, and took him prisoner: however, he soon afterwards made his escape, and rejoined his forces. In the third year of the war, the Spartans with a great force entered Messenia, whither Aristocrates king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCADIA\">Arcadia</a> was come, with a great body of troops to the assistance of his allies: Aristomenes therefore made no difficulty of fighting when the Spartans approached; but they entering privately into a negociation with Aristocrates, engaged him with bribes and promises to betray his confederates. When the battle began, the deceitful Arcadian represented to the forces under his command the mighty danger they were in, and the great difficulty there would be of retreating into their own country, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> the battle should be lost: he then pretended, that the sacrifices were ominous; and, having terrified his Arcadians into the disosition of mind fittest to serve his purpose, he not only drew them off from both wings, but, in his flight, forced through the Messenian ranks, and put them too in confusion. Aristomenes and his troops, however, drew themselves into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> order, that they might defend themselves the best they could: and indeed they had need of all their valour and skill; for the Lacedemonians, who expected this event, immediately attacked and surrounded them on all sides. Fortune was, on this occasion, too powerful either for the courage or the conduct of the Messenians; so that, notwithstanding their utmost efforts, most of their army were cut to pieces, and amongst them the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a>. Aristomenes, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> remains of his shattered forces, retired as well as he could; and, perceiving that it was now impossible to maintain the war against the Lacedemonians upon equal terms, he exhorted his countrymen to fortify Mount Era, and to make the best dispositions possible for a long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>. He likewise placed garrisons in Pylus and Methone on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> coasts; and to these three places he gathered all the inhabitants, leaving the rest of Messenia to the mercy of the Spartans. They, on the other hand, looked on the war as now in a manner finished; for which reason they divided the lands among their citizens, and caused them to be carefully cultivated, while they besieged Era. But Aristomenes quickly convinced them that the war was far from being over: he chose out of all the Messenians 300 men, with whom he ravaged all the adjacent country: carried off a prodigious booty; and, when Messenia could no longer supply the wants of his garrison, penetrated into Laconia, and bore away corn, wine, cattle, and whatever else was necessary to the subsistence of his countrymen shut up in Era: so that at last the Spartans were constrained to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROCLAMATION\">proclamation</a>, forbidding the cultivation, not only of the Messenian territory in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, but also of Laconia in its vicinity; whereby they distressed themselves more than their enemies, inducing at last a famine in Sparta itself, which brought with it its usual attendant, sedition. Here again all things had gone wrong, if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> of the poet Tyrt\u00e6us had not supported the Spartan courage; nor was it without much difficulty that he influenced them to continue the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLOCKADE\">blockade</a> of Era, and to maintain a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAMP\">camp</a> for the security of the country.\n\nAristomenes, in spite of all these precautions, committed terrible depredations with his small corps of 300 men. Amongst other places which he plundered, the city of Amycl\u00e6 was one; from whence he carried not only a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a>, but also many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARRIAGES\">carriages</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LADEN\">laden</a> with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>. The kings of Sparta lying with their troops in its neighbourhood, as soon as they heard of this expedition, marched after Aristomenes with the utmost diligence; and, as the Messenians were encumbered with their booty, came up with them before they could reach Era. In this situation of things, Aristomenes, prompted rather by despair than prudence, disposed his troops in order of battle; and, notwithstanding they were so few, made a long and vigorous resistance against the whole Lacedemonian army. At length, however, numbers prevailed: the greatest part of the Messenians were slain on the spot; and Aristomenes, with about 50 of his men who survived the slaughter, were taken prisoners; that chief having received so many wounds, that he was senseless when they carried him away. The Lacedemonians expressed the loudest joy at the sight of this illustrious captive; who for so many years, by his single abilities,\nhad enabled his exhausted country to defend itself against the whole force of Sparta. When he was recovered of his wounds, they decreed him and all his fellow prisoners to be thrown together into a deep cavern, which was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> of the lowest kind of offenders. This judgment was executed with the utmost severity, excepting that Aristomenes had leave to put on his armour. Three days he continued in this dismal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, lying upon and covered over with dead bodies. The third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, he was almost famished through want of food, and almost poisoned with the stench of corrupted carcases, when he heard a fox gnawing a body near him. Upon this he uncovered his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a>, and perceiving the fox <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> by him, he with one hand seized one of its hind legs, and with the other defended his face, by catching hold of its jaw when it attempted to bite him. Following as well as he could his struggling guide, the fox at last thrust his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> into a little hole; and Aristomenes then letting go his leg, he soon forced his way through and opened a passage to the welcome rays of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, from which the noble Messenian had been so long debarred. Feeble as he was, Aristomenes wrought himself an outlet with his nails; and travelling by night with all the expedition he could, at length arrived safe at Era, to the great joy and amazement of his countrymen.\n\nWhen this news was first blazed abroad, the Spartans would have had it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> for a fiction; but Aristomenes soon put the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of it out of doubt, by falling on the posts of the Corinthians, who, as allies of the Spartans, had a considerable body of troops before Era. Most of their officers, with a multitude of private men, he slew; pillaged their camp; and in short, did so much mischief, that the Spartans under the pretence of an approaching festival, agreed to a cessation of arms for 40 days, that they might have time to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURY\">bury</a> their dead. On this occasion, Aristomenes for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> time celebrated the *hecatomphonia*, or the sacrifice appointed for those who had killed 100 of the enemy with their own hands. He had performed the same before and after his second battle: and he lived to do it a third time: which must appear wonderful to the reader, when he is informed, that notwithstanding this truce, certain Cretan archers in the service of the Spartans seized Aristomenes as he was walking without the walls, and carried him away a prisoner. There were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> of them in all: two of them immediately flew with the news to Sparta, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> remained to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIZE\">prize</a>, whom they bound, and conducted to a lone cottage inhabited only by a widow and her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a>. It so fell out that the young woman dreamt the night before that she <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> a lion without claws, bound, and dragged along by wolves; and that she having loosed his bonds, and given him claws, he immediately tore the wolves to pieces. As soon as Aristomenes came into the cottage, and her mother, who knew him, had told her who he was, she instantly concluded that her dream was fulfilled; and therefore plied the Cretans with drink, and when they were asleep, took a poniard from one of them, cut the thongs with which Aristomenes was bound, and then put it into his hands. He presently verified her vision, by putting all his guards to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>; and then carried her and her mother to Era, where, as a reward for her service, he married the young woman to his son Gorgus, then about 18 years of age.\n\nWhen Era had held out near eleven years, it fell into the hands of Sparta by an accident: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a> of one Empiramus, a Spartan commander, driving his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>'s cattle to drink at the river Neda, met frequently with the wife of a Messenian whom he engaged in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMOUR\">amour</a>. This woman gave him notice, that her husband's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> was without the wall; so that he could come to it without danger, when the good man was abroad; and she likewise gave him intelligence when her husband was upon duty in the garrison. The Spartan failed not to come at the time appointed; but they had not been long in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a> before the husband returned, which put the house into great confusion; the woman, however, secured her gallant; and then let in her husband, whom she received in appearance with great joy, inquiring again and again by what excess of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOOD_FORTUNE\">good fortune</a> she was blessed with his return. The innocent Messenian told her, that Aristomenes being detained in his bed by a wound, the soldiers knowing that he could not walk the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROUNDS\">rounds</a>, had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> to retire to their houses, to avoid the inclemency of the season. The Spartan no sooner heard this, than he crept softly out of doors, and hastened away to carry the news to his master. It so happened, that the kings were at this time absent from the camp, and Empiramus had the chief command of the army. As soon as he received this information, he ordered his army to begin its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">march</a>, though it rained excessively, and there was no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">moon</a> light. The fellow guided them to the ford, and managed matters so well that they seized all the Messenian posts; yet, after all, they were afraid to engage; darkness, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>, heavy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a>, together with the dread of Aristomenes, keeping them quiet in the places they had seized. As soon as it was light the attack began; and Era had been quickly taken, if only the men had defended it; but the women fought with such fury, and by their mingling in the fray, brought such an accession of numbers, as made the event doubtful. Three days and two nights this desperate engagement lasted: at last, all hopes of preserving the city being lost, Aristomenes drew off his wearied troops. Early in the fourth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, he disposed the women and children in the centre, the Messenian youth in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> and rear, the less able men in the main body: himself commanded the van; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-REAR_GUARD\">rear-guard</a> was brought up by Gorgus and Manticius, the former the son of Aristomenes, the latter of Theocles, a Messenian of great merit, who fell with much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> in this attack, fighting valiantly in the cause of his country. When all things were ready, Aristomenes caused the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARRIER\">barrier</a> to be thrown open; and, brandishing his spear, marched directly towards the Spartan troops, in order to force a passage. Empiramus, perceiving his intent, ordered his men to open to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> and left, and fairly gave them a passage; so that Aristomenes marched off in triumph, as it were, to Arcadia.\n\nThe Arcadians, when they heard that Era was taken, were very desirous of succouring their old confederates in this deep distress: they therefore entreated their king Aristocrates to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> them into Messenia.\nBut he, corrupted by the Lacedemonians, persuaded them that it was too late; that the Messenians were all cut off; and that such a step would only expose them to the fury of the conquerors. When the things appeared to be otherwise, and it was known that Aristomenes was on the frontiers of Arcadia, they went in crowds to carry him provisions, and to testify their readiness to afford him and those under his command all the assistance in their power. Aristomenes desired to be heard before a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a>; which being accordingly convoked, he there opened one of the boldest and best laid schemes recorded in history; he said, that he had yet 500 undaunted soldiers, who, at his command, would undertake anything; that it was very probable most of the Spartans were employed in pillaging Era, and that therefore he determined to march and surprise Sparta; which appeared so sensible, that all the assembly loudly commended his great capacity and unshaken courage. Aristocrates, however, took care to betray him; having, by various pretences, retarded the execution of the project. The Arcadians, who began to suspect him, waited for and surprised the messengers as they came back. They took the letters from them, and read them openly in the assembly. The purport of them was, that they acknowledged his great kindness both now and in the battle; and promised, that the Lacedemonians would be grateful. As soon as the letters were read, the Arcadians fell to stoning their king, frequently calling upon the Messenians to assist them; which, however, they did not, waiting for Aristomenes's order; who, far from triumphing in this spectacle, stood still, with his eyes fixed on the ground, which he wet with his tears, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> pierced with sorrow to see a crowned head so shamefully and so deservedly put to death. The Arcadians afterwards erected a monument over him, with an inscription to perpetuate his infamy. As for the Messenians under the command of Gorgus and Manticles, they passed over into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SICILY\">Sicily</a>; where they founded the city of Messene, one of the most famous in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>. Aristomenes remained, however, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>; where he married all his daughters, except the youngest, to persons of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RHODES\">Rhodes</a>, inquiring of the oracle at Delphi, whom he should espouse, that his subjects might be happy under his posterity, was directed to marry the daughter of the most worthy of the Greeks; which answer was immediately understood to point at the virgin daughter of Aristomenes. Her therefore he demanded, and received; Aristomenes accompanying him back to his dominions, where he formed a scheme of uniting the Lydians and Medes against the Spartans, resolving with this view to go into Media, and to the court of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SARDIS\">Sardis</a>; but while he meditated those great things, death surprised him, and thereby freed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LACEDEMON\">Lacedemon</a> from the most formidable enemy she ever had.","sp":591,"ep":594},{"h":"MESSIAH","t":"a word signifying one anointed, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> installed into an office by unction.

In a word, That this glorious person should be regarded by all who believed in him as a divine teacher, an atoning sacrifice, and a royal governor; by means of whom God would make a covenant with his people, very different from that made with Israel of old; in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of which they should be restored to, and established in, the divine favour, and fixed in a state of perpetual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>. See JESUS CHRIST, and CHRISTIANITY.\n\nThe Jews, as was already observed, still wait for the coming of the Messiah, being impressed with the notion of a temporal Messiah, who is to be a mighty conqueror, and to subdue all the world. Most of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> rabbins, according to Buxtorf, believe that the Messiah is already come, but that he keeps himself concealed, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not manifest himself because of the sins of the Jews. Some of the Jews, however, in order to reconcile those prophecies that seem to contradict each other as to the character and condition of the Messiah, have had recourse to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> of two Messiahs, who are yet to succeed each other; one in a state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUMILIATION\">humiliation</a> and suffering; the other of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>, splendor, and power. The first, they say, is to proceed from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> of Ephraim, who is to fight against Gog, and to be slain by Amnillus, Zech. xii. 10. The second is to be of the tribe of Judah, and\nand lineage of David, who is to conquer and kill Antichrist, and restore the kingdom of Israel, reigning over it in the highest glory and felicity.\n\nJesus Christ asserts himself the Messiah. In St John iv. 25, the Samaritan woman says to Jesus, \"I know that when Messiah comes, who is called the Christ, he will tell us all things.\" Jesus answered her, \"I that speak to thee am he.\"\n\nThere are several impostors, who have endeavoured to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> for Messiahs, as Christ himself predicted. J. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENT\">Lent</a>, a Dutchman, has written a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> De Pseudomessiahs \"Of false Messiahs.\" The first he mentions was one Barcochab, who appeared under the empire of Adrian. The last was Rabbi Mordecai, who began to be talked of in 1682. A little before him, viz. in 1666, appeared Sabbethai Sebi, who was taken by the Turks, and turned Mahometan.","sp":594,"ep":595},{"h":"MESSINA","t":"an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>, handsome, and strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SICILY\">Sicily</a>, and in the Val di Demona, with a citadel, several forts, a fine spacious harbour, and an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a>'s see.

This city in the beginning of the year 1783 suffered most dreadfully by the earthquakes which shook great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CALABRIA\">Calabria</a> and Sicily to their foundations, overturned many rich and populous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>, and buried thousands in their ruins: (see CALABRIA, and EARTHQUAKE, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOLOGY\">GEOLOGY</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">Index</a>).\u2014The following account of Messina, as it stood before the above <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, is extracted from Mr Swinburne's Travels in Sicily.\n\nA large chain of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> presses upon the shore, and part of the city stands upon elevated ground. The mountains are many of them nobly wooded; the hills before them finely chequered with groves and fields. As the town runs in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SWEEP\">sweep</a> along the edge of a declivity, every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> is seen to advantage, while the less noble parts are hidden by the Palazzata. This is a regular ornamental range of lofty houses, with 19 gates, answering to as many streets: it follows the semicircular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEND\">bend</a> of the port for one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> and five <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-POLES\">poles</a>, and would have been the handsomest line of buildings in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> been completed; but a considerable part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> is not finished, except merely in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> wall, and that seems to be in a very ruinous condition. Philibert Emmanuel de Savoy, viceroy of Sicily, in 1622, began this princely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>. Before it is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> quay, decorated with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATUES\">statues</a> and fountains; ships of any burden can moor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARAPET\">parapet</a> in great depth of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>. At the west extremity is a small fort and a gate; the other end is closed by the governor's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> and the citadel, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> pentagonal fortress, built on the point where the isthmus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> braccio di San Raniero issues from the main <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a>. On this slip of low ground, which with the Palazzata forms the circular harbour of Messina, is placed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTHOUSE\">lighthouse</a> (farsetto), and on the point the old castle of St Salvatore. The circumference of the port is four miles: it probably owes its formation to an earthquake, which opened an immense chasm, and then filled it with water. Near the lighthouse is a kind of whirlpool in the sea, shown as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARYBDIS\">Charybdis</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>.\n\nThe inner part of Messina is dirty, though it contains a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of neat churches and large substantial dwellings. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHEDRAL\">cathedral</a> is Gothic, enriched with Saracenic mosaics on the altars and shrines; the front of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> altar is particularly splendid: Gagini has embellished the pulpit and some tombs with excellent specimens of his art.\u2014In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURY\">treasury</a> of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> is preserved the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PALLADIUM\">palladium</a> of Messina, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> from the Virgin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a> to its citizens (a). This is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> upon which the Messinese build their pretensions.\n\n(a) The story is as follows: After St Paul had made some stay at Messina (a circumstance of his travels unnoticed by St Luke), the Messinese prevailed upon him to return to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a> with an embassy of four persons sent by the city to the Virgin Mary. Their excellencies were graciously received by her, and brought back a letter written with her own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEBREW\">Hebrew</a> tongue, which St Paul translated into Greek. By the irruption of the Saracens this invaluable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURE\">treasure</a> was lost, and utterly forgotten till the year 1467, when Constantine Lascaris, a refugee Greek, found a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> of it, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> it into Latin, made it known to the citizens, and then to all the Catholic world. Its authenticity is now so well established at Messina, that Regna the historian candidly acknowledges, that whoever was to confess even a doubt on the subject in that city would be treated as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFIDEL\">infidel</a>.\n\nThis curious epistle is conceived in these terms:\u2014<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARIA\">Maria</a> Virgo, Joachim filia, Dei humillima Christi Jesu crucifixi mater, ex tribu Jud\u00e6, stirpe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAVID\">David</a>, Messanensis omnibus salutem, et Dei Patris Omnipotentis benedictionem. Vos omnes fide magna legatos ac nuncios per publicum documentum <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-AD\">ad</a> nos misisse constat. Filium nostrum Dei genitum Deum et hominem esse fatemini, et in celum <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POST\">post</a> suam resurrectionem ascendisse, Pauli apostoli electi predicacione mediatanea viam veritatis agnoscentes. Ob quod vos et ipsam civitatem <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-BENE\">bene</a> dicimus, cujus perpetuum protectricem nos esse volumus. Anno filii nostri XLII. Indict. I. III. Nonas Junii, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUNA\">luna</a> XXVII. feria V. ex Hyerosolymis.\n\nThus translated:\u2014\"The Virgin Mary, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of Joachim, most humble mother of God, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a> Christ crucified, of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> of Juda and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> of David, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> and the blessing of God the Father Almighty to all the people of Messina. Out of the abundance of your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>, you have, in consequence of a public deliberation, sent a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEPUTATION\">deputation</a> to me; and since you acknowledge that my son is both God and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, and that he ascended into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a> after his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESURRECTION\">resurrection</a>, as you have learned from the preaching of St Paul the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APOSTLE\">apostle</a>,\npretensions to pre-eminence over the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>, nay over the whole world; to its virtues and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRONAGE\">patronage</a> they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> every piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOOD_FORTUNE\">good fortune</a>, and to their own unworthiness all sinister events that have befallen them. The authenticity of this epistle has been seriously impugned, and of course vigorously defended by many Sicilian divines and disputators.\n\nThere is another church in this city that deserves particular notice, not so much on account of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a> or ornaments, as for its being the last refuge of the Greek liturgy, which was once the predominant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> of the island, but gradually abolished by different conquerors. It is dedicated to the Virgin Mary de Graphco, or of the Letter, which denomination may perhaps have furnished Lascaris with the idea of his letter. It is known at present by the name of la Cattolica. According to the Greek canons, the entrance of monastic churches was reciprocally forbidden to each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEX\">sex</a>, and the cathedrals were the only places of worship where a daily sacrifice was offered up by the bishop and clergy, and where both men and women were present at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, but in different parts of the church. From this general admittance the building acquired the title of Catholic or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a>.\n\nMessina is all paved with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAVA\">lava</a>, cut into large flags of two feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>: a material which the vicinity of lavas renders it easy to procure, and which being very hard resists friction better than any other.\n\nDuring a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of ages, notwithstanding the various revolutions and calamities to which it has been exposed, this city has still maintained its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> situation; while most other cities have shifted their ground more or less from the place where they were first founded. But its situation enjoys advantages which have still tempted such of its inhabitants as escaped from the ravages of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> and the desolation of earthquakes to prefer it to every other spot, however delightful or secure. It is of very ancient origin; it has been under many different races of monarchs, and its name has been repeatedly changed: It has been at different times called Zancle, Mamertina, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MESSANA\">Messana</a>. Its first name Zancle, which in the old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of Sicily meant \"a sickle;\" alluding, as some authors suppose, to the form of the port; or, according to others, to the fertility of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. Allured by the advantages of its situation, the Cum\u00e6ans, a commercial and enterprising people, invaded the island and drove the Siculi from this settlement; they were in their turn overpowered by a band of Samian adventurers, who made way for a colony of citizens of Messene, and under these masters it changed its name to Messana. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> was of short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>; for in the 28th year before Christ it was destroyed by the Mamertines, a warlike unprincipled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> inhabiting the south part of Bruttium. These <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> being received into Messana on their return to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a> from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYRACUSE\">Syracuse</a>, where they had served as mercenaries in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> of Agathocles, took an opportunity of massacring the inhabitants and usurping their possessions. The city was now called Mamertina; and, in order to support themselves against the resentment of the Sicilian powers, the Mamertines implored the protection of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, who, eager to extend their dominion beyond the limits of Italy, and jealous of the growing power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARTHAGE\">Carthage</a>, made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> scruple to succour these assassins with a consular army. This step brought on the first Punic war. The Mamertines reaped no other fruit from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> but a more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SLAVERY\">slavery</a>; for such was the real <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of their connexion with Rome, whatever name it might be disguised under.\n\nMessina was, however, always distinguished by particular attentions and favours from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a>; and, excepting a short period during the wars of the triumvirate, appears to have tasted all the sweets of Roman prosperity, without partaking of the bitter draughts of adversity. Its fate, in the ruin of the empire, was similar to that of the rest of Sicily. In 829 Messina fell into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of the Saracens, but obtained very honourable terms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITULATION\">capitulation</a>; for half the city was left to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>, where they were to be governed by their own laws, and profess their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> undisturbed. In the other resided the bey of one of the five provinces into which the Arabian conquerors had divided the island. Notwithstanding this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a>, Messina was the first to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> off the yoke in 1037, when George Maniaces landed an army of Greeks and Normans on the shore of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FARO\">Faro</a>. It afterwards held out against the whole Mussulman force, till the feeble state of a distracted empire shut out all hopes of assistance from Constantinople. This unfortunate city then opened its gates to the army of the caliph, and felt very severely the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of his resentment, but it did not long groan under the yoke; for in less than 20 years Roger the Norman took it by surprise, and delivered it from Mahometan oppression. During the crusade our Richard Coeur de Lion and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a> Augustus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> of France wintered here in their way to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PALESTINE\">Palestine</a>; a sojourn marked by continual quarrels, conflagration, and bloodshed. The Messinese were particularly tardy in entering into the national <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSPIRACY\">conspiracy</a> of 1282, but afterwards exceeded the rest of the insurgents in deeds of cruelty: This, and the importance of their situation, singled them out for the first objects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a>'s vengeance. He invested their city very closely, and declared so openly his determination to refuse all terms whatever to the besieged, that they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> no hopes of safety but in an obstinate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>. Their courage, perseverance, and sufferings, were excessive; at length their strength and resources began to fail rapidly, and every circumstance seemed to denounce their speedy destruction, when Roger Lauria appeared off the harbour with the Arragonian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a>, forced the king to retire with precipitation across\n\nI give my blessing to you and all your city, and agree to become your protectress. In the 42d year of my Son, the 1st of the indiction, the 3d <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a>, and the 27th of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>, at Jerusalem.\"\n\nNot to dwell upon the astronomical blunders in these dates, let it suffice to observe, that Lascaris was not aware that Denis the Little, a Syrian monk in the 6th century, was the first who made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of the era that commences at our Saviour's birth.\nthe straits, and in his sight defeated and destroyed his naval armament. Robert, grandson of Charles I., also made a fruitless attack; but in the disturbed reign of Frederic III., Messina was delivered up to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> king of Naples and his consort <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> Joan, who entered it in triumph. In a few years it returned to its former possessors. The year 1672 was remarkable for the revolt of the Messinese.\u2014They threw off the Spanish yoke, and swore <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALLEGIANCE\">allegiance</a> to Louis XIV., king of France. They were for some time vigorously assisted by the French; but before the Spaniards had gained the least advantage to excite any hopes of recovering so valuable a possession, Louis found himself necessitated from motives of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a> his new subjects, and leave them to the mercy of their old incensed masters. The horror of being thus abandoned, and the chastisement inflicted by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, broke the fierce spirit of the Messinese; they were still stunned with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-REMEMBRANCE\">remembrance</a> and effects of this blow, when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAGUE\">plague</a> in 1743 was introduced from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEVANT\">Levant</a>, and swept away more than half the inhabitants. From this chain of calamities, the opulence, trade, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> of Messina, have been gradually sinking; and unless very favourable circumstances happen, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> every year <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> lower. The number of its inhabitants does not now exceed 30,000.\n\nThe following particulars are added from M. Houel, who visited this city since the late earthquakes, which completed its destruction.\n\nOn the front of the cathedral there is a square, which, though not regular, is far from being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a>. This was not the largest square in Messina before its overthrow; but it was the most elegant, the most splendidly adorned, and the best frequented. There stands in this square an equestrian statue of Charles II. of Spain, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRONZE\">bronze</a>, which has been spared by the earthquake. It stands on a marble pedestal, in the middle of the square. Opposite to this statue is an elegant marble fountain, ornamented with a variety of figures, representing men and other animals, all of them spouting out water in great abundance; which used, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, to spread an agreeable and refreshing coolness over the square, that induced <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> to assemble here. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">Seven</a> streets terminated here. The cathedral forms a part of the square. It is dedicated to the blessed Virgin; the occasion of which has been already mentioned.\n\nThere is an anniversary feast celebrated in Messina, which is called the feast of the Letter. A lock of the Virgin's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>, which she sent to the Messenians at the same time with the letter, is carried through the city in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESSION\">procession</a> in a crystal vessel. She made also a present of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> to the Messenian deputies. It is placed over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABERNACLE\">tabernacle</a>. None but the canons of the cathedral are permitted to touch, or take up on their shoulders, the silver shrine in which the crystal vessel with the Virgin's hair is deposited. Eight of those canons, with mitres on their heads, bear this shrine in the procession. The canopy suspended over it is supported by six senators in their robes. The picture and the hair are shown to strangers. This procession, and the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> ceremonies of this festival, are followed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> races. The spirits of the people being already elevated by their religious exercises, they engage with amazing eagerness in these and the other diversions with which they are accompanied: a tumultuous joy reigns over the city; and the evening concludes with illuminations and fireworks. The ships in the harbour pay the citizens the compliment of entertaining them with a discharge of their guns on the occasion.\n\nThrough a square called the Square of the Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">Hospital</a>, runs a large and impetuous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TORRENT\">torrent</a>, the Porto delle Legni. It is precipitated from those lofty mountains which overlook this city on the south side. The channel which it has cut out for itself is at times entirely full. It would, on such occasions, overflow the square and other parts of the city, were it not confined by walls which have been built on both sides to prevent such accidents.\u2014Another stream of a similar origin, called the Torrent of La Bocetta, runs through another part of the city, it is also confined within walls to prevent it from overflowing.\n\nThe Square of St John of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALTA\">Malta</a> is one of the largest in Messina. In the middle of this square is a fine marble fountain, ornamented with a variety of sculptured figures and jets d'eau. Beside the fountain there used to stand a large reservoir for horses to drink out of.\n\nIn the time of the annual festivals, there used to be exhibited on the water of the reservoir a galley, or rather a fictitious representation of a galley, with galley-slaves, soldiers, officers, and a commander on board, all in arms, and the galley properly equipped as a ship of war. This galley was decorated with great art; and by night the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASTS\">masts</a>, and every other suitable part, were hung with lamps, which illuminated it in a very splendid manner. Every thing around was so artificially disposed, that when the fire-works were played off, the spectator was led to think, though he perceived only one galley, that the noise which he heard was produced by a naval <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBAT\">combat</a>; and that the other ships were concealed from his view by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a> occasioned by the guns and fireworks. This, when properly conducted, was a noble spectacle. The senate repaired thither from the cathedral, attended with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> and a numerous company. In one carriage sat six senators, the governor of the city, and sometimes the archbishop. It was exceedingly large and drawn by six <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> horses very richly harnessed. Other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARRIAGES\">carriages</a> followed, with the train who attended the governor and the senators.\n\nAlmost all festivals owe their origin to some extraordinary event, or some singular story either true or false. It is said, that when the splendor with which the feast of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSUMPTION\">Assumption</a> de la <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARA\">Bara</a> was celebrated at Messina, first began to attract foreigners to the city, on that occasion such crowds repaired thither as to alarm the inhabitants with the fears of a famine: But one year, when the number of strangers was greater than usual at the time of this festival, the magistrates were very much at a loss how to supply them with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>; and at length, every other resource failing, no hopes of relief remained but from the kindness of the Blessed Virgin. Fervent prayers were addressed to their patroness: and next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> by day-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> three brigantines appeared entering the harbour with full sails. They proved to be loaded with corn. It was eagerly purchased: and the people of the city hasted to appease their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUNGER\">hunger</a>. But when they came after\nrefreshing themselves to pay the corn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, neither ships nor merchants could be found. After their first emotions of surprise had subsided, they naturally concluded that such a seasonable supply must undoubtedly be a present from the Virgin, who, being pleased with the zeal of her Messenian votaries, and desirous to prevent the concourse of strangers who attended the festival from diminishing, had interposed in this miraculous manner to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> them from the distresses of famine. A new festival was celebrated in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> to their generous benefactress. Three small vessels of silver were made, and dedicated to the Virgin in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of the event; and these are at present used as lamps in the cathedral. The senate likewise decreed, that the clergy should pay annually a small tax, to be laid out in constructing a small gallery to swim on the fountain, and in defraying the expenses of the fireworks. The profits of the clergy are so considerable on the occasion of the festival, that they may be supposed to pay the tax with great cheerfulness.\n\nIn Messina, as in the other cities of Sicily, the women wrap themselves in a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> mantle above the rest of their dress. The stuffs are richer or plainer according to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> and circumstances. People who are not rich enough to have fine clothes of their own, hire them at so much an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>. There are women who make a livelihood by lending out their clothes. The mantle covers the wearer from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> to foot.\u2014It reduces the old and the young, the ill-shaped and the handsome, pretty much to an equality in point of appearance. This must naturally appear very unfavourable to the influence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>. But yet, on proper occasions, at church or in a public walk, the ladies of Messina find means to open and adjust the mantle so as to display all their beauties of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a> and shape, and to attract the affections of lovers, perhaps more powerfully than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> their dress were suited to display their charms in a more ostentatious manner.\n\nBetween Messina and the tower of Faro there stands a small church called the Madonna of the Grotto. It was anciently a temple of a round structure, and ornamented with columns like the temple of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> at Rome. Modern columns now supply the place that was occupied by the ancient. There are large niches in the rock adjoining to the temple, which are thought to be of equal antiquity. These contain no sculptured figures; but in Pagan times they might possibly contain some.\n\nMessina being situated between Mount \u00c6tna and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GULF\">gulf</a> of Charybdis, and being likewise at no great distance from the volcanoes of Lipari and Stromboli, must have been in all ages liable to suffer by earthquakes. Such terrible events, however, appear to have been more unfrequent in ancient than in modern times, and have actually alarmed the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> oftener than any other. In the year 1693 a fourth part of the cities of Sicily was destroyed by an earthquake. Messina merely felt the shock; all its buildings, however, suffered. In the year 1742 it suffered another equally violent. A plague which followed in 1743 retarded the repairs necessary after the earthquake. In the year 1780 this city <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>, for more than six months, to suffer from new earthquakes.\n\nWere the state of the elements, previous to these dreadful events, carefully examined, it might perhaps be found to undergo certain changes which might be considered as prognosticating them.\n\nThe autumn of the year 1782 was unusually <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> and rainy. Fahrenheit's thermometer was often as low as 56 degrees. The succeeding winter was dry; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a> never fell under 25 degrees: And, what is uncommon in that season, storms were now and then observed to arise from the west. The pilots in the channel observed that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-TIDES\">tides</a> no longer rose at the usual periods, and the gulf of Charybdis raged with extraordinary fury.\n\nOn the 5th of February 1783, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> was heavy and calm; the sky obscured with thick <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">clouds</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a> seemingly all in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a>. About half after twelve at noon, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> began to shake with a dreadful noise. The shocks continually increased, and became at length so violent as to open the ground, and to overturn in two or three minutes a considerable part of the buildings.\n\nA long white cloud appeared to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>-west; and soon after another, very dark, in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of the heavens. The latter in a moment spread over the whole horizon, and deluged the city with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIL\">hail</a>, accompanied with dreadful claps of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a>. The inhabitants fled in the utmost terror to the fields and the ships in the harbour.\n\nFrom mid-day till five in the afternoon the earthquake continued almost without interruption. The shocks then became somewhat less frequent. The cries of the dying; the shrieks of those who were half buried under the ruins; the wild terror with which others, who were still able, attempted to make their escape; the despair of fathers, mothers, and husbands, bereft of those who were dearest to them; then formed altogether a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of horror, such as can but seldom occur in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of the calamities of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>. Amid that awful scene, instances of the most heroic courage and the most generous affection were displayed. Mothers, regardless of their own safety, rushed into every danger to snatch their children from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. Conjugal and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FILIAL\">filial</a> affection prompted deeds not less desperate and heroic. But no sooner did the earthquake cease, than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> wretches who had escaped began to feel the influence of very different passions. When they returned to visit the ruins, to seek out the situation of their fallen dwellings, to inquire into the fate of their families, to procure food and collect some remains of their former fortunes\u2014such as found their circumstances the most wretched became suddenly animated with rage, which nothing but wild despair could inspire. The distinction of ranks, and the order of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> were disregarded, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> eagerly violated. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">Murder</a>, rapine, and lawless robbery, reigned among the smoking ruins.\n\nAbout one in the morning another shock of the earthquake was felt, which overturned most of the houses that were still standing. Most of those whom want, or avarice, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>, still detained among the ruins, now shared the same fate with their friends whom the former shocks had buried under them.\n\nThe succeeding day scarce alleviated the distress of this dismal night: the few wretches who still survived found themselves destitute of every necessary. At length order was in some degree re-established; and in\ntwo days after every person was supplied at least with some small portion of the necessaries for subsistence.\n\nNone yet thought of returning to take up their abode among the ruins. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> people fixed their residence on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> of Porto Salvo, near the town of Salleo. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBLES\">nobles</a>, magistrates, and merchants, took up their abode on another plain, on the other part of the stream Porto de Legno; the soldiers at Terra Nuova.\n\nSome violent shocks which were again felt on the 7th of February and the 28th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> completed the destruction of the city. The corn magazines, however, escaped without damage: and the public ovens and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AQUEDUCTS\">aqueducts</a> were but little injured. From these facts it may perhaps be inferred, that had not the houses of Messina been, in general, hastily built at the first, and afterwards carelessly repaired, fewer of them would have been overthrown by the earthquake.\n\nThe neighbouring villages having suffered but little, were the first to relieve the remaining inhabitants of Messina in their distress. Maltese galleys for some days supplied necessaries to the poor and the sick with a generosity which merits the highest praise. They brought surgeons and whatever was needful for the cure of the wounded. The supplies sent by the king of France were refused, for what reason we know not. What money was needed for the support of the people was taken from the treasury of the city of Messina; for what the king of Naples sent was seized and spent by the garrison.\n\nIt is said that not more than 800 or 900 persons perished by this earthquake. The sea during that convulsion of the land was slightly agitated in the harbour. Farther out the sea was more violently agitated; but none of the ships in the harbour were dashed to pieces. The waters rose so high as to be injurious in a very considerable degree to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHAROS\">Pharos</a>, as well as along the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SCYLLA\">Scylla</a> and Bagmara.\n\nThis earthquake was not of a momentary duration, like that by which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LISBON\">Lisbon</a> was destroyed, and like many others; for more than sixty days from the 5th of February to the beginning of April, Messina continued to be shaken, and in that time felt more than 200 shocks; and even after that period the alarm was again and again renewed. Not only the magistrates, the soldiers and the people, but the priests likewise, with their tabernacle and altar, retired to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARRACKS\">barracks</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NUNS\">nuns</a>, too, deserted their cloisters, and sought a retreat without the walls. Some of them confined themselves to the gardens of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONVENTS\">convents</a>; others mixed indiscriminately with the people.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> damage which the public buildings within the city suffered was the fall of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOME\">dome</a> of the church of Purgatory. Only the walls were left standing; and even these had suffered considerably. One half of the steeple of the cathedral was beaten to the ground. The magazines of Porto Franco were likewise very much shattered. The fort of St Salvator, being built on an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> foundation, the side next the sea is there fallen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>; but on the other side, where it is founded on a rock, it has stood unmoved by all the shocks of the earthquake.\n\nOn the 5th of February, when the earthquake was more violent than at any time afterwards, a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a> of sulphur was felt. The earth was affected somewhat in the same way as if it had been borne up on a fluid; and seemed to reel with the shocks much like a ship tossed with the waves. This tremendous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> was felt all over Sicily; but towards Pharos it became weaker. On the following days the sky was cloudy; the mountains of Sicily and the shores of Calabria continued covered with a thick fog like smoke. North and north-east winds raged with the most violent impetuosity.\n\nThe disastrous year of this earthquake was scarce concluded, the chasms which it had opened in the ground were still yawning, and the poor inhabitants of the adjacent country still trembled with terror, when the elements again renewed their fury to ravage this miserable land.\n\nOn Tuesday the 6th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1783, about sunrise, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> began to blow softly from the north-east. The sea gradually swelled, rose beyond its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a> with rapid impetuosity, overflowed the quay of Messina, and lashed with its billows the ruins of the Palazzata. It loosened and displaced many of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MOLE\">mole</a>, spread over the whole street, and attacked the pedestals of the statues which had been spared by the earthquake, and still stood firm among the ruins. The same furious wind which swelled the sea in so extraordinary a manner, ravaged the whole coast from Messina all the way to Syracuse.","sp":595,"ep":599},{"h":"MESSUAGE","t":"MESSAGIUM, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">Law</a>, a dwelling-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, with some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> adjoining assigned for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>.

A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> connected with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a>, resembles a tree, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a> and branches of which are connected with a common root: but let us suppose, that a family is figured, not barely to be like a tree, but to be a tree; and then the simile will be converted into a metaphor, in the following manner:\n\nEdward's sev'n sons, whereof thyself art one,\nWere sev'n fair branches, springing from one root;\nSome of these branches by the dest'ries cut:\nBut Thomas, my dear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">lord</a>, my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, my Glo'ster,\nOne flourishing branch of his most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> root,\nIs hack'd <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> leaves all faded,\nBy Envy's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">Murder</a>'s bloody axe.\n\nRichard II., <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> i. sc. 3.\n\nFiguring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> life to be a voyage at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>.\n\nThere is a tide in the affairs of men,\nWhich, taken at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOD\">flood</a>, leads on to Fortune:\nOmitted, all the voyage of their life\nIs bound in shallows and in miseries.\nOn such a full sea are we now afloat:\nAnd we must take the current when it serves,\nOr lose our ventures.

A metaphor is defined above to be an act of the imagination, figuring one thing to be another. An allegory requires no such operation, nor is one thing figured to be another: it consists in choosing a subject having properties or circumstances resembling those of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> subject: and the former is described in such a manner as to represent the latter: the subject thus represented is kept out of view: we are left to discover it by reflection; and we are pleased with the discovery, because it is our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>. (See the word Allegory.)\n\nQuintilian gives the following instance of an allegory.\n\nO navis, referent in mare te <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVI\">novi</a>\nFluctus. O quid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGIS\">agis</a>? fortiter occupa portum.\n\nHorat. lib. ode 14.\n\nand explains it elegantly in the following words: \"Tosusque ille Horatii locus, quo navim pro republica, fluctuum tempestates pro bellis civilibus, portum pro pace atque <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCORDIA\">concordia</a>, dicit.\"\n\nIn a figure of speech, there is no fiction of the imagination employed, as in a metaphor; nor a representative subject introduced, as in an allegory. This figure, as its name implies, regards the expression only, not the thought; and it may be defined, the using a word in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> different from what is proper to it.\u2014Thus youth, or the beginning of life, is expressed figuratively by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> of life: morning is the beginning of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>; and in that view it is employed to signify the beginning of any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a>, life especially, the progress of which is reckoned by days. See Figure of Speech.\n\nMetaphor and allegory are so much connected, that it seemed proper to handle them together: the rules particularly for distinguishing the good from the bad, are common to both. We shall therefore proceed to those rules, after adding some examples to illustrate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of an allegory, which, with a view to this article, was but slightly illustrated under its proper name.\n\nHorace, speaking of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> to Pyrrha, which was now extinguished, expressed himself thus:\n\nMe tabula sacer\nVotivae paries indicat uvida\nSuspendisse potenti\nVestimenta maris Deo.\n\nCarm. lib. i. ode 5.\n\nAgain:\nPh\u0153bus volentem pr\u00e6lia me loqui,\nVictas et urbes, incerepit, lyra\nNe parva Tyrrhenum per sequor\nVela darem.\n\nCarm. lib. iv. ode 15.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a>. Great lords, wise men ne'er sit and wail their loss,\nBut cheerly seek how to redress their harms.\nWhat though the mast be now blown overboard,\nThe cable broke, the holding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANCHOR\">anchor</a> lost,\nAnd half our sailors swallowed in the flood!\nYet lives our pilot still. Is't meet that he\nShould leave the helm, and, like a fearful lad,\n\nWith tearful eyes add <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> to the sea,\nAnd give more strength to that which hath too much;\nWhile in his moan the ship splits on the rock,\nWhich industry and courage might have sav'd?\nAh, what a shame! ah, what a fault were this!\n\nThird Part of Henry VI. act v. sc. 5.\n\nOroonoko. Ha! thou has rous'd\nThe lion in his den; he stalks abroad,\nAnd the wide forest trembles at his roar.\nI find the danger now.\n\nOroonoko. act. iii. sc. 2.\n\n\"My well beloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill. He fenced it, gathered out the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> thereof, planted it with the choicest vine, built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a wine press therein; he looked that it should bring forth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAPES\">grapes</a>, and it brought forth wild grapes. And now, O inhabitants of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a>, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard. What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done? Wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes? And now go to, I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down. And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged, but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">clouds</a> that they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> no rain upon it. For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant.\" Isaiah v. 1.\n\nThe rules that govern metaphors and allegories are of two kinds. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of these figures comes under the first kind: the propriety or impropriety of introduction comes under the other.\u2014To begin with rules of the first kind; some of which coincide with those already given for similes; some are peculiar to metaphors and allegories.\n\nIn the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, It has been observed, that a simile cannot be agreeable where the resemblance is either too strong or too faint. This holds equally in metaphor and allegory; and the reason is the same in all. In the following instances, the resemblance is too faint to be agreeable.\n\nMalcolm. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014But there's no bottom, none;\nIn my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,\nYour matrons, and your maids, could not fill-up\nThe cistern of my lust.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MACBETH\">Macbeth</a>, act iv. sc. 4.\n\nThe best way to judge of this metaphor, is to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> it into a simile: which would be bad, because there is scarce any resemblance between lust and a cistern, or betwixt enormous lust and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> cistern.\n\nAgain:\nHe cannot buckle his distemper'd cause\nWithin the belt of rule.\n\nMacbeth, act v. sc. 2.\n\nThere is no resemblance between a distempered cause and any body that can be confined within a belt.\n\nAgain:\nSteep me in poverty to the very lips.\n\nOthello, act iv. sc. 9.\n\nPoverty\nMetaphor. Poverty here must be conceived a fluid, which it resembles not in any manner.\n\nSpeaking to Bolingbroke banished for six years:\n\nThe sullen passage of thy weary steps\nEsteem a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, wherein thou art to set\nThe precious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JEWEL\">jewel</a> of thy home return.\n\nRichard II. act ii. sc. 6.\n\nAgain:\n\nHere is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a>,\nAnd every word in it a gaping wound\nIssuing life-blood.\n\nMerchant of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a>, act. iii. sc. 3.\n\nTantae molis erat Romanam condere gentem.\n\n\u00c6neid. i. 37.\n\nThe following metaphor is strained beyond all endurance: Timur-bec, known to us by the name of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TAMERLANE\">Tamerlane</a> the Great, writes to Bajazet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> of the Ottomans in the following terms:\n\n\"Where is the monarch who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DARES\">dares</a> resist us? where is the potentate who doth not glory in being numbered among our attendants? As for thee, descended from a Turcoman sailor, since the vessel of thy unbounded ambition hath been wreck'd in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GULF\">gulf</a> of thy self-love, it would be proper, that thou shouldst take in the sails of thy temerity, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> the anchor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REPENTANCE\">repentance</a> in the port of sincerity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, which is the port of safety; lest the tempest of our vengeance make thee perish in the sea of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> thou deservest.\"\n\nSuch strained figures, as observed above, are not unfrequent in the first dawn of refinement; the mind in a new enjoyment knows no bounds, and is generally carried to excess, till <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> discover the proper limits.\n\nSecondly. Whatever resemblance subjects may have, it is wrong to put one for another, where they bear no mutual proportion. Upon comparing a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> to a very low subject, the simile takes on an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BURLESQUE\">burlesque</a>; and the same will be the effect where the one is imagined to be the other, as in a metaphor; or made to represent the other, as in an allegory.\n\nThirdly. These figures, a metaphor especially, ought not to be crowded with many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> circumstances; for in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> it is scarcely possible to avoid obscurity. A metaphor above all ought to be short: it is difficult, for any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, to support a lively image of a thing being what we know it is not; and for that reason, a metaphor drawn out to any length, instead of illustrating or enlivening the principal subject, becomes disagreeable by overstraining the mind. Here Cowley is extremely licentious. Take the following instance.\n\nGreat and wise conqu'ror, who where'er\nThou com'st, dost fortify and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> there!\nWho canst defend as well as get;\nAnd never hadst one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> up yet;\nNow thou art in, thou ne'er will part\nWith one inch of my vanquish'd heart;\nFor since thou took'st it by assault from me\n'Tis garrison'd so strong with thoughts of thee,\nIt fears no beauteous enemy.\n\nFor the same reason, however agreeable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> allegories may at first be by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a>, they never afford any lasting pleasure: witness the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAIRY\">Fairy</a> Queen, which with great power of expression, variety of images, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MELODY\">melody</a> of versification, is scarce ever read a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> time.\n\nIn the fourth place. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> carried on in a simile, being in a metaphor sunk by imagining the principal subject to be that very thing which it only resembles; an opportunity is furnished to describe it in terms taken strictly or literally with respect to its imagined nature. This suggests another rule, That in constructing a metaphor, the writer ought to make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of such words only as are applicable literally to the imagined nature of his subject: figurative words ought carefully to be avoided; for such complicated figures, instead of setting the principal subject in a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, involve it in a cloud, and it is well <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the reader, without rejecting by the lump, endeavour patiently to gather the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> meaning, regardless of the figures:\n\nA stubborn and unconquerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a>\nCreeps in his veins, and drinks the streams of life.\n\nLady Jane Gray, act i. sc. 1.\n\nCopied from Ovid:\n\nSorbent avid\u00e6 pr\u00e6cordia flamm\u00e6.\n\nMetamorph. lib. ix. 172.\n\nLet us analyze this expression. That a fever may be imagined a flame, we admit: though more than one step is necessary to come at the resemblance: a fever, by heating the body, resembles fire; and it is no stretch to imagine a fever to be a fire: again, by a figure of speech, flame may be put for fire, because they are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> conjoined; and therefore a fever may be termed a flame. But now admitting a fever to be a flame, its effects ought to be explained in words that agree literally to a flame. This rule is not observed here; for a flame drinks figuratively only, not properly.\n\nKing Henry to his son <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">Prince</a> Henry:\n\nThou hid'st a thousand daggers in thy thoughts,\nWhich thou hast whetted on thy stony heart\nTo stab at half an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> of my frail life.\n\nSecond Part Henry IV. act iv. sc. ii.\n\nSuch faulty metaphors are pleasantly ridiculed in the Rehearsal:\n\nPhysician. Sir, to conclude, the place you fill has more than amply exacted the talents of a wary pilot; and all these threatening storms, which, like impregnable clouds, hover o'er our heads, will, when they once are grasp'd but by the eye of reason, melt into fruitful showers of blessings on the people.\n\n\"Boyce. Pray mark that allegory. Is not that good?\n\n\"Johnson. Yes, that grasping of a storm with the eye is admirable.\n\nAct ii. sc. i.\n\nFifthly. The jumbling different metaphors in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a>, beginning with one metaphor and ending with another, commonly called a mixt metaphor, ought never to be indulged.\n\nK. Henry.\nK. Henry.\u2014Will you again unknit\nThis churlish knot of all abhorred war,\nAnd move in that obedient orb again,\nWhere you did give a fair and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> light?\nFirst Part Henry VI. act. v. sc. r.\n\nWhether 'tis nobler in the mind, to suffer\nThe stings and arrows of outrageous fortune;\nOr to take arms against a sea of troubles,\nAnd by opposing end them.\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAMLET\">Hamlet</a>, act iii. sc. 2.\n\nIn the sixth place, It is unpleasant to join different metaphors in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, even where they are preserved distinct: for when the subject is imagined to be first one thing and then another in the same period without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a>, the mind is distracted by the rapid transition; and when the imagination is put on such hard duty, its images are too faint to produce any good effect:\n\nAt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol0.html#article-REGINA\">regina</a> gravi jamdudum saucia cara,\nVolnus alit venis, et eceo carpitur igni.\n\u00c6neid. iv. 1.\n\nEst mollis flamma medullas\nInterea, et tacitum vivit sub pectore vulnus.\n\u00c6neid. iv. 66.\n\nMotum ex Metello consule civicum,\nBellique causas, et vitia, et modos,\nLudumque fortunae, gravesque\nPrincipum amicitias, et arma\nNondum expatiis uncta cruroribus,\nPericuloso plenum opus alee,\nTractas, et incedis per ignes\nSubpositos cineri doloso.\nHorat. Carm. lib. ii. ode 1.\n\nIn the last place, It is still worse to jumble together metaphorical and natural expression, so as that the period must be understood in part metaphorically, in part literally; for the imagination cannot follow with sufficient ease changes so sudden and unprepared: a metaphor begun and not carried on, hath no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>; and instead of light there is nothing but obscurity and confusion. Instances of such incorrect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> are without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>: we shall, for a specimen, select a few from different authors. Speaking of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>,\n\nThis precious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> set in the sea,\nWhich serves it in the office of a wall,\nOr as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOAT\">moat</a> defensive to a house,\nAgainst the envy of less happier lands.\nRichard II. act ii. sc. 1.\n\nIn the first line Britain is figured to be a precious stone: in the following line, Britain, divested of her metaphorical dress, is presented to the reader in her natural appearance.\n\nThese growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing,\nWill make him fly an ordinary pitch,\nWho else would soar above the view of men,\nAnd keep us all in servile fearfulness.\nJulius Caesar, act i. sc. 1.\n\nRebus angustis animosus atque\nFortis adpare: sapienter idem\nContrahis vento nimium secundo\nTurgida vela.\nFlor. Carm. lib. ii. ode 10.\n\nThe following is a miserable jumble of expressions, arising from an unsteady view of the subject, between its figurative and natural appearance:\n\nBut now from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GATH\">gath</a>'<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a> clouds destruction pours,\nWhich ruins with mad rage our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HALCYON\">halcyon</a> hours:\nMists from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> jealousies the tempest form,\nWhilst late divisions reinforce the storm.\nDispensary, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANTO\">canto</a> iii.\n\nTo thee the world its present homage pays,\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARVEST\">harvest</a> early, but mature the praise.\nPope's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">Imitation</a> of Horace, book ii.\n\nOui, sa pudeur ne'st que franche grimace,\nQu'une <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OMBRE\">ombre</a> de vertu qui garde mal la place,\nEt qui s'\u00e9vanouit, comme l'on peut savoir,\nAux rayons du soleil qu'une bourse vait voir.\nMoliere, L'\u00c9tourdi, act iii. sc. 2.\n\nEt son feu, de pourv\u00fb de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENS\">sens</a> et de lecture,\nS'\u00e9teint \u00e0 chaque pas, faut de nourriture.\nBoileau, L'Art Po\u00e9tique, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CHANT\">chant</a>. iii. l. 319.\n\nDryden, in his dedication of the translation of Juvenal, says, \"When thus, as I may say, before the use of the loadstone, or knowledge of the compass, I was sailing in a vast ocean, without other help than the pole-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAR\">star</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>, and the rules of the French stage among the moderns,\" &c.\n\n\"There is a time when factions, by the vehemence of their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERMENTATION\">fermentation</a>, stun and disable one another.\"\nBolingbroke.\n\nThis fault of jumbling the figure and plain expression into one confused <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>, is not less common in allegory than in metaphor.\n\nTake the following examples:\n\n\u2014Heu! quoties fides,\nMutatosque Deos flebit, et aspera\nNigris aquora ventis\nEmirabitur insolens,\nQui nunc te fruitor credulos aure\u00e2:\nQui semper vacuam, semper amabilem\nSperat, nescius aure\u00e2\nFallacis.\nHorat. Carm. lib. i. ode 5.\n\nPour moi sur <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CETTE\">cette</a> mer, qu'ici bois nous courons;\nJe songe \u00e0 me pourvoir d'esquif et d'avirons,\nA regler mes d\u00e9sirs, \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir l'orage,\nEt sauver, s'il se peut, ma Raison du naufrage.\nBoileau, \u00e9p\u00eetre 5.\n\nLord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HALIFAX\">Halifax</a>, speaking of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> fabulists: \"They (says he) wrote in signs, and spoke in parables: all their fables carry a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> meaning: the story is one, and entire; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> the same throughout; not broken or changed, and always conformable to the nature of the creature they introduce. They never tell you, that the dog which snapped at a shadow, lost his troop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>; that would be unintelligible. This is\nMetaphor, his (Dryden's) new way of telling a story, and confounding the moral and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FABLE\">fable</a> together.\" After insisting from the Hind and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-PANTHER\">Panther</a>, he goes on thus:\n\n\"What relation has the hind to our Saviour? or what notion have we of a panther's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIBLE\">bible</a>? If you say he means the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, how does the church feed on lawns, or range in the forest? Let it be always a church, or always a cloven-footed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAST\">beast</a>; for we cannot bear his shifting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> every line.\"\n\nA few words more upon allegory. Nothing gives greater pleasure than this figure, when the representative subject bears a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a>, in all its circumstances, to that which is represented: but the choice is seldom so lucky; the analogy being generally so faint and obscure, as to puzzle and not please. An allegory is still more difficult in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a> than in poetry: the former can show no resemblance but what appears to the eye; the latter hath many other resources for showing the resemblance. And therefore, with respect to what the abb\u00e9 du <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOS\">Bos</a> terms mixt allegorical compositions, these may do in poetry; because, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>, the allegory can easily be distinguished from the historical part: no person, for example, mistakes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGIL\">Virgil</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAME\">Fame</a> for a real being. But such a mixture in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> is intolerable; because in a picture the objects must appear all of the same kind, wholly real or wholly emblematical. For this reason, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a> de Medicis, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> of Luxembourg, painted by Rubens, is unpleasant by a perpetual jumble of real and allegorical personages, which produce a discordance of parts, and an obscurity upon the whole: witness, in particular, the tablature representing the arrival of Mary de Medicis at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARSEILLES\">Marseilles</a>; where, together with the real personages, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEREIDS\">Nereids</a> and Tritons appear sounding their shells: such a mixture of fiction and reality in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUP\">group</a> is strangely absurd. The picture of Alexander and Roxana, described by Lucian, is gay and fanciful; but it suffers by the allegorical figures. It is not in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WIT\">wit</a> of man to invent an allegorical representation deviating farther from any shadow of resemblance, than one exhibited by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> XIV., anno 1664; in which an enormous chariot, intended to represent that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, is dragged along, surrounded with men and women, representing the four ages of the world, the celestial signs, the seasons, the hours, &c. a monstrous composition, and yet scarcely more absurd than Guido's tablature of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AURORA\">Aurora</a>.\n\nIn an allegory, as well as in a metaphor, terms ought to be chosen that properly and literally are applicable to the representative subject: nor ought any circumstance to be added that is not proper to the representative subject, however justly it may be applicable properly or figuratively to the principal. The following allegory is therefore faulty:\n\nFeras et Cupido,\nSemper ardentes acuens sagittas\nCote cruentis. Horat. lib. ii. ode 8.\n\nFor though blood may suggest the cruelty of love, it is an improper or immaterial circumstance in the representative subject: water, not blood, is proper for a whetstone.\n\nWe proceed to the next head, which is, to examine in what circumstances these figures are proper, in what improper. This inquiry is not altogether superseded by what is said upon the same subject in the article Comparison; because, upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>, it will be found, that a short metaphor or allegory may be proper, where a simile, drawn out to a greater length, and in its nature more solemn, would scarcely be relished.\n\nAnd, in the first place, A metaphor, like a simile, is excluded from common conversation, and from the description of ordinary incidents. Secondly, In expressing any severe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> that totally occupies the mind, metaphor is unnatural.\n\nThe following example, of deep despair, beside the highly figurative style, has more the air of raving than of sense:\n\nCalista. Is it the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a>, or my father?\nMadness! confusion! let the storm come on,\nLet the tumultuous roar drive all upon me,\nDash my devoted bark; ye surges, break it:\n'Tis for my ruin that the tempest rises.\nWhen I am lost, sunk to the bottom low,\nPeace shall return, and all be calm again.\n\nFair Penitent, act. v.\n\nThe following metaphor is sweet and lively; but it suits not the fiery temper of Chamont, inflamed with passion: parables are not the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of wrath venting itself without restraint:\n\nChamont. You took her up a little tender flow'r,\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">Just</a> sprouted on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a>, which the next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FROST\">frost</a>\nHad nip'd; and with a careful loving hand,\nTransplanted her into your own fair garden,\nWhere the sun always shines; there long she flourish'd,\nGrew sweet to sense, and lovely to the eye;\nTill at the last a cruel spoiler came,\nCropt this fair rose, and rifled all its sweetness,\nThen cast it like a loathsome weed away.\n\nOrphan, act. iv.\n\nThe following speech, full of imagery, is not natural in grief and dejection of mind:\n\nGonzalez. O my son! from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a> dotage\nOf a father's fondness these ills arose.\nFor thee I've been ambitious, base, and bloody:\nFor thee I've plung'd into this sea of sin;\nStemming the tide with only one weak hand,\nWhile 'tother bore the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> (to wreath thy brow),\nWhose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> has sunk me ere I reach'd the shore.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOURNING\">Mourning</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRIDE\">Bride</a>, act. v. sc. 6.\n\nThere is an enchanting picture of deep distress in Macbeth, where Macduff is represented lamenting his wife and children, inhumanly murdered by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRANT\">tyrant</a>. Stung to the heart with the news, he questions the messenger over and over: not that he doubted the fact, but that his heart revolted against so cruel a misfortune. After struggling some time with his grief, he turns from his wife and children to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUTCHER\">butcher</a>: and then gives vent to his resentment, but still with manliness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>;\n\nO, I could play the woman with mine eyes,\nAnd braggart with my tongue. But, gentle Heav'n!\nCut short all intermission; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> to front\nBring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;\nWithin\nMetaphor. Within my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>'s length set him. If he 'scape,\nThen Heav'n forgive him too.\n\nMetaphorical expression, indeed, may sometimes be used with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a> where a regular simile would be intolerable: but there are situations so severe and dispiriting, as not to admit even the slightest metaphor. It requires great delicacy of taste to determine with firmness, whether the present case be of that nature; perhaps it is; yet who could wish a single word of this admirable scene altered?\n\nBut metaphorical language is proper when a man struggles to bear with dignity or decency a misfortune however great; the struggle agitates and animates the mind:\n\nWolsey. Farewell, a long farewell to all my greatness;\nThis is the state of man: to-day he puts forth\nThe tender leaves of hope; to-morrow blossoms,\nAnd bears his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLUSHING\">blushing</a> honours thick upon him;\nThe third day comes a frost, a killing frost,\nAnd when he thinks, good easy man, full surely\nHis greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,\nAnd then he falls as I do.

But, \"what is first to nature, is not first to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>.\" Nature begins with causes, which produce effects. Man begins with effects, and by them ascends to causes. Thus all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> proceed of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> in the reverse of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> order of things, from sensible to intelligible, from body the effect, to mind, which is both the first and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> cause. Now physics being the name given by the Stagyrite to the philosophy of body, some of his interpreters, from this necessary course of human studies, called that of mind METAPHYSICS, implying by that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> not only that its subject is more sublime and difficult, but also that the study of it would be most properly and successfully entered upon AFTER THAT OF PHYSICS. To this name, which, though it has sometimes been treated with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIDICULE\">ridicule</a>, is abundantly significant, the followers of Aristotle were led by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>, who, to the books in which he pretends to elevate the mind above things corporeal to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a> of God and things spiritual, prefixed the Greek words \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u1f70 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac (A).\n\nThe science of Metaphysics has been divided, according to the objects which it considers, into six principal parts, which are called, 1. Ontology; 2. Cosmology; 3. Anthroposophy; 4. Psychology; 5. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PNEUMATICS\">Pneumatics</a>; and, 6. Metaphysical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEOLOGY\">theology</a>.\n\n1. That <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the science which is named ontology, investigates and explains the nature and essence of all beings, as well as the qualities and attributes that essentially appertain to them. Hence it has been said that ontology should proceed in its operations from the most simple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a>; such as do not admit of any other qualities of which they may be compounded. These simple ideas are of being, of essence, of substance, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a>, of existence as well with regard to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, of a necessary cause of unity; the idea of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGATION\">negation</a>; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between a being that is simple or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a>, necessary or accidental, finite or infinite; the ideas of essential and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> properties, such as of the greatness, perfection, and goodness of beings, &c. The business therefore of ontology, is to make us acquainted with every kind of being in its nature and essential qualities, which distinguish it from all other beings. This knowledge being once established on simple principles, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> consequences may thence be drawn, and those things proved after which the metaphysician inquires, and which is the business of his science to prove.\n\nIt is easy to conceive, that even a clear knowledge of beings, and their essential properties, would be still defective and useless to man, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he did not know how to determine and fix his ideas by proper denominations, and consequently to communicate his perceptions to those whom he would instruct, or against whom he is obliged to dispute. To render our ideas therefore intelligible to others, we must have determinate words or denominations for each being, and the qualities of each being; and ontology teaches us those terms which are so necessary to fix our ideas, and to give them the requisite perspicuity and precision, that when we endeavour to extend the sphere\n\n(a) \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u1f70 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac.

Metaphysics, having, in as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> a manner as possible, explained and established the principles above mentioned, continues its inquiries to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> part, which is called cosmology, and examines into the essence of the world and all that it contains; its eternal laws; of the nature of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>; of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>; of the nature of tangible bodies, their attributes and adjuncts; and of all that can be known by reasoning and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>. It is also in cosmology that the metaphysicians of this school examine the Leibnitzian system; that is, whether God, in creating the world, must necessarily have created the best world; and if this world be so in fact. In this manner they pursue the argument, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> to consequence, to its last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a>, frequently with very little advantage to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> and science.\n\n3. Anthroposophy, or the knowledge of man, forms the third branch of metaphysics. It is subdivided into two parts. The first, which consists in the knowledge of the exterior parts of the human frame, belongs not to this science, but to Anatomy and Physiology. The business of the metaphysician is here to ascertain the nature of those powers by which all the motions essential to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> are produced; and to discover, if possible, whether they be corporeal or spiritual. This inquiry leads at the same time to\n\n4. Psychology; which consists in the knowledge of the intellectual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> in particular; concerning which the most profound, the most subtle, and most abstract researches, have been made that human reason is capable of; and concerning the substance of which, in spite of all these efforts, it is yet extremely difficult to support any positive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> with conclusive or probable arguments.\n\n5. The fifth part of metaphysics is called pneumatology. By this term, which has not been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>, metaphysicians <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> the knowledge of all spirits, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGELS\">angels</a>, &c. It is easy to conceive what infinite art is necessary to give an account of that, of which nothing positive can ever be known in the present state of human existence. But the metaphysician of this school readily offers to show us, \"what is the idea of a spirit; the effective existence of a spirit; what are its general qualities and properties; that there are rational spirits, and that these rational spirits have qualities that are founded in the moral attributes of God;\" for this is in so many words what is attempted to be taught in pneumatology.\n\n6. Metaphysical theology, which Leibnitz and some others call theodicy, is the sixth and last branch of the science of metaphysics. It teaches us the knowledge of the existence of God; to make the most rational suppositions concerning his divine essence, and to form a just idea of his attributes and perfections, and to demonstrate them by abstract reasoning. Theodicy differs from natural theology, in as much as this last borrows, in fact, from theodicy proofs and demonstrations to confirm the existence of a supreme Being; but after having solidly established that great truth, by extending its consequences natural theology teaches us what are the relations and connexions that subsist between the supreme Being and men, and what are the duties which result from these relations.\n\nWe have briefly mentioned these divisions of the previous science, because they were once prevalent in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a>. The greater part of them, however, appears to us to be not only superfluous, but such as can serve <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> other purpose than to perplex the mind. The only beings of which we know anything are mind and body; and we have no reason to think that there are any other beings in the universe. Of bodies indeed there are various kinds, endowed with different properties; and it is extremely probable, that of minds endowed with different powers, the variety may be equally great. Our own minds we know to be united in one system with bodies by which they perform all their operations; and we can demonstrate that there is another Mind, which is independent of all body, and is the cause of all things. Between these there may be numberless orders of minds; but their energies are wholly unknown to us, and therefore they can never become the objects of science.\n\nMind and body therefore, i.e., the minds and bodies which we know to exist, together with their powers and properties, essential and accidental, can alone be the subjects of rational inquiry. We may inquire into the essence of mind and the essence of body, and endeavour to ascertain in what respects they differ. We may examine the nature of different bodies, in order to discover whether all bodies, however modified, have not something in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a>; and we may consider the properties, relations, and adjuncts of bodies, and endeavour to distinguish those which are accidental from such as appear to be so necessary that without them body itself could not exist. Of minds we cannot make the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a>. In this part of the science we have not sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATA\">data</a> for an accurate and complete <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDUCTION\">induction</a>; we can only examine the powers of our own mind; and by probable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> make some estimate of the powers of superior minds, as observation <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> help us to guess at the powers of those which are placed beneath us in the scale of existence.\n\nIf this be so, Cosmology, as distinguished from Ontology, cannot properly be a branch of Metaphysics. For if mind and body, with their several powers, properties, and adjuncts, compose the universe, it is obvious, that when we have ascertained, as well as we are able, the essence of mind and the essence of body, together with the powers and properties of each, and have traced them all to the first cause, we have done every thing in the science of the universe, if we may use the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>, which belongs to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of the metaphysician. The particular laws of motion on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> and in the planetary system belong to the natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> and astronomer.\n\nIn like manner, Anthroposophy, Psychology, or Pneumatology, if they be not words expressive of distinctions where there is no difference, seem to be at least very needlessly disjoined from each other. Of the nature of spirits we can know nothing but from contemplating the powers of our own minds; and the body of man is in the province, not of the metaphysician, but of the anatomist and physiologist. Anthroposophy, psychology, and pneumatology, if they be used to denote our knowledge of all minds except the Supreme, are words of the same import; for of no created minds except our own can we acquire such knowledge as deserves the name of science.\nOntology has sometimes been defined the science of being in the abstract; but in the course of our inquiries it will be seen, that being in the abstract is a phrase without meaning. Considered as the science of real beings and their properties, Ontology is a very significant word, of the same import with Metaphysics, comprehending in itself the knowledge of the nature of all things existing. Or if it be thought proper to make a distinction between ontology and theology, the former branch of the science will teach the knowledge of body and created minds, whilst it is the province of the latter to demonstrate the existence and attributes of that mind which is uncreated.\n\nBody and mind, therefore, with their properties, adjuncts, and powers, comprehend the whole subject of the science of metaphysics; and as we are earlier acquainted with body than with mind, the natural order of conducting our inquiries seems to be, to begin with the former, and thence proceed to the latter. It is obvious, however, that if we would pursue these inquiries with any hopes of success, we must first trace human knowledge from its source, ascertain the nature of truth, and show what kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> on each topic to be treated ought to enforce conviction. In this view of the science, metaphysics appears to be divided into three parts; the first treating of human understanding; the second, of body with its adjuncts; and the third, of mind with its powers.\n\nPrevious to the entering upon such inquiries, some philosophers of great merit have thought it expedient to explain the terms which they might have occasion to use. Their conduct is judicious and worthy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a>; for the objects of metaphysics being, for the most part, such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> not under the cognizance of the senses, are liable to be differently apprehended by different men, if the meanings of the words by which they are expressed be not ascertained with the utmost precision. We intend, however, to use very few words but in the common acceptation; and we therefore hope, that as terms of science are explained under different words in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DICTIONARY\">Dictionary</a>, to which references are made, we have little or no occasion for swelling the article by previous definitions. There are indeed two words which have given rise to much useless disputation, which yet cannot be banished from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a> philosophy, and which it will therefore be proper here to define. The words to which we allude are idea and notion. These are very generally considered as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYNONYMOUS\">synonymous</a>; but we think that much logomachy might have been avoided by assigning to each a determinate signification. We know not any philosopher who made much use of the word idea before <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a>; but with his mysterious doctrine concerning ideas we have here nothing to do: our present business is to ascertain the precise meaning of the word, which is evidently derived from \u03bd\u03bf\u03ad\u03c9 to see, as the word notion is from \"noceo, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVI\">novi</a>, notum,\" and that from \u03b3\u03b9\u03bd\u03ce\u03c3\u03ba\u03c9 to know or understand. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of the two words, therefore, notion is more comprehensive than idea, because we know many things which cannot be seen. We have not a doubt, but that at first the word idea was employed to denote only those forms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> objects which men contemplate in their imaginations, and which are originally received through the sense of sight. Its signification was afterwards extended to the relics of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a>, of touch, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a>, as well as of sight; and at last it was confounded with notion, which denotes the mental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> of whatever may be known. In our use of the word idea, except when we quote from others, we shall employ it only to denote that appearance which absent objects of sense make in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> (B); and by the word notion we shall denote our apprehension or knowledge of spirits, and all such things as, though they be the objects of science, cannot be perceived by the external senses. Having said this, we proceed to our inquiries, beginning with that into human understanding.\n\nPART I. OF HUMAN UNDERSTANDING.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRELIMINARY\">Preliminary</a> Observations on the Origin of our Ideas and Notions.\n\nTHAT the mind of man has no innate ideas or notions, but comes into the world ignorant of everything, is a truth which since the days of Locke has been very little disputed. In the first book of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> on the Human Understanding, that acute philosopher has demonstrated, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> or first principles of all our knowledge are communicated to us by sensation; and he has compared the mind, previous to the operation of external objects upon the senses, to a tabula rasa or sheet of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>. To repeat his arguments would swell the article to no purpose. There is not a man capable of attending to his own ideas, who\n\n(B) In thus restricting the meaning of the word idea, we have the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> to agree with the great English Lexicographer.\u2014\"He was particularly indignant against the almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> use of the word idea in the sense of notion or opinion, when it is clear that idea can only signify something of which an image may be formed in the mind. We may have an idea or image of a mountain, a tree, or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>: but we cannot surely have an idea or image of an argument or proposition. Yet we hear the sages of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a> delivering their ideas upon the question under consideration; and the first speakers in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a> entirely coinciding in the idea, which has been so ably stated by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> member; or representing an idea as unconstitutional, and fraught with the most dangerous consequences to a great and free <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. This Johnson called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> cant.\" Boswell's Life of Johnson.\nOrigin of who can entertain a doubt in what manner he received ideas and them. Without the sense of sight, we could never have known colours; nor sound, without hearing; nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a>, softness, smoothness, pain, or bodily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>, without touch; nor odours, without smell, &c.\n\nSelf-evident as these facts are, objections have been started to the inferences drawn from them; and Locke has been accused of advancing principles subversive of all distinction between truth and falsehood, and favourable of course to universal scepticism.\u2014\u201cThe first book of his Essay, which, with submission, (says Dr. Essay on Beattie*) I think the worst, tends to establish this dangerous doctrine, that the human mind, previous to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a>, is as susceptible of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> as of another: a doctrine which, if true, would go near to prove, that truth and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> are no better than human contrivances; or at least that they have nothing permanent in their nature, but may be as changeable as the inclinations and capacities of men; and that there is no such thing as common sense in the world. Surely this is not the doctrine which Mr Locke meant to establish.\u201d We are so thoroughly satisfied that it is not, that we cannot help wondering how such inferences could, by a man of learning, genius, and candour, be drawn from any thing which is to be found in the Essay on the Human Understanding.\n\nBut the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">Doctor</a> thinks Mr Locke\u2019s \u201c<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIMILE\">simile</a> of the mind to white paper one of the most unlucky allusions that could have been chosen; because the human soul, when it begins to think, is not extended, nor of a white <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, nor incapable of energy, nor wholly unfurnished with ideas, nor as susceptible of one impression or character as of any other;\u201d and it has been observed by another objector\u2020, that \u201con a sheet of white paper you may write that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a> is bitter; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WORMWOOD\">wormwood</a> sweet; fire and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FROST\">frost</a> in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> pleasing and sufferable: that compassion and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> are base; treachery, falsehood, and envy, noble; and that contempt is indifferent to us.\u201d\n\nAll this is true; but we apprehend it is not to the purpose. Mr Locke has no where expressed himself in such a manner as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> us to suppose that he believed the soul to be extended or coloured; or, when it begins to think, incapable of energy, and wholly unfurnished with ideas: but he certainly did believe, that it begins not to think the first instant of its existence, and that it acquires all the ideas of which it is ever possessed. We may undoubtedly write upon a piece of white paper that sugar is bitter, and that wormwood is sweet; but how the capacity of paper to receive the symbols of false <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a> should make Mr Locke\u2019s comparison improper or dangerous, we cannot comprehend. Mr Usher indeed says, that it is improper on this account, \u201cthat no human art or industry is able to make those impressions upon the mind: in respect of them, the mind discovers not a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSIVE\">passive</a> capacity, but resists them with the force of fate.\u201d Does it indeed? does the mind reject the idea of sugar or of bitterness, of contempt or of indifference? May not any man have the idea of sugar and at the same time the idea of bitterness, and compare the one with the other in his mind, as well as the word sugar may be written beside the word bitter, and connected with it on the same piece of paper? In all this we perceive nothing that is impossible or even difficult.\n\nThe mind cannot indeed be made to feel that sugar has the same taste with wormwood; but who ever thought that it could? Not Mr Locke, we shall be bold to say; nor does his simile give the smallest countenance to such an absurdity. The author of the Essay on the Human Understanding understood his subject too well to imagine that either truth or falsehood could be communicated to paper, or that paper is capable of comparing ideas. Paper is capable of receiving nothing but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> or figures; and it passively receives whatever lines or figures we may choose to inscribe on it: yet if a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEN\">pen</a> be carried over it in a circular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> impressed will not be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>; just as, to the mind of one eating sugar, the taste communicated is not that of wormwood.\n\nOn a piece of paper a circle may be described, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> beside it a square: in like manner an agreeable sensation may be communicated to the mind, and immediately afterwards a sensation that is disagreeable. These two sensations, or the ideas which they leave behind them, may be compared together; and it is certainly true that no art or industry can make them appear similar in the mind: but is it not equally true, that no art or industry can make the circle and the square similar on the paper? The paper is susceptible of any sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> figures, and the mind is equally susceptible of any sort of ideas or sensations; but figures dissimilar cannot be made to coincide, neither can discordant ideas be made to agree. Again, one may write upon paper, that \u201ca circle is not a square,\u201d and likewise that \u201ca circle is not a square;\u201d and both these propositions may be communicated to the mind by the organs of sight or of hearing. The paper receives the words expressive of the false as well as those expressive of the true proposition; and the mind receives the ideas and relations signified by the one cluster of words as well as those signified by the other: but in the mind the idea of a square is different from that of a circle, and on the paper the figure of a square is different from the figure of a circle. The great difference between the mind and the paper is, that the former is conscious of its ideas, and perceives their agreement or disagreement; whereas the paper is not conscious of the figures drawn upon it, nor perceives anything about them. But still those figures are what they are; they either agree or disagree on the paper, as well as the ideas either agree or disagree in the mind. It is not in the power of the mind to alter the ideas of the square and the circle, nor in the power of the paper to alter the forms of these figures.\n\nIt appears then, that the principles of Mr Locke, and the comparison by which he illustrates them, have no more tendency to subvert the difference between truth and falsehood, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> and wrong, than the passiveness of paper has to subvert the difference between a straight line and a crooked, a circle and a square: and with a view to establish the doctrine of innate ideas and instinctive principles of knowledge, we might with as much propriety ask, Whether it be possible to imagine that any mode of manufacture could make paper of such a nature, as that a pen drawn over it in a circular direction would leave the figure of a square? as that, \u201cWhether it be possible to imagine, that any course of education could ever bring a rational creature to believe that two and two are equal to three.\u201d\nThe mind being thus, as we may say, originally white paper, void of all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a>, without ideas or notions of any kind, the first question which we have to consider is, Whence and in what manner it derives the materials of all its knowledge? To this question the only answer which can be given is, That it derives them from observation and experience; from observation, either employed upon external objects of sense, or turned inwardly upon its own operations. Our senses, conversant about particular external objects, convey into the mind several distinct perceptions; such as those of colour, figure, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, bitterness, sweetness, and all those things which are usually called sensible qualities. The notions, ideas, or whatever else they may be called which are acquired in this manner, may be called sensible knowledge; and the source of that knowledge is termed sensation.\n\nThe other fountain from which experience furnishes the understanding with knowledge, is that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> which we are capable of giving to the operations of our own minds when employed about those ideas which were originally suggested by objects of sense. These operations, when the soul comes to reflect on them, furnish us with a set of notions entirely different from the ideas of sense; such as the notions of perception, thinking, doubting, believing, reasoning, knowing, willing, and all the different energies and passions of our own minds. Of these operations we are always conscious when we are awake; but it requires, as shall be shown afterwards, no inconsiderable effort to set them, as it were, at a distance, to reflect on them and consider what they are; but when we have made this effort, we acquire notions as distinct, and perhaps more important, than those ideas which we receive through the medium of the senses.\n\nSensation and reflection then furnish mankind with the first materials of all their knowledge. The mind seems not to have ideas or notions of any kind which it did not receive by one or other of these ways. By means of the senses it perceives external objects; and by that power which it has of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> its attention upon itself, it discovers the nature and manner of its own operations.\n\nAlthough the knowledge which we acquire from reflection be of equal importance, and perhaps of greater certainty than that which we receive through the medium of the senses, it comes into the mind at a much later <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>; both because it is impossible that the faculties of the mind should operate without materials, and because it is much more difficult to attend to these operations even while they are going on, than to the objects of sense which solicit our attention. It is for this reason pretty late before children have any notions whatever of the operations of their own minds; and of the greater part of these operations the bulk of mankind have no clear or accurate notions during their whole lives. On the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, every human being is so surrounded with bodies, which perpetually and variously affect his senses, that a variety of sensible ideas force an entrance even into the minds of children. In order therefore to trace the procedure of the understanding, and to ascertain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> and limits of human knowledge, it should seem that we must begin with considering the external senses, that we may discover the manner in which we receive knowledge by means of them, the objects of that knowledge, and its certainty.\n\nIt is to be observed, however, that though we consider sensation as possessed of many powers or faculties, and inquire first into the nature of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> which we conceive to be first exerted, this is done merely for the sake of proceeding in our subject with method and perspicuity. The mind is one simple and undivided being; and in every mental energy it is the whole mind, and not any part or portion of it, that is energetic. On this account, it is impossible to explain even the nature of sensation and perception to him who knows not what is meant by will or understanding; but to every one who is acquainted with the common import of these words, and who has read the short system of Logic inserted in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">Work</a>, we hope that our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of perception will be intelligible and convincing.\n\nCHAP. I. Of Sensation and Perception.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">SECT</a>. I. Of Sensation.\n\nThe Supreme Being, who made us and placed us in this world, has given us such powers of mind as he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> to be suited to our state and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a>. He has given us the power of perceiving many objects around us; but that power is limited in various ways; and particularly in this, that without the organs of the several senses we perceive no external <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>. The senses, as every one knows, are five in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, and each communicates its proper sensation. It is by the eyes alone that we see, by the ears that we hear, by the nose that we smell, and by the tongue and palate that we taste; the sense of feeling or touch is spread over the whole body, for we feel equally by our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> and by our feet, &c. To the powers of perception by the senses it is necessary not only that we have all the organs enumerated, but that we have them also in a sound and natural state. There are many disorders of the eye which cause total <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BLINDNESS\">blindness</a>, as well as others which impair without destroying the power of vision. The same thing is true of the organs of all the other senses.\n\nAll this is so well known from experience, that it needs no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a>; but it may be worth while to observe, that it is known from experience only*. For any thing that we know to the contrary, our Creator might have endowed us with the power of perception by a thousand organs of sense, all different from those which we possess; and it is certain that he himself perceives every Man thing more perfectly than we do without bodily organs.\n\nFor it is to be observed, that the organs of sense are different from the being which is sentient.\u2014It is not gains the eye which sees, nor the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EAR\">ear</a> which hears; these are selves not only the organs by which we see and hear. A man cannot see the satellites of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a> but by means of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TELESCOPE\">telescope</a>, nor hear a low <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> but by means of an ear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRUMPET\">trumpet</a>. Does he from this conclude that it is the telescope which sees those satellites, or the trumpet which hears that voice? Such a conclusion would be evidently absurd. It is no less absurd to conclude that it is the eye which sees, or the ear which hears. The telescope and the trumpet are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> organs of sight and of hearing, of which the eye and the ear are natural organs; but the natural organs see and hear as little as the artificial.\n\nThat this is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> with respect to the eye and the ear,\nOf car, is so obvious, that, as far as we know, it has never been denied. But with respect to the senses of touch, taste, and smell, the truth at first view appears not so evident. A celebrated writer has observed*, that \"after the utmost efforts, we find it beyond our power to conceive the flavour of a rose to exist in the mind: we are necessarily led to conceive that pleasure as existing in the nostrils, along with the impression made by the rose upon that organ (c); and the same will be the result of experiments with respect to every feeling of taste, touch, and smell. Touch (he says), affords the most satisfactory evidence, and philosophy detects the delusion.\" To detect this delusion requires, indeed, no great depth in philosophy; for it is so far from being true that we are necessarily led otherwise than by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">association</a>, of which the laws shall be explained afterwards, to conceive the pleasure or pain of touch as existing at that part of our body upon which the impression is made, that as every man must have observed, children previous to experience cannot distinguish the precise place of their bodies which is affected by the touch of any external object. Nay, we believe it will be found upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>, that if a full grown man, with all the experience of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> to guide him, be pricked with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PIN\">pin</a> on any part of his body which he has seldom handled, and never seen, he will not readily nor at first put his finger upon the wound, nor even come very near to the wound. This, however, he would certainly and infallibly do were the sense of touch necessarily conceived as existing at the organ. To these observations objections may perhaps be made, which we cannot stay to obviate; but the following, we think, will admit of none. We <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> to every man who has experienced that particular sensation of touch which Scaliger dignified with the name of a sixth sense, whether, whilst those sensations were new to him, he was necessarily led to conceive them as existing at any particular organ. If he was not, it follows undeniably that the organs of sensation are different from the being which is sentient; that it is not the eye which sees, the ear which hears, the nostrils which smell, the tongue which tastes, nor any part of the body which feels; and that it is by experience that we learn to associate our several sensations with those organs upon which the impressions are made.\n\nIt is, however, certain that we receive no sensation from external objects, unless when some impression is made upon the organ of sense, either by the immediate application of the object itself, or by some medium which passes between the object and the organ\u2020. In the other three the sensation is occasioned by the impression of some medium passing from the object to the organ. The effluvia of bodies drawn into the nostrils with the breath are the medium of smell; the undulations sense of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> are the medium of hearing; and the rays of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> passing from visible objects to the eye are the medium of sight. These are facts known from experience to hold universally both in men and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUTES\">brutes</a>. It is likewise a law of our nature perfectly known to all who know anything of anatomy, that in order to actual sensation the impressions made upon the external organs must be communicated to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NERVES\">nerves</a>, and from them to the brain. First, The object, either immediately, or by some medium, makes an impression upon the organ; the organ serves only as a medium, by which the impression is communicated to the nerves; and the nerves serve as a medium to carry it on to the brain. Here the corporeal part ends; at least we can trace it no farther. The rest is all intellectual.\n\nThe proof of these impressions upon the nerves and brain in sensation is this, that from many observations and experiments it is found, that when the organ of any sense is perfectly sound, and has the impression made upon it by the object ever so strongly, yet if the nerve which serves that organ be cut or tied hard, there is no sensation; and it is well known that disorders in the brain deprive us of sensation, while both the organ and its nerve are sound.\n\nThere is sufficient reason, therefore, to conclude, that in sensation the object produces some change in the organ; that from the organ the change proceeds to the nerve, and from the nerve to the brain. Hence it is that we have positive sensations, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a> objects, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> nonentities, such as darkness, blackness, and vacuity. For, sensation resulting from changes in the brain, whatever produces any change must of course occasion a new sensation: but it is obvious, that the mere absence of any impression, by the removal of the object which produced it, must as necessarily cause a change in the organ, nerves, and brain, as the presence of a new impression from a new object. To these changes, or that which immediately produces them, we give the name of impressions; because we know not how, in a general manner, to express more properly any change produced by an external cause without specifying the nature of that cause. Whether it be pressure, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a>, or repulsion, or vibration, or something unknown, for which we have no name, still it may be called an impression.\n\nSir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Newton was perhaps the first who supposed that the rays of light falling upon the bottom of the eye excite vibrations in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TUNICA\">tunica</a> retina; and that those vibrations being propagated along the solid fibres of the optic nerves into the brain, cause the actual sensation of seeing. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> was adopted by Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARTLEY\">Hartley</a>, applied to the other senses, and shown to be\n\n(c) Another eminent writer thinks on this subject very differently, and in our opinion much more justly.\u2014\"Suppose (says Dr Reid) a person who never had this sense (viz. smell) before, to receive it all at once, and to smell a rose; can he perceive any similitude or agreement between the smell and the rose? or indeed between it and any other object whatever? Certainly he cannot. He finds himself affected in a new way, he knows not why, or from what cause. He is conscious that he is not the cause of it himself; but he cannot from the nature of the thing determine whether it be caused by body or spirit; by something near, or by something at a distance. He cannot give it a place any more than he can give a place to melancholy or joy; nor can he conceive it to have any existence but when it is smelled,\" Inquiry into the Human Mind, ch. 2, sect. 2.\nhe at least as probable as any which has yet been invented to account for the perception of external objects by means of the organs of sense. Be this as it may, experience informs us, that whatever be the nature of those impressions and changes which are made by external objects upon the senses, nerves, and brain, we have without them no actual sensation, and of course perceive nothing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">ab</a> extra. Hence it has been supposed, that the mind is wholly passive in sensation, and that sensation is necessarily produced by those impressions. But this we believe to be a mistake. Every man who has been attentive to his own thoughts and actions, must know instances of impressions having been certainly made upon his organs of sense without producing any sensation, or suggesting to his mind the perception of the particular objects by which the impressions were caused. He whose mind is intensely employed in any particular pursuit, may have his eyes open upon an object which he does not see; or he may not hear the sound of a clock striking within two yards of him: Nay, we will venture to affirm, that there is hardly one reader of this article to whom such absences of sensation have not often occurred. Now, as there is no reason to suppose, that in the one case the undulations of the air, caused by the striking of the clock, did not reach his ears, or that in the other the rays of light, reflected from the object, did not fall upon his eyes, which were open to receive them; the only reason which can be assigned for his not having, in these instances, had audible and visible sensations, is, that his mind was so engaged in something else as not to pay to the vibrations in his brain that attention, if we may so say, without which impressions ab extra can produce no sensation. There are, indeed, some impressions on the organs of sense so violent and so sudden, as to force themselves upon the mind however employed. Such are those made on the ear by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a>, and on the eye by strong light. In these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, sensation is involuntary and unavoidable; whence we conclude, not that in such instances the mind is passive or destitute of energy, but that by the violent agitation given to the brain, it is roused from its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REVERIE\">reverie</a>, and compelled to give attention. It appears, therefore, that in sensation the mind exerts some kind of energy; for in nothing but in the sentient being itself can we seek for the cause why, when all external circumstances are the same, organical impressions sometimes produce sensations and sometimes not; and that cause can only be the energy of the mind; what kind of energy we pretend not to say.\n\nSect. II. Of Perception by the Senses.\n\nHow the correspondence is carried on between the thinking principle within us and the material world without us, has always, as Dr Reid observes, been found a very difficult <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a> to those philosophers who consider themselves as obliged to account for every phenomenon in nature. It is, indeed, a problem of which we expect not to see a complete solution. A few steps beyond the vulgar we may certainly go; but the nature of that connexion by which the mind and body are united, will probably remain for ever unknown. One question, however, which has employed much of the attention of philosophers, both ancient and modern, appears to be not wholly unanswerable. It is, Whether by means of our senses we perceive external objects immediately or immediately; or in other words, Whether sensation and perception be one and the same thing, or two things succeeding each other? On this subject, till of late, there appears to have been in the main a great uniformity in the sentiments of philosophers, notwithstanding their variations respecting particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>. Of some of the most eminent of them, we shall give the opinions as we find them collected by one* who is well acquainted with their writings, who is thoroughly qualified to estimate their respective merits, and who cannot be suspected of partiality to that theory which we feel ourselves compelled to adopt.\n\nPlato illustrates our manner of perceiving external objects thus: He supposes a dark subterraneous cave, in which men <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> bound in such a manner as that they can <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> their eyes only to one part of the cave. Far behind there is a light, of which some rays come over a wall to that part of the cave which is before the eyes of our prisoners. A number of men variously employed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> between them and the light, whose shadows are seen by the prisoners, but not their persons themselves. In this manner did that philosopher conceive that by our senses we perceive not things themselves, but only the shadows of things; and he seems to have borrowed his notions on this subject from the disciples of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYTHAGORAS\">Pythagoras</a>.\n\n\"If we make due allowance for Plato's allegorical genius, his sentiments with respect to sensation and perception correspond very well with those of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PERIPATETICS\">Peripatetics</a>. Aristotle, the founder of that school, seems to have thought, that the soul consists of two or three parts, or rather that we have three souls\u2014the vegetable, the animal, and the rational. The animal soul is held to be a certain form of the body, which is inseparable from it, and perishes at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. To this soul the senses belong; and he defines a sense to be that which is capable of receiving the sensible forms, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of objects, without any of the matter of them; as wax receives the form of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEAL\">seal</a> without any of its matter. Of this doctrine it seems to be a necessary consequence, that bodies are constantly sending forth, in all directions, as many different kinds of forms without matter as they have different sensible qualities. This was accordingly maintained by the followers of Aristotle, though not, as far as we know, taught by himself. They disputed concerning the nature of these forms or species, whether they were real beings or nonentities; but of matter and form we shall have occasion to speak afterwards.\n\n\"After Aristotle had kept possession of the schools for more than a thousand years, his authority, which had often supplied the place of argument, was called in question by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACON\">Bacon</a> and others. Descartes, however, was the first philosopher who, convinced of the defects of the prevailing system, attempted to form another entirely new: but on the nature of perception by means of the senses he differs little or nothing from those who had preceded him in that department of science. He denies, indeed, and refutes by solid reasoning, the doctrine which maintains that images, species, or forms of external objects, come from the objects themselves, and enter into the mind by the avenues...\"\nOf avenues of the senses. But he takes it for granted, as all the old philosophers had done, that what we immediately perceive must be either in the mind itself, or in the brain, in which the mind is immediately present. The impressions made upon our organs, nerves, and brain, can be nothing, according to his philosophy, but various modifications of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a>, figure, and motion. There can be nothing in the brain like sound or colour, taste or smell, heat or cold. There are sensations in the mind, which by the laws of the union of the soul and body, are raised on occasion of certain traces in the brain; and although he sometimes gives the name of ideas to these traces, he does not think it necessary that they should be perfectly like the things which they represent, any more than that words and signs should resemble the things which they signify.\n\nAccording to this system it would appear, that we perceive not external objects directly by means of our senses; but that these objects, operating either immediately or immediately upon the organs of sense, and they again upon our nerves and brain, excite in the mind certain sensations; whence we infer the existence of external objects from our sensations of which they are the cause. Perception of external objects, therefore, according to Des Cartes, is not one simple original <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of the mind, but may be resolved into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of reasoning from effects to causes.\n\nThe doctrines of Malebranche, Locke, and Hartley, respecting perception, differ not essentially from that of Des Cartes. Malebranche, indeed, supposes, that external objects are not themselves the causes of perceptions; but that the Deity, being always present to our minds more intimately than any other being, does, upon occasion of the impressions made upon our organs of sense, discover to us, as far as he thinks proper, and according to fixed laws, his own ideas of the object: and thus, according to him, we see all things in God, or in the divine ideas. He agrees, however, with Des Cartes and the ancient philosophers, in considering it as a truth which it is impossible to refute, that we perceive not the objects without us, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>, and stars, &c., because it is not likely that the soul sallies out of the body, and takes a walk, as it were, through the heavens to contemplate these objects. She sees them not therefore by themselves; and the immediate object of the mind, when it sees the sun, is not the sun itself, but something which is intimately united to the mind, and is that which he calls an idea.\n\nLocke, speaking of the reality of our knowledge, says: \"It is evident the mind knows not things immediately, but only by the intervention of the ideas it has of them. Our knowledge, therefore, according to him, is real only so far as there is a conformity between our ideas and the things which they represent.\" The manner of our perceiving external objects he illustrates by the following similitude: \"Methinks the understanding is not much unlike a closet wholly shut from light, with only some little opening left, to let in external visible resemblances or ideas of things without. Would the pictures coming into such a dark room but stay there, and lie so orderly as to be found upon occasion, it would very much resemble the understanding of a man in reference to all objects of sight, and the ideas of them.\" He has elsewhere defined an idea thus: \"Whatsoever the mind perceives in itself, or is the immediate object of perception, thought, or understanding, that I call an idea; and the power to produce any idea in our mind, I call <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of the subject wherein the power is.\" He likewise thinks it \"easy to draw this observation, that the ideas of what he calls primary qualities of bodies, viz. extension, solidity, figure, mobility, &c., are resemblances of these qualities as they really exist in the bodies themselves.\n\nThis unguarded expression, which affirms that ideas in the mind are the resemblances of external things, has brought upon Mr Locke much undeserved ridicule. That on this and other occasions he uses the word idea with too great latitude, and that he often confounds ideas with sensations, and even with the causes of sensation, must be admitted by his warmest admirers; but we believe, that by an attentive reader, who peruses his whole work, and compares such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> as are obscure with those which are clearer, his meaning may always be discovered, and with respect to sensation and perception will generally be found just. That by calling the ideas of primary qualities resemblances of the qualities themselves, he meant nothing more than that bodies in all possible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> impress the senses, nerves, and brain, in such a manner as to produce in the mind certain sensations, between which and those impressions there is an inseparable, though unknown, connection, is evident from the account which he gives of the manner of perception. \"Our senses (says he), conversant about particular sensible objects, do convey into the mind several distinct perceptions of things according to those various ways in which these objects affect them: and thus we come by those ideas we have of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a>, white, heat, cold, soft, hard, bitter, sweet, and all those which we call sensible qualities; which when I say the senses convey into the mind, I mean, they from external objects convey into the mind what produces those perceptions.\" And as bodies can act only by impulse, he adds, that \"those perceptions can be produced only by an impression made upon the senses, and some motion thence <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> by our nerves to the brain or seat of perception.\"\n\nDr Hartley was the pupil of Locke and Newton; and has, in a more satisfactory manner than all who had preceded or have since followed him, explained the material part of the process of perception. His principles we shall have occasion, during the course of the article, to develope pretty fully. For our present purpose it is sufficient to say, that all his observations and arguments evidently suppose, that nothing distant from the mind can be perceived in the immediate act of sensation; but that the apparently immediate perception of external objects is an instance of early and deep-rooted association.\n\nIn this sentiment Mr Hume agrees with his predecessors; but he obscures his philosophy, and misleads his reader, by confounding sensations with the impressions from which they proceed. \"Every one (says he) will allow, that there is a considerable difference between the perceptions of the mind, when a man feels the pain of excessive heat, or the pleasure of moderate warmth, and when he afterwards recalls to his memory this sensation, or anticipates it by his imagination.\"\nThe less forcible and lively of these perceptions he with great propriety calls ideas; but it is either through willful perverseness, or confusion of intellect, that he chooses to call the others impressions. Sensation and perception are caused by impressions; but they are no more impressions themselves, than the pain occasioned by the stroke of a bludgeon is the stroke itself, or the bludgeon with which it was struck. But more of this afterwards.\n\nThus far, then, that we perceive not external objects directly, but infer their existence from certain sensations excited in our minds by the operation of these objects upon our senses, nerves, and brain, seems to have been the opinion of every philosopher from Pythagoras to Mr Hume. For an opinion so universal, and at the same time so contrary to the persuasion of the multitude, some cogent reason must have been assigned. That reason has been given by many philosophers, but by none with greater perspicuity than Dr Porterfield, in his Essay concerning the Motion of the Eyes. \"How body acts upon the mind, or mind upon body (says he), I know not; but this I am very certain of, that nothing can act, or be acted upon, where it is not: and therefore our mind can never perceive anything but its own proper modifications, and the various states of the sensorium to which it is present. So that it is not the external sun and moon, which are in the heavens, that our mind perceives, but only their image or representation impressed on the sensorium. How the soul of a seeing man sees those images, or how it receives those ideas from such agitations in the sensorium, I know not; but I am sure it can never perceive the external bodies themselves to which it is not present.\"\n\nThis reasoning appears to have force; and, perhaps, the unanimous agreement of thinking men in all ages has still greater force; yet the doctrine which prevailed so long, and which to Locke appeared so evident as to need no proof, has been since called in question by some eminent philosophers in our own country; who, though they allow that we cannot perceive external objects but by means of the senses, yet affirm that they are the objects themselves which we perceive directly; and that in perception there is no association which can be resolved into a process of reasoning from sensations the effects, to external objects the causes. Dr Reid, who was perhaps the first, and is unquestionably the ablest of this class of philosophers, had expressed himself on the subject as follows:\n\n\"If we attend to the act of our mind, which we call the perception of an external object of sense, we shall find in it these three things: First, Some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> or notion of the object perceived. Secondly, A strong and irresistible conviction and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> of its present existence. And, Thirdly, That this conviction and belief are immediate, and not the effect of reasoning.\" To the first and second of these propositions, we are persuaded that Des Cartes and Locke would readily have assented; nor do we imagine that they would have denied the third, had the author allowed that this strong and irresistible conviction is the consequence of an early and deep-rooted association resolvable into a process of reasoning. This, however, the learned professor does not allow; for he repeatedly affirms, that it is instinctive and original, and that \"the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of our power of perception determines us to hold the existence of what we distinctly perceive as a first principle, from which other truths may be deduced, but it is deduced from none.\" With this view of the matter, he could with no propriety attempt to support his own opinion by argument; but to the reasonings of Dr Porterfield and others in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of the Cartesian theory, he replies in the following words: \"That nothing can act immediately where it is not, I think must be admitted (D); for I agree with Sir Isaac Newton, that power without substance is inconceivable. It is a consequence of this, that nothing can be acted upon immediately where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a> is not present; let this, therefore, be granted. To make the reasoning conclusive, it is farther necessary, that when we perceive objects, either they act upon us, or we act upon them. This does not appear self-evident, nor have I ever met with any proof of it.\"\n\nOf the profundity of Dr Reid's understanding, we have the most firm conviction; nor is there any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-META\">meta</a>-physician, ancient or modern, from whom we differ with greater reluctance: but we cannot help thinking this a very rash assertion, as his own works appear to us to afford complete proofs that, in perception, the mind both acts and is acted upon. Let us attend, however, to the reasons which, on this occasion, induced\n\n(D) One of the most celebrated of Dr Reid's followers thinks otherwise. \"That no distant subject can act upon the mind, is a proposition (says Lord Kames) which undoubtedly requires evidence; for it is not instinctively certain: And, therefore, till the proposition be demonstrated, every man may without scruple rely upon the conviction of his senses, that he hears and sees things at a distance.\" But his Lordship ought to have known, that Locke and Berkeley, the two philosophers whom he was combating, have nowhere called in question the conviction of their senses. They do not, indeed, admit, that the external organs are themselves perceiving, or that by means of them the mind can immediately perceive distant objects; but they have no where denied, that through the medium of them the mind comes to the knowledge of external existence. And the reasons which they assign for this twofold opinion are, that in perception they experience <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> or the effects of action, which is not their own; and that it is an intuitive truth, that nothing can act where it is not present. \"But admitting (says his Lordship) that no being can act but where it is, is there any thing more simple or more common, than the acting upon subjects at a distance by intermediate means? This holds in fact with respect both to seeing and hearing.\" It certainly does, and with respect to the other senses likewise; but it is the very thing for which Locke and Berkeley would have contended, had any man in their days presumed to call it in question. It is the very foundation of their system; and if it be granted, nothing can be more evident, than that external existence is not the immediate object of perception. See Appendix to Elements of Criticism.\nOf Perception, either of the object on the mind or of the mind on the object.\n\n\"When we say, that one being acts upon another, we mean, that some power or force is exerted by the agent which produces, or has a tendency to produce, a change in the thing acted upon. If this be the meaning of the phrase, as I conceive it is, there appears no reason for asserting, that in perception, either the object acts upon the mind or the mind upon the object. An object, in being perceived, does not act at all. I perceive the walls of the room where I sit; but they are perfectly inactive, and therefore act not upon the mind. To be perceived, is what logicians call an external denomination, which implies neither action nor quality in the object perceived.\"\n\nThis last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> we pretend not to understand. Substance without qualities is to us inconceivable, and certainly is no object of perception; for Dr Reid himself has told us, and told us truly, that \"the objects of perception are the various qualities of bodies.\" That an object in being perceived does not act at all, is directly contrary to what the ingenious author has taught us, both in his Inquiry and in his Essays, viz., that \"it is a law of our nature that we perceive not external objects, unless certain impressions be made by the object upon the organ, and by means of the organ upon the nerve and brain;\" for if the external object in being perceived make impressions, it is certainly not true that it acts not at all. It is indeed readily acknowledged, that when one perceives the walls of the room where he sits, these walls do not act immediately upon the organs of sight; but it does not, therefore, follow, that they are perfectly inactive; for it is known to all mankind, that from every point of the wall which is seen, rays of light are reflected to the eye; that those rays make upon the retina an impression, which is conveyed by the optic nerve to the brain; and that this impression on the brain is one of the immediate causes of vision.\n\nIn what particular manner it causes vision, we shall never be able to discover; till we know more of the laws which unite mind and body, and by which one of these is qualified to act upon the other; but because we know not the manner of this operation, to affirm that there is no operation at all seems to be as absurd as it would be to affirm, because we perceive no necessary connexion between a stroke and the sensation of sound, that the sound of a musical string is not caused by the stroke of a plectrum. That God might have given us powers of perception of a different kind from those which we possess, there can be no doubt; but with what we might have been, we have no concern. As we are, we know perfectly that the eye is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> of vision, because without it nothing can be seen: we know also that the retina and optic nerves are equally necessary; because if they be disordered, vision is still wanting; we know likewise, that the brain is necessary to all perception; because, when it is disordered, thinking either entirely ceases, or is proportionably disturbed. And, lastly, We are not more certain of our own existence, than that actual perception takes place but when the object makes an impression upon some organ of sense; for when no rays of light fall upon the eye, we see nothing; when no sapid body is applied to the tongue and palate, we taste nothing; and if we could be removed from every thing solid, we would feel nothing. These are conclusions which cannot be controverted. They are admitted equally by the philosopher and by the plain unlettered man of common sense; nor are they rendered one whit less certain by our not being able to go a step farther, so as to discover in what manner the brain or the affections of it can be the immediate instrument of sensation and perception. For (as Dr Reid, in the spirit of true philosophy, observes), in the operation of mind, as well as in those of bodies, we must often be satisfied with knowing that certain things are connected and invariably followed one another, without being able to discover the chain that goes between them. It is to such connexions that we give the name of laws of nature; and when we say that one thing produces another by a law of nature, this signifies no more than that one thing which we call in popular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> the cause, is constantly and invariably followed by another which we call the effect; and that we know not how they are connected.\n\nIn the preceding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> we have observed, that in sensation the mind exerts some energy; and therefore, as on every hypothesis perception is a consequence of sensation, it follows, that in perception the mind cannot be wholly inactive. Dr Reid, in his Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man, seems to affirm that it is. \"I see no reason (says he) to believe, that in perception the mind acts upon the object. To perceive an object is one thing, to act upon it is another: Nor is the last at all included in the first. To say that I act upon the wall by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> at it, is an abuse of language, and has no meaning.\" This is indeed true; it would be a great abuse of language to say, that by looking at the wall a man acts upon it: but we do not believe that any man ever said or supposed such a thing. The philosophers, whose opinion he is combating, might argue in this manner. We are conscious that in perception the mind is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a>; nothing can act immediately where it is not; the mind cannot act immediately upon external existence: external existence therefore is not the immediate object of that energy which is exerted in perception. As Dr Reid affirms that external existence is the immediate object of perception, he must deny the first proposition in this argument; for if it be granted, as we have just seen that in his reply to Dr Porterfield he admits the second, the laws of reasoning will compel him to admit the third. To say, that in perception the mind acts not upon external objects, is a truth in which all mankind are agreed; and it is the very principle from which his antagonists infer, that the conviction of the present existence of external objects is not an original and instinctive consequence of sensation, but an early and deep-rooted association which may be resolved into a process of reasoning. His meaning, therefore, must be, that in perception the mind acts not at all: but this is directly contrary to his definition of perception, which he calls an act of the mind: it is likewise contrary to his theory of perception, as it is detailed in the Inquiry into the Human Mind on the principles of Common Sense. We are there taught, with equal elegance and perspicuity, \"that an impression made by an external object upon the organ, nerves, and brain,\"\nis followed by a sensation, and that this sensation is followed by the perception of the object.\" We are likewise taught, that \"although the Peripatetics had no good reason to suppose an active and passive intellect, they yet came nearer the truth, in holding the mind to be, in sensation, partly passive and partly active, than the moderns in affirming it to be purely passive. Sensation, imagination, memory, and judgment, have by the vulgar, in all ages, been considered as acts of the mind. The manner in which they are expressed in all languages shows this: for when the mind is much employed in them, we say, it is very active; whereas, if they were impressions only, we ought to say that the mind is very passive.\" All this is undeniable; but if sensation necessarily precede perception, and if in sensation the mind be active, what becomes of the assertion, that in perception it acts not at all? Indeed we may appeal to the common sense of mankind, whether any thing can be perceived without some mental energy of the percipient. For when the impressions made on the external senses are faint, in order to be conscious of them an evident exertion is requisite, not of the organ only, but also of the mind, as in perceiving very remote objects and sounds; but when the impressions are stronger, the perception is involuntary and unavoidable, as has been already explained in the preceding section.\n\nIt being thus certain that in perception the mind both acts and is acted upon, and it being universally acknowledged that nothing can act where it is not, we feel ourselves compelled to admit with the Cartesians, that in perception the conviction of the present existence of external objects is not original and instinctive, but the consequence of an early and unavoidable association of certain sensations with the causes which produce them. In this opinion we are still more confirmed by the well-known fact, that particular pressures upon the organ, nerves, and brain, excite not only sensations, but even perceptions of objects apparently external, when no such objects are within the reach of our senses. Thus \u00a7, if a man in the dark press either corner of his eye with his finger, he will see a circle of colours like those in the feather of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-PEACOCK\">peacock</a>'s tail, though no such external object be before him, and though the room be so dark that nothing external could possibly be seen. Again, if a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> coal be nimbly moved round in a circle, with gyrations continually repeated, the whole circumference of the circle will at once appear on fire, though it is certain that there can really be no fire but one portion of that circumference, equal in length to the diameter of the coal. These are facts known to all mankind; and they are perfectly irreconcilable with the supposition, that the perception of external objects by the sense of sight is original and instinctive; but they are at once accounted for, if it be true that rays of light falling from external objects upon the retina tymica agitate the optic nerves and brain, and that such agitations excite sensations in the mind which experience has taught us to refer to external objects, as, under God, their ultimate cause.\n\nBut although we have declared ourselves to be in this instance Cartesians, we do not admit all the absurdities which have sometimes been imputed to that system of perception. We do not believe that external objects are perceived by means of images of them in the mind or the brain; nor do we think that Descartes or Locke has anywhere affirmed that they are, otherwise than by an expression obviously figurative, denoting, not that the actual shapes of things are delineated in the brain or upon the mind, but only that impressions of some kind or other are conveyed to the brain by means of the organs of sense and their corresponding nerves; and that between these impressions and the sensations excited in the mind, there is a real, and in our present state a necessary, though unknown, connexion.\n\nUpon the whole, we think that there is good evidence for believing, that in perception the process of fairly nature is as follows: First, If the object be not in contact with the organ of sense, there must be some medium which passes between them; as, in vision, the rays of light; in hearing, the vibrations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> air; and in smelling, the effluvia of the body smelled; otherwise we have neither sensation nor perception. Secondly, There must be some action or impression upon the organ of sense, either by the immediate application of the object, as in the two senses of touch and taste; or by the medium that goes between them, as in the other three senses. Thirdly, The nerves which go from the brain to the organ, must receive some impression by means of that which was made upon the organ; and by means of these nerves that impression must be carried to the brain. Fourthly, The impression made upon the organs, nerves, and brain, reuses the dormant energy of the mind; and this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> action of the mind and the object produces a sensation. And, lastly, As we know by experience that the mind alone cannot, by any exertion of its own, produce one sensation, and are intuitively certain that nothing can begin to exist without a cause, we infer from the existence of any new sensation the existence of some other cause than the internal energy of the mind from which that sensation proceeds; and this cause experience teaches us to be the external object. This process is carried on so rapidly, and the several parts of it, by being continually repeated, are so closely associated, that except by a reflex act of the mind we distinguish them not from one another, and therefore we denominate the whole perception.\n\nIt is with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> diffidence that we advance a doctrine which Dr Reid has controverted; but he differs from us only in the last stage \u00a7 of the process, where he supposes sensation and perception to be two simple and independent acts of the mind. Yet he sometimes expresses himself, as if he thought, as we do, that in perception the belief of the present existence of external objects is rather the result of experience, than an instinctive persuasion. Thus, speaking of the perception which we have in smelling a rose, he says \u00a7, Essays on Perception has always an external object, and the object of my perception in this case is that quality in the rose which I discern by the sense of smell. Observing that the agreeable sensation is raised when the rose is near, and ceases when it is removed, I am led chap. 15, by my nature [we think by experience would have been and 21, more proper] to conclude some quality to be in the rose, which is the cause of this sensation. This quality in the rose is the object perceived; and that act of my mind, by which I have the conviction and belief,\nObjects of belief of this quality, is what in this case I call perception. Again (he says) that \"three of our senses, viz., taste, smell, hearing, originally gives us only certain sensations, and a conviction that these sensations are occasioned by some external object. We give a name to that quality of the object by which it is fitted to produce such a sensation, and connect that quality with the object and with its other qualities. Thus we learn, that a certain sensation of smell is produced by a rose; and that quality in the rose by which it is fitted to produce this sensation we call the smell of the rose. Here it is evident that the sensation is original. The perception that the rose has that quality which we call its smell, is acquired.\"\n\nTo this doctrine no Cartesian could possibly object; for it is the very account which Descartes himself would have given of perception by the organ of smell, as it resolves such a perception into an early association between a certain sensation and that external quality from which we know by experience that the sensation proceeds. Indeed this excellent author repeatedly affirms, that every different perception is conjoined with a sensation which is proper to it; and that the one is the sign, and the other the thing signified. He likewise doubts, whether children, from the time that they begin to use their senses, make a distinction between things which are only conceived or imagined, and things which really exist. But if the conviction of the present existence of external objects were in perception instinctive, we cannot see how there could be room for such a doubt; for the mere senses of children are as perfect as those of full grown men; and they know well the difference between actually sucking their nurses and only thinking of that operation, though they be not capable of expressing that difference in language.\n\nBut if in perception our conviction of the present existence of external objects be not instinctive, what, it may be asked, is the evidence that such objects really exist? This question we shall partly answer in the following section, and more completely when we come to examine Berkeley's theory of the non-existence of matter: but from what has been said already, it is sufficiently evident, that every sensation compels us to believe in the present existence of something different from ourselves, as well as from our sensations.\n\nSect. III. Of the Objects of each Sense respectively.\n\nHitherto we have considered sensation and perception in general, and shown that it is not by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-INSTINCT\">instinct</a> that we perceive the existence of external objects. This will appear more clearly, if we can ascertain the precise nature of that information which each sense affords us: and in order to this, we shall begin with the sense of touch, not only because it is that which is certainly first exercised, but also because there is a meaning in which all the others may be resolved into it.\n\nBy means of touch we perceive many things, of which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> are heat and cold, hardness and softness, roughness and smoothness, extension, figure, solidity, and motion. Of these perceptions, some are immediate; and others, as we are persuaded, early associations, which may be resolved into a process of reasoning. The perceptions of heat and cold are immediate. When a person for the first time in his life approaches the fire, he feels heat; and when he is first exposed to the frost, he feels cold. What are heat and cold, and where do they reside? They are obviously the reverse of each other; but are they external objects, or mere sensations in the mind? They are undoubtedly sensations which have no existence but when they are felt. To every man not altogether a stranger to these speculations, this proposition is self-evident; but to the bulk of the people it appears an extravagant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARADOX\">paradox</a>. To make it plain, however, to the meanest capacity, it is sufficient to observe, that at a certain distance the fire has no perceptible influence upon any person; if that distance be lessened, we feel an agreeable warmth; approach a little nearer, and the warmth becomes disagreeable; and still nearer, it will rise to pain. No man supposes the pain inflicted by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a> to exist in the sword, or anywhere else but in a sentient being. It is equally absurd to suppose pain to exist in fire, or anywhere else but in a sentient being. But that which at one distance is pain, at another is only agreeable warmth; and since warmth and pain are only different degrees of the same feeling, it is equally absurd to suppose the one as the other in the fire. What then is the object of sense when we feel heat? There is obviously no object beyond the present sensation.\n\nBut has the sensation of heat no cause independent of us? Undoubtedly it has, and experience teaches us that the cause is in the fire. We know that we cannot produce the sensation of heat in ourselves by any mental energy of our own; and we are intuitively certain, that nothing can begin to exist without some cause. A man on the top of a mountain covered with snow, may imagine or remember what he felt when in the neighbourhood of fire, and thus have in his mind what is called an idea of heat; but that idea will not warm him (E) like the actual sensation, which no exertion of his own can in such circumstances produce. When he leaves the mountain, however, and approaches the fire, he feels the sensation actually produced, and produced as often as he makes the experiment. He is, therefore, under the necessity of inferring, that in the fire there is some power or quality which, acting either immediately or immediately upon his sense of touch, excites the feeling which is called heat. What that power is, we shall perhaps never be able to discover; but it is self-evident, that it is neither heat nor the resemblance of\n\n---\n\n(e) \u2014 Who can hold a fire in his hand,\n   By thinking on the frosty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAUCASUS\">Caucasus</a>?\n   Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite,\n   By bare imagination of a feast?\n\nOr wallow naked in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a>'s snow,\n   By thinking on fantastic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>'s heat?\n   Oh no! the apprehension of the good\n   Gives but the greater feeling to the worse.\n\nK. Richard II.\nThe same reasoning holds good with respect to cold. There is at certain times, and in certain countries, some power in the air which congeals <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> and causes cold; but that power is as different from the sensation of cold, as the power of fire is different from the sensation of heat, or the point of a sword from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> wound.\n\nBy the sense of touch we perceive extension, figure, terms of solidity, &c. but we do not perceive them immediately as we perceive heat and cold; for extension, figure, and solidity, are not sensations. Those perceptions then must be acquired; and more clearly to ascertain the manner in which we acquire them, let us suppose a man from his birth destitute of the sense of sight and the power of local motion, but possessed of intellect and every other faculty which we enjoy.\u2014Such a person, it is obvious, would be capable of every sensation and perception which is original to us, except the perception of colours; but we doubt whether it would be possible to give him perceptions of extension, figure, and solidity. Let us try; and as he cannot move a single limb or member of himself, let us suppose a solid substance of small dimensions to be gently pressed against any part of his body; what would such pressure communicate to him? We think it could communicate nothing but a new sensation, to which, as it is neither pleasing nor painful, no name has hitherto been given, except the general one of feeling. This sensation he would not know whether to refer to an external or internal cause; or rather he could have no notion whatever of an external cause, though he would at the same time be conscious that the new sensation was not excited by any energy of his own will. Were the pressure to be gradually increased till it rose to pain, our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a> man would still be conscious of nothing but a sensation, which could not lead him to the notion of extension, figure, or solidity, because mere sensations cannot be conceived as either solid or extended. Let us next suppose the pressure to be applied successively to different parts of his body; he would now indeed be conscious of successive sensations, but he could not assign to them either extension or place: for it has been already shown that the external parts of the body are not themselves sentient; and it shall be shown afterwards, that to a man who has never perceived motion, place is absolutely inconceivable.\n\nLastly, let us suppose the dimensions of the pressing substance to be greatly enlarged: what would then follow? nothing, we apprehend, but an increase of pain; for though his whole body were pressed ab extra, the pressure could affect the individual being which is sentient, not more extensively, but only more violently. It appears, therefore, that a man blind from his birth, and destitute of the power of local motion, could never be made to perceive extension, figure, or solidity.\n\nLet us now suppose this man to receive by a miracle the use of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a>, and to be suddenly prompted, by some instinctive impulse, to arise and walk. So long as he met with no obstacle in his way, he would not, we apprehend, acquire by this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> any correct notions of extension or figure; but were a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> or log of wood of considerable dimensions to be laid across his usual walk, the case would soon be altered. He would feel himself interrupted in his course, and he the respect would at the same instant recognize his wonted sensations of touch. After being twice or thrice thus interrupted, he would learn from experience that the interruption or resistance proceeded from the same cause which in this instance communicated to him the sensation of feeling; and were he to run his hand along the surface of the log or stone, he would perceive the resistance and the sensation continued. As every effect must have an adequate cause, this continued resistance would compel him to believe the continuity of something external in every direction in which he felt his hand resisted; but such continuity of being is all that is meant by the word extension. At the very same time, and by the very same means, he would gradually acquire the perception of figure; for by running his hand in every direction over the surface of the obstacle which opposed him, he would soon perceive it on all sides limited; but the limits of extension is a phrase of precisely the same import with figure. It appears, therefore, that without the power of local motion, men could never, by the sense of touch, acquire the notions of extension and figure; and the same will be found to be the case with respect to hardness and softness.\n\nWhen we press our hand gently against a stock or stone, we feel a sensation which is neither painful and soft nor pleasing. When we press it more violently, the sensation becomes painful, and we experience in the object a resistance which we have not power to overcome. When we press <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a> or pomatum very gently, we have a sensation in all respects similar to that which we felt when we gently touched the stock or the stone. But when we press the butter with violence, we feel no pain, and experience little resistance; for the parts of which it is composed give way before the hand, though the parts of the stock or the stone remained fixed and immoveable. That the parts of one body should thus resist a pressure to which the parts of another so readily yield, must proceed from some difference in the texture of the two bodies: for by the sense of touch we perceive the effects to be different; and are therefore certain that they must proceed either from different causes, or from the same cause operating with different degrees of force. That particular texture which makes the parts of a stone resist the pressure of touch, we call hardness; and the texture which makes the parts of butter or pomatum give way to touch, we call softness. But what hardness and softness are in themselves, touch cannot inform us; for they are neither sensations, nor similar to sensations. We acquire, however, by experience, so complete notions of hardness and softness, that every one who understands the English language perfectly knows the meaning of these words as soon as he hears them; and when he is told that one body is hard and another soft, he knows with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> certainty that the meaning of the assertion is, that the parts of the body which is said to be hard are held together by some unknown cause operating forcibly, and that the parts of the other are held together by the same or a similar cause operating with less force.\n\nWe acquire the notions of roughness and smoothness in the very same way and by the very same means that\nObjects of we acquire ideas of extension and figure. To describe the process at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> would certainly be superfluous; for if what we have said concerning our perceptions of extension and figure be just and intelligible, every one will, without farther assistance, discover for himself how he perceives roughness and smoothness. Motion shall be considered among the adjuncts of body; but in order to understand what body itself is, it will be necessary, before we dismiss the sense of touch, to inquire how we come by the notion of solidity.\n\nSolidity is one of those notions, or, in the language of Locke, one of those ideas, which are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> said to be acquired by the sense of touch. That touch gives the first hint towards our notion of solidity, is certainly true; but that hint must be afterwards improved by the intellect, or we never could have an adequate knowledge of what is meant when any thing is said to be absolutely solid. We know by experience, that we can at pleasure open and shut our empty hand without meeting with any resistance. We know likewise, that when we grasp an ivory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> of three or four inches diameter, no force which we can exert will bring together the several parts of the hand, which were easily brought together when we grasped nothing. In this way do we acquire our first notion of solidity; for the word denotes nothing more in this instance than the power or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of the ball, by which our fingers are excluded from the place which it occupies. Solidity differs from hardness in this respect, that hardness results from the strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COHESION\">cohesion</a> of the parts of a hard body, which renders it difficult to change the places of those parts, as they respect one another; whereas solidity respects the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>, and is as essential a quality of water as of adamant. A drop of water, indeed, placed between two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> surfaces of marble, will not like adamant preclude their contact; because the parts of a drop of water, cohering but loosely to one another, give way to the pressure, and escape in every lateral direction. But if a drop of water be confined on all sides, as in a globe of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>, we know from experience that no force will bring the sides of the globe together without forcing the water through the pores of the metal; and hence we infer solidity to be essential to every corporeal substance.\n\nThus then it appears that of the objects perceived by touch not one is immediately perceived except heat, cold, and other sensations. The sensations, as they are not excited by any internal energy of our own, lead us indeed to something external as their cause; and by comparing the different sensations with each other, and observing what effects their external causes have upon our own motions, we are naturally led to conceive these causes as extended, figured, solid, hard or soft, rough or smooth, &c.; but it is obvious that this conception is the result of experience, and a process of mental reasoning.\n\nOn the senses of taste, smell, and hearing, it is needless to say much. The immediate objects of these are confessedly sensations which have no existence but when they are perceived; though experience teaches us to refer them all to external objects as their respective causes. With respect to smell, this has been made sufficiently evident in the preceding section, and it is not less evident with respect to taste and hearing,\n\nCertain bodies applied to the tongue and palate, and moistened with the saliva, excite certain sensations which we call tastes. These sensations, however, are not in the bodies; nor can they have any existence but in a sentient being. They are produced in consequence of impulses on the nerves of the tongue and palate, exciting certain agitations in the brain; but the sensation itself is neither impulse nor agitation. Some substances excite tastes which are agreeable, and others such as are disagreeable; and there are not a few which excite no taste at all. Bodies, which applied to the tongue and palate of one man produce tastes that are agreeable, applied to the same organs of another man give him tastes which are disagreeable; and we have all experienced, that the same substance, which, when the organs are sound, excites a sweet or pleasant taste, has, when the organs were disordered, excited a taste which was bitter or unpleasant. These facts, which cannot be controverted, afford the fullest evidence, if evidence were wanted, that taste, as we feel it, is no quality of bodies, nor has any existence out of the mind.\n\nThe organ of hearing is the ear, and its object is sound. It is well known, that sound is produced by certain vibrations of the air striking the tympanum of the ear, and that these vibrations are caused by the sonorous body. Sound, however, is not vibration, nor the idea of sound the idea of vibration. Sound considered by itself is a mere sensation, which can have no existence but in a sentient being. We know by experience, that it is caused by something external; but we know likewise that the effect has no resemblance to the cause. Previous to experience we could not refer sound to any external cause; far less could we discern whether it proceeded from an object above us or below us, on our right hand or on our left. It appears to us self-evident, that if a man born deaf were suddenly made to hear, he would consider his first sensation of sound as originating wholly within himself. Between that sensation and the sensations of touch, taste, smell, and sight, there is no resemblance; nor are there any relations among them, which, previous to experience, could induce him to trace them all to external objects as their several causes. Our deaf man might have learned to refer all his other sensations to their true causes, in some such way as we have described under the sense of touch; but sound would be something so new to him, and so totally different from touch, taste, and smell, that he could <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> it to nothing external.\n\nExperience, however, would soon teach him that it is by the ear its organ, and the sonorous body its cause; and he would in time learn to distinguish one sound, that of a trumpet for instance, from another, suppose the sound of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELL\">bell</a>; and to attribute each to its proper cause, even when neither the trumpet nor the bell bodies was perceived by his other senses. With respect to the sounds which we have been accustomed to hear, this sound is done so instantaneously, that some philosophers have imagined it to be the effect of an instinctive principle in our nature, totally different from experience, and independent of reason. But the fact is not so. Long before we are capable of making sensation and perception objects of reflection, we have heard the sound produced by the ringing of a bell, and seen the object which produced the sound so often, that, when we hear a similar sound\nthe rays of light reflected from the body, which in objects of common language is said to be coloured. These rays, falling upon the pupil of the eye, are refracted differently, according as their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INCIDENCE\">incidence</a> is more or less oblique, into points on the retina, where they form a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> of the external object; and from the picture, by means of the optic nerve, is communicated to the brain some impulse or agitation, which produces vision or the perception of colour. As rays of light are corporeal substances, it is obvious that they can act upon body only by impulse; but between impulse and the various sensations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>, green, blue, &c., there is no resemblance. For the laws of reflection and refraction, and for the structure of the eye, see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPTICS\">Optics</a> and Anatomy. That which we have to inquire into at present is, how we learn, by means of the sense of sight, to perceive the figure, magnitude, motion, and distance of external objects, or indeed to distinguish one object from another.\n\nA ray of light proceeding, as all rays do, in a straight line, must, however great its length, affect the eye, retina, and optic nerve, as if it were a single point. From this obvious and undeniable fact, Bishop Berkeley predicted *, that a man born blind, who should be suddenly made to see, would at first perceive nothing without him, would distinguish neither the distance, size, figure, nor situation, of external objects; that he would only see in his eyes themselves, or, to speak more properly, would only experience new modifications in his mind, until joining touch to sight, he formed thus a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> with the external world, and learned, by the simultaneous exercise of the two senses, that natural language in which the visible is the sign of the tangible. This truth, which was discovered by the bishop merely by contemplating in his own mind the nature of sensation, and the known laws of optics, after having been laughed at for more than 20 years as one of the many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DREAMS\">dreams</a> of a visionary genius, was completely confirmed by the case of the famous patient whom Cheselden cured of a cataract; and that too, though the cataract does not produce total blindness: which makes it evident, that the first visual perceptions of the patient after his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a> could not be wholly new and unmixed. It may indeed be confirmed at any time by a simple experiment made upon an infant. For several weeks after birth, a child shuts not its eyes upon the sudden approach of an object to them, nor shows the least symptom of distinguishing one distance from another; and it is easy by a little attention to observe, how it gradually learns to distinguish objects at greater and greater distances. Indeed colour, or the immediate object of sight, being a mere sensation or affection of the mind, can have no natural relation whatever to anything external.\n\nIt is plain, therefore, that distance is in its own nature imperceptible to the eye, and yet it is often perceived by sight. How is this done? We think, in the following manner. Distance is one mode of expansion, which, we have already seen, is perceived by means of touch. Of short distances, our first ideas are doubtless acquired by the stretching out and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> back of our arms; and those ideas are soon so connected with certain sensations which we have in actual vision, that the latter instantly suggests the former.\nObjects of Thus, it is a fact known by experience, that when the respective we look at a near object with both eyes, according as it approaches or recedes from us, we alter the disposition of our eyes, by lessening or widening the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> between the pupils. This disposition or turn of the eye, is attended with a sensation of which every man is conscious at the time of vision; and this sensation seems to us to be that which in this case suggests the idea of greater or less distance to the mind. Not that there is any natural or necessary connexion between the sensation of which we are conscious, and greater or less distance: for the sensation is wholly internal, and the distance is external. But because the mind has, by constant experience, found the different sensations occasioned by different dispositions of the eyes to correspond to different degrees of distance in the object, there has grown a habitual or customary connexion between those sensations and the notions of greater or less distance. So that the mind no sooner perceives the sensation arising from the different turn it gives the eyes in order to bring the pupils nearer or farther asunder, than it is instantly impressed with a certain notion of the distance which was wont to be connected with that sensation. Again, An object placed at a certain distance from the eye, to which the breadth of the pupil bears a sensible proportion, being made to approach nearer, is seen more confusedly; and the nearer it is brought, the confusion is always the greater. The reason of all this is known to every optician: but it being constantly experienced by those who never dipt into optics, there arises in the mind of every man a habitual connexion between the several degrees of confusion and distance, the greater confusion still implying the less distance, and the less confusion the greater distance. It is of no avail to say, that between confused vision and distance, great or small, there is no necessary connection: for there is as little connexion between a blush in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a> and the mental feeling of shame; and yet no sooner does a man of observation perceive that particular colour in the face of another, than it suggests to him the notion of that feeling or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> with which he has constantly observed it accompanied.\n\nIn these ways, however, we perceive only small distances. Of distances more remote our judgment is formed from other data; and happily these data are not far to seek. It is a fact known to every man who is not totally ignorant of the science of optics, that a greater number of rays fall upon the eye when reflected from a body near at hand, than can fall from the same body at a distance; and as those rays operate by impulse, it is self-evident that the impression must be stronger, and of course the sensation or colour more vivid, when the body is near than when it is distant. Now having acquired the notion of the true distance of objects by motion and the sense of touch, and finding by uniform experience, that as they are near or far off, the sensation or colour which they excite in the mind through the organ of vision is more or less vivid, those degrees of sensation come to be so closely associated with the respective distances of the object, that the one instantly suggests the other.\n\nIt is just so that we perceive figure by sight. Having experienced by the sense of touch that one surface is a square and another a circle, that one body is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUBE\">cube</a> and another a sphere; and finding our sense of sight differently affected by the square and the circle, the respect by the cube and the sphere; these different affections come to be so closely connected in our minds with the figures of the respective bodies, that long before we are capable of reasoning on the subject the one is never present to us without suggesting the other. Nay, so complete in this case is the connexion or association, that we cannot even in idea abstract the colour from the figure; though it is certain that colour is a mere sensation, and figure an external quality; that colour alone is immediately perceivable by the eye, and the notion of figure suggested by the colour. We are aware that it has been affirmed, and affirmed with great vehemence, that figures of two dimensions are immediately perceived by the eye, and perceived with greater accuracy than by the sense of touch. But they who insist upon this doctrine affirm likewise, contrary to experience and the clearest reasoning, that the immediate objects of sight are external, and that colour is a quality of bodies. In the arguments too by which they support their hypothesis, they seem to confound sight as an affection of the mind, with the picture on the bottom of the eye, as if the retina were the sentient being; whereas the retina and picture are no more than instruments of sensation. It is indeed a fact, that the picture has the same figure nearly with the plane of the object which is presented to the eye; as when the object is a sphere, the picture is a circle variously shaded in colour. It is likewise a fact, that the picture is enlarged in proportion as the object is brought near, and diminished as it is carried to a distance. But these facts are known only to persons skilled in optics; and therefore it is evident, that though calculations may be raised from them by mathematicians to determine the distance and figure of external objects, they cannot possibly be the data from which distance and figure are inferred by the vulgar, who know not that such pictures on the retina exist. Besides all this, it is universally known, that a painter, by laying on his colours properly, can make a plain square surface appear to the eye in certain positions as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a> or as a cube, and a plain circular surface as a concave or a convex hemisphere. But not one of these things could possibly be done, were figure, or indeed anything else than colour, the immediate object of vision.\n\nAs we see distance and figure, so we see magnitude; and we see both in the same way that we see shame or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a> in the looks of a man. The impression made upon the bottom of the eye by rays reflected from a large magnitude, must necessarily be different from the impression made by rays reflected from a magnitude that is less. This is self-evident; and since the impression ab extra is in some way or other the cause of that sensation, which is all of which we are originally conscious in vision, it is obvious that the sensation, like every other effect, must correspond to the cause from which it proceeds. Being therefore conscious of different sensations; and having, at an earlier period than we distinctly remember, learned by experience to refer them to different magnitudes; no sooner is each sensation excited than it suggests the notion, or, if you please, the perception, of that magnitude with which it is connected. So completely is this association fixed in the mind, that when we look at a known object, its real\nsets of real magnitude appears to be as instantly observed as respect its colour, whilst we hardly attend at all to the particularity of the sensation by which the magnitude is suggested. It is, indeed, customary with writers on optics to distinguish between tangible and visible magnitude, as if any kind of magnitude were the immediate object of vision; but this is not so: for magnitude is something external, whereas the immediate object of vision is a mere sensation. What has introduced into science this mode of speaking is the following fact, that as we approach a distant object it appears to the eye larger and larger every step, and less and less as we recede from it; whereas the tangible magnitude of an object is always the same. The reason of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> change of magnitude to the eye, according to the distance at which any particular object is viewed, is, that from a near object rays of light fall in greater numbers and more diverging than from the same object viewed at a distance. This of course alters the nature of the visible sensation: each common sensation is in the mind closely linked with a particular notion of magnitude; and by the exercise of sight and touch we have learned from experience, that the particular sensation caused by diverging rays must be referred to a larger magnitude than that which is caused by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> rays proceeding from the same distance.\n\nUpon the whole, then, we think ourselves entitled to conclude, that the proper and original objects of vision constitute an universal language of the Author of Nature, by which we are instructed how to regulate our actions, in order to attain those things that are necessary to the preservation and well-being of our bodies, as also to avoid whatever may be hurtful or destructive to them. It is principally by the information of this language that we are guided in all the transactions and concerns of life: And the manner in which it signifies and marks to us the objects which are at a distance, is similar to that of languages and signs of human appointment, which do not suggest the things signified by any likeness or identity of nature, but only by a habitual connection, which experience has made us to observe, between them. This language of the eye, like the language of the tongue, suggests by one sensation what may be resolved into a variety of perceptions. A tree is composed of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a>, branches, leaves; it has colour, figure, size; and all these things are at once suggested to the mind by the two words spreading oak. Just so it is with respect to vision: the sensation received by the eye suggests at once the trunk, branches, leaves, colour, figure, and size of the oak, and suggests them all as the qualities of one object.\n\n**CHAP. II. Of Retention and Ideas.**\n\nFrom the experiment with the burning coal mentioned in No. 31, it is apparent, the sensations excited through the eye, together with their corresponding perceptions, remain in the mind for a short time after the external exciting cause is removed. The same thing appears from another experiment which was first made by Sir Isaac Newton, and which every man may repeat for his own satisfaction. It is universally known*, that a proper mixture of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> original colours, red, yellow, green, blue, &c., constitutes that uniform appearance which we call white. But when these colours are made to pass in a rapid consecution before the eye, they excite the very same perception as when they are properly mixed, which is a satisfactory proof that the impression made by each separate colour remains in the brain until a revolution of all the colours be completed; for nothing but the impression of all the colours at once can produce the sensation and perception of white. Indeed no person capable of paying the proper attention to these things, can keep his eye fixed upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUMINOUS\">luminous</a> object, and afterwards shut it, without experiencing that the sensation and perception remain for some time after the external object is shut out, and that they go off gradually till they leave behind them the mental appearance, which is properly called an idea of the object.\n\nThe same continuance of the sensation after the removal of its cause is equally observable in the sense of hearing; for every sound which we hear is reflected by the neighbouring bodies; and therefore consists in reality of a variety of sounds succeeding each other at different distances of time, according to the distances of the several reflecting bodies. Yet this causes no confusion or apparent complexity of sound, unless when the distance of the reflecting bodies is very considerable, as in spacious buildings.\n\nWith respect to the continuance of the sensation of touch, doubts have been started: but for these there is as little room as for doubting the continuance of the sensations of seeing and hearing. The continuance of heat after the heating body is removed, and of the smart of a wound after the instant of infliction, are proofs that every sensation of touch does not vanish with its cause. A man unused to the motion of a ship or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COACH\">coach</a>, after having been a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> or on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a>, feels or imagines he feels the rolling of the ship or the jolting of the coach after he is in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a> and actually at rest. Of these facts we know not what other account can be given, than that the agitation in the brain, which is the immediate cause of the sensation of touch, remains for some time after the external cause of the agitation is removed.\n\nAs to the senses of taste and smell, Dr Hartley seems to think that there is no clear and direct evidence for the continuance of their sensations after their proper objects are removed: but in this instance the ingenious author does not do <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> to his own theory. Let any man eat onions, garlic, or any other thing of a very pungent taste, and immediately wash his mouth with fresh water, so that he may be sure no part of the sapid body remains on his tongue or palate. According to this doctrine, the taste of the onion or garlic should instantly vanish with its object; but the fact is otherwise. Whoever shall make the experiment, will find the sensation to remain a considerable time: not indeed in its original force, but weakened no more than what it must necessarily be by the introduction of a new sensation excited by the water. It is more difficult to ascertain the permanency of smell: but analogy inclines us to believe, that in this particular it resembles the other senses, though we know not how to direct the reader to an experiment which will give him absolute conviction.\n\nWhether the cause of these continued sensations, after the removal of their objects, be in the brain alone,\nRetention in the mind alone considered as an immaterial being, and ideas or in both together, is of very little importance; because, taking the mind and its internal organs as one metaphysical whole*, it matters not to our present inquiry, where this retentive power resides, as long as it can be proved to exist within us: for it seems evident, that what has the faculty of retaining a sensation when no longer acted upon by the object which excited it, must also have a power to preserve the vestiges of that sensation even after the sensation itself shall be entirely obliterated. This is in fact the case with the mind. When an object which we have once perceived is most remote from our thoughts, we are certain that there is within us a capacity, disposition, tendency, or power, by which a representation of that object may be at any time revived and presented to the intellect. Thus the same inherent power of the mind and its internal organs, which retains a sensation and perception in the absence of the object by which they were excited, can also reproduce that perception, or bring into the view of the intellect something exactly similar to it. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-REPRODUCTION\">reproduction</a> will not indeed be so lively as the original perception when accompanied with its corresponding sensation, because sensation and actual perception are affected by a double cause, the action of the external object upon the organ, nerves, and brain, and the corresponding energy of the mind or sentient principle; whereas, in the reproduction, the mind seems to act solely by its own power, and certainly without the assistance of external objects. This reproductive power is commonly called memory.\n\nBy many of the ancient philosophers, and by M. Schwab, with one or two others among the moderns, it is called imagination. We do not choose either to revive antiquated modes of expression, or to introduce innovations of our own; but as we cannot disapprove of the ancient phraseology, after the definitions which the reader will by and by find of imagination, memory, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOLLECTION\">recollection</a>, as given by Mr Harris, we have prefixed to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of retention, which comprehends them all.\n\nWhen one recalls an object of sight by the power of memory, it appears to him precisely the same as in the original survey, only less distinct, and with a conviction (which is perhaps the result of experience) that the real object is not immediately before him. How is an object recalled by the power of memory? Does the man endeavour to form in his mind a picture or representative image of the object? Let us listen to the answers given by different philosophers to this question.\n\nThe sentiments of the Peripatetics, as expressed by Alexander Aphrodisiensis, one of the earliest commentators on Aristotle, are thus translated by Mr Harris in his Hermes.\u2014\"Now, what fancy or imagination is, we may explain as follows: We may conceive to be formed within us, from the operation of the senses about sensible objects, some impression (as it were), or picture in our original sensorium, being a relict of that motion caused within us by the external object; and this relict which, when the external object is no longer present, remains, and is still preserved, being as it were its image; and which, by being thus preserved, becomes the cause of our having memory. Now such a sort of relict, (and as it were) impression, they call fancy or imagination (x).\" A passage from Alcinos of the doctrines of Plato, as rendered into English by Dr Reidt, shows that, in this theory, as in that of perception, the Platonists agreed with the Peripatetics. \"When the form or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYPE\">type</a> of things is imprinted on the mind by the organs of the senses, and so imprinted as not to be deleted by time, but preserved firm and lasting, its preservation is called memory.\"\n\nMr Harris, who was deeply read in the ancient philosophy, and who considered the authority of Aristotle and Plato as superseding all reasoning and all inquiry, after justly observing, that if the soul had no other faculties than the senses, it could never acquire the least idea of time, thus expresses himself on the subject before us: \"But, happily for us, we are not deserted here. We have, in the first place, a faculty called imagination or fancy; which, however as to its energies it may be subsequent to sense, yet is truly prior to it both in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> and use. This it is which retains the fleeting forms of things, when things themselves are gone, and all sensation is at an end. That this faculty, however connected with sense, is still perfectly different, may be seen from hence. We have an imagination of things that are gone and extinct; but no such things can be made objects of sensation. We have an easy command over the objects of our imagination, and can call them forth in almost what manner we please; but our sensations are necessary when their objects are present, nor can we controul them but by removing either the objects or ourselves. As wax would not be adequate to its business of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIGNATURE\">signature</a>, had it not a power to retain, as well as receive; the same holds of the soul, with respect to sense and imagination. Sense is its receptive power: imagination its retentive. Had it sense without imagination, it would not be as wax but as water; where, though all impressions may be instantly made, yet as soon as made they are entirely lost. Thus then, from a view of the two powers taken together, we may call sense (if we please), a kind of transient imagination; and imagination, on the contrary, a kind of permanent sense.\"\n\nGreat part of the office which is here given to imagination, is in common English attributed to memory; but between these two faculties, as well as between them and recollection, the author accurately distinguishes thus:\u2014\"When we view some relict of memory sensation reposed within us, without thinking of its rise, &c., or referring it to any sensible object, this is fancy or imagination. When we view some such relict, and refer it without to that sensible object which in time past was its...\"\nOf this theory we shall only remark, that if we could understand the words picture and form in a metaphorical sense, as candour obliges us to understand Locke's images in the mind, the doctrine of Alexander Aphrodiasius would be very little wide of the truth. Experience teaches us that memory as well as perception depends upon the state of the brain; and as it is undeniable, that when a man to-day contemplates an object which he perceived yesterday, or at any former period, he has a view of it in all respects similar to the original perception, only fainter and less distinct, it is extremely probable, that an impression ab extra, which produces a sensation and perception, leaves behind it some tendency in the brain, to vibrate as in the actual sensation, and that this tendency is carried into effect by the internal energy of the mind itself. But in the Peripatetic philosophy, pictures and forms in the sensorium were considered as real things, and by no means as metaphorical expressions. This is evident from their being constantly compared to the impression of a seal upon wax, and from their converting the materia prima from something, which can neither be seen nor felt, into visible and tangible body, of which we shall treat afterwards. Now it being certain that on a being immaterial, no corporeal form can be impressed, and repeated dissections having shown that no such forms are in fact impressed on the brain, this whole theory is at once overturned.\n\nModern philosophers having denied that there are real images or forms in the mind during the immediate act of perception, cannot consistently with themselves admit such images in the act of retention, or when those things which were formerly objects of perception are recalled to the mind by the power of memory. Mr Locke's doctrine is, \"that the mind retains these simple ideas which it first received from sensation or reflection, two ways: first, by keeping the idea, which is brought into it, for some time actually in view, which is called contemplation: and secondly, by the power which we have to revive again in our minds those ideas, which, after imprinting, have disappeared, or have been, as it were, laid out of sight; as when we conceive heat or light, yellow or sweet, the object being removed. This (he says) is memory; which is, as it were, the storehouse of our ideas.\"\n\nTo explain this more fully, he immediately adds the following observation:\u2014\"But our ideas being nothing but actual perceptions in the mind, which cease to be anything where there is no perception of them, this laying up of our ideas in the repository of the memory, signifies no more than this, that the mind has a power in many cases, to revive perceptions which it has once had, with this additional perception annexed to them, that it has had them before. And in this sense it is, that our ideas are said to be in our memories, when indeed they are actually nowhere; but only there is an ability, in the mind, when it will, to revive them again, and, as it were, paint them anew on itself, though some with more some with less difficulty, some more lively and others more obscurely. And thus it is, by the assistance of this Retention faculty, that we are said to have all those ideas in our understandings, which, though we do not actually contemplate them, yet we can bring in sight, and make appear again, and be the objects of our thoughts, without the help of those sensible qualities which first imprinted them there.\"\n\nTo attempt a defence of the accuracy of this language would be vain; but as the author's meaning is sufficiently obvious, his expressions may be easily and certainly corrected. Had Locke said\u2014\"But our ideas being nothing but scenes or appearances in the mind, which cease to be any thing when there is no perception of them, thus laying up of our ideas in the repository of the memory signifies no more but this, that the mind has a power, in many cases, to revive scenes which it has once viewed, with this additional perception annexed to them, that it has viewed them before?\" there would have been no room for the many petulant remarks which have been made upon the passage.\n\nBut against this account of memory, a much heavier objection has been brought than that which regards the propriety of the language. It has been said, that the additional perception, which according to Locke, attends the revival of our ideas by the power of memory, \"would be a fallacious perception, if it led us to believe that we had them before, since they cannot have two beginnings of existence: nor can we believe them to have two beginnings of existence; we can only believe that we had formerly ideas or perceptions very like to them, though not identically the same.\" Let us examine this question somewhat narrowly: for if it be really true, that in the sense in which the word same is here used, we cannot twice contemplate the same idea, all confidence in memory would seem to be at an end.\n\nSuppose a man to stand on some of the rising grounds about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, the Caltonhill for instance, and from that eminence to view the glorious prospected of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of Fife, the ocean, the frith of Forth, and the little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a> scattered in the frith. Let him go away, and return next day to the same place and look the same way: we would ask whether he has the same view or perception which he had the day before? The man must surely be very captious who would say that he has not: and yet it is certain that the energy of mind by which he perceives on one day cannot be identically the same with that by which he perceived on another; nor are the rays of light which fall upon his eyes on the second day, identically the same with those which fell upon his eyes and occasioned vision on the first day. Let the same man now shut his eyes, and contemplate the various objects at which he had been just looking. They will appear to him in all respects the same as when viewed by means of his organs of sight, only fainter and less distinct, with this additional conviction, that the immediate objects of his present contemplation are not real external things, but ideas or mental representations of those things which had so lately been the objects of his sight. Let him think no more about the matter for some days, and then exert his powers of memory. We have no hesitation to say, that in the sense of the word same, as used by Mr Locke, the very same ideas will recur.\nRetention recur and be present to his intellect which were present to it at the former contemplation. The second energy of memory or imagination, or whatever it may be called, is not indeed identically the same with the first; nor is that agitation or motion, or whatever other affection of the brain is necessary to memory, identically the same at the second time as at the first: but the mind exerting itself in the very same manner at the one time as at the other, produces the same kind of agitation in the brain, and is itself affected in the very same way at the second as at the first exertion. Whence it follows, that the second ideal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> will be as much the same with the first, as the second actual perception is the same with the first, and the two ideal scenes, and the two actual perceptions, are respectively said to be the same with each other, only because they impress the mind with a conviction that they were occasioned by the same external objects.\n\nBut though we think Locke's doctrine, with respect to memory, may be thus easily vindicated from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of fallaciousness, we must acknowledge that to us it appears not to be of much value. It teaches nothing, but that the mind has a power to retain ideas of those objects which it formerly perceived, and in many instances to recall them as occasion may require. But these are truths known to all mankind, to the clown as well as to the philosopher.\n\nPhilosophers in general have paid less regard to the retentive faculties of the mind than to its original powers of perception. Perhaps they imagined, that as memory depends upon perception, and in some respects appears to resemble it, a competent knowledge of the nature of the former faculty would lead to that of the second. Be this as it may, Mr Hume, who was at some pains to detail his notions of perception, has in his Philosophical Essays only dropt concerning memory and imagination a few hints, so loosely thrown together, that, if he had not elsewhere expressed himself with more precision, it would have been difficult to discover his real meaning. According to him, that which is commonly called the perception of an external object, is nothing but a strong impression upon the mind; and that which is called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-REMEMBRANCE\">remembrance</a> of a past object, is nothing but a present impression or idea weaker than the former. Imagination is an idea weaker than the idea or impression which he calls memory. This seems to be a wonderful abuse of language. Impressions are not perceptions; and, if possible, they can still less be called ideas, which are but secondary perceptions. It is likewise far from being true, that an idea of imagination has necessarily less vivacity than an idea of memory. We have seen Mr Hume, and have at the present moment an idea of his form and dress: we can likewise imagine to ourselves a centaur; and though a centaur was never seen, and therefore cannot be an impression repeated by memory, our idea of the monster is much more lively and distinct than that of the philosopher.\n\nDr Reid having observed of memory *, that it is by it we have an immediate knowledge of things past; Reid that it must have an object; that in this respect it agrees with perception, but differs from sensation, which has no object but the feeling itself; and that every man can distinguish the thing remembered from the remembrance of it\u2014proceeds to inquire what memory is. And, \"First (says he), I think it appears that memory is an original faculty given us by the Author of our being, of which we can give no account but that we are so made. The knowledge, (continues he) which I have of things past by my memory, seems to me as unaccountable as an immediate knowledge would be of things to come (x); and I can give no reason why I should have the one and not the other, but that such is the will of my Maker. I find in my mind a distinct conception and a firm belief of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of past events; but how this is produced I know not. I call it memory; but this is only giving a name to it; it is not an account of its cause. I believe most firmly what I distinctly remember; but I can give no reason of this belief. It is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSPIRATION\">inspiration</a> of the Almighty which gives me this understanding. When I believe the truth of a mathematical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-AXIOM\">axiom</a> or of a mathematical proposition, I see that it must be so: every man who has the same conception of it sees the same. There is a necessary and an evident connection between the subject and the predicate of the proposition; and I have all the evidence to support my belief which I can possibly conceive. When I believe that I washed my hands and face this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, there appears no necessity in the truth of the proposition. It might be or it might not be. A man may distinctly conceive it without believing it at all. How then do I come to believe it? I remember it distinctly. This is all I can say. This remembrance is an act of my mind. Is it impossible that this act should be, if the event had not happened? I confess I do not see any necessary connexion, between the one and the other. If any man can show such a necessary connexion, then I think that belief which we have of what we remember will be fairly accounted for: but if this cannot be done, that belief is unaccountable; and we can say no more than that it is the result of our constitution. Our original faculties are all unaccountable: Of these memory is one. He only who made them comprehends fully how they are made, and how they produce in us not only a conception, but a firm belief and assurance, of things which it concerns us to know.\"\n\nOn this account of memory we shall make no remarks. There is a certain sense of the words, in which every thing which the author has said on the subject is undoubtedly\n\n(f) If memory depends upon the state of the brain as it has been affected in past perceptions, this appears to us a strange position. Perhaps the excellent author means nothing more, than that it is as unaccountable to us, that impressions on the brain should cause perception, and the vestiges of those impressions should cause remembrance, as how the mind might not perceive things to come without the intervention of impressions on the brain. If this be the meaning, no man will controvert it: for it is impossible to discover the nature of that relation which subsists between an impression and perception; but that there is such a relation, we know from experience.\nreader the conclusions to which we think these facts Retention lead.\n\n1. Objects once perceived by the senses, when recalled to the mind by the power of memory, appear precisely the same as in the original perception, only less distinct*. For example, having seen yesterday a sensible spreading oak growing on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a> of a river, and objects when having heard a shepherd play, and handled a square stone, we endeavour to recall to our mind these objects of memory, which are now absent. How is this operation performed? Do we endeavour to form in our minds pictures or representative images? or, does our intellect survey the types or forms which, according to Aristotle, those objects left in the imagination when originally perceived? Neither of these things is done. We conceive ourselves as standing in the same place where we stood yesterday; upon which we have perceptions of the objects similar in all respects to the perceptions which we had when we employed our eyes, our ears, and our hands. The tree appears, as it were, before us; faint indeed, but attended with all the objects which we observed around it yesterday: we seem to hear the sound of the pipe confusedly, and at a distance; to move our hands over the stone, and to feel the same surfaces and the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> which we felt in the original perception. In this recollection we are not conscious of pictures or images more than in the original survey. The perceptions seem to be of the tree and river themselves, of the sound itself, and of the stone itself, exactly as at the first; and yet we are satisfied that in the act of remembrance we perceive no such object as a real tree, pipe, or stone. That these are facts, every man must be convinced who attends to the energies of his own mind when exerting the powers of retention: and therefore it is, in our opinion, with no impropriety that Mr Harris says, we may call sense, if we please, a kind of transient imagination; and imagination, on the contrary, a kind of permanent sense; for if these two faculties, as far as the mind or intellect is concerned, be not the same, they seem to resemble each other much.\n\n2. The primary perception of a visible object is more complete, lively, and distinct, and remains longer in the sensorium than that of any other object. We longest in know likewise by experience, that an idea or secondary perception of a visible object is as much more complete, lively, and distinct, than the idea of any other object, as was the primary perception; and that we remember things which we have seen for a longer time than sounds which we have heard, or than tangible objects which we have only handled. Yet there seems to be a constant decay of all our ideas, even of those which are struck (G) deepest and in minds the most retentive; so that if they be not frequently renewed by repeated exercise of the senses, or by reflection on those objects which at first occasioned them, the print (G) wears out,\n\n(g) These expressions, which mention ideas as things which are deep struck, and as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINTS\">prints</a> which wear out, are the expressions of Locke. We hope it is needless to warn our readers, that they are used by us, as they were by him, in a metaphorical sense. On these subjects it is impossible to write without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METAPHOR\">metaphor</a>; which, while the meaning is obvious, no man will condemn, who reflects that the words of language were not invented by metaphysicians, and are for the most part literally significant only of sensible objects.\nRetention out, and at last there remains nothing to be seen.\n\nConcerning ideas, it is easy to remark, that those remain longest and clearest in the memory which are derived from two or more senses, especially if the sense of sight be one of the number, or which are oftenest refreshed by a return of the objects which produced them. Hence a man has a longer and more distinct remembrance of what he has seen than of what he has only heard, of what he has both seen and felt than of what he has only seen; and the ideas which we have of heat and cold, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUNGER\">hunger</a> and thirst, and of all those things which most frequently affect our senses, are extremely clear, and are never quite lost whilst the mind retains any ideas at all.\n\nMemory appears to be a kind of habit, which is not always in exercise with regard to things we remember, but is ready to suggest them when there is occasion. The most perfect degree of this habit is, when the thing presents itself to our remembrance spontaneously, and without labour, as often as there is occasion. A second degree is, when the thing is forgotten for a longer or shorter time, even when there is occasion to remember it, and yet at last some incident, such as a violent passion*, which agitates the whole mind and sensorium, tumbles the idea, as it were, out of its dark corner, and brings it into view without any search. A third degree is, when we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> about and search for what we would remember, and after some labour find it out. This searching faculty of the soul is by Aristotle called *anamnesis*, by Dr Reid and others *reminiscence*, and by Mr Harris *recollection*. Should it be said, that what we will to remember we must already conceive, as we can will nothing of which we have not a conception; and that, therefore, a will to remember a thing, seems to imply that we remember it already\u2014we answer, with Dr Reid, that when we will to remember a thing, we must indeed remember something relating to it; but we may have no positive idea or conception of the thing itself, but only of the relation which it bears to that other thing which we do remember. Thus, one remembers that a friend <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> him with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> to be executed at such a place, but he has forgotten what the commission was. He applies himself to discover it; and recollects that it was given by such a person, upon such an occasion, in consequence of such a conversation: and thus by a train of thought he is led to the very thing which he had forgotten and wished to remember. To this operation it is not always necessary that the relations between the various ideas which the mind turns over be very close, or have their foundation in nature; for a casual connexion is often sufficient. Thus, from seeing a garment, we think of its owner; thence of his habitation; thence of woods; thence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a>; thence of ships; thence of admirals; thence of cannons, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, furnaces, and forges,* &c.\n\nThat, in the process of recollection, one idea should suggest another, may be easily accounted for. When, in perception, our minds are exposed to the influence of external objects, all the parts and properties, and even the accidental variable adjuncts of these objects, are perceived by full-grown men at the same time; so that the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROUP\">group</a> makes but one impression upon our organs of sense, and consequently upon the mind.\n\nBy these means all the parts of the simultaneous impression*, and consequently of the perception occasioned by that impression, are so intimately associated or linked together, that the idea of any one of them recurring at any future period, generally introduces the ideas of all the rest. But as the necessary parts and properties of any thing are more closely linked together, and occur more frequently than any particular variable adjuncts, it is obvious, that by the idea of any one of these properties, the idea of the rest, and of the object itself, will be more readily introduced than by the idea of any variable adjunct. It seems, however, to be certain, that we have no power of calling up any idea at pleasure, but only such as have a connexion, either in nature or by means of former associations, with those that are at any time present to the mind. Thus the sight, or the idea, of any particular person, generally enables us to recollect his name, because his name and his person have been constantly associated together. If that fail to introduce the name, we are at a loss and cannot recollect it at all till some other associated circumstance help us. In naming a number of words in a sentence, or lines in a poem, the end of each preceding word or line being connected with the beginning of the word or line which succeeds it, we can easily repeat them in that order; but we are not able to repeat them backwards with any ease, nor at all till after many fruitless efforts. By frequent trials, however, we acquire at last a facility in doing it, as may be found by making the experiment on the names of number from one to twenty. It is indeed, probable, that in the wildest flights of fancy, no single idea occurs to us but such as had a connexion with some other idea, perception, or notion, previously existing in the mind, as shall be shown more fully in a subsequent chapter.\n\nMemory appears to depend entirely or chiefly upon the state of the brain\u2020. For diseases, concussions of the brain, spirituous liquors, and some poisons, impair or destroy it; and it generally returns again with the return of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, from the use of proper medicines and methods. It is observable, too, that in recovering from concussions and other disorders of the brain, it is usual for the person to recover the power of remembering the then present common incidents for minutes, hours, and days, by degrees; also the power of recalling the events of his life preceding his illness. At length he recovers this last power perfectly; and at the same time forgets almost all that past in his illness, even those things which at first he remembered for a day or two. Now the reason of this seems to be, that upon a perfect recovery the brain recovers its natural state, and all its former affections and tendencies; but that such affections or tendencies as took place during the preternatural state, i.e. during the patient's illness, are obliterated by the return of the natural state.*\n\nAll this we are induced to believe; because, though it is a fact incontrovertible, that in certain diseases the memory is impaired, and recovers its vigour with the return of health, it is not conceivable that the mind itself should suffer any change by diseases, concussions, or spirituous liquors, &c.\n\nFrom these facts we are strongly inclined to conclude,\ntheir brain is too moist and soft to retain impressions made upon it; and that he was likewise in the right, and Ideas when he imputed the defect of memory in old men to the hardness and rigidity of the brain, which hinders it from receiving any durable impression.\n\nAnother argument to prove, that in remembrance the mind acts upon something left in the brain by the impressions of sense, is this, that nothing can act but where it is present. The truth of this axiom is acknowledged by Dr Reid, and we believe by all mankind except Dr Priestley and one or two others, whose paradoxes we shall consider afterwards. Now it is confessed, that in recollection at least the mind is active; and therefore it must act, not upon an object which has now perhaps no existence, and certainly no immediate existence, but upon something left by that object in the brain or sensorium, to which the mind is intimately present.\n\nBut if this be so, we may be asked how it comes by what pass that men never confound memory with perception, nor fancy that they perceive things which they only remember? If perception be an inference drawn from certain sensations excited by an impression on the brain, and if remembrance result from the mind's operating upon relicts of those impressions, one would think it natural to suppose, that in both cases we have actual perceptions, though in the one case the perception must be more vivid and distinct than in the other. To this we answer, That previous to all experience, perception and memory are very probably confounded; and that we believe a man brought into the world with all his faculties in their full natural perfection, would not instantly be able to distinguish what he remembered from what he perceived. This we know to be the case with respect to imagination, a faculty which strongly resembles memory; for in dreams, and sometimes even in waking reveries, we fancy actually that we perceive things which it is certain we can only imagine. A very short experience, however, would enable this newly created man to make the proper distinction between remembrance and perception. For let us suppose him to be brought into a dark room, and soon afterwards a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a> to be introduced. The candle would give him a visible sensation, though not at first the perception of an external object. Let the candle after some time be carried out: the man would retain a visible idea, which he might confound with the actual sensation. But if, whilst this idea remained in his mind, the candle were brought back, he would instantly feel a difference between the real sensation and the idea, when both were together present in his mind. And having, in some such manner as we have already described, acquired the power of perceiving external objects by means of his senses, he would soon discover, without any effort of his own, the difference between actual perceptions and the ideas treasured up in his memory.\n\n(H) Through the whole of this and the preceding chapters, we have taken it for granted, that the sentient principle in man is not material. This is the common, and, as shall be shown afterwards, the most probable opinion: but whether it be absolutely certain or not, makes no difference on the theories of sensation and perception. These are obviously neither figure nor motion, and therefore not subject to the laws which govern the material world.\nThe only remaining difficulty which seems to encumber this theory of remembrance, is, to account for the order of succession in which objects recur to the memory, and to which we give the name of time.\u2014But this difficulty will vanish when we have ascertained what time is. At present it is sufficient to observe, that our perceptions of external objects remain a certain space of time in the mind; that this time is different, according to the strength and other circumstances of the impression which occasioned the perception; and that traces of those perceptions, i.e. ideas, may be recalled after the intervention of other trains of ideas, and at very different intervals. If one look upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, and then shut his eyes, the impression which it made upon his mind will not instantly vanish: he can contemplate the house almost as long as he pleases; and, by the help of various associated circumstances, he may recall the idea several years afterwards, and refer it to the original perception.\n\nBefore we dismiss the subject of retention, it may not be improper to take notice of the retentive powers of inferior animals. Aristotle, Locke, Dr Reid, and almost every philosopher of eminence both among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> and moderns, have maintained, that inferior animals have memory as well as men; and indeed we do not perceive how the fact can be denied of the more perfect animals, and those with whose operations we are best acquainted. A dog knows his master again after a long absence; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> will trace back a road which he has but once travelled, often with more accuracy than his rider; and it is well known that many species of singing birds have a capacity to learn tunes from the human voice, and that they repeat the notes again and again, approaching nearer and nearer to perfection, till at last they sing the tune correctly. These phenomena can be accounted for only by supposing, that in the brains of the several animals traces are left by perception, of the same kind with those which perception leaves in the brain of man, and which are the cause or occasion of his remembrance. With respect to this point, the learned author of Ancient Metaphysics differs from his master Aristotle. He allows that brutes have imagination, but denies that they have memory: for (says he) \"memory necessarily implies a sense of time, and what is first and last; but brutes have no idea of time, or of first and last; and it is certain that they have not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSCIOUSNESS\">consciousness</a> or reflection, by which only they could review their own operations. At the same time he admits, that imagination in the brute serves the purpose of memory in us; for whenever he sees the object that is painted on his phantasia, he knows it again, but without any perception of the time when he first saw it.\" But that a brute, when he sees the object which is painted on his phantasia, should know it again without referring it to a former perception, is plainly impossible. The recognition of any thing consists in a consciousness of its having been perceived before; and nothing more than such recognition is essential to memory. The author's mistake seems to lie in supposing that memory necessarily implies a sense of some determinate portion of past time; but we surely remember many things of which we can only say that we have formerly perceived them, without being able to ascertain the precise period at which we had such perceptions.\n\nA child has the use of memory sooner than he acquires the faculty of speech; but he must have spoken and thought even reasoned before he can have an accurate notion of time, which, as shall be shown afterwards, arises from comparing the fleeting succession of our own ideas with the permanence of ourselves and other objects. The author's distinction between memory and imagination seems to be on all accounts improper. Aristotle has said, and said truly, that there is memory of ideas as well as of sensible objects; meaning by ideas general conceptions or propositions: but this reviver of his philosophy is inclined to say, \"that memory is only of ideas, consequently belongs only to man: and that imagination is only of sensible objects, and consequently belongs both to man and brute.\"\u2014But surely man remembers what he has seen and felt as well as what he has conceived or thought; and if imagination and memory be properly distinguished by Mr Harris, the reverse of this writer's doctrine must be true, viz. that imagination belongs only to man, and memory of sensible objects both to man and brute.\u2014We can contemplate in imagination the idea of a centaur or of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> mountain; but we cannot be said to remember them, for they were never perceived. That a dog can contemplate in his imagination the idea of a centaur or of a golden mountain, we have not the least reason to suppose; but were he not capable of viewing relics of sense reposed with him, and referring them to their original causes, he could not possibly recognise his master after a day's absence.\n\nDr Reid and the same author agree with Aristotle, in thinking it probable that brutes have not reminiscence, or the power of recollection; but there are many well-attested facts which seem to prove the contrary. We shall mention one which fell under our own observation. One of the persons concerned in this work was, when a young man, absent for five months from the house of his father. Upon his return, a dog of that species which is commonly called the shepherd's cur, and which had been in the possession of his father only a few months before his departure, gazed at him for a few minutes as at any other stranger. The animal then began to walk round him with looks which soon attracted his notice. This made him call the dog by the name which he bore in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, and stretch out his hand to caress him, when the creature instantly leaped upon him with all that appearance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> which these animals so commonly exhibit upon the return of their master after a few days absence. If this was not recollection, we should be glad to know what it was, for we cannot distinguish it from recollection in men. Indeed, if dogs and some other animals possess, as Aristotle, Locke, and others, allow them to possess, the power of memory, and something of ratiocination; and if, as Dr Reid expressly says*, \"we expect events in the same order and succession in which they happened before; it is not conceivable that they can be wholly destitute of reminiscence, or the power of recollection.\"\n\nThat memory is a faculty of the first importance, cannot be denied; since it is obvious, that, without the power of retaining the ideas and notions which we receive by the senses and other faculties, we never could make any progress in the acquisition of knowledge, but should begin every day, nay every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>, in the same\nCHAP. III. Of Simple Apprehension and Conception.\n\nThe ideas received into the mind by the senses, and treasured up in the memory and imagination, are the original materials of human knowledge. It is by comparing those ideas with one another, or by analyzing them into their first principles, that we acquire all our knowledge in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a> and philosophy, and indeed all the knowledge which regulates our conduct through life. It must, therefore, be of importance to trace the progress of the mind in her various operations upon these materials; beginning, as she certainly begins, with that which is most simple, and proceeding regularly to those which are more complex and difficult.\n\nNow the first operation of the mind about her ideas appears plainly to be that which logicians term simple apprehension. Having yesterday observed a tree or any other object, if we contemplate the idea of that tree to-day as it remains in the imagination, without comparing it with any other idea, or referring it to any external object, we perform the operation which is called simple apprehension. We consider simple apprehension as an operation, because the mind in the apprehension of her own ideas is certainly active; she turns them, as it were, round and round, and views them on every side.\n\nSimple apprehension is a phrase which is commonly taken to be of the same import with the word conception; and in the ordinary affairs of life no confusion can arise from an indiscriminate use of the two words; but in this article we think it expedient to employ the phrase simple apprehension, to denote the view or contemplation of those ideas only which the mind by sensation has actually received from external objects; and the word conception to denote the view, not only of those ideas, but also of such as the mind fabricates to herself. Thus, a man may conceive a centaur, but we would not choose to say that he may apprehend a centaur: not that there is any impropriety, perhaps, in this last expression; but as there is certainly a difference between apprehending the idea of what has been seen or felt, and conceiving that which never existed, perspicuity requires that these different operations be expressed by different names.\n\nWe have said, that the mind may conceive what never existed: and every man may easily satisfy himself that what we have said is true; but though this has been frequently called the creative power of the mind, it has in fact no resemblance to creation. The materials of all our most complex and fantastic conceptions are furnished to our hands by sensation and reflection; nor can we form one simple idea which was not originally received by some of our senses from external objects, or, as shall be shown afterwards, one intellectual notion which was not acquired by reflecting on the operations of our own minds. To explain the process of fantastic conception, it is to be observed, that in every sensible object we perceive at once several things, such as colour, figure, extension and motion or rest, &c. These are the objects of different senses: but they are not, at least by full-grown men, perceived in succession, but all at once; whence it comes to pass that the memory, or the imagination, retains not several distinct and disjointed ideas, but the idea of one coloured, figured, and extended object. But when we compare various objects, or the ideas of various objects, together, we find that in some respects they agree and in others disagree; i.e., that several objects affect some of our senses in the same way, and other senses differently. Thus one globe is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>, and another white; one black substance is circular and hard, and another square and soft. In the first instance, the two globes affect our sense of touch in the same way, and our sense of seeing differently; in the second, the two black substances affect our sense of sight in the same way, and our sense of touch differently.","sp":605,"ep":629},{"h":"METAPLASMUS","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAMMAR\">Grammar</a>, a transmutation\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> change made in a word, by adding, retrenching, or\naltering a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYLLABLE\">syllable</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> thereof.","sp":735,"ep":735},{"h":"METAPONTUM","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> METAFONTIUM, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">Ancient</a>\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">Geography</a>, a town of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUCANIA\">Lucania</a>, on the Sinus Tarenti-\nnus; to the west of Tarentum; built by the Pylians\nwho returned from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TROY\">Troy</a>; and where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYTHAGORAS\">Pythagoras</a> is said\nto have taught in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of Servins Tullius. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-META\">Meta</a>-\npontini, the people; who pretended to show in a temple\nof <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINERVA\">Minerva</a>, the tools with which Epeus built the wooden\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>, (Justin).

The parching <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> is never felt; the thick <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a> of trees, and thousands of crystal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a> which everywhere arise and form themselves into unnumbered rivulets, joined to the refreshing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> breeze, the constant corrective and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a> of noontide heat, qualify the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, and render the year a never-ending May. The houses are constructed in such a manner as to have the best view of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> beauties. Each is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> tower neatly built of hewn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> as to overtop the trees, and to command a view of the sea and neighbouring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>. The lower stories are granaries and storehouses; and the habitable apartments are all at the top, to which you ascend by a stone stair, built for the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> on the outside, and surrounding the tower; so that from the apartment the trees are overlooked, and the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> is seen; while the habitations themselves, which are very numerous, peering above the groves, add <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> and variety to the enchanting prospect, and give an air of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> to these woodlands, which might otherwise be supposed the region of Dryads, of Naiads, and of Satyrs.\"\n\nThe most remarkable thing, however, in this island is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> by which the women have here openly usurped those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> of sovereignty which in other countries...\ncountries are supposed to belong essentially to the men.\n\n\"Contrary (says his lordship) to the usage of all other countries, the eldest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> here inherits; and the sons, like daughters everywhere else, are portioned off with small dowers, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a>, which is still worse, turned out penniless to seek their fortune. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> have two daughters, the eldest, at her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a>, is entitled to all her mother's possessions, which are by far the greater part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> estate, as the mother, keeping up her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PREROGATIVE\">prerogative</a>, never parts with the power over any portion of what she has brought into the family, until she is forced into it by the marriage of her daughter; and the father also is compelled to ruin himself by adding whatever he may have scraped together by his industry. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> daughter inherits nothing, and is condemned to perpetual celibacy. She is styled a calogria, which signifies properly a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> woman or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUN\">nun</a>, and is in effect a menial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a> to her sister, being employed by her in any office she may think fit to impose, frequently serving her as waiting-maid, as cook, and often in employments still more degrading. She wears a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> peculiar to her situation, which she can never change; a sort of monastic dress, coarse, and of a dark <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a>. One advantage, however, she enjoys over her sister, that whereas the elder, before marriage, is never allowed to go abroad, or to see any man, her nearest relations only excepted, the calogria, except when employed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> toil, is in this respect at perfect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>. But when the sister is married, the situation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> calogria becomes desperate indeed, and is rendered still more humiliating by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> between her condition and that of her happy mistress. The married sister enjoys every sort of liberty; the whole family fortune is hers, and she spends it as she pleases; her husband is her obsequious servant, her father and mother are dependent upon her, she dresses in a most magnificent manner, covered all over, according to the fashion of the island, with pearls and with pieces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>, which are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> sequins; thus continually carrying about her the enviable marks of affluence and superiority, while the wretched calogria follows her as a servant, arrayed in simple homespun brown, and without the most distant hope of ever changing her condition. Such a disparity may seem intolerable, but what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not custom reconcile? Neither are the misfortunes of the family yet at an end. The father and mother, with what little is left them, contrive by their industry to accumulate a second little fortune; and this, if they should have a third daughter, they are obliged to give to her upon her marriage; and the fourth, if there should be one, becomes her calogria, and so on through all the daughters alternately. Whenever the daughter is marriageable, she can by custom compel the father to procure her a husband; and the mother, such is the power of habit, is foolish enough to join her in teasing him into an immediate compliance, though its consequences must be equally fatal and ruinous to both of them. From hence it happens, that nothing is more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> than to see the old father and mother reduced to the utmost indigence, and even begging about the streets, while their unnatural daughters are in affluence; and we ourselves have frequently been shown the eldest daughter parading it through the town in the greatest splendour, while her mother and sister followed her as servants, and made a melancholy part of her attendant train.\n\n\"The sons, as soon as they are of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> a livelihood, are turned out of the family, sometimes with a small present or portion, but more frequently without any thing to support them; and thus reduced, they either endeavour to live by their labour, or, which is more usual, go on board some trading vessel as sailors or as servants, remaining abroad till they have got together some competency, and then return home to marry and to be henepecked. Some few there are who, taking advantage of the Turkish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> through this whimsical custom, who marry their calogrias, and retain to themselves a competent provision: but these are accounted men of a singular and even criminal disposition, and are hated and despised as conformists to Turkish manners, and deserters of their native customs; so that we may suppose they are few indeed who have the boldness to depart from the manners of their country to adopt the customs of their detested masters, and to brave the contempt, the derision, and the hatred, of their neighbours and fellow-citizens.\n\n\"Of all these extraordinary particulars I was informed by the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSUL\">consul</a>, a man of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> and of indisputable veracity, who had resided in this island for several years, and who solemnly assured me that every circumstance was true: but indeed our own observation left us without the least room for doubt, and the singular appearance and deportment of the ladies fully evinced the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of our friend's relation. In walking through the town, it is easy to perceive, from the whimsical manners of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> passengers, that the women, according to the vulgar phrase, wear the breeches. They frequently stopped us in the streets, examined our dress, interrogated us with a bold and manly air, laughed at our foreign garb and appearance; and showed so little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to that decent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a> which is or ought to be the true characteristic of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEX\">sex</a>, that there is every reason to suppose they would, in spite of their haughtiness, be the kindest ladies upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, if they were not strictly watched by the Turks, who are here very numerous, and would be ready to punish any transgression of their ungallant laws with arbitrary fines. But <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> and native manners will often baffle the efforts even of tyranny. In all their customs these manly ladies seem to have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> sexes with the men. The woman rides astride, the man sits sideways upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>; nay, I have been assured that the husband's distinguishing appellation is his wife's family name. The women have town and country houses, in the management of which the husband never <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DARES\">dares</a> interfere. Their gardens, their servants, are all their own; and the husband, from every circumstance of his behaviour, appears to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> other than his wife's first domestic, perpetually bound to her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>, and slave to her caprice. Hence it is that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a> obtains in the country, that this island was formerly inhabited by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMAZONS\">Amazons</a>; a tradition, however, founded upon no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> that I know of. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAPPHO\">Sappho</a> indeed, the most renowned female that this island has ever produced, is said to have had manly inclinations; in which, as Lucian informs us, she did but conform with the singular manners of her countrywomen: but I do not find that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> in which she\nshe chose to show these inclinations is imitated by the present female inhabitants, who seem perfectly content with the dear prerogative of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> sway, without endeavouring in any other particular to change the course of nature; yet will this circumstance serve to show, that the women of Lesbos had always something peculiar, and even peculiarly masculine, in their manners and propensities. But be this as it may, it is certain that no country whatsoever can afford a more perfect idea of an Amazonian commonwealth, or better serve to render probable those ancient relations which our manners would induce us to esteem incredible, than this island of Metelin. These lordly ladies are for the most part very handsome in spite of their dress, which is singular and disadvantageous. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">Down</a> to the girdle, which as in the old Grecian garb is raised far above what we usually call the waist, they wear nothing but a shift of thin and transparent guaze, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>, green, or brown, through which every thing is visible, their breasts only excepted, which they cover with a sort of handkerchief; and this, as we are informed, the Turks have obliged them to wear, while they look upon it as an encumbrance, and as no inconsiderable portion of Turkish tyranny. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">Long</a> sleeves of the same thin material perfectly show their arms even to the shoulder. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> ornaments are chains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEARL\">pearl</a>, to which they hang small pieces of gold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COIN\">coin</a>. Their eyes are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> and fine; and the nose, which we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> Grecian, usually prevails among them, as it does indeed among the women of all these islands. Their complexions are naturally fine; but they spoil them by paint, of which they make abundant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>; and they disfigure their pretty faces by shaving the hinder part of the eyebrow, and replacing it with a straight line of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> neatly applied with some sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUM\">gum</a>, the brow being thus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> in a straight and narrow line till it joins the hair on each side of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a>. They are well made, of the middle size, and for the most part plump; but they are distinguished by nothing so much and so universally as by a haughty, disdainful, and supercilious air, with which they seem to look down upon all mankind as creatures of an inferior nature, born for their service, and doomed to be their slaves; neither does this peculiarity of countenance in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> diminish their natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>, but rather adds to it that sort of bewitching <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> which the French call *piquant.*\n\nHis lordship has been at great pains to investigate the origin of such a singular custom; but is unable to find any other example in history than that of the Lycians, who called themselves by the names of their mothers, and not of their fathers. When asked by their neighbours who they were? they described themselves by their maternal genealogy. If a gentlewoman should marry a slave, the children by that marriage were accounted noble; but should the first man among them marry a foreign woman, the children would be accounted ignoble. This custom is mentioned by several ancient authors. A difficulty of no little magnitude occurs, however, in accounting for the derivation of the inhabitants of Lesbos from the Lycians. This is solved in the following manner: In times of the most remote antiquity, the island of Lesbos was peopled by the Pelasgi, who, under their leader Xanthus, the son of Triopas <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARGOS\">Argos</a>, first inhabited Lesbos; previous to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> they had dwelt in a certain part of Lycia which they had conquered; and in this country we may suppose they had learned the custom in question.","sp":736,"ep":738},{"h":"METELLUS","t":"the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SURNAME\">surname</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> of the C\u00e6cili\u00e6 at Rome, the most known of whom were\u2014A general who defeated the Ach\u00e6ans, took Thebes and invaded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACEDONIA\">Macedonia</a>, &c.\u2014Q.

Lucan treats this doctrine as a kind of officious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIE\">lie</a>, contrived to mitigate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> of death, by persuading men that they only changed their lodging, and only ceased to live to begin a new life.\n\nRencllin denies this doctrine; and maintains that the metempsychosis of Pythagoras implied nothing more than a similitude of manners, desires, and studies, formerly existing in some person deceased, and now revived in another alive. Thus when it was said that Euphorbus was revived in Pythagoras, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> more was meant than that the martial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> which had shone in Euphorbus at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of the Trojan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, was now, in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, revived in Pythagoras, by reason of the great respect he bore the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol2.html#article-ATHLETE\">athlete</a>. For those people wondering how a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> should be so much taken with men of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>, he palliated the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, by saying, that the soul of Euphorbus, i.e., his genius, disposition, and inclinations, were revived in him. And this gave occasion to the report, that Euphorbus's soul, who perished in the Trojan war, had transmigrated into Pythagoras.\n\nFicinus asserts, that what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a> speaks of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MIGRATION\">migration</a> of a human soul into a brute, is intended allegorically, and is to be understood only of the manners, affections, and habits, degenerated into a beastly nature by vice. Serranus, though he allows some force to this interpretation, yet inclines rather to understand the metempsychosis of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESURRECTION\">resurrection</a>.\n\nPythagoras is said to have borrowed the notion of a metempsychosis from the Egyptians; others say, from the ancient Brahmans.

When there is a metempsosis without a proempsosis, the next following or lower index must be taken. 2. When there is a proempsosis without a metempsosis, the next preceding or superior index is to be taken. 3. When there are both a metempsosis and a proempsosis, or when there is neither the one nor the other, the same index is preserved. Thus, in 1600, we had D: in 1700, by reason of the metempsosis, C was taken: in 1800, there was both a proempsosis, and a metempsosis; so the same index was retained. In 1900, there will be a metempsosis again, when B will be taken: which will be preserved in 2000, because there will then be neither the one nor the other.

With due deference, however, to some philosophers of name, we are not prepared to assert, that it implies impossibility.

At all events, the same Being who called into existence those sublime and countless masses of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> which revolve in space, may, to serve purposes unknown to us, create bodies of dimensions infinitely smaller, and destined to impinge on some planetary orb. The reasoning of an angel may not convince us, that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> is greater than the whole, or that the value of two and two is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to six; but a very ordinary logician may prove to our satisfaction, that the contact of particles of matter in portions of space which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> beyond our globe, is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> chimerical supposition. Every thing around us proclaims, that matter is subject to incessant change. New forms and new modifications are ever springing into being: and can we doubt, that the same particles, as they may happen to be affected or influenced by various circumstances, may exist in the state of gas, of aqueous vapour, or of a concrete <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>?\nAgain, it surely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not be seriously maintained, that, from the rarity of a phenomenon, we are warranted to infer its non-existence. The appearance of a comet is a rare, but not a fictitious, occurrence. Nay, we may safely advance a step farther, and assert, without fear of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a>, that the existence of a phenomenon, if otherwise well attested, cannot be disproved by our inability to explain it. How multiplied, in fact, are the subjects, even of our daily and hourly observation, which we cannot satisfactorily expound? We cannot say why a small seed should gradually unfold into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> tree, why <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> should produce <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, why the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> in immediate subserviency to the will, or why a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTUSION\">contusion</a> of the brain should induce stupor, alienation of mind, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. It is one thing to prove a fact, and it is another to account for it.\n\nFrom these premises it follows in course, that we are not entitled to reject the existence of meteoric <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, provided it be established by valid testimony. Should the historical evidence, on a fair and dispassionate review, be deemed conclusive, we may afterwards examine the theories which have been proposed for the solution of the appearance.\n\nFrom the Scriptures of the Old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a> we are not aware that any passage can be cited in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> corroboration of the descent of stones from the atmosphere. The ingenious and fanciful Mr Edward <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">King</a>, indeed, in his \"Remarks concerning stones said to have fallen from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">clouds</a>, both in these days, and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> times,\" adverts to the 13th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSE\">verse</a> of the 18th Psalm.\u2014\"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> also thundered out of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>, and the Highest gave his thunder: hail-stones and coals of fire.\" This last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> has, no doubt, been conjectured to denote real hard bodies, in a state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IGNITION\">ignition</a>; and the term \u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u03b3\u03b3\u03b1, employed by the cautious Seventy, rather favours such an interpretation. The same expression, however, occurs in the preceding verse, without admitting this interpretation; and the phrase seems to be only a figurative <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of describing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a>. In the sober latitudes of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>, and even in colloquial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, we talk of balls of fire and thunderbolts, without any reference to solid matter. Mr King likewise quotes the 11th verse of the 10th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> of Joshua.\u2014\"And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were in the going <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to Beth-horon, that the Lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: there were more which died with hail-stones, than they whom the children of Israel slew with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>.\" Here, the expression, great stones is less equivocal than coals of fire; yet the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTEXT\">context</a> hardly allows us to doubt, that the great stones were really hail-stones, or rather, perhaps, lumps of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ICE\">ice</a>, consolidated in the atmosphere, such as occasionally fall in hot countries, and such as alarmed the whole of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> and its neighbourhood in 1788. At any rate, the slaughter of the Canaanites is represented as resulting from the special interposition of divine power; and the consideration of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MIRACLES\">miracles</a> is irrelevant to our present purpose.\n\nIf from sacred, we turn to the early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of profane <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, we shall find the annals of public events very copiously interspersed with notices of strange appearances, many of which may be safely ascribed to the ascendancy which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> obtained over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> mind. The scepticism of the learned is, however, sometimes not less injudicious and indiscriminate than the credulity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a>; and he who should resolve every extraordinary event, which is recorded by the writers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a> and Rome, into a \"cunningly devised <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FABLE\">fable</a>,\" would not be less reprehensible for want of candour, than the untutored rustic, who yields his assent to every alleged miracle, is to be taxed with want of discernment.\n\nAlthough these general positions can scarcely admit of dispute, it becomes extremely difficult, after a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAPSE\">lapse</a> of many ages, and in the collation of marvellous records, to separate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> from falsehood. In our attempts to prosecute this analytical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a>, we may sometimes advance a certain length with perfect security, without being able to trace uniformly the precise <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> of demarcation. Thus, in regard to the topic of our present discussion, we know, that in various periods of the world the vulgar have ascribed a celestial origin to stones of a peculiar configuration, as to certain modifications of pyrites, to telemmites, orthoceratites, &c. which the subsequent observations of naturalists have proved to be of mineral formation, and to the heads of arrows and sharpened flints, which have been fashioned by the hand of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, and which, accordingly, we are authorized to exclude from the ex-terrestrial catalogue. But when substances dissimilar from these, and coinciding in any one character or circumstance with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> specimens of atmospheric stone, are reported by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> to have fallen from the clouds, the distance of ages and the lameness of the documents may powerfully affect our appreciation of the reputed evidence.\n\nWhen, therefore, we shortly touch on a few of the many instances which might be quoted from the annals of antiquity, we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> not to vouch for the truth even of these particular instances; but merely to admit their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> which the mention of them may be considered to add to that of subsequent and recent narrations.\n\nThrough the midst of fable which envelopes the history of the betuli, we discern some characters which correspond with those of meteorolites. Thus, in the \u0394\u03b9\u03ac\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2, a poem falsely ascribed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORPHEUS\">Orpheus</a>, the \u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u03b3\u03b3\u03b1, which M. Falconet properly classes with the betuli, is said to be rough, heavy, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>. Damascus, in an extract of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> of Isidorus, preserved by Photius, relates that the betuli fell on Mount Libanus, in a globe of fire. A fragment of Sanchoniathon, preserved in Eusebius, (Prepar. Evangel. i. 10.), moreover informs us, that these stones were fabricated by the god <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-URANUS\">Uranus</a> (or Heaven), one of whose four sons was named Betul. May not this mythological genealogy be regarded as merely emblematical of their descent from the upper regions of the atmosphere? In the same chapter we are told that Astarte found a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAR\">star</a> which had fallen from heaven, and honoured it with consecration in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRE\">Tyre</a>. The stone denominated \"the mother of the gods,\" if we can believe Appian, Herodian, and Marcellinus, fell from heaven. Aristodemus, cited by the Greek scholiast on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PINDAR\">Pindar</a>, asserts that it fell encircled by fire, on a hill, at the feet of the Theban bard. It is said to have been of a black <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, and of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> shape. Herodian (lib. vi.) expressly declares, that the Phoenicians had no statue of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, polished by the hand; but only a certain stone, circular below, and terminated\nterminated acutely above, in the form of a cone, of a black colour, and that, according to report, it fell from heaven, and was regarded as the image of the sun.\n\nAmong various instances which might be selected from Livy, is that of a shower of stones on Mount <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALBA\">Alba</a>, in the reign of Tullus Hostilius, or about six hundred and fifty-two years before the birth of Christ. When the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a> were told, that it had rained stones, they doubted the fact, and deputed commissioners to inquire into the particulars. They were then assured, that stones had really fallen, haud aliter quam grandinem venti glomeratam in terras agitat. On this occasion, the historian mentions, that similar events were celebrated by a festival of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> days. Mansit solenne, ut quinquaginta idem prodigium nuntiaretur, feria per novem dies ageretur.\n\nBut one of the most remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> which occurs in the records of antiquity, is that which is mentioned in the 58th chapter of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> book of Pliny's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">Natural</a> History, of a large stone which fell near Egospotamos, in Thrace, in the second year of the seventy-eighth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OLYMPIAD\">Olympiad</a>, or, according to our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHRONOLOGY\">chronology</a>, about four hundred and sixty-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> years before the Christian era. Pliny assures us, that this extraordinary mass was still shown in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>; and that it was as large as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CART\">cart</a>, and of a burnt colour. The Greeks pretended that it had fallen from the sun, and that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANAXAGORAS\">Anaxagoras</a> had predicted the day of its arrival on the earth's surface. According to Plutarch, in the life of Lysander, the inhabitants of the Chersonesus held the Thracian stone in great veneration, and exhibited it as a public show. His account of its first appearance is chiefly extracted from the relation of Daimachus of Plat\u00e6\u00e6, and may be thus translated. \"During seventy-five successive days before the stone fell, a large fiery body, like a cloud of flame, was observed in the heavens, not fixed to one point, but wandering about with a broken irregular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>. By its violent agitation, several fiery fragments were forced from it, impelled in various directions, and darted with the velocity and brightness of so many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHOOTING\">shooting</a> stars. After this body had fallen on the Chersonesus, and the people had assembled to examine it, they could find no inflammable matter, nor the slightest trace of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMBUSTION\">combustion</a>, but a real stone, which, though large, by no means corresponded to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIMENSION\">dimension</a> of the flaming globe which they had seen in the sky, but seemed to be only a piece detached from it.\" Daimachus, it is true, may, on this occasion, have given way to his reputed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of the marvellous; and we can easily believe that the seventy-five continuous days are either an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> of the copyist, or an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> exaggeration; yet, from the marked coincidence of some of the circumstances with those more fully detailed in the sequel, there arises the presumption that a meteorite really fell at the place and period above assigned.\n\nFrom this period till near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of the fifteenth century, any historical notices which we have been enabled to collect, are so vague and scanty, that, in this abridged view of the subject, we may pass them over in silence.\n\nProfessor Bantenschoen, of the central school of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLMAR\">Colmar</a>, first directed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of naturalists to some of the old chronicles, which commemorate with much naivet\u00e9, and in the true spirit of the times, the fall of the celebrated stone of Ensisheim. The following account accompanied this very singular mass, when it was suspended in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>.\n\n\"In the year of the Lord 1492, on Wednesday, which was Martinmas <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-EVE\">eve</a>, the 7th of November, there happened a singular miracle: for, between eleven o'clock and noon, there was a loud peal of thunder, and a prolonged confused noise, which was heard to a great distance, and a stone fell from the air, in the jurisdiction of Ensisheim, which weighed 265 pounds, and the confused noise was, moreover, much louder than here. There a child <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> it strike on a field, situated in the upper jurisdiction, towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHINE\">Rhine</a> and Inn, near the district of Gisgard, which was sown with wheat, and did it no harm, except that it made a hole there; and then they conveyed it from that spot; and many pieces were broken from it, which the landvogt forbade. They, therefore, caused it to be placed in the church, with the intention of suspending it as a miracle; and many people came hither to see this stone. So there were remarkable conversations about this stone: but the learned said, that they knew not what it was; for it was beyond the ordinary course of nature, that such a large mass should smite the earth from the height of the air; but that it was really a miracle of God; for, before that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, never any thing was heard like it, nor seen, nor described. When the people found that stone, it had entered into the earth, to the depth of a man's stature, which every body explained to be the will of God, that it should be found, and the noise of it was heard at Lucerne, at Villing, and in many other places, so loud, that it was believed that houses had been overturned: And as the king (Maximilian) was here, the Monday after St Catherine's day, of the same year, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> excellence ordered the stone which had fallen to be brought to the castle, and after having conversed a long time about it with the noblemen, he said the people of Ensisheim should take it, and order it to be hung up in the church, and not allow any body to take any thing from it. However, his excellency took two pieces of it, of which he kept one, and sent the other to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> Sigismund of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUSTRIA\">Austria</a>: and they spoke a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> about this stone, which they suspended in the choir, where it still is; and a great many people came to see it.\"\n\nTrithemius, in his Hirsauensian Annals, employs language to this effect.\u2014\"In the same year, on the 7th day of November, in the village of Suntgaw, near the townlet of Ensisheim, not far from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BASIL\">Basil</a>, a city of Germany, a stone, called a thunder-stone, of a prodigious size, for we know from eye-witnesses that it weighed 255 pounds, fell from the heavens. Its fall was so violent, that it broke into two pieces. The most considerable is still exhibited at the door of the church of Ensisheim, suspended by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> chain, as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the fact which we have mentioned, and to preserve it in the public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOLLECTION\">recollection</a>.\"\u2014We learn also from Paul Lang that there arose a furious storm on the 7th of November 1492, and that while the thunder roared, and the heavens appeared all on fire, a stone of enormous size fell near Ensisheim. Its form was that of the Greek delta, with a triangular point. They still show it at Ensisheim as an astonishing phenomenon.\"\n\nIt is worthy of observation, that these chroniclers lived at the period which they assign to the descent of\nthe stone; and that, though their names are hastening to oblivion, Tritheimius yielded to few of his contemporaries in labour and learning; while Lang, a German Benedictine as he was, travelled in search of historical monuments, arraigned the license of the catholic clergy, and applauded the independence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUTHER\">Luther</a> and Melancthon.\n\nOf the Ensisheim stone, which has been transported to the national library at Colmar, and which, notwithstanding various dilapidations, stills weighs 150 pounds, some interesting specimens may now be seen in the cabinets of the curious. Robert Ferguson, Esq., younger of Raith, has, in the most polite and obliging manner, gratified us with the sight of a small fragment, which belongs to his valuable collection of minerals at Raith <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> in Fifehire, Scotland.\n\nWe are fully aware, that M. Barthold has laboured to convince his readers (Journal de Physique, Ventose, year 8.) that the far-famed mass of Ensisheim is merely argillo-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FERRUGINOUS\">ferruginous</a>, of secondary formation, detached from an adjacent mountain, and conveyed to the spot on which it was found by some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TORRENT\">torrent</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOD\">flood</a>. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, we might partially acquiesce, did not the artlessness of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">contemporary</a> and concurring records militate against it, and had not the more accurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a> of Vanquelin detected the same constituent parts as in the other stony and metallic substances denominated meteoric. \"It is certainly composed of silica,\" observes this celebrated chemist, \"of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNESIA\">magnesia</a>, of iron, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NICKEL\">nickel</a>, of sulphur, and of a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of lime.\u2014Particular trials have convinced me of the presence of sulphur and nickel in the grains of malleable iron, and in the pyrites, though in different proportions. This stone, then, in every respect, resembles others which have fallen from the atmosphere.\"\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMENTARY\">Commentary</a> of Surius, a Carthusian monk of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOGNE\">Cologne</a>, mention is made of a shower of large stones in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOMBARDY\">Lombardy</a>, in 1510. These stones were harder than flint, and smelled of sulphur. The heaviest weighed 120 pounds. The same event is more particularly related by Cardan, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> intitled de Rerum Varieitate (lib. xiv. c. 72.). According to this author, near the river Adda, not far from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILAN\">Milan</a>, and at five o'clock in the evening, about 1120 stones fell from the air, one of them weighing 120 pounds and another 60 pounds. Many were presented to the French governor, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEPUTY\">deputy</a>. At three o'clock P.M. the sky appeared as if in a general blaze; and the passage, though somewhat ambiguous, would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> us to infer, that the meteor was visible for two hours. Like many of the learned and unlearned of his day, Cardan instantly connects the extraordinary appearance with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> transactions of his district.\n\nWe next pass to an interesting extract from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMOIRS\">memoirs</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> Jehangire, written in Persian, by himself, and translated by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLONEL\">Colonel</a> Kirkpatrick.\n\n\"A.H. 1030, or 16th year of the reign.\u2014The following is among the extraordinary occurrences of this period.\n\nEarly on the 30th of Furverdeen of the present Metron year (1629), and in the eastern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of the heavens, there arose in one of the villages of the purgannah of Jalindher, such a great and tremendous noise, as had nearly, by its dreadful nature, deprived the inhabitants of the place of their senses. During this noise, a luminous body was observed to fall from above, on the earth, suggesting to the beholders the idea that the firmament was raining fire. In a short time, the noise having subsided, and the inhabitants having recovered from their alarm, a courier was dispatched to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAHOMMED\">Mahommed</a> Syeed, the amul of the aforesaid purgannah, to advertise him of this event. The amul, instantly mounting his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>, proceeded to the spot. Here he perceived the earth, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of a dozen of yards in length and breadth, to be burned to such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, that not the least trace of verdure, or a blade of grass remained; nor had the heat yet subsided entirely.\n\nMahommed Syeed hereupon directed the aforesaid space of ground to be dug up; when the deeper it was dug, the greater was the heat of it found to be. At length a lump of iron made its appearance, the heat of which was so violent, that one might have supposed it to have been taken from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FURNACE\">furnace</a>. After some time it became <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>; when the amul conveyed it to his own habitation, from whence he afterwards dispatched it in a sealed bag to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">court</a>.\n\nHere I had this substance weighed in my presence. Its weight was 160 talahs (A). I committed it to a skilful artisan, with orders to make of it a sabre, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a>, and a dagger. The workman reported, that the substance was not malleable, but shivered into pieces under the hammer.\n\nUpon this I ordered it to be mixed with other iron. Conformably to my orders, three parts of the iron of lightning (B) were mixed with one part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> iron; and from the mixture were made two sabres, one knife, and one dagger.\"\n\nOur limits will not permit us to give the whole of the extract, nor the remarks of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">Right</a> Hon. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> Greville and Colonel Kirkpatrick, which were read before the Royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, on the 27th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a>, 1803. We feel, however, no hesitation in attaching to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCUMENT\">document</a> something very nearly approaching to direct evidence of the fact in question.\n\nThe celebrated Gassendi relates, that, on the 27th of November, 1627, about 10 o'clock A.M. during a very clear sky, he saw a flaming stone, of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> diameter of four feet, fall on Mount Vasion, an eminence situated between the small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> of Perne and Guillaume, in Provence. This stone was surrounded by a luminous circle of different colours, nearly resembling the rainbow, and its fall was accompanied with a noise like the discharge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTILLERY\">artillery</a>. It weighed 59 pounds; and its specific gravity was to that of common marble as 14 to 11. It was of a dark metallic colour, and extremely hard. Though it was not subjected to chemical analysis, and is not now to be found, the circumstances which have been stated by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> are sufficiently\n\n(A) A talah is about 180 grains, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-TROY_WEIGHT\"><a class=\"x</a>ref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TROY\">Troy</a> weight.\n(B) This expression is equivalent to our term thunder-bolt.\nFrom a curious book printed at Paris in 1672, and now become very scarce, entitled Conversations tir\u00e9es de l'Acad\u00e9mie de M. l'Abb\u00e9 Bourdelet, contenant diverses recherches et observations physiques, par le Sieur Legallais, we make the ensuing extract.\n\n\"A member presents a fragment of two stones which fell near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERONA\">Verona</a>, one of which weighed 300, and the other 200 pounds. These stones,\" says he, \"fell during the night, when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> was perfectly mild and serene. They seemed to be all on fire, and came from above, but in a slanting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>, and with a tremendous noise. This prodigy terribly alarmed 300 or 400 eye-witnesses, who were at a loss what to think of it. These stones fell with such rapidity, that they formed a ditch, in which, after the noise had ceased, the spectators ventured to approach them, and examine them more closely. They then sent them to Verona, where they were deposited in the Academy, and that learned body sent fragments of them to different places.\"\n\nThat which accompanied the above intimation was of a yellowish hue, very easily pulverized, and smelled of sulphur.\u2014In the course of examining one of these stones, M. Laugier, professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHARMACY\">pharmacy</a> at Paris, has recently detected the presence of chrome, by means of the caustic alkali.\u2014The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a> of the Verona phenomenon, if we have been correctly informed, is 1663.\n\nIn the Borian collection there is a substance which is designated Ferrum retractorium, granulis nitentibus matrice viridesci immixtis (Ferrum viride Lin.), cujus fragmenta <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">ab</a> unius <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-AD\">ad</a> viginti usque librarum pondus, cortice nigro scoriaco circumdata, ad Plasen, prope Tabor, circuli Reichenensis Bohemiae, possim repertur. The following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> is subjoined: (Quae fragmenta 3 Juli anni 1753, inter tonitrua, &c. caelo pluvi\u00e6 creduliores quidam asservant). The expression creduliores quidam, it may be alleged, at once destroys the evidence of this memorandum. It deserves, however, to be noted, that, in regard to our present subject, what was formerly accounted the credulity of the vulgar, may now, on several occasions, be construed into probability, if not into matter of fact; and that Mr Greville has found the identical fragment to have the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> with other meteoric stones. Hence, we are compelled either to admit its extraterrestrial origin, or the existence of a substance, originally belonging to the earth, and yet agreeing in character with those deemed atmospheric. The former part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ALTERNATIVE\">alternative</a> is perfectly consonant with well-authenticated facts; whereas of the latter, we are not warranted to pronounce, that a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> has hitherto been established to the satisfaction of any chemist or mineralogist.\n\nBut we have now to turn our attention to a report of M. de la Lande, inserted in the Historical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALMANACK\">Almanack</a> of Bresse, for 1756.\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of September 1753, about one o'clock P.M., when the weather was very hot, and very serene, without the least appearance of a cloud, a very loud noise, like the discharge of two or three cannons, was heard within the circumference of six leagues, but was of very short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>. This noise was loudest in the neighbourhood of Pont-de-Veule; and at Liponas, a village three leagues from the last-mentioned place, it was even accompanied with a hissing, like that of a Meteora cracker. On the same evening there were found at Liponas and at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PIN\">Pin</a>, two blackish masses, of a form nearly circular, but very uneven, which had fallen on ploughed ground, and sunk, by their own weight, to half a foot below the surface. One of them weighed about twenty pounds; and a fragment of one of them weighing 14 lb. was preserved in the cabinet of M. Varenne de Boist, at Dijon. The basis of these masses resembled a greyish whinstone, and was very refractory; and some ferruginous particles were disseminated in grains, filaments, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> masses, through the substance of the stone, especially in its fissures. This iron, when subjected to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> heat, became obedient to the magnet. The black coating on the surface, M. de la Lande ascribes to fusion, induced by violent heat. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>'s acknowledged respectability and accuracy of observation, combined with the circumstances which he has adduced, circumstances, too, which, if misstated, lay so open to public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>, powerfully plead in favour of his testimony.\n\nOn the 13th of September 1762, according to the abb\u00e9 Bachelay, about half past four o'clock P.M., there appeared near the chateau de Chevabrie, in the neighbourhood of Luce, a small town of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAINE\">Maine</a>, a stormy cloud, from which proceeded a loud peal of thunder, like the discharge of cannon, and followed by a noise which was mistaken by several people for the lowing of oxen. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> was heard over a space of about two leagues and a half, but unaccompanied by any perceptible flame. The reapers in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> of Perigue, about three leagues from Luce, on hearing the same noise, looked up, and saw an opake body, which described a curve, and fell on soft turf, on the high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> from Mons, near which they were at work. They all quickly ran up to it, and found a sort of stone, nearly half of which was buried in the earth, and the whole so hot that it could not be touched. At first they ran away in a panic; but on returning to the spot some time after, they found the stone precisely in the same situation, and sufficiently cooled to admit of being handled, and narrowly examined. It weighed seven ounces and a half, and was of a triangular form, presenting, as it were, three rounded horns, one of which, at the moment of the fall, had entered into the ground, and was of a gray or ash colour, while the rest, which was exposed to the air, was very black. When the abb\u00e9 presented this stone to the academy, that body appointed three of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, namely, Messieurs Lavoisier, Fougeroux, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CADET\">Cadet</a>, to examine and analyse it. This task they performed with more care and accuracy than M. de la Lande had done on the preceding occasion; but their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> was confined to an integral part of the whole, considered as a homogeneous substance, in place of being repeated on each of the constituent parts. The substance was of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> cinereous hue, speckled with an infinite number of small and shining metallic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>, visible through a magnifying glass. That part of the outer surface which remained above ground was incrusted with a thin black coating, which seemed to have undergone fusion, and which gave a few sparks when struck with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a>. The specific gravity of the mass was 3335.\u2014Two other stones, nearly of the same characters, the one reported to have fallen at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIRE\">Aire</a>, in Artois, and\nthe other in the Cotentin, in Normandy, were presented to the academy in the course of the same year by M. Gurson de Boyaval, honorary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">lieutenant</a>-general of the bailiwick of Aire, and the younger M. Morand. According to the academical report, these three stones, when compared, presented no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> to the eye, were of the same colour, and nearly of the same grain, exhibiting metallic and pyritous particles, and covered with a black and ferruginous incrustation. Although the coincidence of facts and circumstances, in three places so remote from one another, did not convince the academy that these stones had been conveyed to the earth by lightning, yet it induced them to invite naturalists to prosecute the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of the subject.\n\nOn the 25th of November 1768, a stone fell at Mauerkirchen near the Inn, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAVARIA\">Bavaria</a>, that weighed 38lb. was of a triangular form, and only eight inches in thickness. Its fall was accompanied by a hissing noise, and great darkness in the atmosphere. This meteorite penetrated two feet and a half into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>. Part of it is in the cabinet of the right <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> Charles Greville, which is now in the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSEUM\">Museum</a>; and a fragment may be seen in Mr Ferguson's collection quoted above.\n\nThe next remarkable case on record occurred on the 20th of August 1789, at Barbotan, near Roquefort, in the Landes of Bordeaux, and is thus related by Citizen Lomet, who was known to several members of the Institute, and happened to be at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGEN\">Agen</a> when the meteor appeared.\n\n\"It was a very bright fire-ball, luminous as the sun, of the size of an ordinary balloon, and, after inspiring the inhabitants with consternation, burst and disappeared. A few days after, some peasants brought stones, which they said fell from the meteor; but the philosophers to whom they offered them laughed at their assertions as fabulous. The peasants would have now more reason to laugh at the philosophers.\"\u2014One of these stones broke through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a> of a cottage, and killed a herdsman and some cattle. Vaupelin, who received a proces-verbal of the circumstances, also examined one of the specimens. The fragment procured by Mr Ferguson has visibly all the characters of a genuine meteorite.\n\nA much more remarkable phenomenon, however, of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>, occurred near Agen, on the 24th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> 1790. An inhabitant of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ST_SEVER\">St Sever</a> communicated the following particulars to M. Darcey the chemist, who was then resident at Paris.\n\n\"Our towns-people were yesterday very much alarmed. About a quarter past nine o'clock, in the evening, there suddenly appeared in the air a fire-ball, dragging a long train, which diffused a very vivid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> over the horizon. This meteor soon disappeared, and seemed to fall at one hundred paces from us. It was quickly followed by an explosion louder than that of a cannon or of thunder. Every body dreaded being buried under the ruins of his house, which seemed to give way from the concussion. The same phenomenon was seen, and the report heard, in the neighbouring towns, as Mont de Marsan, Tartas, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAX\">Dax</a>. The weather in other respects was very calm, without a breath of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> or a cloud, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">moon</a> shone in all her brightness.\"\n\nM. Darcey's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>, a clergyman in that part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, sent him a small stone, which was picked up on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> after the explosion, and the history of which he was scrupulously anxious to investigate. Being satisfied with respect to all the particulars, he at length dispatched it to Paris, accompanied with some curious remarks. \"When these stones fell,\" says he, \"they had not their present degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a>. Some of them fell on straw, bits of which stuck to the stones, and incorporated with them. I have seen one in this predicament. It is at present at La Bastide; but I cannot persuade the owner to part with it***. Those which fell on the houses produced a noise, not like that of stones, but rather of a substance which had not yet acquired compactness.\"\n\nWe subjoin the proces-verbal\u2014a simple but authentic document.\n\n\"In the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety, and the 24th day of the month of August, we, the Sieur Jean Duby, mayor, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> Mauillon, procurator of the commune of the municipality of La Grange de Juillac, and Jean Darmite, resident in the parish of La Grange de Juillac, certify in truth and verity, that, on Saturday the 24th of July last, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, there passed a great fire, and after it we heard in the air a very loud and extraordinary noise; and, about two minutes after, there fell stones from heaven, but fortunately there fell only a very few, and they fell about ten paces from one another in some places, and in others nearer, and finally, in some other places, farther, and falling, most of them, of the weight of about half a quarter of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> each; some of about half a pound, like that found in our parish of La Grange; and on the borders of the parish of Creon, they were found of a pound weight; and in falling they seemed not to be inflamed, but very hard and black without, and within of the colour of steel; and, thank God, they occasioned no harm to the people, nor the trees, but only to some trees which were broken on the houses; and most of them fell gently, and others fell quickly, with a hissing noise; and some were found which had entered into the earth, but very few. In witness whereof we have written and signed these presents.\n\n(Signed) Duby, Mayor\u2014Darmite.\"\n\nMonsieur Baudin mentions, that, as M. Carris of Barbotan and he were walking in the court of the castle of Mormes about half past nine o'clock, in the evening of the 24th of July 1790, when the air was perfectly calm, and the sky cloudless, they found themselves suddenly surrounded by a pale clear light, which obscured that of the moon, though the latter was nearly full. On <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> up, they observed, almost in their zenith, a fireball of a larger apparent diameter than that of the moon, dragging a tail, which seemed to be five or six times longer than the diameter of its body, and which gradually tapered to a point, the latter approaching to blood-red, though the rest of the meteor was of a pale <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>. This luminous body proceeded with great velocity from south to north, and in two seconds split into portions of considerable size, like the fragments of a bursting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOMB\">bomb</a>. These fragments became extinguished in the air, and some of them, as they fell, assumed that deep red colour, which had been observed at the point of the tail. Two or three minutes after M. Baudin and his friend heard a dreadful explosion, like the simultaneous firing of several pieces of ordnance; but they were not sensible of any tremulous motion under their feet, though the concus...\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SION\">sion</a> of the atmosphere shook the windows in their frames, and threw down <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KITCHEN\">kitchen</a> utensils from their shelves. When these gentlemen removed to the garden, the noise still <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>, and seemed to be directly over their heads. Some time after it had ceased, they heard a hollow sound rolling, in echoes, for fifty miles, along the chain of the Pyrenees, and at the end of about four minutes gradually dying away in distance.\n\nAt the same time, a strong sulphurous odour was diffused in the atmosphere. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> which occurred between the disruption of the meteor, and the loud report, induced M. Baudin to conjecture, that this fireball must have been at least eight miles from the earth's surface, and that it fell about four miles from Mormes.\n\n\"The latter part of my conjecture,\" says he, \"was soon confirmed by an account which we received of a great many stones having fallen from the atmosphere at Juillac and in the neighbourhood of Barbotan.\" It appears, indeed, from the concurring testimony of intelligent persons worthy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a>, that the meteor really exploded at a little distance from Juillac, and that its fragments were found lying in an almost circular space, of nearly two miles in diameter. Some of them weighed eighteen or twenty, and a few, it is alleged, even fifty pounds. M. de Carris procured one of 18 lbs., which he transmitted to the Parisian Academy of Sciences. That examined by M. Baudin was small, but heavy in proportion to its size, black on the outside, grayish within, and interspersed with many minute, shining, metallic particles. These last circumstances perfectly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCORD\">accord</a> with the fragment of a Barbotan stone preserved in Mr Ferguson's collection.\n\nIn one of his letters to Professor St Amand, M. Goyon d'Arzaz remarks, that these stones, though generally smooth on the outside, presented some longitudinal cracks, or fissures, while their interior parts exhibited symptoms of metallic veins, especially of a ferruginous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a>. When yet red hot, and scattered in various directions, they formed that magnificent fire-work, that shower of flame, which enlightened the horizon over a large tract of country; for this extraordinary meteor was seen at Bayonne, Auch, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PAU\">Pau</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TARBES\">Tarbes</a>, and even at Bordeaux and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOULOUSE\">Toulouse</a>. At the last-mentioned place it excited little attention, on account of its great distance, and its appearing only a little brighter than a shooting star. It, moreover, deserves to be noted, that the meteorites in question were found on a bare moor, of an extremely thin soil, on which no such stones, or indeed stones of any description, had been observed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of man. They who are solicitous of additional information on this part of our subject, may consult No. 23 and 24 of the Journal des Sciences Utiles of Montpelier, for 1790, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECADE\">Decade</a> Philosophique for February 1796.\n\nWhen all the circumstances of the case are duly considered, we need not be surprised, that they should produce conviction on the minds of many men of science, who, till then, possessed \"an evil heart of unbelief.\" M. de St Amand ingenuously confessed to M. Pictet of Geneva, that he had treated this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVEL\">novel</a> topic with unmerited contempt, and that the evidence deduced from the similar characters of the stones should not be rashly rejected. The learned and the unlearned of the district in which the phenomenon is stated to have occurred, attest its existence; the professor of natural history in the central school of Agen renounces his former scepticism; Vanquelin analyses a specimen, and finds it to contain the same chemical substances as other meteorites, and in nearly the same proportions; and shall we be so unreasonable as to withhold our assent, merely because we have not ocular demonstration of the alleged particulars?\n\nOur chronological <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of cases has now brought us to the fall of several meteorites near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIENNA\">Sienna</a>, the particulars of which, as reported by the late <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRISTOL\">Bristol</a> and Sir William <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAMILTON\">Hamilton</a>, are recorded in the first part of the Philosophical Transactions for 1795 (page 103). Mr King, likewise in the tract which we have already quoted, communicates some interesting circumstances relative to this phenomenon, chiefly extracted from an account of it published by Professor Soldani. While we refer our readers to these details, we cannot omit mentioning that, in regard to aspect and composition, the Sienna stones are perfectly analogous to others already noticed, and very different from any that occur in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TUSCANY\">Tuscany</a>. As the meteor from which they were discharged appeared on the morning after a violent eruption of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VESUVIUS\">Vesuvius</a>, they were at first supposed to be volcanic, till cool reflection and examination betrayed the extravagance of such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>. The precise number of stones which were collected on this occasion is not specified, but many of them were small, weighing from a quarter of an ounce to two ounces. A pretty entire specimen occurs in Mr Ferguson's collection.\u2014The date of the Sienna meteor is the 16th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a>, 1794.\n\nOn the 13th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> of the following year, about three o'clock in the afternoon, another of these singular stones, weighing 16 pounds, fell near the country house of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> Topham, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORKSHIRE\">Yorkshire</a>. The captain's report, which is inserted in the Gentleman's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGAZINE\">Magazine</a> for 1796, is distinct and satisfactory; while the chemical examination of the mass, detailed in Mr Howard's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, in the Philosophical Transactions for 1802, affords a still more decisive proof of its atmospheric origin. M. de Dr\u00e9e, also found it to correspond exactly in aspect and character, with fragments of meteor stones from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENARES\">Benares</a> and Ville-franche. The original mass is in the possession of Mr Sowerby author of English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTANY\">Botany</a>, &c. It is larger than a man's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>.\n\nMr Southey, in his letters from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PORTUGAL\">Portugal</a>, transcribes the authenticated relation of another instance of the descent of a stone from the clouds on the 19th of February 1796. But we pass to some of the most important details relative to the stone which is affirmed to have fallen near Ville-franche, in the department of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RHONE\">Rhone</a>, on the 12th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a>, 1798. When it was transmitted to Professor Sage, member of the National Institute, he considered it at first, as only a pyritous and magnetical ore of iron, although it bore no resemblance to any known <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of ore of that metal, since it contained nickel, silica, magnesia, and native iron, which shone like steel when polished. \"It is of an ash gray colour,\" says M. Sage, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANULATED\">granulated</a> and speckled with gray, shining, and pyritous metallic points. One of its surfaces is covered with a dingy black enamel, about the third of a line in thickness. This stone acts very powerfully on the magnetic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NEEDLE\">needle</a>. When the senator Chasset transmitted it to me, it\nwas accompanied with an historical notice of similar import with that of M. Delievre, of Ville-franche, who saw and described the phenomenon on the spot.\"\n\nAt six o'clock in the evening, a round body, which diffused the most vivid light, was observed in the vicinity of Ville-franche, moving westward, and producing a hissing, like that of a bomb which traverses the air. This luminous body, which was seen at the same time at Lyons and on Mont-Cenis, marked its path by a red track of fire, and exploded, about 200 toises from the earth with a tremendous report and concussion. One of the flaming fragments fell on the vineyard of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a> Crepier, an inhabitant of Sales. On the spot where this portion of the meteor was seen to fall, and in a fresh opening of about 20 inches in depth, and 18 in width, was found a black mass, 15 inches in diameter, and rounded on one side.\n\nAn account of the same meteor was published in the Journal de Physique, for Floreal, year 11, by M. de Dr\u00e9e. From his minute and deliberate investigation, it appears that the fire-ball had scarcely fixed the attention of the inhabitants of Sales and the adjacent villages, when its rapid approach, accompanied by a terrible whizzing noise, like that of an irregular hollow body, traversing the air with unusual velocity, inspired the whole commune with alarm, especially when they observed it passing over their heads, at an inconsiderable elevation. It left behind a long train of light, and emitted, with an almost unceasing crackling, small vivid flames, like little stars. Its fall was remarked, at the distance of only 50 paces, by three labourers, one of whom, named Montillard, let fall his coat and bundle of sticks that he might run the faster, while the other two, Chardon and Lapoces, fled with equal precipitation to Sales, where the alarm had become general.\u2014These three witnesses attest the astonishing rapidity of the meteor's motion, and the hissing which proceeded from the spot where it fell. So terrified was Crepier at the explosion, that he locked himself up with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, first in his cellar, and then in his private apartment, nor ventured abroad till next morning, when, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> of M. Blandel, Chardon, Lapoces, and many others, he repaired to the opening which had been made by the fire ball. At the bottom of this opening, which was 18 inches deep, including the entire thickness of the mould, they found a large black mass, of an irregularly ovoid form, having a fanciful resemblance to a calf's head. Though no longer hot, it smelled of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUN\">gun</a>-powder and was cracked in several places. When the observers broke it, and discovered nothing but stone, indifference succeeded to curiosity, and they coolly ascribed its appearance to causes more or less whimsical and supernatural.\n\nThe original weight of this stone was about twenty pounds. Its black vitrified surface gave fire with steel. Its interior was hard, earthy, ash-coloured, of a granular texture, presenting different substances scattered through it, namely, iron in grains, from the smallest size to a line or even more in diameter, somewhat malleable, but harder and whiter than forged iron; white pyrites, both lamellated and granular, and in colour approaching to nickel; some gray globules, which seemed to present the characters of trapp, and a very few and small particles of steatites, inclining to an olive hue. On account of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HETEROGENEOUS\">heterogeneous</a> composition, its specific gravity could not be easily ascertained. One hundred parts of the mass gave, according to Vauquelin, 46 of silica, 38 oxide of iron, 15 magnesia, 2 nickel, and 2 lime. The excess of this result was ascribed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSORPTION\">absorption</a> of oxygen by the native iron during the process. A small specimen of this mass belongs to Mr Ferguson's collection.\n\nOn the 19th of December 1798, about eight o'clock in the evening, the inhabitants of Benares and its neighbourhood observed in the heavens a very luminous meteor, in the form of a large ball of fire, which exploded with a loud noise, and from which a number of stones were precipitated near Krakhat, a village about fourteen miles from the city of Benares. Mr Davis, the judge and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a> of the district affirmed that its brilliancy equalled the brightest moonlight. Both he and Mr Erskine, the assistant collector, were induced to send persons in whom they could confide to the spot where this shower of stones was asserted to have taken place, and thus obtained additional evidence of the phenomenon, and several of the stones, which had penetrated about six inches into fields recently watered. Mr Maclean, a gentleman who resided near Krakhat, presented Mr Howard with part of a stone, which had been brought to him the morning after its descent, by the watchman who was on duty at his house, and through the roof of whose hut it had passed, and buried itself several inches in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a>, which was of consolidated earth. Before it was broken, it must have weighed upwards of two pounds.\n\nAt the time that this meteor appeared, the sky was perfectly serene; not the smallest vestige of a cloud had been seen since the 11th of the month, nor was any observed for many days after.\n\n\"Of these stones (says Mr Howard), I have seen eight nearly perfect, besides parts of several others, which had been broken by the possessors, to distribute among their friends. The form of the more perfect ones appeared to be that of an irregular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUBE\">cube</a>, rounded off at the edges; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> were to be observed on most of them. They were of various sizes, from about three to upwards of four inches in their largest diameter; one of them, measuring four inches and a quarter, weighed two pounds twelve ounces. In appearance they were exactly similar; externally they were covered with a hard black coat, or incrustation, which in some parts had the appearance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VARNISH\">varnish</a> or bitumen; and on most of them were fractures, which, from their being covered with a matter similar to that of the coat, seemed to have been made in the fall, by the stones striking against each other, and to have passed through some medium, probably an intense heat, previous to their reaching the earth. Internally they consisted of a number of small spherical bodies, of a slate colour, imbedded in a whitish gritty substance, interspersed with bright shining spicules, of a metallic or pyritical nature. The spherical bodies were much harder than the rest of the stone: the white gritty part readily crumbled, on being rubbed with a hard body; and on being broken, a quantity attached itself to the magnet, but more particularly the outside coat or crust, which appeared almost wholly attractable by it.\"\n\nHere we are furnished with another circumstantial and authenticated narrative, by individuals above the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>.\nrank of suspicion, and who were prompted solely by motives of curiosity, to examine with due deliberation the particulars which they have reported.\n\nThe history of the extraordinary shower of stones which fell near l'<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIGLE\">Aigle</a>, in Normandy, on the 26th of April 1803, first appeared in the ensuing artless <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a>, addressed by M. Marais, an inhabitant of the place, to his friend in Paris.\n\n\"At l'Aigle, the 13th Flor\u00e9al, 11.\n\nAn astonishing miracle has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> occurred in our district. Here it is, without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a>, addition, or diminution. It is certain, that it is the truth itself.\n\nOn Friday last, 6th Flor\u00e9al (26th April), between one and two o'clock in the afternoon, we were roused by a murmuring noise like thunder. On going out we were surprised to see the sky pretty clear, with the exception of some small clouds. We took it for the noise of a carriage, or of fire in the neighbourhood. We were then in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEADOW\">meadow</a>, to examine whence the noise proceeded, when we observed all the inhabitants of the Pont de Pierre at their windows, and in gardens, inquiring concerning a cloud, which passed in the direction of from south to north, and from whence the noise issued, although that cloud presented nothing extraordinary in its appearance. But great was our astonishment when we learned, that many and large stones had fallen from it, some of them weighing ten, eleven, and even seventeen pounds, in the space between the house of the Buat family (half a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a> to the north-north-east of l'Aigle) and Glos, passing by St Nicolas, St Pierre, &c. which struck us at first as a fable, but which was afterwards found to be true.\n\nThe following is the explanation given of this extraordinary event by all who witnessed it.\n\nThey heard a noise like that of a cannon, then a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> report still louder than the preceding, followed by a rumbling noise, which lasted about ten minutes, the same which we also heard, accompanied with hisings, caused by these stones, which were counteracted in their fall by the different currents of air, which is very natural in the case of such a sudden expansion. Nothing more was heard; but it is remarkable, that previously to the explosion, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> fowls were alarmed, and the cows bellowed in an unusual manner. All the country-folks were much dismayed, especially the women, who believed that the end of the world was at hand. A labourer at la Sap\u00e9e fell prostrate on the ground, exclaiming, 'Good God! is it possible that thou canst make me perish thus? <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARDON\">Pardon</a>, I beseech thee, all the faults I have committed,' &c. The most trifling objects in fact, might create alarm, for it is not improbable, that history offers no example of such a shower of stones as this. The piece which I send was detached from a large one, weighing eleven pounds, which was found between the house of the Buats and le Fertey. It is said, that a collector of curiosities purchased one of seventeen pounds weight, that he might send it to Paris. Every body in this part of the country is desirous of possessing a whole stone, or a fragment of one, as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of curiosity. The largest were darted with such violence that they entered at least a foot into the earth. They are black on the outside, and grayish, as you see, within, seeming to contain some species of metal and nitre. If you know before us of what ingredients they are composed, you will inform us. One fell near M. Bois de la Ville, who lives near Glos. He was much afraid, and took shelter under a tree. He has found a great number of them of different sizes, in his court-yard, his wheat field, &c. without reckoning all those which the peasants have found elsewhere. Numberless stories, more or less absurd, have been circulated among the people. You know that our country is fertile in such tales. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUSIN\">Cousin</a> Moutardier sends one of these stones to Mademoiselle H\u00e9bert; and he is not less eager than we are, to know how these substances can be compressed and petrified in the air. Do try to explain the process.\n\nThe person who gave me the largest stone which I send to you, went to take it at the moment that it fell, but it was so hot that it burned him. Several of his neighbours shared the same fate in attempting to lift it.\n\nThe elder Buat has just arrived, and desires us to add, that a fire-ball was observed to hover over the meadow. Perhaps it was wild-fire.\"\n\nAt the sitting of the Institute, on the 9th of May, Fourcroy read a letter, addressed from l'Aigle to Vauguelin, and which sufficiently corroborates the preceding statements. But we pass to the substance of M. Biot's letter, addressed to the minister of the interior, and published in the Journal des D\u00e9bats, (14th Thermidor, year 11.). The writer who is advantageously known for his scientific attainments, was deputed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> to repair to the spot, and collect all the authentic facts. The contents of his letter have been since expanded into the form of a memoir, which manifests the caution and good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> which guided his inquiries, and which we are surprised to learn, has not appeared in an English translation.\n\nM. Biot left Paris on the 25th of June, and in place of proceeding directly to l'Aigle, went first to Alen\u00e7on, which lies fifteen leagues to the west-south-west of it. He was informed on his way, that a globe of fire had been observed moving towards the north, and that its appearance was followed by a violent explosion. From Alen\u00e7on he journeyed through various villages to l'Aigle, being directed in his progress by the accounts of the inhabitants, who had all heard the explosion on the day and at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> specified. Almost all the inhabitants of twenty hamlets, scattered over an extent of upwards of two leagues <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> affirmed that they were eye-witnesses of a dreadful shower of stones which was darted from the meteor. The following is his summary of the whole evidence.\n\n\"On Tuesday, 6th Flor\u00e9al, year 11, about one o'clock P. M. the weather being serene, there was observed from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CAEN\">Caen</a>, Pont d'Audemer, and the environs of Alen\u00e7on, Falaise, and Verneuil, a fiery globe, of a very brilliant splendour, and which moved in the atmosphere with great rapidity. Some moments after, there was heard at l'Aigle, and in the environs of that town, in the extent of more than thirty leagues in every direction, a violent explosion, which lasted five or six minutes. At first there were three or four reports, like those of cannon, followed by a kind of discharge which resembled the firing of musketry; after which there was heard a dreadful rumbling like\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEATING\">beating</a> of a drum. The air was calm, and the sky serene, except a few clouds, such as are frequently observed.\n\n\"This noise proceeded from a small cloud which had a rectangular form, the largest side being in a direction from east to west. It appeared motionless all the time that the phenomenon lasted; but the vapours of which it was composed, were projected momentarily from different sides, by the effect of the successive explosions. This cloud was about half a league to the north-north-west of the town of l'Aigle. It was at a great elevation in the atmosphere, for the inhabitants of two hamlets, a league distant from each other, saw it at the same time above their heads. In the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CANTON\">canton</a> over which this cloud was suspended, there was heard a hissing noise like that of a stone discharged from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SLING\">sling</a>, and a great many mineral masses exactly similar to those distinguished by the name of meteor-stones were seen to fall.\n\n\"The district in which these masses were projected, forms an elliptical extent of about two leagues and a half in length, and nearly one in breadth, the greatest dimension being in a direction from south-east to north-west, forming a declination of about 22 degrees. This direction, which the meteor must have followed, is exactly that of the magnetic meridian, which is a remarkable result. The greatest of these stones fell at the south-eastern extremity of the large axis of the ellipse, the middle-sized in the centre, and the smaller at the other extremity. Hence it appears that the largest fell first, as might naturally be supposed. The largest of all those that fell weighs seventeen pounds and a half. The smallest which I have seen weighs about two gros (a thousandth part of the last). The number of all those which fell is certainly above two or three thousand.\"\n\nAs we cannot make room for an analysis of M. Biot's more extended <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a>, we shall be contented to select only two facts.\n\nThe cur\u00e9 of St Michael declared, that he observed one of the stones fall, with a hissing noise, at the feet of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIECE\">niece</a>, in the court-yard of his parsonage, and that it rebounded upwards of a foot from the pavement. He instantly requested his niece to fetch it to him; but as she was too much alarmed, a woman who happened also to be on the spot, took it up; and it was found in every respect to resemble the others.\n\nAs one Piche, a wire-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANUFACTURER\">manufacturer</a> belonging to the village of Am\u00e9e, was working with his men in the open air, a stone grazed his arm, and fell at his feet; but it was so hot, that, on attempting to take it up, he instantly let it fall again.\n\nHe who compares the various accounts of the l'Aigle meteor, with a critical eye, may detect some apparent contradictions, which, however, on reflection, are found to be strictly conformable to truth. Thus, according to some, the meteor had a rapid motion, others believed it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a>; some saw a very luminous ball of fire, others only an ordinary cloud. Spectators, in fact, viewed it in different positions with respect to its direction. They who happened to be in its line of march, would see it stationary, for the same reason, that we fancy a ship under full sail to be motionless, when we are placed in its wake, or when we view it from the harbour to which it is approaching in a straight line.\n\nThey, on the other hand, who had a side view of the meteor, would reckon its progress the more rapid, in proportion as their position approached to a right <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> with its line of passage. They, again, who saw it from behind, as the inhabitants of l'Aigle, would perceive only the cloud of vapour, which it left in its train, and which, in the dark, would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> like a blazing tail, in the same manner as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a> of a volcano appears black during the day and red at night. Lastly, they who were placed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> of the meteor, would reckon it stationary, but brilliant and cloudless.\n\nIt deserves to be remarked, that the l'Aigle stones were very friable for some days after their descent, that they gradually acquired hardness, and that after they had lost the sulphureous odour on their surface, they still retained it in their substances, as was found by breaking them. Professor Sage submitted them to several comparative trials with those of Ville-franche; and, though the l'Aigle specimens present some globules of the size of a small coriander seed, of a darker gray than the mass, and not attractable by the magnet, yet, in respect of granular texture and general aspect, the coincidence was so striking as to lead one to suppose that they were all parts of the same mass.\n\nThe l'Aigle stones, according to Fourcroy, are generally irregular, polygonal, often cuboid, sometimes sub-conciform, and exceedingly various in their diameter and weight. All are covered with a black gravelly crust, consisting of a fused matter, and filled with small agglutinated grains of iron. The greater part of them are broken at the corners, either by their shock against each other, or by falling on hard bodies. The internal parts resemble those of all the stones analyzed by Messrs Howard and Vauquelin, being gray, a little varied in their shades, granulated, and as it were scaly, split in many parts, and filled with brilliant metallic points, exactly of the same aspect as those of other stones of a like description. The proportions of their constituent materials are stated as nearly, 54 silex, 36 oxidated iron, 9 magnesia, 3 nickel, 2 sulphur, and 1 lime, the five per cent. of increase, arising from the oxidation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a> produced by the analysis.\n\nOf the two specimens which M. Biot presented to the celebrated Patrin, one was less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a>, and of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a> gray than the other, and likewise presented small patches of a rust colour. When immersed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, it gave a hissing sound, like the humming of a fly, which is held by one wing. As it began to dry, it was observed to be marked by curvilinear and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> layers. The more compact specimens, when moistened, presented no such appearances, but assumed the aspect of a gray porphyry, with a base of trap, mottled with small white spots, and speckled with metallic points.\n\nTwo fine specimens of the l'Aigle stone, one of them nearly entire, may be seen in Mr Ferguson's collection, which we have already repeatedly quoted.\n\nPreviously to the explosion of the 26th of April 1803, no meteorolites had been found by the inhabitants of the l'Aigle district, nor in the mineralogical collections of the department; nor the slightest mention of them made in the geological documents of this portion of Normandy; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINES\">mines</a>, foundries, and forges, had produced nothing similar, in the form of dross or ore, nor had the country exhibited any trace of volcanoes.\nThe meteor at once appears, and a multitude of stones of the peculiar character noted above are seen scattered on a determined space of ground, in a manner, and accompanied with circumstances, which could not formerly have escaped observation. Let us likewise reflect, that the young and the old, simple peasants dwelling at a distance from one another, sagacious and rational workmen, respectable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ECCLESIASTICS\">ecclesiastics</a>, young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> devoid of timidity, individuals, in short, of various manners, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROFESSIONS\">professions</a>, and opinions, united by no common ties, all agree in attesting a fact, which contributed neither directly nor indirectly to promote their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>, and they all assign the manifestation of this fact to the same day and hour. They, moreover, point to existing vestiges of the descent of solid substances, and they declare, in terms unsusceptible of misconstruction or ambiguity, that they saw the masses in question roll down on roofs, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> branches of trees, rebound from the pavement, and produce smoke where they fell. These recitals, and these vestiges, are limited to a tract of territory which has been accurately defined; while beyond the precincts of this tract, not a single particle of a meteorolite has been found, nor a single individual who pretends that he saw a stone fall.\n\nHaving now, we presume, advanced ample and satisfactory evidence of the existence of meteorolites, we shall forbear to enlarge this article by dwelling on instances of inferior notoriety to those which we have recounted, and shall merely note the dates of subsequent examples.\n\nOn the 4th of July 1803, a fire-ball struck the White Bull Inn at East-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NORTON\">Norton</a>, and left behind it several meteoric fragments.\u2014On the 13th of December of the same year, a similar phenomenon occurred at the village of St Nicholas, in Bavaria.\u2014At Possil, near Glasgow in Scotland, a meteor-stone fell, with a loud and hissing noise, on the 5th April 1804.\u2014The next instance which we have to mention occurred near Apt, in the department of Vaucluse, on the 6th of October of the same year: and the last which has come to our knowledge happened at half past five o'clock in the evening of the 15th March 1826, near Alais in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUEDOC\">Languedoc</a>.\n\nIt seems reasonable, however, to suppose, that the fall of meteoric substances takes place more frequently than is commonly supposed, since several foreign collections of fossils contain specimens of reputed celestial origin, and exhibiting the genuine atmospheric physiognomy. It is likewise worthy of remark, that many relations of the phenomenon may have sunk into oblivion, from the contempt with which they were heard by the learned, and that on a fair computation of chances, meteors may have sometimes exploded on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a> tracts of land, and still more frequently over the pathless expanse of the water.\n\nThat some of the relations to which we have alluded are vague and unsatisfactory, cannot be denied, but the circumstantial testimony conveyed by others is more pointed and positive; and the whole mass of historical proof, especially when combined with the argument deduced from the identity of the physical and chemical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of the stones, appears to us to be altogether irresistible.\n\nIn the course of our inquiry into this novel and interesting subject, we have ascertained a variety of circumstances which render it highly probable, if not indubitable, that those detached masses of native iron, whose history has so often staggered and perplexed the geologist, are only modifications of meteoric depositions. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TARTARS\">Tartars</a>, for example, ascribe the descent of the Siberian mass described by Chladni, Pallas, Patrin, &c., to a period that is lost in the remoteness of antiquity; and while <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a> thus favours our hypothesis, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> which is obviously observable in point of texture and chemical characters with those of other solid bodies, whose fall is no longer questioned, strengthens tradition. According to the discoveries of Proust and Klaproth, native iron, reputed meteoric, differs from that which occurs in a fossil state by the presence of nickel. The former of these celebrated analysts obtained 50 grains of sulphate of nickel from 100 of the South American mass, and his results are corroborated by Mr Howard and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOURBON\">Bourbon</a>.\n\nOf the two pieces of Siberian iron possessed by Mr Greville, one, which was transmitted by Dr Pallas, weighs several pounds; and another presents a cellular and ramified texture, analogous to that of some very light and porous volcanic scoriae. When attentively examined, there may be perceived in it not only empty cells, but also impressions or cavities of greater or less depth, and in some of which there remains a transparent substance, of a yellowish green colour. The iron itself is very malleable; and may be easily cut with a knife, or flattened under the hammer. The specific gravity is 6.487, which is obviously inferior to that of unformed iron that has undergone fusion, and may be partly owing to the oxidization of the surface of the iron, and partly to the minute cavities in its substance, which are often rendered visible by fracture, and which have their surface also oxidized. The fracture is shining and silvery, like that of white cast iron; but its grain is much smoother and finer; and it is much more malleable when cold. The heavier specimen is more solid and compact, exhibiting no cavities or pores, though its surface is ramified and cellular. So blended and incorporated is its compact part with the yellowish-green substance mentioned above, that if the whole of the latter could be subtracted, the remainder would consist of iron in the metallic state, and would display the same cellular appearance as the preceding specimen, or as the superficial portion of that now described. This stony part of the composition usually assumes the appearance of small nodules, generally of an irregular shape, but sometimes nearly globular, with a smooth, shining, and glassy surface. This substance, which is always more or less transparent, is hard enough to cut glass, but makes no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTZ\">quartz</a>. It becomes electric by friction, is very refractory, and varies in specific gravity from 3.263 to 3.300. Of all substances hitherto known, it approaches most to the peridot, or Wernerian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CHRYSOLITE\">chrysolite</a>, which yielded to Klaproth nearly the same results which this substance did to Howard. In the mass of iron, it is liable to decomposition, changing to an opake white, and crumbling into a gritty dry powder, when lightly pressed or squeezed between the fingers.\u2014\"I cannot help observing (says the count de Bourbon), that there appears to exist a very interesting analogy between these transparent nodules and the globules I described as making part of the stones said...\"\nto have fallen on the earth. This analogy, though not a very strong one, may lead us to suppose, that the two substances are similar in their nature, but that the globules are less pure, and contain a greater quantity of iron.\"\n\nThe native iron from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOHEMIA\">Bohemia</a> is compact, like the large specimen from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIBERIA\">Siberia</a>, in Mr Greville's collection, and like it contains nodules, but not so numerous. They are besides quite opake, and very much resemble the globules in atmospheric stones. This iron contains nearly five per cent. of nickel. Between five and six per cent. of the same metal seems to exist in a piece of native iron brought from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENEGAL\">Senegal</a>.\n\nThough our limits will not permit us to dwell with minuteness on the physical and chemical characters of meteorolites, we shall shortly state those which the count de Bourbon found to appertain to the specimens from Benares, and which may serve as no unfair standard of the aspect and composition of the others.\n\nLike all of the same origin which were subjected to the count's examination, the Benares stones are covered over the whole extent of their surface, with a thin crust, of a deep black colour, sprinkled over with small asperities, which make it feel somewhat like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHAGREEN\">shagreen</a> or fish skin. Their fracture exhibits a greyish colour, and a granulated texture, like that of coarse grit-stone. By help of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENS\">lens</a>, they are perceived to be composed of four different substances. One of these occurs in great abundance, in the form of small bodies, some of which are perfectly globular, others rather elongated or elliptical, and all, of various sizes, from that of a small pin's head to that of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-PEA\">pea</a>, or nearly so. These small globules are usually gray, sometimes inclining much to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a>, and always opake; they are easily broken in any direction, have a conchoidal fracture, and a fine, smooth, compact grain, with a slight degree of lustre, approaching to enamel; lastly, they can destroy the polish of glass without being able to cut it, and sparkle faintly when struck with steel. Another of these substances is martial pyrites, of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDETERMINATE\">indeterminate</a> form, and reddish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> colour, slightly verging to the nickel tint, or to that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> pyrites; of a somewhat loosely granulated texture, and irregularly distinguished in the mass, being black when reduced to powder, and not attractable by the magnet. The third of these substances consists of small particles of iron, in a perfectly metallic state, so that they may be easily flattened or extended under the hammer. Though in a much smaller proportion than the pyrites just mentioned, they impart the magnetic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> to the stone. When a piece of the latter was pulverized, and the particles of iron separated from it as accurately as possible, by means of a magnet, they appeared to compose about 200 parts of the weight of the stone. These three substances are united by means of a fourth, which is nearly of an earthy consistency, and of a whitish gray colour.\u2014The black crust, or outward coating, though of very inconsiderable thickness, emits bright sparks when struck with steel, may be broken by the hammer, and seems to possess the same properties with the black oxide of iron, though, like the substance of the stone, it is occasionally intermixed with small particles of iron in the metallic state. These are easily distinguished, by passing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FILE\">file</a> over the crust, which reveals their lustre. The specific gravity of the Benares stones is 3.52.\n\nNone of them, when breathed on, emit the argillaceous Meteorodour.\n\nIn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of various experiments, M. Sage, infers that meteorolites are composed of native iron, sulphuret of nickel, quartz or silica, alumina, and magnesia; that the proportions of iron and nickel vary; that the quartz seems to form at least the half of the stone, the alumina and magnesia the sixth, and the sulphur the 30th part. These general results pretty nearly accord with the more special reports of Howard and Vanquelin, except that the latter makes no mention of alumina, the existence of which in atmospheric stones is by no means distinctly ascertained.\n\nWe shall only beg leave to add, on this part of our subject, that Laugier, an ingenious chemist, by employing the caustic alkali, has detected a small portion of chrome. The results of his experiments, which are stated in the 58th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the Annales de Chimie, are 1st, That the five stones from Verona, Barbotan, Ensisheim, PAigle, and the neighbourhood of Apt, besides the principles already recognized, contain about one per cent. of chrome. 2dly, That it is very probable that all meteorolites contain this principle, since they all resemble one another in their physical and chemical properties, and have all, apparently, the same origin; and, 3dly, That in many cases, the perfection of chemical analysis requires, that the same substance should be treated both by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALKALIES\">alkalies</a>, since <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> has shown, that a principle which eluded the former method, has been revealed by the latter.\n\nHaving now, as we apprehend, sufficiently established the existence and nature of meteorolites, we hope our readers will excuse us from enlarging on the various causes which have been assigned for their origin, as these seem to lie beyond the reach of our present state of knowledge. After a candid and patient review of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> theories, we conceive that they are at best gratuitous, and that most of them are open to many and formidable objections.\n\nThe terrestrial hypotheses, we believe, begin already to be generally abandoned, as untenable. Until the phenomenon of exploding meteors had been distinctly observed and recorded, Lomery and others could maintain, with some degree of plausibility, that lightning might tear up the ground, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> soil into a compact mass. But the appearances of a thunder storm and of a fire-ball are now ascertained to differ in various important respects. Spectators worthy of credit have seen the latter terminate in the fall of solid bodies; and the composition of these solid bodies has been found to differ from that of all the known fossil substances on the surface of the globe. It is in vain, then, to allege, that they are formed on the ground by common lightning, which has often produced very extraordinary effects, but which never <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> thousands of stones in fine calm weather. The supposition, that such stones have been projected from some of our volcanoes, is hardly less conceivable. The ashes which accompany a violent eruption of Etna or Vesuvius have, from their levity, been carried to a very considerable distance; but we are totally unacquainted with any projectile force which could dart solid masses many hundred miles, through such a dense medium as the atmosphere. The compact lavas of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> are never found\nfound remote from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of their formation, and none of them present the characters and aspect of the stones which we have described. M. Bory de St Vincent, indeed, in his Voyage dans les quatre Principales Isles des Mers d'Afrique, very pompously expounds a doctrine, which, in our opinion, carries its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> along with it. According to this writer, meteorites were projected from immense depths, in an early stage of the earth's existence, when igneous mountains were ended with propelling forces sufficient to drive masses of matter into the regions of space, where they were constrained to obey, for ages, the combined laws of impulse and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAVITATION\">gravitation</a>, until, in the progress of time, their spiral revolutions at length terminated on the surface of their native earth. Before we can adopt such an extravagant hypothesis, we must be convinced, that at one period of the history of our globe, the agency of subterraneous fire was adequate to communicate planetary motion to splinters of rock, without heaving up the rocks themselves, and that the rotatory movement, though once established, must gradually diminish and cease. The demonstration of these positions is surely not less arduous than the explanation of the phenomenon which they are intended to solve.\n\nOf those who contend for the atmospheric formation of meteorites, scarcely any two agree in regard to the manner by which such formation is effected. Patrin, who is solicitous to extend and illustrate his darling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of volcanoes, labours at great length to maintain the existence of a regular circulation of gaseous fluids between the primitive schistose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRATA\">strata</a> of the globe, and its surrounding atmosphere, and, from this fancied circulation, which he flatters himself he has demonstrated, he deduces, quite at his ease, the occasional ignition and concretion of portions of these fluids in the higher regions of the air. This ingenious mineralogist and geologist is so extremely tenacious of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> that we shall not attempt to disturb his self-complacency; but he will excuse us if we refuse to assent to results which rest on imaginary foundations. The celebrated Muschenbroeck, in one part of his writings, ascribes the descent of stones from the air to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, an opinion which later observations have disproved. In other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a>, however, he seems to incline to a modification of the atmospheric hypothesis, and endeavours to trace the origin of shooting stars to an accumulation of the volatile matters which are suspended in the air. It is extremely probable, that shooting stars and fiery meteors have an intimate relation to one another, if they are not identical appearances; but it is certain that the former move at a much greater distance from our earth than fireballs, and only occasion, a transient luminous appearance in their passage through the upper regions of the atmosphere. Perhaps they are analogous to those telescopic sparks of light which were observed by M. Schr\u00f6ter. Muschenbroeck, however, adopts the vulgar notion of their falling to the earth, and seems to confound their residue with tremella nostoc. M. Salverte has given <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> to the theory of formation from vapours, by having recourse to the agency of hydrogen gas. According to him, in consequence of the decomposition of water, which is constantly going on at the surface of the earth, immense quantities of hydrogen gas are continually rising into the atmosphere, and ascending to its higher regions. As this gas is capable of dissolving metals, it carries along with it a portion of iron and nickel. During thunder-storms this gas is kindled by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTRICITY\">electricity</a>; the metals are deposited, reduced, melted, and vitrified; in other words, meteors are produced and stones formed. This hypothesis is scarcely more satisfactory than the others. It does not account for the presence of magnesia and silica, nor does it explain why the stones are always composed of the same materials. Besides, the existence of hydrogen gas in the atmosphere has not been proved, far less that it forms a separate atmosphere, which is contrary to all experience; and it is well known, that a little hydrogen, mixed with a large portion of atmospheric air, cannot be fired by electricity. In general, we may observe, that if the origin of meteorites be really atmospherical, the matters of which they are composed must have existed in one of two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, namely, in very attenuated particles or concretions of the matters themselves volatilized and held in solution in the air, or only in the elements of these matters. In the first case, when abandoned by their menstruum to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECIPROCAL\">reciprocal</a> tendencies, they would unite by aggregation only; in the second, by chemical combination. Now, we can hardly suppose that disengagement of light and violent detonation should result from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> of aggregation, whereas they are strictly symptomatic of the affinity of composition. This, and various other considerations which might be stated, if we could make room for them, induce us to regard the doctrine of combination as the most plausible. M. Izarn, who has published a treatise on Atmospheric Lithology, has entered into a tedious and somewhat obscure exposition of his own theory, founded on this principle. We shall give the summary, as nearly as we can, in his own words.\n\n\"Gaseous substances, arranged in spherical masses in the upper regions of the air, being admitted, the various agitations of the atmosphere should naturally waft some of these masses from their insulating medium into one capable of combining with them. If the combination begins, the disengagement of light is explained. In proportion as the combination advances, the specific gravities are changed; and, consequently, a change of place will commence, and that in the quarter which presents least resistance, or where the medium is most rarefied, in course rather towards the south than the north. Hence, most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FIRE_BALLS\">fire-balls</a> are observed to move from north to south, or from north-east to south-west. Motion being once impressed, the mass traverses other media, capable of supplying new principles, which still increasing the weight, determine the curve; and when at length the principles which are at work, and which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> in all directions, have attained the requisite proportion for extinguishing the elements in the birth of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a>, the grand operation is announced by the explosion, and the product takes its place among the solids.\"\u2014That the stones in question are produced by chemical combination in the higher regions of the atmosphere, and that they are thus formed from their own elements, are suppositions fully as probable as any that have been advanced on the subject; but whether the union of their parts be effected in the manner detailed by M. Izarn, we are unable to determine, both because we are uncertain if we perfectly comprehend his\nhis meaning, and because our range of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATA\">data</a> is as yet too circumscribed, to warrant any specific or decisive conclusions.\n\nA much bolder theory has been suggested, and its possibility demonstrated by the celebrated French astronomer, La Place, who shows that meteorites may be the products of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUNAR\">lunar</a> volcanoes. As this romantic view of the subject has obtained the suffrages of some men of science, and has excited the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIDICULE\">ridicule</a> of others, we shall present the reasoning on which it is founded in the popular and perspicuous language of Dr Hutton of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOLWICH\">Woolwich</a>.\n\n\"As the attraction of gravitation extends through the whole planetary system, a body placed at the surface of the moon is affected chiefly by two forces, one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> it toward the centre of the earth, and another drawing it toward that of the moon. The latter of these forces, however, near the moon's surface is incomparably the greater. But as we recede from the moon, and approach toward the earth, this force decreases while the other augments; till at last a point of station is found between the two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANETS\">planets</a>, where these forces are exactly equal, so that a body placed there must remain at rest; but if it be removed still nearer to the earth, then this planet would have the superior attraction, and the body must fall towards it. If a body then be projected from the moon towards the earth, with a force sufficient to carry it beyond the point of equal attraction, it must necessarily fall on the earth. Such then is the idea of the manner in which the bodies must be made to pass from the moon to the earth, if that can be done, the possibility of which is now necessary to be considered.\n\n\"Now, supposing a mass to be projected from the moon, in a direct line towards the earth, by a volcano, or by the production of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEAM\">steam</a> by subterranean heat; and supposing for the present these two planets to remain at rest; then it has been demonstrated, on the Newtonian estimation of the moon's mass, that a force projecting the body with a velocity of 12,000 feet in a second, would be sufficient to carry it beyond the point of equal attraction. But this estimate of the moon's mass is now allowed to be much above the truth; and on M. la Place's calculation, it appears that a force of little more than half the above power would be sufficient to produce the effect, that is, a force capable of projecting a body with a velocity of less than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> and a half per second. But we have known cannon balls projected by the force of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a>, with a velocity of 2500 feet per second or upwards, that is, about half a mile. It follows, therefore, that a projectile force, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> a velocity about three times that of a cannon ball, would be sufficient to throw the body from the moon beyond the point of equal attraction, and cause it to reach the earth. Now there can be little doubt that a force equal to that is exerted by volcanoes on the earth, as well as by the production of steam by subterranean heat; when we consider the huge masses of rock, so many times larger than cannon balls, thrown on such occasions to heights also so much greater. We may easily imagine, too, such cause of motion to exist in the moon as well as in the earth, and that in a superior degree, if we may judge from the supposed symptoms of volcanoes recently observed in the moon by the powerful tubes of Dr Herschel; and still more, if we consider that all projections from the earth suffer an enormous resistance and diminution, by the dense atmosphere of this planet; while it has been rendered probable, from optical considerations, that the motion has little or no atmosphere at all, to give any such resistance to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROJECTILES\">projectiles</a>.\n\n\"Thus then we are fully authorized in concluding, that the case of possibility is completely made out; that a known power exists in nature, capable of producing the foregoing effect, of detaching a mass of matter from the moon, and transferring it to the earth in the form of a flaming meteor, or burning stone: at the same time we are utterly ignorant of any other process in nature by which the same phenomenon can be produced. Having thus discovered a way in which it is possible to produce those appearances, we shall now endeavour to show, from all the concomitant circumstances, that these accord exceedingly well with the natural effects of the supposed cause, and thence give it a very high degree of probability.\n\n\"This important desideratum will perhaps be best attained, by examining the consequences of a substance supposed to be projected by a volcano from the moon into the sphere of the earth's superior attraction; and then comparing those with the known and visible phenomena of the blazing meteors or burning stones that fall through the air on the earth. And if in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> a striking coincidence or resemblance shall always or mostly be found, it will be difficult for the human mind to resist the persuasion that the assumed cause involves a degree of probability but little short of certainty itself. Now the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> phenomena attending these blazing meteors or burning stones, are these:\n\n1. That they appear or blaze out suddenly.\n2. That they move with a surprising rapid motion, nearly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a>, but a little inclined downwards.\n3. That they move in several different directions with respect to the points of the compass.\n4. That in their flight they yield a loud whizzing sound.\n5. That they commonly burst with a violent explosion and report.\n6. That they fall on the earth with great force in a sloping direction.\n7. That they are very hot at first, remain hot a considerable time, and exhibit visible tokens of fusion on their surface.\n8. That the fallen stony masses have all the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> appearance and contexture, as well as internally the same nature and composition.\n9. That they are totally different from all our terrestrial bodies, both natural and artificial.\n\n\"Now these phenomena will naturally compare with the circumstances of a substance projected by a lunar volcano, and in the order in which they are here enumerated. And first, with respect to the leading circumstance, that of a sudden blazing meteoric appearance, which is not that of a small bright spark, first seen at an immense distance, and then gradually increasing with the diminution of its distance. And this circumstance appears very naturally to result from the assumed cause. For, the body being projected from a lunar volcano, may well be supposed in an ignited state, like inflamed matter thrown upon by our terrestrial volcanoes, which passing through the comparatively <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VACUUM\">vacuum</a>, in the space between the moon and the earth's sensible atmosphere, it will probably enter the superior parts of this atmosphere with but little diminution of its original...\"\nnal heat; from which circumstance, united with that of its violent motion, this being 10 or 12 times that of a cannon ball, and through a part of the atmosphere probably consisting chiefly of the inflammable gas rising from the earth to the top of the atmosphere, the body may well be supposed to be suddenly inflamed, as the natural effect of these circumstances; indeed it would be surprising if it did not. From whence it appears, that the sudden inflammation of the body, on entering the earth's atmosphere, is exactly what might be expected to happen.\n\n\"2. To trace the body through the earth's atmosphere; we are to observe that it enters the top of it with the great velocity acquired by descending from the point of equal attraction, which is such as would carry the body to the earth's surface in a very few additional seconds of time if it met with no obstruction. But as it enters deeper in the atmosphere, it meets with still more and more resistance from the increasing density of the air, by which the great velocity of six miles per second must soon be greatly reduced to one that will be uniform, and only a small part of its former great velocity. This remaining part of its motion will be various in different bodies, being more or less as the body is larger or smaller; and as it is more or less specifically heavy; but, for a particular instance, if the body were a globe of 12 inches diameter, and of the same gravity as the atmospheric stones, the motion would decrease so as to be little more than a quarter of a mile per second of perpendicular descent. Now while the body is thus descending, the earth itself is affected by a twofold motion, both the diurnal and the annual one, with both of which the descent of the body is to be compounded. The earth's motion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROTATION\">rotation</a> at the equator is about 17 miles in a minute, or two-sevenths of a mile in a second; but in the middle latitudes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> little more than the half of that, or little above half a quarter of a mile in a second; and if we compound this motion with that of the descending body, as in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a>, this may cause the body to appear to descend obliquely, though but a little, the motion being nearer the perpendicular than the horizontal direction. But the other motion of the earth, or that in its annual course, is about 20 miles in a second, which is 80 times greater than the perpendicular descent in the instance above mentioned; so that, if this motion be compounded with the descending one of the body, it must necessarily give it the appearance of a very rapid motion, in a direction nearly parallel to the horizon, but a little declining downwards. A circumstance which exactly agrees with the appearances of these meteoric bodies, as stated in the second article of the enumerated phenomena.\n\n\"3. Again, with regard to the apparent direction of the body; this will evidently be various, being that compounded of the body's descent and the direction of the earth's annual motion at the time of the fall, which is itself various in the different seasons of the year, according to the direction of the several points of the ecliptic to the earth's meridian or axis. Usually, however, from the great excess of the earth's motion above that of the falling body, the direction of this must appear to be nearly opposite to that of the former. And in fact this exactly agrees with a remark made by Dr Halley, in his account of the meteors in his paper Meteor above given, where he says that the direction of the meteor's motion was exactly opposite to that of the earth in her orbit. And if this shall generally be found to be the case, it will prove a powerful confirmation of this theory of the lunar substances. Unfortunately, however, the observations on this point are very few, and mostly inaccurate; the angle or direction of the fallen stones has not been recorded; and that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a> meteor commonly mistaken, all the various observers giving it a different course, some even directly the reverse of others. In future, it will be very advisable that the observers of fallen stones, observe and record the direction or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> of the perforation made by the body in the earth, which will give us perhaps the course of the path nearer than any other observation.\n\n\"4. In the flight of these meteoric stones, it is commonly observed, that they yield a loud whizzing sound. Indeed it would be surprising if they did not. For if the like sound be given by the smooth and regularly formed cannon ball, and heard at a considerable distance, how exceedingly great must be that of a body so much larger, which is of an irregular form and surface too, and striking the air with 50 or 100 times the velocity.\n\n\"5. That they commonly burst and fly in pieces in their rapid flight, is a circumstance exceedingly likely to happen, both from the violent state of fusion on their surface, and from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> rapidity of their motion through the air. If a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRINDING\">grinding</a> stone, from its quick rotation, be sometimes burst and fly in pieces, and if the same thing happen to cannon balls when made of stone and discharged with considerable velocity, merely by the friction and resistance of the air; how much more is the same to be expected to happen to the atmospheric stones, moving with more than 50 times the velocity, and when their surface may well be supposed to be partly loosened or dissolved by the extremity of the heat there.\n\n\"6. That the stones strike the ground with a great force, and penetrate to a considerable depth, as is usually observed, is a circumstance only to be expected from the extreme rapidity of their motion, and their great weight, when we consider that a cannon ball, or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTAR\">mortar</a> shell, will often <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURY\">bury</a> itself many inches, or even some feet in the earth.\n\n\"7. That these stones, when soon sought after and found, are hot, and exhibit the marks of recent fusion, are also the natural consequences of the extreme degree of inflammation in which their surface had been put during their flight through the air.\n\n\"8. That these stony masses have all the same external appearance and contexture, as well as internally the same nature and composition, are circumstances that strongly point out an identity of origin, whatever may be the cause to which they owe so generally uniform a conformation. And when it is considered,\n\n\"9. That in those respects they differ totally from all terrestrial compositions hitherto known or discovered, they lead the mind strongly to ascribe them to some other origin than the earth we inhabit; and none so likely as coming from our neighbouring planet.\n\n\"Upon the whole then (continues Dr Hutton), it appears\nappears highly probable, that the flaming meteors, and the burning stones, that fall on the earth, are one and the same thing. It also appears impossible, or in the extremest degree improbable, to ascribe these either to a formation in the superior parts of the atmosphere, or to the eruptions of terrestrial volcanoes, or to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a> by lightning striking the earth. But, on the other hand, that it is possible for such masses to be projected from the moon so as to reach the earth; and that all the phenomena of these meteors or falling stones, having a surprising conformity with the circumstances of masses that may be expelled from the moon by natural causes, unite in forming a body of strong evidence, that this is in all probability and actually the case.\n\nM. Poisson, an ingenious French mathematician, has shown by an algebraical calculation, the possibility of a projectile reaching our planet from the moon. His calculation, however, which may be found in the work of Izarn, quoted above, (p. 238, et seq.) proceeds on the supposition that our satellite has no atmosphere, or next to none. There are, no doubt, appearances which seem to favour this supposition, but they do not amount to positive proof of the fact. Even could the latter be established, the combustion of a volcano, without the presence of atmospheric air, would remain to be explained. But, granting this difficulty too be surmounted, there are other circumstances which we cannot easily reconcile to the lunar hypothesis. The occasional arrival of fragments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAVA\">lava</a> on the earth's surface, would argue, on a fair computation of chances, such a copious discharge of volcanic matters, that the moon, by this time, would consist of hardly anything else. Again, if we may be allowed to reason from analogy, the volcanic productions of the moon should exhibit varieties of aspect and composition like those with which we are acquainted, and not a definite and precise number of the same ingredients. We may also remark, that the soft and incoherent state of several of the recent specimens of meteorolites can ill accord with their supposed passage through any considerable portion of space; and that the l'Aigle phenomenon, which is so distinctly recorded, evidently suggests the notion of instantaneous formation in the atmosphere. And, though this view of the subject may be regarded by some as inexplicable, we cannot conceive that it is more so than the doctrine of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CRYSTALLIZATION\">crystallization</a>, or than many of the results of chemical combination, whose existence it is impossible to deny. These and other arguments may, we apprehend, be fairly urged against any theory which attempts to explain the history of meteors by the agency of lunar volcanoes.\n\nThe hypothesis of Dr Chladni, which likewise boasts of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a>, though still more extravagant than the preceding, deserves to be stated. As earthly, metallic, and other particles form the principal component parts of our planet, among which iron is the prevailing part, other planetary bodies, he affirms, may consist of similar, or, perhaps, the same component parts, though combined and modified in a very different manner. There may also be dense matters accumulated in smaller masses, without being in immediate connexion with the larger planetary bodies, dispersed throughout infinite space, and which, being impelled either by some projecting power or attraction, continue to move until they approach the earth, or some other body; when, being overcome by attractive force, they immediately fall down. By their exceeding great velocity, still increased by the attraction of the earth and the violent friction in the atmosphere, a strong electricity and heat must necessarily be excited, by which means they are reduced to a flaming and melted condition, and great quantities of vapour and different kinds of gases are thus disengaged, which distend the liquid mass to a monstrous size, till, by a still farther expansion of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> fluids, they must at length explode. That portions of cosmical matter are allowed to revolve in space, and to terminate their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAREER\">career</a> on the surface of a planet, is a position too gratuitous and vague, to be readily admitted, but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> of which involves no principle of atheism or impiety, as some of Dr Chladni's antagonists have very unhandsomely insinuated. If worlds disappear and others <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> into existence, a sportive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> may be permitted to indulge in the innocent supposition, that fragments of their materials are detached from their fractured masses, and obey those laws of attraction which seem to extend their influence to the remotest corners of the universe.\n\nSuch of our readers as are solicitous of obtaining more ample information on the subject of this article, may consult Izarn's Lithologie Atmospherique; Biot's Relation d'un Voyage fait dans le departement de l'<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORNE\">Orne</a>, pour constater la realite d'un Meteor observe a l'Aigle; B\u00f6ttiger's Observations on the Accents given by ancient authors of Stones said to have fallen from the Clouds; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FULDA\">Fulda</a>'s Memoir on Fire-balls; Cavallo's Elements of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\">Natural <a class=\"</a>xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">Philosophy</a>; Klaproth on Meteoric Stones; Soldani's Account of the Tuscan Meteor; Chladni's Treatise on the Siberian Mass of Iron; Mr Edward King's Remarks concerning Stones said to have fallen from the Clouds; and several of the more recent transactions of learned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a> and periodical scientific communications, as those of the Royal Society of London, of the Institute at Paris, the Journal de Physique, Annales de Chimie, Biblioth\u00e8que Britannique, Decade Philosophique, Journal des Mines, Philosophical Magazine, Nicholson's Journal, &c. &c.","sp":739,"ep":754},{"h":"METEOROLOGICAL","t":"something belonging to meteors.\n\nMeteorological Journal, is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> recording the daily state of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, exhibited by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAROMETER\">barometer</a>, thermometer, hygrometer, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANEMOMETER\">anemometer</a>, and other meteorological instruments.

That the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> is sometimes hotter and sometimes colder than usual; that it is at one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> much rarefied, and at another greatly condensed; now uncommonly dry, and now surcharged with moisture\u2014are circumstances that daily meet the senses of the most casual observer, as they are circumstances that powerfully, and often unpleasantly, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARREST\">arrest</a> his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>. That these changes are the result of decompositions and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a> that are continually going on in the atmosphere, and of new modifications of its component principles, is manifest to him who is acquainted merely with the first elements of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> chemistry.\n\nIndeed to modern chemistry this science is indebted for the progress it has made within the last 50 years; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> which may be considered as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> epoch of meteorology. In fact, this science is still in its infancy; but from the ardour with which it is now cultivated, from the abilities of the philosophers who are engaged in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a>, and from the progress that is daily making in the kindred sciences, we may reasonably look forward to a period, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> great distance, when it shall please the great Author of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> to unveil many of those wonders which are now involved in darkness and obscurity, and permit us to control the jarring elements, as he has allowed us to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> dominion over the beasts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, the fowls of the air, and the fishes of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>.\n\nA late ingenious writer on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> has suggested some useful hints for the improvement of meteorology, which we shall here extract. \"With this view, our first step must be that recommended by Mr Kirwan and others, to establish corresponding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a> in different parts of the world; these societies must be furnished with similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a>, equally adjusted, and graduated in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a>, for making observations on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>. In our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be necessary to procure registers, carefully kept, from the different parts of the sea <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a>, and from those parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> situated in the interior. The various <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAROMETER\">barometer</a>, thermometer, hygrometer, and electroscope, should be carefully noted; with the variations and the degrees of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>, as well as the diurnal and nocturnal aspect of the heavens discriminately marked; the appearance of the sky; and in familiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, such as might be understood by the respective and distant observers; for instance, whether the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> is totally or partially obscured by vapour;\u2014whether the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">clouds</a> are mottled, or fleaky;\u2014whether they assume the appearance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> streaks, or appear in radii apparently from a centre\u2014or in masses of dense vapour\u2014or loose and fleecy\u2014or those familiarly known by the name of mare-tail clouds\u2014with any other new or accustomed phenomena. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> terms fair, cloudy, or wet, are insufficient for forming a judgment of the weather; as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> fair is generally at present expressed only in opposition to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a>, without distinguishing whether the atmosphere is obscure, dull, or bright. The appearance of the stratum of air on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-EARTH_S\">earth's</a> surface, that is, the space between the clouds and the earth, should be always accurately described. Is there a blue haze, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIST\">mist</a>, and dense fog? or is the air transparent? which is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> when distant objects appear more than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> distinct and near to the eye of the observer: the temperature of the ocean at full tide should be frequently ascertained, as it will be found to have considerable influence in these respects on an insular country. By the remarks of observers, stationed in various parts of our coasts, we should soon be enabled to discover when vapour is wafted in from the sea, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> by the aqueous and vegetable surface of our island. During a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>-west wind, which is frequently attended with storms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIL\">hail</a> and rain, and usually experienced in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>, an observer stationed on the coast of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SLIGO\">Sligo</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>, or Denbighshire in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a>, might ascertain whether the disposition of the atmosphere to storm and cloud came in with the air from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATLANTIC_OCEAN\">Atlantic ocean</a>, or was generated by the vapours of our own island. It would be desirable also again, that the temperature and blue hazy appearance of the atmosphere during the north-east winds, so common in May and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a>, should be noticed by observers on the north-east coast, in the counties of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LINCOLN\">Lincoln</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSEX\">Essex</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KENT\">Kent</a>; and by others, on the opposite western coasts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEMBROKE\">Pembroke</a>, Devon, and Cornwall, so as to determine what changes in temperature this wind undergoes in its passage over the island; and whether or not the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of haze increases or diminishes by its progress from either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>; and whether the vapour is more or less disposed to produce storms?\n\nBy such comparative observations on the coast, conjoined with those made by others in the central parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>, we might rapidly proceed in meteorological science, or, as it is commonly called, a knowledge of the weather. The observations made in the interior of the country would enable us at all times to trace the origin and progress of storms: in situations where tillage or pasturage is most attended to, the effects of spring frosts and blights should be particularly noticed, as well as the first appearance of the aphis and coccus, the caterpillar and larve of other insects, on fruit trees, and particularly those peculiar to the hop plantations. The first opening of the vernal foliage on trees and hedges in the spring, should likewise be remarked, and compared with the starting up grass on the highly\nhighly manured pastures in the neighbourhood of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>, and on those also assisted with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANURE\">manure</a>, as well as the natural herbage on the commons and wastes. Some attention should be paid to the effects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a> storms, in destroying the aphids and other destructive insects, the pest of fruit and hop plantations; and the first appearance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILDEW\">mildew</a> or rust on wheat should be particularly observed, and remarks made to ascertain, whether or not the moisture, which occasions the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> in its commencement was attended with wind and rain, or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> damp state of the air. The different kinds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, where the crops, from the disease, suffered most, should be noticed, and the situation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> for ventilation, with the height of the fences, size of inclosures, and vicinity to coppices, trees, or hedge-rows.*\n\nThe importance of the study of meteorology requires little elucidation. In climates where the succession of seasons is nearly stated and regular, where the periods of parching drought or deluging torrents, of the tempestuous hurricane or the refreshing breeze, are fixed and ascertained, mankind has little to do, but expect the dreaded changes, and provide against their devastations; but in countries like our own, where all the vicissitudes of seasons may take place in the course of a few hours, it is of the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> to investigate the nature of the change, and the circumstances that precede or accompany it. To the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">farmer</a>, the mariner, the traveller, the physician, meteorology is in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> a study of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a>; to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> it is a study of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> and delight; and to the observer of nature it affords objects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a> and sublimity not to be found in any other department of his favourite science. Surely nothing can contribute more to elevate the mind of man, to raise it \"from nature up to nature's God,\" than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a> of the sweeping whirlwind, the dazzling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a>, or the awful thunder.\n\nOur limits will not admit of our entering into a historical detail of the progress of meteorology; but it may be proper in this place to enumerate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> writers on this science both in our own country and on the continent.\n\nIn this country, we may reckon Dr Kirwan, (in his \"Estimate of the Temperature of different Climates\"), his \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> on the Variations of the Atmosphere,\" and in the Irish Transactions,\" Mr John Dalton (chiefly in the \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANCHESTER\">Manchester</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a>\"), Col. Capper (in his Introduction \"Observations on the Winds and Monsoons\"), Mr Williams (in his \"Climate of Great Britain\"), and Mr Luke Howard (in the Philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGAZINE\">Magazine</a>), Writers on the principal cultivators of meteorological knowledge; and on the continent, the names of Cotte logi (\"Traite de Meteorologie,\" and Journal de Physique), Sanssure (\"Essai sur l'Hygrometrie,\" and Voyage aux Alpes\"), De Luc (A) (\"Recherches sur les Modifications de l'Atmosphere,\" \"Idees sur la Meteorologie,\" and other works), and Lamarck (see Journ. de Phys. passim) stand most conspicuous in this branch of natural science. The names of some of the more recent writers are mentioned in the article Meteorology, Supplement, which see.\n\nIn considering the subject of meteorology, we may properly divide it into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> general heads: 1. Of the changes which take place in the gravity of the air; 2. Of the changes of the temperature of the air; 3. Of the changes produced by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a> and rain; 4. Of the changes produced by winds; 5. Of atmospherical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTRICITY\">electricity</a>; 6. Of meteors, or those visible phenomena accompanied with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, which take place in the atmosphere or near the surface of the earth; and, 7. The application of the principles of meteorology to the useful purposes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. Of these heads, the fifth has been already fully considered under Electricity, and much of the sixth has been exhausted under Meteorolite. The remaining circumstances will form the subjects of the following chapters.\n\nChap. I. Of the Changes which take place in the Gravity of the Air.\n\nMany of the facts relating to this part of our subject have been already anticipated under the article Barometer, and several circumstances <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> to be considered more properly under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PNEUMATICS\">Pneumatics</a> than in this place. We shall here confine ourselves to a general view of the changes in the gravity of the atmosphere, as indicated by the barometer, in various situations on or near the surface of the earth, and briefly examine the conclusions that may be drawn from them.\n\nThe most general fact indicated by the barometer is, that this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> shows us the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> of air highest at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> of the sea.\n\n(A) In again mentioning the name of a philosopher so respectable as M. de Luc, we embrace the first opportunity of doing him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, and of vindicating his character against an unfortunate misconception of the late Professor Robison, a mistake which we have inadvertently contributed to disseminate, by quoting Dr Robison's statement in our account of Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">Black</a>, where M. de Luc is accused of having arrogated to himself Dr Black's discovery of latent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>.\n\nM. de Luc's vindication of himself (as printed in the 12th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> Review) is before the public. We owe it to candour and justice to acknowledge our conviction that Dr Robison was too hasty in his assertion, and that M. de Luc, so far from arrogating to himself the doctrine of latent heat, has, in various parts of his numerous writings, expressly mentioned Dr Black as the author of that doctrine. This will appear from the following citations. In his \"Introduction \u00e0 la Physique terrestre,\" p. 102, M. de Luc thus expresses himself. \"No connoissant point le fien latent, dans la vapeur \u00e0 toute temp\u00e9rature, dont la premi\u00e8re d\u00e9couverte est due au Dr Black, &c. Again, p. 232. of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>. \"Ce qui d\u00e9veloppait l'id\u00e9e de chaleur latente par laquelle le Dr Black avait d\u00e9sign\u00e9 ce ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne\"\u2014and at p. 385, \"Le Dr Black ayant d\u00e9couvert qu'une certaine quantit\u00e9 de chaleur dispara\u00eet quand la vapeur de l'eau bouillante se forme, nomma ce ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne chaleur latente dans la vapeur.\"\n\nWe trust that these quotations, with M. de Luc's own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTIFICATION\">justification</a> of himself above referred to, will be sufficient to exculpate him from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of literary felony so warmly brought against him by Professor Robison; and we have no doubt the Professor himself, were he still alive, would under such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> retract his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCUSATION\">accusation</a>.\nGravity of air whose base is equal to the diameter of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a> in the tube, and whose height is equal to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of the atmosphere above the place of observation. As the height of this column must vary in different situations, and must, ceteris paribus, be greatest at the level of the sea, the mercury in the tube will, under the same circumstances, stand highest in such a situation.\n\nThe medium height of the barometer at the level of the sea is 30 inches, as has been found by observations in the British channel, and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a> sea, at the temperatures of 55\u00b0 and 65\u00b0; on the coast of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERU\">Peru</a> at the temperature of 84\u00b0, and in latitude 80\u00b0. As we ascend above the surface of the earth, the medium height of the mercury diminishes; and some late observations made in balloons at a considerable distance above the tops of the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>, have shown that in the higher regions of the air, the column of mercury is very considerably shortened. This fact, as we have seen (see Barometer), has been usefully applied to the measuring of heights and depths that cannot be ascertained by the usual geometrical methods.\n\nAs the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> gravity of the atmosphere is constantly varying even in the same place, the column of air pressing on the surface of the mercury without the tube, must press with more or less force, in proportion as these changes are greater; and hence the barometer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> out these variations, falling when the atmosphere is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a>, and rising when it is heavier than usual.\n\nFor an account of the observations that were made on the rise and fall of the barometer by the earlier philosophers, and the attempts which were made by them to explain these phenomena, see Barometer.\n\nIt will be of advantage here to consider the variations of the barometer, as they take place in different situations, in order, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> possible, to point out the cause by which these variations are produced, as this cause must have considerable influence on the changes of the weather.\n\nIt is found, that between the tropics the variations of the barometer are exceedingly small, and it is remarkable, that in that part of the world it does not descend above half as much for every 200 feet of elevation as it does beyond the tropics*. In the torrid zone, too, the barometer is elevated about \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of a line twice every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>; and this elevation happens at the same time with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-TIDES\">tides</a> of the sea\u2020.\n\nAs the latitude advances towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-POLES\">poles</a>, the range of the barometer gradually increases, till at last it amounts to two or three inches. This gradual increase will appear from the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>.\n\n| Latitude | Places       | Range of the Barometer |\n|----------|--------------|------------------------|\n| 0\u00b0       | Peru         | Greatest: 0.20         |\n| 22\u00b0      | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CALCUTTA\">Calcutta</a>     | Greatest: 0.77         |\n| 40\u00b0      | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPLES\">Naples</a>       | Greatest: 1.00         |\n| 51\u00b0      | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOVER\">Dover</a>        | Greatest: 2.47         |\n| 53\u00b0      | Middlewick   | Greatest: 3.00         |\n| 53\u00b0      | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIVERPOOL\">Liverpool</a>    | Greatest: 2.89         |\n| 59\u00b0      | Petersburgh  | Greatest: 3.45         |\n\nThere is, however, some exception to this general rule, as in North <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a> the range of the barometer is much less than in the corresponding European latitudes.\n\nThe range of the barometer is greater at the level of the sea than on mountains, and in the same degree of latitude the extent of the range is in the inverse ratio of the height of the place above the level of the sea.\n\nIt appears probable that the barometer has a tendency to rise during the day from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> to evening, and that this tendency is greatest between 2 and 9 P.M., the greatest elevation being at this last period. The elevation at 2 differs from that at 9 by \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), while that at 2 differs from the morning elevation only by \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\); and that in certain climates the greatest elevation takes place at 2 o'clock*.\n\nThe range of the barometer is greater in winter than in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, as appears from some observations made at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KENDAL\">Kendal</a> during five years; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> range from October to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> being 7.982, and that from April to September being only 5.447\u2020.\n\nWhen the atmosphere is serene and settled the mercury is generally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>; and in calm weather, when it is inclined to rain, the mercury is low. On the approach of high winds it sinks, as it does with a southerly wind, but rises very high on the approach of easterly and northerly winds. It is found, however, that at Calcutta, the mercury is highest with north-westerly and northerly, and lowest with south-easterly winds.\n\nThe mercury suddenly falls on the approach of tempests, and during their continuance undergoes great oscillations.\n\nTo these general facts that have been observed on the rise and fall of the barometer, we shall annex the following axioms by M. Cotte.\n\n1. The greatest changes of the barometer commonly take place during clear weather, with a north wind; and the small risings during cloudy, rainy, or windy weather, with a south, or nearly south wind.\n\n2. The state of the mercury changes more in the winter than in the summer months; so that its greatest rising and falling takes place in winter; but its mean elevation is greater in summer than in winter.\n\n3. The changes of the state of the barometer are nearly null at the equator, and become greater the more one removes from it towards the poles.\n\n4. They are more considerable in valleys than on mountains.\n\n5. The more variable the wind, the more changeable the state of the barometer.\n\n6. It is lower at midnight and noon than at other periods of the day; its greatest daily height is towards evening.\n\n7. Between 10 at night and 2 in the morning, and also in the day, the rising and falling of the mercury are less; the contrary is the case between 6 and 10 in the morning and evening.\n\n8. Between 2 and 6 in the morning and evening it rises as often as it falls; but in such a manner that it oftener rises about that time in the winter months, and falls oftener in the summer months.\n\n9. The oscillations are less in summer, greater in winter, and very great at the equinoxes.\nGravity of the Air.\n\n10. They are greater also in the daytime than during the night.\n\n11. The higher the sun rises above the horizon, the less are the oscillations; they increase as he approaches the western side of the horizon, and are exceedingly great when he comes opposite to the eastern part of the horizon.\n\n12. They are, to a certain degree, independent of the changes of temperature.\n\n13. The mercury generally rises between the new and the full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>, and falls between the latter and the new moon.\n\n14. It rises more in the apogee than the perigee; it usually rises between the northern lunisitice and the southern, and falls between the southern lunisitice and the northern.\n\n15. In general, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of the variations of the mercury with the positions of the moon gives nothing certain; the results of No. 13. and 14. are the most constant.\n\n16. In the neighbourhood of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> the barometer never continues 24 hours without changing.\n\n17. The barometers in the western districts rise and fall sooner than those in the more eastern.\n\n18. When the sun passes the meridian, the mercury, if falling, continues to fall, and its fall is often hastened.\n\n19. When the mercury at the same period is rising, it falls, remains <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a>, or rises more slowly.\n\n20. When the mercury, under the same circumstances, is stationary, it falls, unless, before or after it becomes stationary, it has been in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of rising.\n\n21. The above changes commonly take place between 11 in the morning and 1 in the afternoon, but oftener before than after noon.\n\n22. Before high tides there is almost always a great fall of the mercury; this takes place oftener at the full than the new moon.\n\nSuch is a general view of the variations in the gravity of the air, as far as they have been observed by the barometer; and we shall now endeavour to give some plausible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of them.\n\nIt is evident that the density of the atmosphere is least at the equator, and greatest at the poles; for at the equator the centrifugal force, the distance from the centre of the earth, and the heat (all of which tend to diminish the density of the air), are at their maximum, while at the poles they are at their minimum. The mean height of the barometer at the level of the sea, all over the globe, is 30 inches; the weight of the atmosphere, therefore, is the same all over the globe. This weight depends on the density and height of the air; where the density is greatest, its height must be least; and on the contrary, where its density is least, its height must be greatest. The height of the atmosphere, therefore, must be greatest at the equator, and least at the poles; and it must decrease gradually between the equator and the poles, so that its upper surface will resemble two inclined planes, meeting above the equator their highest parts.\n\nDuring summer, when the sun is in our hemisphere, the mean heat between the equator and the pole does not differ so much as in winter. Hence the rarity of the atmosphere at the pole, and consequently its height, will be increased. The upper surface of the atmosphere, therefore, in the northern hemisphere, will be less inclined; while that of the southern hemisphere, from contrary causes, will be much more inclined. The reverse will take place during our winter.\n\nThe density of the atmosphere depends in a great measure on the pressure of the superincumbent column, and therefore decreases according to the height, as the pressure of the superincumbent column constantly decreases. But the density of the atmosphere in the torrid zone will not decrease so fast as in the temperate and frigid zones, because its column is larger, and because there is a greater proportion of air in the higher part of this column. This accounts for the observation of Mr Casson, that the barometer sinks only half as much for every 200 feet of elevation in the torrid as in the temperate zones. The density of the atmosphere at the equator, therefore, though at the surface of the earth it is less, must at a certain height equal, and at a still greater must exceed, the density of the atmosphere in the temperate zones and at the poles.\n\nWe shall presently endeavour to prove, that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of air is constantly ascending at the equator, and that part of it at least reaches and continues in the higher parts of the atmosphere. From the fluidity of northern air it is evident that it cannot accumulate above the latitudes of the equator, but must roll <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-INCLINED_PLANE\">inclined <a cl</a>ass=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> which the upper surface of the atmosphere assumes towards the poles. As the surface of the atmosphere of the northern hemisphere is more inclined during our winter than that of the southern hemisphere, a greater quantity of the equatorial current of air must flow over upon the northern than upon the southern hemisphere; so that the quantity of our atmosphere will be greater during winter than that of the southern hemisphere; but during summer the reverse will take place. Hence the greatest mercurial heights take place during winter, and the range of the barometer is less in summer than in winter.\n\nThe density of the atmosphere is in a great measure regulated by the heat of the place; wherever the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> is greatest, there the density of the atmosphere will be greatest, and its column shortest. High countries, and ranges of lofty mountains, the tops of which are covered with snow the greatest part of the year, must be much colder than other places situated in the same degree of latitude, and consequently the column of air over them much shorter. The current of superior air will linger and accumulate over these places in its passage towards the poles, and thus occasion an irregularity in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, which will produce a similar irregularity in the barometer. Such accumulations will be formed over the north-western parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>, and over North America; hence the barometer usually stands higher, and varies less there, than in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. Accumulations also are formed upon the Pyrenees, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALPS\">Alps</a>, the mountains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TURKEY\">Turkey</a> in Europe, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TARTARY\">Tartary</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIBET\">Tibet</a>. When these accumulations have gone on for some time, the density of the air becomes too great to be balanced by the surrounding atmosphere; it rushes down on the neighbouring countries, and produces cold winds which raise the barometer. Hence the rise of the barometer which generally attends north-east winds in Europe, as they proceed from accumulations in the north-west of Asia, or about the pole; hence, too, the north-west wind from the mountains of Tibet raises the barometer at Calcutta.\nWe shall presently endeavour to show, that considerable quantities of air are occasionally destroyed in the north polar regions. When this happens, the atmosphere to the south rushes in to supply the deficiency. Hence south-west winds take place, and the barometer falls.\n\nAs the mean heat of our hemisphere differs in different years, the density of the atmosphere, and consequently the quantity of equatorial air which flows towards the poles, must also be variable. Does this range correspond to the mean annual heat; that is to say, Is the range greatest when the heat is least, and least when the heat is greatest? In some years greater accumulations than usual take place in the mountainous parts of the south of Europe and Asia, owing, perhaps, to earlier falls of snow or to the rays of the sun having been excluded by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> fogs. When this takes place, the atmosphere in the polar regions will be proportionally lighter. Hence the prevalence of southerly winds during some winters more than others.\n\nAs the heat in the torrid zone never differs much, the density, and consequently the height, of the atmosphere, will not vary much. Hence the range of the barometer within the tropics is comparatively small; and it increases gradually as we approach the poles, because the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of the temperature, and consequently of the density, of the atmosphere, increases with the latitude.\n\nThe diurnal elevation of the barometer in the torrid zone corresponding to the tides, observed by Mr Casson and others, must be owing to the influence of the moon on the atmosphere. This influence, notwithstanding the ingenious attempts of D'Alembert and several other philosophers, seem altogether inadequate to account for the various phenomena of the winds. It is not so easy to account for the tendency which the barometer has to rise as the day advances. Perhaps it may be accounted for by the additional quantity of vapour added to the atmosphere, which by increasing the quantity of the atmosphere, may possibly be adequate to produce the effect.\n\nThe falls of the barometer which precede, and the oscillations which accompany, violent storms and hurricanes, shew us that these phenomena are produced by very great rarefactions, or perhaps destructions of air, in particular parts of the atmosphere. The falls of the barometer, too, that accompany winds, proceed from the same cause. The observation made by Mr Copeland, that a high barometer is accompanied by a temperature above the mean, will be easily accounted for by every one acquainted with Dr Black's theory of latent heat. The higher the mercury stands, the denser the atmosphere must be; and the denser it becomes, the more latent heat it must give out. It is well known that air evolves heat when condensed artificially. The falling of the barometer, which generally precedes rain, remains still to be accounted for; but we know too little about the causes by which rain is produced, to be able to account for it in a satisfactory manner.\n\nIt has been for some time suspected that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> of the barometer is affected by the changes of the moon. The theory of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUNAR\">lunar</a> influence has been discussed on the continent chiefly by Lamarek and Cotte, (see Journal de Physique, passim); and in this country by Mr Luke Howard. Mr Howard's suspicions of this influence on the barometer were first conceived, in consequence of the printed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CHARTS\">charts</a>, of which he made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> in keeping a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGISTER\">register</a> of the barometer, having the phases of the moon marked on them, and of his observing a remarkable coincidence between these and certain states of the mercury. This coincidence consists in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPRESSION\">depression</a> of the barometrical line on the approach of the new and full moon, and its elevation on that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>. In above 30 out of the 50 lunar weeks in the year 1798, the barometer was found to have changed its general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> once in each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>, in such a manner as to be either rising or at its maximum, for the week preceding and following, about the time of each quarter; and to be either falling or at its minimum, for the two weeks, about the new and full. It is remarkable, that the point of greatest depression during the year, viz. to 28.67, was found about 12 hours after the new moon on the 8th of November; and, that at its greatest and extraordinary elevation to 30.89, on the 7th of February, at the time of the last quarter. Moreover, this coincidence appeared to take place most regularly in fair and moderate weather; and, in general, when the barometer fell, during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> between the new or full moon and the quarters, an evident perturbation in the atmosphere accompanied; of which may be instanced February 15. to 23. when the barometer, after an uncommon rise, continued to fall rapidly after the new moon, with severe cold, which ended suddenly in stormy and wet weather; again, June 13. to 20. when two weeks of fair weather ended in a thunder storm. In the greater part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> the usual coincidence disappeared, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONVERSE\">converse</a> took place; the barometer being low at the quarter and high at the full, amidst continual alternations of rain, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FROST\">frost</a>, and snow, and, for part of the time, high winds. On the two days preceding the last quarter, the barometer rose rapidly, and rain followed.\n\nOn the whole, Mr Howard thought there appeared sufficient ground, on the evidence of the year 1798, to suppose that the gravity of our atmosphere, as indicated by the barometer, may be subject to certain periodical changes, effected by a cause more steady and regular than either change of temperature, currents, or solution and precipitation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, to which he believes the whole variation has been heretofore attributed.\n\nThe mean of the register at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> appeared to be 29.89, whence it appears that the depression at the new and full moon either amounted to more, on the whole, than the elevations at the quarters, or that they fell out nearer to the time. He was quite satisfied, in passing through this register, that if he had allowed himself to choose the higher rotations about the quarters, and the lower about the new and full, with a latitude of 24 or 36 hours, it would have made the results as much more favourable to his conclusions as in the former case.\n\nNow, to omit the consideration of other proofs for the present, it appeared to him evident, that the atmosphere is subject to a periodical change of gravity, whereby the barometer, on a mean of ten years, is depressed at least one-tenth of an inch while the moon is passing from the quarters to the full and new; and elevated, in the same proportion, during the return to the quarter. To what causes shall we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> this periodical change, other than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> of the sun and moon for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> composing the atmosphere?\n\nThe atmosphere is a gravitating fluid, differing, in a physical\nTemperature of the Air.\n\nPhysical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, from the water, chiefly in possessing less gravity; and it is demonstrated *a priori* on the principles of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NEWTONIAN_PHILOSOPHY\">Newtonian philosophy</a>, that it ought to have its tides as well as the ocean, although in a degree as much less perceptible as is its gravity.\n\nHe supposes, therefore, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> attractions of the sun and moon at the new moon, and the attraction of the moon predominating over the sun's weaker attraction at the full, tend to depress the barometer, by taking off from the gravity of the atmosphere, as they produce a high tide in the waters, by taking off from their gravity; and, again, that the attraction of the moon being diminished by that of the sun at her quarters, this diminution tends to make a high barometer, together with a low tide, by permitting each fluid to press with additional gravity upon the earth.*\n\n**CHAP. II. Of the Changes which take place in the Temperature of the Air.**\n\nIt is obvious to the most careless observer, that the temperature of the air varies considerably even in the same place, and at the same season. This constant variation must be attributed to the reflected rays of the sun, which communicate heat from the surface of the earth to the surrounding atmosphere. As from this cause the heat of those places which are so situated as to be most warmed by the sun's rays is always greatest, and as this temperature varies in every place with the season of the year, and diminishes according to the height of the air above the surface; and as the earth at the equator is exposed to the most perpendicular rays of the sun, the earth is there hottest; and its heat diminishes gradually from the equator to the poles. Of course, the temperature of the air must vary in the same manner, being hottest over the equator, and diminishing in temperature towards the poles, where it is coldest. Though it is hottest at the equator, its heat, as in all other situations, gradually diminishes there, as we ascend above the surface of the earth.\n\nThough there is a considerable difference in every part of the world between the temperature of the atmosphere in summer and in winter; though in the same season the temperature of almost every day, and even every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>, differs from that which precedes and follows it; though the heat varies continually in the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> and seemingly capricious manner\u2014still there is a certain mean temperature in every climate, which the atmosphere has always a tendency to observe, and which it neither exceeds nor comes short of beyond a certain number of degrees. What this temperature is, may be known by taking the mean of tables of observations kept for a number of years; and our knowledge of it must be the more accurate the greater the number of observations is.\n\nThe mean annual temperature is greatest at the equator (or at least a degree or two on the north side of it), and it diminishes gradually towards the poles, where it is least. This diminution takes place in arithmetical progression, or, to speak more properly, the annual temperatures of all the latitudes are arithmetical means between the mean annual temperature of the equator and that of the pole. This was first ascertained by Mr Meyer; and Dr Kirwan, improving on Meyer's hint, has calculated in the following table the mean annual temperature of every latitude between the equator and the pole. It must be remarked, however, that this table is calculated only for a particular part of the earth's surface, viz. that part of the Atlantic ocean which lies between the 80\u00b0 of northern, and the 45\u00b0 of southern latitude, extending westward as far as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GULF\">Gulf</a> stream, and to within a few leagues of the coast of America, and for all that part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PACIFIC_OCEAN\">Pacific ocean</a> that reaches from 45\u00b0 of north latitude to 40\u00b0 of south latitude, and extending between the 20th and 27th degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a> east from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>. This part of the ocean is called by Dr Kirwan the standard, and was best suited to his purpose, as the rest of the ocean is subject to irregularities, which will be noticed presently (d).

Let the mean annual heat at the equator be $m$ and at the pole $m-n$; but $\\phi$ for any other latitude; the mean annual temperature of that latitude will be $m-n\\times\\sin\\phi$. If, therefore, the temperature of any two latitudes be known, the value of $m$ and $n$ may be found. Now, the temperature of north latitude 40\u00b0 has been found by the best observations to be 62.1\u00b0.\nDr Kirwan has also calculated in the following table the mean monthly temperature of the same standard (E).\n\n| Latit. | 80\u00b0 | 79\u00b0 | 78\u00b0 | 77\u00b0 | 76\u00b0 | 75\u00b0 | 74\u00b0 | 73\u00b0 | 72\u00b0 | 71\u00b0 | 70\u00b0 | 69\u00b0 | 68\u00b0 | 67\u00b0 | 66\u00b0 | 65\u00b0 | 64\u00b0 | 63\u00b0 | 62\u00b0 |\n|-------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| Jan.  | 22. | 22.5| 23. | 23.5| 24. | 24.5| 25. | 25.5| 26. | 26.5| 27. | 27.5| 28. | 28. | 28. | 29. | 30. | 31. |\n| Feb.  | 23. | 23. | 23.5| 24. | 24.5| 25. | 25.5| 26. | 26.5| 27. | 27.5| 28. | 28.5| 29. | 30. | 31. | 32. | 33. |\n| March | 27. | 27.5| 28. | 28.5| 29. | 29.5| 30. | 30.5| 31. | 31.5| 32. | 32.5| 33. | 33.5| 34. | 35. | 36. | 37. |\n| April | 32.6| 32.9| 33.2| 33.7| 34.1| 34.5| 35. | 35.5| 36. | 36.5| 37.2| 37.8| 38.4| 39.1| 39.7| 40.4| 41.2| 41.9| 42.7|\n| May   | 36.5| 36.5| 37. | 37.5| 38. | 38.5| 39. | 39.5| 40. | 40.5| 41. | 41.5| 42. | 42.5| 43. | 44. | 45. | 46. | 47. |\n| June  | 51. | 51. | 51.5| 52. | 52. | 52.5| 53. | 53.5| 54. | 54.5| 54.5| 54.5| 54.5| 54.5| 54.5| 54.5| 55. | 55.5| 56. |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a>  | 50. | 50. | 50.5| 51. | 51. | 51.5| 52. | 52.5| 53. | 53.5| 53.5| 53.5| 54. | 54.5| 54.5| 55. | 55.5| 55.5| 56. |\n| Aug.  | 39.5| 40. | 41. | 41.5| 42. | 42.5| 43. | 43.5| 44. | 44.5| 45. | 45.5| 46. | 47. | 48. | 48.5| 49. | 50. | 51. |\n| Sept. | 33.5| 34. | 34.5| 35. | 35.5| 36. | 36.5| 37. | 38. | 38.5| 39. | 39.5| 40. | 41. | 42. | 43. | 44. | 45. | 46. |\n| Oct.  | 28.5| 29. | 29.5| 30. | 30.5| 31. | 31.5| 32. | 32.5| 33. | 33.5| 34. | 34.5| 35. | 36. | 37. | 37.5| 38. | 39. |\n| Nov.  | 23. | 23.5| 24. | 24.5| 25. | 25.5| 26. | 26.5| 27. | 27.5| 28. | 28.5| 29. | 30. | 31. | 32. | 32.5| 33. | 34. |\n| Dec.  | 22.5| 23. | 23.5| 24. | 24.5| 25. | 25.5| 26. | 26.5| 27. | 27.5| 28. | 28.5| 29. | 30. | 30.5| 31. | 31. | 32. |\n\nand that of latitude 50\u00b0, 52.9\u00b0. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> of the sine of 40\u00b0 is nearly 0.419, and the square of the sine of 50\u00b0 is nearly 0.586.

From this last equation the value of \\( n \\) is found to be nearly 53; and \\( m \\) is nearly equal to 84. The mean temperature of the equator, therefore, is 84\u00b0, and that of the pole 31\u00b0. To find the mean temperature for every other latitude we have only to find 88 arithmetical means between 84 and 31.\n\n(r.) In calculating the table of mean monthly temperature, Dr Kirwan proceeded on the following principles. The mean temperature of April seems to approach very nearly to the mean temperature of the whole year, and as far as heat depends on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the solar rays, the mean heat of each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> may be considered as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a>...\nIt appears from the above table that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> is the coldest month in every latitude; that July is the warmest month in all latitudes above 48\u00b0; that in lower latitudes August is generally the warmest month; that the difference between the hottest and coldest months increases according to the distance of the place from the equator. All habitable latitudes are found to enjoy a medium heat of 65\u00b0 for at least 2 months, which is a very favourable circumstance, as probably no corn could be produced under a lower medium temperature. The temperatures within 10\u00b0 of the poles differ very little, nor do they differ much within 10\u00b0 of the equator. Hence it was unnecessary to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> these latitudes in the table. The temperatures of different years vary but little near the equator, but this difference increases more and more as the latitudes approach the poles.\n\nIt is well known that the temperature of the atmosphere gradually diminishes according to the height of the place above the level of the sea. It was found by Dr Hutton of Edinburgh, that a thermometer kept on the top of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTHUR\">Arthur</a>'s seat, a height of about 800 feet, usually stood 3\u00b0 lower than one kept at the foot of this hill; and Bouguer observed that on the top of Pinchincha, a height of about 15564 feet, a thermometer stood 54\u00b0 lower than it did at the level of the sea in the same latitude.\n\nWe are indebted to Dr Kirwan for a very ingenious method of determining the rate of the diminution in the temperature in particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, having the temperature of the surface of the earth given. The temperature of the atmosphere constantly diminishing as we rise above the level of the sea, we must at a certain height arrive at a point where a perpetual congelation takes place. This point must vary in height according to the latitude, being highest at the equator, and coming gradually nearer the earth as we approach the poles; it must vary also with the season, being highest in summer, and lowest in winter. The cold on the top of Pinchincha was found by M. Bouguer to extend from 7\u00b0 perpendicular to 9\u00b0 below the freezing point every morning <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> before sunrise; hence he concluded that between the tropics the medium height of the term of congelation (where it freezes at some part of the day all the year round) should be fixed at 15577 feet above the level of the sea; but in latitude 28\u00b0, and during the summer, at 13440 feet. If we take the difference between the temperature at the equator, and the freezing point, this difference will bear the same proportion to the term of congelation at the equator, that the difference between the medium temperature at any other latitude and the freezing point bears to the term of congelation at that latitude. Suppose the medium heat at the equator to be 84\u00b0, the difference between which and 32\u00b0 is 52\u00b0; and suppose the medium heat of latitude 28\u00b0 to be 72\u00b0, the difference between which and 32\u00b0 is 40\u00b0. Then by the following proportion, \\( \\frac{52}{72} = \\frac{40}{x} \\), gives us the term of congelation at 28\u00b0. In this way Dr Kirwan proceeded in calculating the following table.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARRAY\">array</a>}{cccccccccccc}\n\\text{Latit.} & 23\u00b0 & 22\u00b0 & 21\u00b0 & 20\u00b0 & 19\u00b0 & 18\u00b0 & 17\u00b0 & 16\u00b0 & 15\u00b0 & 14\u00b0 & 13\u00b0 & 12\u00b0 & 11\u00b0 & 10\u00b0 \\\\\n\\text{Jan.} & 68 & 69 & 71 & 72 & 72.5 & 73 & 73.5 & 74 & 74.5 & 75 & 76 & 76.5 & 77 & 77.5 \\\\\n\\text{Feb.} & 72 & 72.5 & 74 & 75 & 76 & 76.5 & 77 & 77.5 & 78 & 78.5 & 79 & 79.5 & 79.8 & 80 \\\\\n\\text{March} & 75 & 75.5 & 76 & 77 & 77.5 & 78 & 78.5 & 79 & 79.5 & 80 & 80.5 & 81 & 81.5 & 81.8 \\\\\n\\text{April} & 75.5 & 76.5 & 77 & 77.5 & 78 & 78.5 & 79 & 79.5 & 80 & 80.5 & 81 & 81.5 & 82 & 82.3 \\\\\n\\text{May} & 78.5 & 79 & 79.5 & 80 & 80.5 & 81 & 81.5 & 82 & 82.5 & 83 & 83.5 & 84 & 84.5 & 84.8 \\\\\n\\text{June} & 79 & 79.5 & 80 & 80.5 & 81 & 81.5 & 82 & 82.5 & 83 & 83.5 & 84 & 84.5 & 84.8 & 84.8 \\\\\n\\text{July} & 79 & 79.5 & 80 & 80.5 & 81 & 81.5 & 82 & 82.5 & 83 & 83.5 & 84 & 84.5 & 84.8 & 84.8 \\\\\n\\text{Aug.} & 79 & 79.5 & 80 & 80.5 & 81 & 81.5 & 82 & 82.5 & 83 & 83.5 & 84 & 84.5 & 84.8 & 84.8 \\\\\n\\text{Sept.} & 78.5 & 79 & 79.5 & 80 & 80.5 & 81 & 81.5 & 82 & 82.5 & 83 & 83.5 & 84 & 84.5 & 84.8 \\\\\n\\text{Oct.} & 75 & 75.5 & 77 & 78 & 79 & 80 & 81 & 81.5 & 82 & 82.5 & 83 & 83.5 & 84 & 84.8 \\\\\n\\text{Nov.} & 74 & 74.5 & 75 & 75.5 & 76 & 77 & 78 & 78.5 & 79 & 79.5 & 80 & 80.5 & 80.8 & 81 \\\\\n\\text{Dec.} & 71 & 71.5 & 72 & 72.5 & 73 & 74 & 75 & 75.5 & 76 & 76.5 & 77 & 77.5 & 78 & 78.5 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\ntional to the mean <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ALTITUDE\">altitude</a> of the sun, or rather to the sine of that altitude. If, therefore, we have the mean heat of April, and the sine of the sun\u2019s altitude given, the mean heat of May may be found by the following proportion:\n\nAs the sine of the sun\u2019s mean altitude in April : the mean heat of April = the sine of the sun\u2019s mean altitude in May : mean heat of May.\n\nIn the same manner the mean heat of June, July, and August may be found; but for the temperature of the succeeding months we must take into consideration another circumstance, since the above rule would make the temperature of these months too low, as it does not take in the heat derived from the earth, which is nearly equal to the mean annual temperature. The real mean heats of these months must be considered as an arithmetical mean between the astronomical and terrestrial heats. Thus, for latitude 51\u00b0, the astronomical heat of September being 44.6\u00b0, and the mean annual heat 52.4\u00b0, the real heat of September ought to be \\( \\frac{44.6 + 52.4}{2} = 48.5 \\). Dr Kirwan, however, after going through a tedious calculation, found the results to correspond so little with actual observation, that he drew up the table partly from calculating from principles, and partly from an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of several sea journals.\nThis last height of 120 feet M. Bouger called the lower term of congelation. He also distinguished another term of congelation above which no visible vapour rises, and this he called the upper term of congelation. This line is considered by Kirwan as much less variable during the summer months than the lower line, and it has therefore been adopted by him to determine the rate of diminution in the temperature as we ascend into the atmosphere. He has calculated its height for every degree of north latitude in the following table.\n\n| N. Lat | Feet | N. Lat | Feet | N. Lat | Feet | N.

Part II.\n\nDr Kirwan has given us the following rule for ascertaining the temperature at any required height, supposing we know the temperature of the surface of the earth.\n\nFor the temperature observed at the surface of the earth, put \\( m \\); for the given height \\( h \\), and \\( t \\) for the height of the upper term of congelation at the given latitude; then\n\n\\[\n\\frac{m - 32}{t} = \\text{the diminution of temperature for every 100 feet of elevation}\n\\]\n\nor it is the common difference of the terms of the progression required. Let this common difference thus found be denoted by \\( c \\); then \\( c \\times \\frac{h}{100} \\) gives us the whole diminution of temperature from the surface of the earth to the given height. Let this diminution be denoted by \\( d \\), then \\( m - d \\) is obviously the\nstandard by about 10\u00b0 or 12\u00b0, as appears from American meteorological tables. The causes of this remarkable difference are many. The highest part of North America lies between 40\u00b0 and 50\u00b0 of latitude, and 100\u00b0 and 110\u00b0 of longitude west from London, for there the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> originate. The very height, therefore, makes this spot colder than it would otherwise be. It is covered with immense forests, and abounds with large swamps and morasses, which render it incapable of receiving any great degree of heat; so that the rigour of winter is much less tempered by the heat of the earth than in the old continent. To the east <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> a number of very large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>, and farther north, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HUDSON_S_BAY\">Hudson's <a </a>class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a>; about 30 miles on the south of which there is a range of mountains which prevent its receiving any heat from that quarter. The bay is bounded on the east by the mountainous country of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LABRADOR\">Labrador</a> and by a number of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>. Hence the coldness of the north-west winds and the lowness of the temperature.\n\nBut as the cultivated parts of North America are now much warmer than formerly, there is reason to expect that the climate will become still milder when the country is better cleared of woods, though perhaps it will never equal the temperature of the old continent.\n\nIslands are warmer than continents in the same degree of latitude; and countries lying to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WINDWARD\">windward</a> of extensive mountains or forests are warmer than those lying to the leeward. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">Stones</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> have a less capacity for heat than earth has, which is always somewhat moist; they heat or cool, therefore, more rapidly and to a greater degree. Hence the violent heat of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARABIA\">Arabia</a> and Africa, and the intense cold of Terra del <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FUEGO\">Fuego</a>. Living vegetables alter their temperature very slowly, but their evaporation is great; and if they be tall and close, as in forests, they exclude the sun's rays from the earth, and shelter the winter snow from the wind and the sun. Woody countries, therefore, are much colder than those which are cultivated.\n\nWe shall conclude this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of meteorological axioms respecting the temperature of the air, by M. Cotte.\n\n1. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> degrees of heat are almost everywhere the same; this, however, is not the case in regard to the extreme degrees of cold.\n\n2. The thermometer rises to its extreme height oftener in the temperate zones than in the torrid zone.\n\n3. It changes very little between the tropics; its variations, like those of the barometer, are greater the more one proceeds from the equator towards the poles.\n\n4. It rises higher in the plains than on mountains.\n\n5. It does not fall so much in the neighbourhood of the sea as in inland parts.\n\n6. The wind has no influence on its motions.\n\n7. Moisture has a peculiar influence on it, if followed by a wind which disperses it.\n\n8. The greatest heat, and the greatest cold, take place about six weeks after the northern or southern solstice.\n\n9. The thermometer changes more in summer than in winter.\n\n10. The coldest period of the day is before sunrise.\n\n11. The greatest heat in the sun and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a> seldom takes place on the same day.\n\n12. The heat decreases with far more rapidity from September and October, than it increased from July to September.\n\n13. It is not true, that a very cold winter is the prognostic of a very hot summer.\n\n**CHAP. III. Of the Changes which take place in the Air with respect to Evaporation and Rain.**\n\nThere seems no reason to doubt that water exists in the atmosphere in an intermediate state between that of a fluid and that of absolute <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEAM\">steam</a>. This is the state of vapour, of the qualities of which it is proper that we should here take a general view.\n\nWe are indebted to the experiments of Saussure and de Luc for much of our knowledge of the qualities of vapour. It is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> invisible fluid like common air, but lighter; being to common air, according to Saussure, as 10 to 14, or, according to Kirwan, as 10 to 12; it cannot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> beyond a certain maximum of density, otherwise the particles of water which compose it unite together, and form small, hollow, visible vesicles, called vesicular vapour; which is of the same specific gravity with atmospherical air. It is of this vapour that clouds and fogs are composed. This maximum increases with the temperature; and at the heat of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> water is so great, that steam can resist the whole pressure of the air, and exist in the atmosphere in any quantity.\n\nAfter what has been stated under Chemistry with respect to the nature and properties of vapour, we have nothing here to add on that subject, except to give the result of observations that have been made on the state of vapour in the atmosphere.\n\nIt is found that the evaporation of water into the air is confined entirely to the surface, and hence it is always proportional to the surface exposed to the action of the air. Accordingly, observation shows that in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARITIME\">maritime</a> countries, and in marshy situations in the neighbourhood of lakes, rivers, &c., the evaporation is much greater than in inland countries and dry situations.\n\nIt is found that evaporation is greatest in hot weather; whence it must depend, in some degree, on the temperature of the air.\n\n---\n\nthe temperature required. An example will make this rule sufficiently obvious. In latitude 56\u00b0 the heat below being 54\u00b0, required the temperature of the air at the height of 803 feet?\n\nHere \\( m = 54 \\), \\( t = 5533 \\), \\( \\frac{m - 32}{t} = \\frac{22}{5433} = 0.0404 = c \\), and \\( c \\times \\frac{h}{100} = 0.0404 \\times 8.03 = 3.24 = d \\), and \\( m - d = 54 - 3.24 = 50.75 \\).\n\nHence we see that the temperature of the air at the height of 803 feet above the surface is 50\u00b0 75'.\nThis was ascertained by Mr Dalton from actual experiments, the result of which was, that the quantity evaporated per <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> from a given surface of water at a given temperature, is to the quantity evaporated from the surface at $212^\\circ$, as the force of vapour at the given temperature is to the force of vapour at $212^\\circ$. By means of the table expressing the force of vapour at various temperatures given under Chemistry, p. 468, we may discover by the above rule the quantity of water at a given temperature lost by evaporation.\n\nThere are several circumstances that affect the quantity of vapour rising from water, even at the same temperature. Thus, we find that evaporation is least in calm weather, increases when there is wind, and is greater in proportion as the wind is stronger. This evidently arises from the agitation of the water, by which a new surface is perpetually exposed to the action of the air.\n\nWe shall here insert a table by Mr Dalton, expressing the quantity of vapour raised in various atmospheric temperatures, from a circular surface six inches in diameter.\n\n| Temperature | Force of vapour in inches | Evaporating force in grains

Two years after they were joined by Mr Ingham of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a>'s college, Mr Broughton of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXETER\">Exeter</a>, and Mr James Harvey; and in 1735 they were joined by the celebrated Mr Whitefield, then in his 18th year.\n\nAt this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> it is said that the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of England was tending fast to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFIDELITY\">infidelity</a>. \"It is come (says Bishop <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUTLER\">Butler</a>), I know not how, to be taken for granted by many persons, that Christianity is not so much as a subject of inquiry, but that it is now at length discovered to be fictitious; and accordingly they treat it as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> in the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> this were an agreement among all people of discernment, and nothing remained but to set it up as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> subject of mirth and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIDICULE\">ridicule</a>, as it were by way of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REPRISALS\">reprisals</a>, for its having so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> interrupted the pleasures of the world.\" The Methodists are said, with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>, to have been very instrumental in stemming this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TORRENT\">torrent</a>. They obtained their name from the exact regularity of their lives; which gave occasion to a young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> of Christ church to say, \"Here is a new set of Methodists sprung up;\" alluding to a sect of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> physicians which went by that name. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> regularity, however, soon brought a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> against them, perhaps not altogether without foundation, of being too scrupulous, and carrying their sanctity to too great a height. In particular it was urged, that they laid too much stress upon the rubrics and canons of the church, insisted too much on observing the rules of the university, and took the scriptures in too literal a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>; and to the name of Methodists two others were quickly added, viz. those of Sacramentarians and the Godly Club.\n\nThe principal person in this club while in its infancy appears to have been Mr Morgan, and next to him Mr John Wesley. They visited the sick, and instituted a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUND\">fund</a> for the relief of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>; and the better to accomplish their benevolent designs, Mr Wesley abridged himself of all his superfluities, and even of some of the necessaries of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>; and by proposing the scheme to some gentlemen, they quickly increased their funds to \u00a32l. per annum. This, which one should have thought would have been attended with praise instead of censure, quickly drew upon them a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSECUTION\">persecution</a>; some of the seniors of the university began to interfere, and it was reported \"that the college censors were going to blow up the Godly Club.\"\n\nThey found themselves, however, patronised and encouraged by some men eminent for their learning and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>; so that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> still <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>, though they had suffered a severe loss in 1730 in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Mr Morgan, who had indeed been the founder of it. In the month of October 1735, John and Charles Wesley, Mr Ingham, and Mr Delamotte son to a merchant in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, embarked for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEORGIA\">Georgia</a> along with Mr Oglethorpe, afterwards General Oglethorpe. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of this voyage was to preach the gospel to the Indians. By this time, however, it appears that Mr Wesley had embraced such notions as may without the least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREACH\">breach</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CHARITY\">charity</a> be accounted fanatical. Thus in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> Samuel, he conjures him to banish from his school \"the classics with their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POISON\">poison</a>,\" and to introduce instead of them such Christian authors as would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> together with him in \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> up his flock in the knowledge and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of God.\"\n\nDuring the voyage such a profession of worship was observed, as we cannot help thinking savoured more of a Pharisaical than Christian behaviour; an account of which, as a similar strictness would certainly be inculcated upon the disciples, and consequently must give a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> idea of the principles of the early Methodists, we shall here transcribe from Mr Wesley's life. \"From four in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> till five, each of us used private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRAYER\">prayer</a>; from five to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> we read the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIBLE\">Bible</a> together, carefully comparing it (that we might not lean to our own understandings) with the writings of the earliest ages; at seven we breakfasted; at eight were the public prayers; from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> to twelve learned the languages and instructed the children; at twelve we met to give an account to one another what we had done since our last meeting, and what we designed to do before our next; at one we dined; the time from dinner to four we spent in reading to those of whom each of us had taken charge, or in speaking to them separately as need required; at four were the evening prayers, when either the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> lesson was explained (as it always was in the morning), or the children were catechised and instructed before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONGREGATION\">congregation</a>; from five to six we again used private prayer; from six to seven I read in our cabin to two or three of the passengers, of whom there were about 80 English on board; and each of my brethren to a few more in theirs; at seven I joined with the Germans in their public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>, while Mr Ingham was reading between decks to as many as desired to hear; at eight we met again, to instruct and exhort one another; between nine and ten we went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a>, when neither the roaring of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> nor the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of the ship could take away the refreshing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a> which God gave us.\"\n\nAs they proceeded in their passage, this austerity instead of being diminished was increased. Mr Wesley discontinued the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of wine and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>; confining himself to vegetables, chiefly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICE\">rice</a> and biscuit. He ate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUPPER\">supper</a>; and his bed having been made wet by the sea, he lay upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a>, and slept soundly till morning. In his Journal he says, \"I believe I shall not find it needful to go to bed, as it is called, any more;\" but whether this was really done or not, we cannot say.\n\nThe missionaries, after their arrival, were at first very favourably received, but in a short time lost the affections of the people entirely. This was owing to the behaviour of Mr Wesley himself, who appeared not only capricious but frequently despotic. He particularly gave offence by insisting upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAPTISM\">baptism</a> of children by immersion; and his excessive austerity with regard to himself\nMethodists himself did not tend to give his hearers any favourable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> either of the superior sanctity or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> of their teacher. At last, on account of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> with Mr Causton the storekeeper and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVANNAH\">Savannah</a> which ended in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a>, he was obliged to return to England.\n\nThus the cause of Methodism seemed to be entirely lost in Georgia. But Mr Wesley was soon succeeded by a more popular and successful champion, viz. Mr George Whitefield; who having spent his time during the voyage in converting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> with whom he sailed, arrived at Savannah in Georgia on the 7th of May 1738. Here he was received by Mr Delamotte, was joined by several of Mr Wesley's hearers, and became intimate with some other ministers. Mr Ingham had made some progress in converting a few runaway Creek Indians, who had a settlement about four miles from Savannah; but being obliged to return to England in a few months, this design was frustrated, and the Indians in a few years separated. During the short time that Mr Whitefield resided at Savannah, he became extremely popular; and indeed the instances of his success in the way of making converts are very surprising. However, he was obliged to return to England in the autumn of that year, that he might receive priests orders. On his return to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a> in October 1739, he landed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHILADELPHIA\">Philadelphia</a>, and instantly began his spiritual labours as in other places; being attended with astonishing success not only there but wherever he went. Passing through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGINIA\">Virginia</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARYLAND\">Maryland</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">North</a> and South Carolina, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of converts continually increased; but on his arrival at Savannah, he found the colony almost deserted. He now resumed the scheme he had formerly projected of building an Orphan-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>; and for this he made the first collection at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARLESTOWN\">Charlestown</a> in South Carolina, amounting to about 70l. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">sterling</a>. His zeal in the cause of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, or of the colony, were not, however, sufficient to procure him the favour of those in power. On his return to Philadelphia, after a short stay at Savannah, the churches were denied him; but he was made ample amends by the success which attended his field preachings and private efforts. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">Religious</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a> were everywhere set up, and many were converted with symptoms of enthusiasm, different according to their various tempers and constitutions. During this excursion, he was so successful in his collection for the Orphan-house, that on his return to Savannah he brought along with him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> to the value of 500l. sterling.\n\nThe success in Georgia was now greater than ever; but the many charities which it was necessary to supply, rendered it necessary in a short time for him to undertake another journey to Charlestown. Here his principles met with the greatest opposition. He had lost the favour of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSARY\">commissary</a> by his field-preaching, and was denied the sacrament. The opposition, however, was altogether fruitless; the number of converts increased wherever he went, and he now undertook a voyage to New England. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> also the established clergy were his enemies; but the usual success attended his other endeavours, and procured 500l. more for the use of the Orphans in Georgia.\n\nFrom the year 1741 to 1743 America was deprived of Mr Whitefield's preaching, he having spent that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> in England; but in 1744 he again set out for Methodists, the western continent. The remarkable success which had hitherto attended his labours now stirred up many opponents; and these had met with the greater success, as none of the Methodist preachers whom he had left were possessed of such abilities either to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> the favour of those who heard them, or to defend their doctrines against objections. Mr Whitefield's success, however, was the same as before: he even found means to inspire the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> class with such sentiments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a>, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLONEL\">Colonel</a> Pepperell could not undertake his expedition against Louisbourg without first consulting Mr Whitefield; and great numbers of New-Englanders went volunteers, confident of victory, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the discourses of their teacher.\n\nFrom the continent of America Mr Whitefield took a voyage to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BERMUDAS\">Bermudas</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>; and here, as everywhere else, he met with the most surprising success. Here also collections were made for the Orphan-house in Savannah, which were transmitted to that place.\n\nSupposing it to be better for his cause to visit different countries, than to take up a permanent residence in one, Mr Whitefield left Bermudas in a few months, and did not return to America till 1751, when the Orphan-house was found to be in a very flourishing situation. After a short stay, he set sail again for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>. Here he remained two years, and then set out on another visit to America, landing at Charlestown on the 27th of May 1754. His presence constantly revived the spirits and cause of his party, and added to their numbers wherever he went. Next year he returned to England; but after labouring in the usual manner, and meeting with the usual success there till the year 1763, he set sail again for America, and arrived at Virginia in the latter end of August. He now visited all the colonies, and found that great progress had been made in converting the Indians. On his arrival at Georgia, matters were found in a very flourishing situation, and he received the thanks of the governor and principal people for the great benefit he had been to the colony; which shows, that the stories which had been so industriously propagated, concerning the avarice of him and other Methodist preachers, were, partly at least, unfounded. In 1765 he returned to England; and in 1769 made his seventh and last voyage to America, landing at Charlestown on the 30th of November the same year. He was still attended with the same success; and indeed it is impossible to read, without admiration, on account of the efforts made by himself and Mr Wesley, to propagate their tenets in the different parts of the world.\n\nFor a very considerable time Mr Whitefield was the only Methodist who paid any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to America; and in that country he was more popular than even in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. Towards the end of his life, several Methodists having emigrated from Britain, formed distinct societies in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NEW_YORK\">New <a c</a>lass=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a> and Philadelphia. These quickly increased in number; and, about the time that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> with Britain began, their numbers amounted to about 3000 in Virginia, Maryland, New York, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PENNSYLVANIA\">Pennsylvania</a>. They would probably have increased much more, had it not been for the imprudence of some of their preachers, who intro-\n\nVol. XIII. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">Part</a> II.\nMethodists introduced politics into their discourses, and thus rendered themselves obnoxious to the people among whom they lived. Among those who hurt the cause in this manner was Mr Wesley himself, who, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> a piece entitled *A Calm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADDRESS\">Address</a> to the American Colonies*, would in all probability have ruined it, had not a gentleman, with whom he was connected, destroyed or sent back to England the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> as soon as it arrived in America, so that its existence was scarce known in that continent. At the conclusion of the war, Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COKE\">Coke</a>, who in 1776 had left a curacy in England in order to join Mr Wesley, paid a visit to his friends in America; though it had been imagined that a total separation had taken place between the American and European Methodists. This breach was, however, made up by a manoeuvre of Mr Wesley; for no sooner had the Americans obtained their independence, than he, who had hitherto branded them with the name of rebels, sent a congratulatory letter on their freedom from the \"State and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HIERARCHY\">Hierarchy</a>,\" and exhorting them to \"stand fast in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> with which God had so strangely made them free.\" To show his zeal in their service still farther, he gave ordination, by laying on of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, to several preachers who were to embark for America, and consecrated Dr Coke one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a> of the Methodist Episcopal church in that country. He extracted also from the liturgy of the English church one for the American Methodists, taking particular care to expunge every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> that had a particular respect to the regal authority.\n\nSuch proceedings in one who had formerly professed such extraordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to the English church, could not but require an apology; and this was accordingly made in a pastoral letter transmitted to the American societies, and addressed \"to Dr Coke, Mr Astbury, and our brethren in North America.\" In this letter he makes the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of his conduct. \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">King</a>'s account of the primitive church convinced me, many years ago, that bishops and presbyters are the same order, and consequently have the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to ordain. For many years I have been importuned, from time to time, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> this right, by ordaining part of our travelling preachers. But I have still refused, not only for the sake of peace, but because I was determined, as little as possible, to violate the established order of the national church to which I belonged. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> is widely different between England and North America. Here there are bishops who have a legal jurisdiction: in America there are none, neither any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> ministers: so that for some hundred miles together, there is none either to baptize, or to administer the Lord's supper. Here, therefore, my scruples are at an end; and I conceive myself at full liberty, as I violate no order, and invade no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>'s right, by appointing and sending labourers into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARVEST\">harvest</a>. It has indeed been proposed to desire the English bishops to ordain part of our preachers for America; but to this I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>. 1. I desired the bishop of London to ordain only one, but could not prevail. 2. If they consented, we know the slowness of their proceedings; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> admits of no delay. 3. If they would ordain them now, they would likewise expect to govern them; and how grievously would that entangle us. 4. As our American brethren are now totally disentangled, both from the state and the English hierarchy, we dare not entangle them again either with the one or the other. They are now at full liberty simply to follow the scripture and the primitive church; and we judge it best, that they should stand fast in that liberty wherewith God has so strangely made them free.\"\n\nDr Coke, on the consecration of Mr Astbury to the office of a bishop, made another apology. \"The church of England (says he), of which the society of Methodists in general have till lately professed themselves a part, did for many years groan in America under grievances of the heaviest kind. Subjected to a hierarchy which weighs everything in the scale of politics, its most important interests were repeatedly sacrificed to the supposed advantages of England. The churches were in general filled with the parasites and bottle-companions of the rich and great. The humble and most unfortunate entreaties of the oppressed flocks, yea the representations of a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a> itself, were contemned and despised. Everything sacred must bow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> at the feet of a party; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLINESS\">holiness</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> of mankind be sacrificed to their views; and the drunkard, the fornicator, and the extortioner, triumphed over bleeding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZION\">Zion</a>, because they were faithful abettors of the ruling powers. The memorable revolution has struck off these intolerable fetters, and broken the anti-christian union which before subsisted between church and state. And had there been no other advantage arising from that glorious epoch, this itself, I believe, would have made ample compensation for all the calamities of the war; one happy consequence of which was the expulsion of most of those hirelings, who \"ate the fat, and clothed themselves with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a>, but strengthened not the diseased,\" &c. The parochial churches in general being hereby vacant, our people were deprived of the sacraments through the greatest part of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, and continue so still. What method can we take in so critical a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNCTURE\">juncture</a>? God has given us sufficient resources in ourselves; and, after mature deliberation, we believe that we are called to draw them forth.\n\n\"But what right have you to ordain?\" The same right as most of the churches in Christendom; our ordination, in its lowest view, being equal to any of the presbyterian, as originating with three presbyters of the church of England. \"But what right have you to exercise the episcopal office?\" To me the most manifest and clear. God has been pleased to raise up, by Mr Wesley, in America and Europe, a numerous society well known by the name of Methodists. The whole body have invariably esteemed this man as their chief pastor under Christ. He has constantly appointed all their religious officers from the highest to the lowest, by himself or his delegate. And we are fully persuaded there is no church office which he judges expedient for the welfare of the people entrusted to his charge, but, as essential to his station, he has power to ordain. \"But, do not you <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> the succession?\" The uninterrupted succession of bishops is a point that has long been given up by the most able Protestant defenders of episcopacy. Bishop Hoadley himself, in his celebrated controversy with Dr Calamy, allows it to be unnecessary. His words are, 'To the 13th question I answer, that I think not an uninterrupted line of succession\nso grants the authenticity of the anecdote given us by St Jerome, which informs us, that the church of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALEXANDRIA\">Alexandria</a> had no regular succession from the time of St Mark the evangelist, the first bishop of that church, to the time of Dionysius, a space of 200 years; but the college of presbyters, on the death of a bishop, elected another in his stead. We are also informed, from the epistle of St Clement to the Corinthians, written soon after the death of St Paul, a writer whose works are next in precedence to the canon of scripture, and probably written by immediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSPIRATION\">inspiration</a>, that the church of Corinth was then governed only by a college of presbyters. And from the epistle of Polycarp to the church of Philippi, written in 116, we also find that the Christian Philippians were then governed only by a college of presbyters. So that the primitive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> were so far from esteeming the regular succession as essential to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of a Christian church, that, in some instances, episcopacy itself was wholly omitted.\n\nSuch was the defence urged by Mr Wesley for this extraordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSUMPTION\">assumption</a> of episcopal powers: a conduct, however, of which he afterwards repented, as tending to make a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> separation betwixt his followers and the church of England. Yet it does not appear that this had any bad effect on the minds of his American brethren; for Dr Coke, on his arrival on the western continent, found the societies numerous and flourishing. His first efforts were directed against the slave trade; and not only the abolition of that traffic, but the release of all those who were actually slaves at the time, seem to have been his favourite objects. By interfering in this matter, however, perhaps with too much zeal, he involved himself in danger. Some riots took place, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a> offered the mob 50 guineas if they would give the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">Doctor</a> 100 lashes. This piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a> would have been inflicted, had it not been for the interposition of a sturdy colonel; and the Doctor had not only the satisfaction of escaping the intended <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>, but of seeing his doctrine so far attended to, that some slaves were emancipated.\n\nMr Hampson, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> of Mr Wesley, observes, that \"the colonists, in the infancy of Methodism, conducted themselves with more propriety than the English. There was little or no persecution, nor anything like a riot, except in one or two instances which have been mentioned as the consequence of the animadversions on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SLAVERY\">slavery</a>; and even these were productive of no mischief. Not a creature was materially injured; no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a> were broken, nor any lives lost; which was not the case in this country. Here many thousands of innocent people were subjected to the grossest indignities, and several were eventually sacrificed to the fury of their persecutors.\"\n\n\"While we commend the Americans for their behaviour in opposition to the brutality of English mobs, it may be proper to inquire into the sources of this distinction. Something of this may have arisen from similarity of sentiment. The Americans, from the first beginnings of colonization, had been accustomed to the doctrines of the old puritans and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NONCONFORMISTS\">nonconformists</a>, which in many respects have a near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> to the Methodist tenets. The origin of Methodism in America was seldom, if ever, attended, either under the Methodist discourses of Mr Whitefield's or Mr Wesley's preachers, with those ridiculous effects with which it was accompanied in these kingdoms. Most of the preachers, who went over to the continent, having laboured for some years in Europe previous to their having crossed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, had exhausted their wildfire; so that their discourses were more scriptural and rational than those of the primitive Methodists. Another reason may be found in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> of the Americans. As a people, they are better cultivated than the body of the English; they are chiefly composed of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> and a respectable gentry; and there is but a small proportion of that class, so superabundant here, which we distinguish by the name of mob.\n\n\"The only exception we have heard, to their exemption from the extravagancies which in this country marked the infancy of Methodism, is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> they have introduced in Maryland and Virginia. Frequently, at the conclusion of a sermon, the whole congregation began to pray and to praise God aloud. The uproar which this must create may easily be conceived. Some we are told, are great admirers of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of enthusiasm, in which every man is his own minister, and one sings and another prays, with the most discordant devotion. But we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not dignify such indecency with such a name. Its proper appellation is fanaticism. We hope, that, for the future, religion will never appear in this country under so odious a form; and greatly is it to be lamented, that, among the friends of Christianity, any such absurdities should arise, to furnish infidels with occasions of triumph.\"\n\nOur author informs us, that the occupation of the Methodist preachers in America was very laborious. In the course of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> they frequently rode 20 or 30 miles, preaching twice or thrice, and sometimes to considerable congregations. Notwithstanding this labour, however, few or none of them ever thought of returning to Britain. Several reasons may be assigned for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> they took in this laborious exercise. \"Their excursions (says Mr Hampson) through immense forests abounding in trees of all sorts and sizes, were often highly romantic. Innumerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> and falls of water; vistas opening to the view, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTRAST\">contrast</a> with the uncultivated wild; deer now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHOOTING\">shooting</a> across the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a>, and now scouring through the woods, while the eye was frequently relieved by the appearance of orchards and plantations, and the houses of gentlemen and farmers peeping through the trees; formed a scenery so various and picturesque, as to produce a variety of reflection, and present, we will not say to a philosophic eye, but to the mind of every reasonable creature, the most sublime and agreeable images.\n\n\"Their worship partook of the general simplicity. It was frequently conducted in the open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>. The woods resounded to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> of the preacher, or to the singing of his numerous congregations; while their horses, fastened to the trees, formed a singular addition to the solemnity. It was indeed a striking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a>; and might naturally impress the mind with a retrospect of the antediluvian days, when the hills and valleys re-echoed the patriarchal devotions, and a Seth or an Enoch, in the shadow of a projecting rock, or beneath the foliage...\"\nMethodists of some venerable oak, delivered his primeval lectures, and was a \"preacher of righteousness to the people.\"\n\nThe American <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITALITY\">hospitality</a> is supposed by Mr Hampson to have been another reason for the assiduity of the Methodist teachers, as well as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSCIOUSNESS\">consciousness</a> of being well employed, and the satisfaction resulting from considerations of public utility. As many of the preachers were men of fervent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a>, this reflection would have its full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>; and the instruction of the ignorant and the reformation of the profligate would be considered as the best recompense of their labours. Spreading themselves through the continent, they took in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-NOVA_SCOTIA\">Nova Scotia</a>, Georgia, with the principal places in both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAROLINAS\">Carolinas</a>, Virginia, Maryland, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DELAWARE\">Delaware</a>, Pennsylvania, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-NEW_JERSEY\">New <a cla</a>ss=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERSEY\">Jersey</a>, and New York; numbering upwards of 43,000 members of their society, exclusive of about 80 itinerants, and a considerable number of local preachers, who took no circuits, but assisted occasionally in the neighbourhood of their respective residence.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> and expensive buildings which the colonists have erected for public worship, almost exceed credibility; and several colleges are founded for the instruction of youth. How far the proposed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of uniting genuine religion and extensive learning will be carried into execution, time only can discover. It must materially depend on the character of the presidents and tutors, and the provision that shall be made for their support. Men of real erudition will never be procured at low salaries; and it is in vain to attempt establishments of this sort without a liberal provision for the professors of every branch of science. Two of these places are called Cokesbury and Wesley Colleges. How they are endowed, or whether they propose to obtain authority to confer degrees, we are not informed. But perhaps they are rather <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a> than colleges; which indeed is a circumstance to be wished, as good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAMMAR\">grammar</a> schools are of the utmost service to the progress of literature.\n\nThe great success which attended the Methodist preachers in America naturally determined Mr Wesley to try the West <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> islands. The Moravians had already attempted to establish their principles in some of these islands; and in 1786 some preachers were sent from the Methodists in England to the West Indies. In many of these they met with success. Societies were formed in Barbadoes, St Vincent's, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMINICA\">Dominica</a>, St Christopher's, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEVIS\">Nevis</a>, Antigua, St Eustatius, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TORTOLA\">Tortola</a>, and St Croix, amounting in all to near 5000 persons. At this time the whole number of Methodists in America and the West Indies amounted to about 43,302. These societies consisted both of whites and blacks: on the continent they were mostly whites, but in the islands <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NEGROES\">negroes</a>. \"But it is to be observed (says Mr Hampson) that the subjection of the negroes, and the obedience in which they are trained, must inculcate a docility peculiarly favourable to the purposes of a mission.\" Some of the missionaries went also to St Vincent's, where they met with some success, and have established some schools, in which their children are carefully instructed in the principles of religion.\n\n\"In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1789 (says our author), Dr Coke paid a visit to Jamaica, and gave them several sermons. As he made but a short stay, it could hardly be considered as a fair <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>. Should a mission be established here, as well as in the other islands, which will probably be the case, it is hoped it will be the means of correcting one vice at least, and that is dwelling; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> relic of Gothic barbarity, by which all the islands have for many years been distinguished. Perhaps too it will give some check to the spirit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a> and dissipation; and teach the planters, if it be found impracticable to emancipate their slaves, at least to treat them with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>.\"\n\nIt has been debated among the leading men of the Methodistical profession, whether the cause might not be served by sending missionaries to the East Indies and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>; but these projects were dropped, as there was no invitation, nor any prospect of success if it had been adopted. A mission has been formed to the new settlement called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KENTUCKY\">Kentucky</a>, on the confines of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> territories, near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MISSISSIPPI\">Mississippi</a>. The danger of the missionaries at the time they undertook this service was certainly very great; yet such was their zeal for the cause, that they voluntarily offered themselves: but we are not yet informed what success they have met with.\n\nWhile Methodism was thus making rapid progress in America, its teachers were equally indefatigable in Britain. A most remarkable particular, however, occurs with regard to Mr Wesley himself; for though he had gone to Georgia, as has been already related, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> the Indians to Christianity, yet on his return to England in 1738, he took it into his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> that he, their teacher, was not yet converted: the reason was, that he had not the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> of assurance. This, however, was not long wanting. He arrived in England on the first day of February, and was blest with the assurance on the sixth of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> following. This was immediately announced to the public; and the consequence, if we may believe him, was, that God then began to work by his ministry, which he had not done before. Being joined by one Kinchin, a fellow of Corpus, they travelled to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANCHESTER\">Manchester</a>, Holms Chapel, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEWCASTLE\">Newcastle</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAFFORDSHIRE\">Staffordshire</a>, and other places, where they preached, exhorted, and conversed on religious subjects, in public houses, stables, &c., sometimes meeting with success and sometimes not. During this peregrination Mr Wesley certainly displayed a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a>, which we must undoubtedly suppose to have been communicated to his hearers, and to have caused them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> on many occasions in a very ridiculous manner. An instance follows:\n\n\"The next day (says he), March 11th, we dined at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BIRMINGHAM\">Birmingham</a>, and, soon after we left it, were reproved for our negligence there (in letting those who attended us go without either exhortation or instruction) by a severe shower of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIL\">hail</a>!\" About the latter end of March or beginning of April he and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a> began to pray extempore, leaving off entirely the forms of the church of England, to which he had formerly been so devoted. The doctrine of instantaneous conversion, which his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> had suggested to him as a work performed on himself, was greedily received by some of his hearers; and all the converts to the new doctrine confirmed themselves, and contributed greatly to persuade others, by declarations of their experiences, as they called them: how-\nThis new doctrine of an instantaneous, and in fact miraculous impulse, though greatly relished by the enthusiastic part of the society, was very much disliked by others, particularly Mr Charles Wesley his brother, who warned him of the mischief he was doing; though he himself was soon converted, and, what is very astonishing, two days before John Wesley himself. The particulars related of these miraculous conversions are truly disgraceful, and could not but bring into contempt the society which consisted of such enthusiasts. \"Many (says Mr Hampson) are represented as falling suddenly to the ground, in horror and agony not to be conceived, and rising again with equal expressions of peace and consolation.\" Their conversions were usually attended with these violent symptoms; and, for several years, few meetings occurred where Mr Wesley presided, without one or more instances of the same kind. It was not possible that such transactions should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> without notice. The confusion that too often prevailed, the emotions of the persons affected, and the exultations of the rest, which were severally animadverted upon, gave great and general offence. Many insisted, that it must either be occasioned by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of the rooms, and the agitation of the animal spirits under discourses of the most alarming <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>; or that it was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> artifice and hypocrisy.\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time, two of the sons of a Mrs Hutton in London, happening to become converts to the new doctrine, this lady was so much offended, that she wrote to Mr Samuel Wesley, informing him, that she was of opinion his brother John had lost his senses; and requesting, that the next time he came to his house, he, Mr Samuel, would either confine or convert him. All that could be done, however, to prevent the progress of the new doctrine was insufficient; and the first Methodist society was formed in London on the first of May 1738, when about 50 agreed to meet together once a-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>, for free conversation, begun and ended with singing and prayer.\n\nAll this time, however, it seems that the conversion of Mr Wesley was far from being so complete as that of many of his hearers. He had preached and converted others, while he himself was absolutely unconverted. The knowledge of the true saving faith was only revealed to him on the 6th of March, and he did not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> its power till the 24th of May; and even after this, his doubts and fears were still so great, that on the 13th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> he undertook a voyage to Germany, where, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> Zinzendorff, his faith seems to have been thoroughly confirmed.\n\nOn Mr Wesley's return, September 16th, 1738, he applied himself with the greatest assiduity and success to the propagation of his doctrine. Multitudes of converts were made in various parts of the kingdom; and the reproaches poured upon him by his opponents, seemed to have rendered his zeal more fervent if possible than before. It is remarkable, however, that some of his old friends were now so much offended with his conduct or his principles, that they absolutely refused to keep company with him. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> plan seems to have been, to make an union of Methodist clergymen, and disseminate his principles by their means. But in this he succeeded so ill, that in a letter written in 1742, he wished for a clerical assistant, were he only in deacons orders: but adds, \"I know of none such, who is willing to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOT\">lot</a> with us; and I scarce expect I shall, because I know how fast they are rivetted in the service of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEVIL\">devil</a> and the world before they leave the university.\"\u2014Finding at last that nothing could be done with them, he was obliged to have recourse to lay preachers; and easily selected those who appeared to have the greatest talents for prayer and exhortation in the private meetings appointed for that purpose. Thus he at once raised himself to be the head of a sect; as the lay preachers willingly yielded obedience to him who had the advantages of superior learning and abilities, and was besides in orders as a clergyman; and this obedience he did not fail on every occasion to exact.\n\nIf his doctrine had formerly given offence to the established clergy, the appointment of lay preachers was reckoned much worse; and their being appointed without any form of ordination whatever, which almost all of them were, subjected them to contempt and reproach, which their want of learning, and very often of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> abilities, did not contribute to remove. Thus finding the churches shut against him and his followers, he was obliged to preach in the fields, and made his first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSAY\">essay</a> in this way on the second of April 1739, in the neighbourhood of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRISTOL\">Bristol</a>; Mr Whitefield having set him an example the day before.\n\nThe success of those ignorant and itinerant preachers, with their absurd and uncharitable discourses and behaviour, so provoked their adversaries, that a persecution was soon commenced against them. Mr Wesley himself was calumniated in the harshest manner, being sometimes said to be a Jesuit, sometimes an illiterate enthusiast, as the people took it into their heads. Many pretended to answer him in writing, without being able to do so: the consequence was, that their deficiency of argument was supplied by invective, and the most scandalous performances made their appearance. Some of the English clergy so far forgot themselves as to instigate the mob against them, and the most cruel outrages were committed upon them in various places. For some time the persecuted party adhered to the doctrines of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSIVE\">passive</a> obedience and non-resistance, which their inhuman adversaries did not fail to take the advantage of.\u2014The less they were opposed, the more insolent they became. The Methodists were frequently in danger of their lives. Men, women with child, and even children, were knocked down and abused with the same undistinguishing fury. Houses were stripped of their furniture, vast quantities of furniture carried off, featherbeds cut in pieces and strewed over the streets, several reputable people were forced into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, &c. To the disgrace of magistracy also it was found, that when application was made to the justices of the peace, redress was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> denied; nor was a step put to these shameful proceedings without a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> mandate for the purpose.\n\nFrom the year 1738 to 1747 Mr Wesley and his itinerants were employed in various parts of England.\nMethodists. In 1747 he went over to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUBLIN\">Dublin</a>, where a society had been formed by one Mr Williams, a clergyman. Here they proved so successful, notwithstanding the number of Papists, and the violence of their other opponents, that in 1750 they had erected meeting-houses in every part of the kingdom, and had formed 29 circuits, which employed 67 itinerants, besides a considerable number of local preachers. An invitation was given to Mr Wesley, in 1751, to visit Scotland, by an officer in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MUSSELBURGH\">Musselburgh</a>. He accordingly took a journey thither the same year; but left the place, after preaching in it once or twice.\n\nIn 1753 he returned to Scotland, and visited Glasgow. Societies were at length formed in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, as well as at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUNDEE\">Dundee</a>, Aberdeen, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERNESS\">Inverness</a>, and a few other places; but his success was by no means equal to what it had been in other parts; for in 1790 the number of circuits in Scotland was no more than eight, which were supplied by 20 itinerants.\n\nMr Whitefield, the other great labourer in the vineyard, was equally indefatigable, and probably more successful than Mr Wesley. Before entering into orders, he had formed a society of religious persons at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GLOUCESTER\">Gloucester</a>; here he preached his first sermon on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">Necessity</a> and Benefit of Religious Society; here he became extremely popular, as well as at Bristol and London, while preparing to set sail for Georgia for the first time; and in all places to which he came, large collections were made for the poor. He maintained the same doctrine with Mr Wesley as to the new birth; which likewise gave offence to the clergy when delivered by him, as it had done with Mr Wesley. In the various intervals of his voyages to America, he employed himself with the very same assiduity in Britain and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>, which we have already taken notice of in the western continent. His success was everywhere prodigious. In 1741 he was invited to Scotland, and preached his first sermon there at Dunfermline. From thence he went to Edinburgh, and preached in several of the established churches, but differed with Messrs Ralph and Ebenezer Erskine; so that he, as well as Mr Wesley, proved unsuccessful in forming a coalition with any other religious party. In the private way, however, his success was very considerable, at Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dundee, and other places. In 1742 he paid a second visit to Scotland, and a third one in 1748. In 1751 he visited Ireland for the first time; and preached to great multitudes, without being molested, even in places where others had been mobbed. From thence he returned to Scotland the same year, and speaks in very favourable terms of the attention the people there paid to their Bibles. In 1752 and 1753 he again visited the same kingdom, and the last time distinguished himself by preaching against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-PLAYHOUSE\">playhouse</a> in Glasgow. In 1756 he returned; and by his animated discourses at Edinburgh against <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPERY\">Popery</a> and arbitrary power, was owned to have contributed very much to the increase of courage and loyalty in this country. Next year he again visited the Scottish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> during the time that the General Assembly sat, and his sermons were attended by several of the members. At Glasgow he made a large collection for the poor of that city, and from thence took a voyage to Ireland. He was received with the usual Methodist affection by the lower classes of Protestants; but the Popish rabble, exasperated at his success, almost murdered him with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>. After passing through a great part of Ireland, visiting England and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a>, he paid another visit to Scotland, where four clergymen now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENT\">lent</a> him their pulpits. His last visit was in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> of 1758, when his congregations were as large as ever; and it is to his endeavours principally that we are to ascribe the great number of Methodist societies now existing in Scotland.\n\nWith regard to the religious principles of the Methodists, we cannot enter into any particular detail; neither indeed are there any doctrines peculiar to all included under that name, except the single one of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDEMPTION\">redemption</a>. In March 1741, Mr Whitefield being returned to England, entirely separated from Mr Wesley and his friends, \"because he did not hold the decrees.\"\u2014Here was the first breach, which warm men persuaded Mr Whitefield to make, merely for a difference of opinion. Those indeed who believed universal redemption, had no desire at all to separate; but those who held particular redemption, would not hear of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a>, being determined to have no fellowship with men that \"were in such dangerous errors.\" So there were now two sorts of Methodists so called; those for particular, and those for general redemption.\n\nNot many years passed, before William Cudworth and James Rolly separated from Mr Whitefield.\u2014These were properly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANTINOMIANS\">Antinomians</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> avowed enemies to the law of God, which they never preached or professed to preach, but termed all legalists who did. With them, preaching the law was an abomination. They had nothing to do with the law. They would preach Christ, as they called it; but without one word either of holiness or good works. Yet these were still denominated Methodists, although differing from Mr Whitefield both in judgment and practice, abundantly more than Mr Whitefield did from Mr Wesley.\n\nIn the mean time, Mr Venn and Mr Romaine began to be spoken of; and not long after Mr Madan and Mr Berridge, with a few other clergymen, who, although they had no connexion with each other, yet preaching <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SALVATION\">salvation</a> by faith, and endeavouring to live accordingly, to be Bible Christians, were soon included in the general name of Methodists. And so indeed were all others who preached salvation by faith, and appeared more serious than their neighbours. Some of these were quite regular in their manner of preaching; some were quite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a>, (though not by choice; but necessity was laid upon them, they must preach irregularly, or not at all); and others were between both; regular in most, though not in all particulars.\n\nIn 1762, George <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BELL\">Bell</a> and a few other persons began to speak great words. In the latter end of the year they foretold that the world would be at an end on the 28th of February. Mr Wesley, with whom they were then connected, withstood them both in public and private.

He early discovered a fondness for polite literature and the sciences; and went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a> at Orkans with the son of Barneveldt, whom he accompanied in his travels. In 1610 he was made professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEYDEN\">Leyden</a>, and afterwards Greek professor. In the following year, the magistrates of the United Provinces proved how <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> was of his abilities, by fixing on him to write the history of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. Meursius married in the year 1612. His wife, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANNA\">Anna</a> Catharina Bilberbeccia, descended from a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> and noble <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> in Angermund a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Pomerania, possessed many amiable qualities, and rendered his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> remarkably happy, while he discharged the duties of his professorship with an assiduity equal to his abilities. At the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> the republic of letters did not lose the advantages to be derived from his labours; for during the fourteen years of his residence at Leyden, the works which he published were more numerous than those which had been presented to the world by the whole body of professors from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> foundation of the university in 1575.\n\nMeursius's writings had now spread his reputation in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>; nor was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> of his diligence and talents as a professor less known. In so high a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>, indeed, did he stand among his literary contemporaries, that Christian IV. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DENMARK\">Denmark</a> conferred on him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of historiographer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a>, and invited him to undertake the professorship of history and politics in the academy of Sora, which was founded by King Frederick II., although the revival of its honours and dignities may be dated from this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, when it seemed to be again founded under the auspices of Christian IV. Meursius and his family left Leyden in the year 1635. On his arrival at Sora, he was received with the most friendly tokens of regard by his majesty and the Danish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a>, and more particularly by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">Chancellor</a> Rosenkrantz, on whom he has bestowed very ample praises in one of his letters. Here he resided, equally beloved and admired, for above twelve years. His pupils were not very numerous, but his exertions never relaxed. Those hours likewise which were not devoted to the duties of his professorship, he employed in revising the works of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> and in philological disquisitions.\n\nHis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> did not suffer by the intenseness of application, till in the year 1638 he had a violent attack of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, from which disorder he had suffered severely. In a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to Vossius he thus describes his melancholy condition: \"The state of my health during the whole of the last winter has been truly deplorable. My sufferings from the stone have been really dreadful. I have voided so many, that the repeated discharges brought on a wound which emit-\nted blood for above four months. I was next attacked by a tertian fever, which increased constantly, and produced an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> lassitude of body, a dejection of spirits, and a total loss of appetite. But, thank <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>, I have now in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> recovered my strength, and gotten the better of these complaints.\" He recovered from this attack; but in the following year the disorder returned with redoubled violence, and brought on a consumption, which terminated his existence on the 29th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> of September 1639. He left behind him a son who was named after him, and one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a>.\n\nSo mild were the dispositions of Meursius, that in all his writings he constantly avoided literary disputes. He was sometimes unavoidably drawn into them; but constantly endeavoured to promote a reconciliation rather than widen any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREACH\">breach</a>, by his replies to the attacks of his adversaries. In his friendships he was firm and affectionate. Of his domestic life, whatever is known has been gathered from his letters. The same easy tranquillity seems to have attended him in every situation. In his family he was particularly fortunate. In his son, to whom he gave his own name, he seemed to behold his own youth renewed. The same application, the same eagerness in the pursuit of knowledge, marked the conduct of this promising young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>; who did not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> survive his father, but died soon after he had recommended himself to the notice of the learned world by his publications. They were only three in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>; but displayed so much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> learning that they have been assigned to the father, John Meursius, by l'Abb\u00e9 Beughem and others. This mistake was occasioned as much by the similitude of their names, as by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of their works, and their manner of treating philological subjects.\n\nHis works may be divided into four classes, of which each might form a separate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they were ever to be republished. Meursius himself indeed, in one of his letters to Vossius, proposes such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a>. From that epistle, and from another which the younger Meursius sent to G. I. Vossius, who strongly advised him to republish the whole of his father's writings, and from the collections of his posthumous works which have appeared from Struvius, Grosschupius, Moller, and some others, a catalogue of his works might be formed. Some assistance <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> also be derived from the indexes published in their respective works, by Hankins, Desselius, Wettenius, and Bartholinus. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> which Meursius recommends for publishing his works, is to insert in the first volume all that he has written relative to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a>; in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, his historical pieces; in the third his miscellaneous dissertations; and in the fourth, the various authors which he published, with his notes and corrections.\n\nA scandalous and indecent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, which is entitled *Meursii eleganti\u00e6 Latini sermonis*, and has *Aloisia Siggeae Satyrae Sotadic\u00e6* annexed to it, is very falsely attributed to Meursius; nor indeed are the *Satires* with more reason assigned to Aloisia Siggea, who was a Spanish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a> eminent for her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>.

In whatever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> they determined to reside for any considerable time, they erected houses and cultivated the ground. Thus their migrations were extremely slow, and it was not till 104 years after they set out that they reached a place about 50 miles to the eastward of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Mexico, where they settled for 20 years, giving to their new place of residence the name of Tollantzinco. From thence they proceeded about 40 miles farther to the west, where they built a city called, from the name of their country, Tollan, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TULA\">Tula</a>.\n\nAfter the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> settlement of the Toltecans, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> was changed into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONARCHY\">monarchy</a>. Their first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> began his reign in 667, and their monarchy lasted 384 years, during which time they reckon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> eight princes. We are not, however, to imagine that each of their kings lived <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> enough to make up this space. It was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> among them that the name of the king should be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> for 52 years, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> longer, from the time he ascended the throne. If he died within that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, the government was carried on in his name by a regency; if he survived, he was obliged to resign his authority. During the four centuries that the Toltecans monarchy continued, they had increased very considerably in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, and had built many cities; but when in the height of prosperity, almost the whole...\nwhole nation was destroyed by a famine occasioned by drought; and a pestilence, probably the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the former. According to Torquemada (says our author), at a certain festival-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> made by the Toltecans, the sad-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEVIL\">devil</a> appeared to them of a gigantic size, with immense arms, and in the midst of the entertainment he embraced and suffocated them; that then he appeared in the form of a child with a putrid head, and brought the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAGUE\">plague</a>; and, finally, at the persuasion of the same devil, they abandoned the country of Tula.\n\nThey were succeeded by the Chichemecas, a much more barbarous people, who came from an unknown country called Amaquemecan, where they had for a long time resided; but of which no traces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-REMEMBRANCE\">remembrance</a> can be found among any of the American nations known to Europeans; so that Clavigero supposes it must have been very far to the northward.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a> which the Chichemecas had for leaving their own country is not known. They were eighteen months on their journey, and took possession of the desolate country of the Toltecs about a hundred years after the former had left it. They were much more uncivilized than the Toltecs; but, however, had a regular form of monarchical government, and in other respects were less disgusting in their manners than some of the neighbouring nations. The last king who reigned in Amaquemecan before the departure of the Chichemecas, had left his dominions between his two sons Auchcauhitl and Xolotl, and the latter conducted the new colony. Having proceeded from the ruins of Tula towards Chempoalla and Tepepolio, Xolotl sent his son to survey the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> crossed the borders of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> which surround the vale of Mexico; then ascending to the top of a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> one, he viewed the whole country, and took possession of it in the name of his father, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHOOTING\">shooting</a> four arrows to the four winds.\n\nXolotl being informed by his son of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the country, chose for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of his kingdom Tenayuca, about six miles to the northward of the city of Mexico, and distributed his people in the neighbouring territory; but as most of them went to the northward, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> obtained the name of the country of the Chichemecas, in distinction from the rest. Here a review of the people was taken, and their number, according to Torquemada, was more than a million.\n\nXolotl finding himself peacefully settled in his new dominion, sent one of his officers to explore the sources of some of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> of the country. While performing this task he came to the habitations of some Toltecs, who it seems had still kept together, and were likely once more to become a nation. As these people were not inclined to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, and greatly esteemed for their knowledge and skill in the arts, the Chichemecas entered into a strict <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> with them, and Prince Nopaltzin, who had first surveyed the country, married a Toltec princess. The consequence of this alliance was the introduction of the arts and knowledge of the Toltecs among the Chichemecas. Till now the latter had subsisted entirely by hunting, and such fruits and roots as the earth spontaneously produced. They were clad in the skins of wild beasts, and, like these beasts, they are said to have sucked the blood of the animals they caught; but after their connection with the Toltecs they began to sow corn, to learn the art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGGING\">digging</a> and working <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a>, to cut <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, manufacture cotton, and, in every respect, to make great improvements.\n\nWhen Xolotl had reigned about eight years in his new territories, an embassy of six persons arrived from distant countries not far from Amaquemecan, expressing a desire of coming with their people to reside in the country of the Chichemecas. The king gave them a gracious reception, and assigned them a district; and, in a few years after, three other princes, with a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> of Acolhuans, who were likewise neighbours of Amaquemecan, made their appearance. The king was at that time at Tezcuco, to which place he had removed his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">court</a>; and here he was accosted by the princes, who, in a submissive and flattering manner, requested him to allow them a place in his happy country, where the people enjoyed such an excellent government. Xolotl not only gave them a favourable reception, but offered them his two daughters in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a>, expressing his concern that he had no more, that none might have been excluded from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> alliance. On the third prince, however, he bestowed a noble virgin of Chalco, in whom the Toltec and Chichemecan blood were united. The nuptials were celebrated with extraordinary pomp; and the two nations, after the example of the sovereigns, continued to intermarry. As the Acolhuans were the more civilized nation of the two, the name of Chichemecas began to be appropriated to the more rude and barbarous part, who preferred hunting to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>, or chose a life of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> in the mountains to the restraints of social laws. These barbarians associated with the Otomies, another savage nation who lived to the northward, occupying a tract of more than three hundred miles in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>; and by their descendants the Spaniards were harassed for many years after the conquest of Mexico.\n\nAs soon as the nuptial rejoicings were over, Xolotl divided his territories into three parts, assigning one to each of the princes. Acolhuatzin, who had married his eldest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a>, had Azocopazalco, 18 miles to the westward of Tezcuco; Chicouanquihli, who married the other, had a territory named Xaltocan; and Tzontecomatl, who married the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a> of inferior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>, had one named Coatlichan. The country continued for some time to flourish, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> increased greatly, and with it the civilization of the people; but as these advanced, the vices of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a> and ambition increased in proportion. Xolotl found himself obliged to treat his subjects with more severity than formerly, and even to put some of them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. This produced a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSPIRACY\">conspiracy</a> against him, which, however, he had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOOD_FORTUNE\">good fortune</a> to escape; but while he meditated a severe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a> on the conspirators, he was seized with the distemper of which he died, in the fortieth year of his reign, and in a very advanced <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>.\n\nXolotl was succeeded by his son Nopaltzin, who at the time of his accession is supposed to have been the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> about sixty years of age. In his time, the tranquillity of the kingdom, which had begun to suffer disturbance under his father, underwent much more violent shocks, and civil wars took place. Acolhuatzin, the only one of the three princes who remained alive, thinking the territory he possessed too narrow, made war upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">lord</a> of a neighbouring province named Tapotzotlan.\nTapotzolcan, and deprived him of his territory. Huetzin, son to the late Prince Tzontecomatl, lord of Coatlicau, fell in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a>-daughter of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a>, a celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>, but was rivalled by a neighbouring lord, who determined to support his pretensions by force of arms. Huetzin, however, got the better, defeated and killed his adversary, and then possessed himself of the lady and his estate. This was followed by a rebellion of the whole province of Tolantzinco, so that the king himself was obliged to take the field. As the rebels were very numerous, the royal army was at first defeated; but having at last received a strong reinforcement, the rebels were overcome, and their ringleaders severely punished. The king did not long survive the restoration of tranquillity to his dominions. He died in the thirty-second year of his reign, and ninety-second of his age, leaving the throne to his eldest son Tlotzin, who was an excellent prince, and reigned thirty-six years.\n\nQuinatzin, the son and successor of Tlotzin, proved a vain and luxurious prince. His accession to the throne was celebrated with much greater pomp than any of his predecessors. Xolotl had removed his court from Tenayuca to Tezence; but being disgusted with this last place, on account of the conspiracy formed against him there, he had returned to Tenayuca.\u2014There the court continued to the reign of Quinatzin, who removed it back to Tezcuco.\n\nThe reign of Quinatzin, though tranquil at first, was soon disturbed by dangerous revolts and rebellions. These first broke out in two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, named Matzilien and Totopec, situated among the northern mountains. The king, having collected a great army, marched without delay against the rebels, and challenged their leaders to come <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> and fight him in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>.\u2014This challenge being accepted, a furious engagement ensued, in which, though great numbers fell on both sides, no decisive advantage was gained by either party. Frequent engagements took place for the space of forty days, until at last the rebels perceiving that their own numbers were daily diminishing, without any possibility of being recruited like the royal army, made a final surrender to the king, who punished the ringleaders with great severity. Tranquillity, however, was not yet restored: the rebellion spread to such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, that the king was obliged not only to take the field in person, but to employ six other armies, under the command of faithful and experienced generals, to reduce the rebels. These proved so successful in their enterprises, that in a short time the rebellious cities were reduced to obedience, and the kingdom enjoyed the blessings of peace during the long reign of Quinatzin, who is said to have sat on the throne for no less than sixty years. He was succeeded by his son Tecbotlatla; but as the affairs of the Acolhuans now began to be connected with those of the Mexicans, it will be proper to give some account of that people.\n\nThe Mexicans, called also the Aztecas, dwelt till the year 1160 in a country called Aztlan, situated to the north of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GULF\">gulf</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CALIFORNIA\">California</a>, as appears by the route they pursued in their journey; but how far to the northward we are not certainly informed. Betancourt makes it no less than 2700 miles, and Boturini says it was a province of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>. The cause of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MIGRATION\">migration</a> is said to have been as follows:\n\nAmong the Aztecas was a person of great authority, named Huitzilin, to whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> every one paid the utmost deference. He had conceived a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> to persuade his countrymen to change their residence; and to effect this he fell upon the following stratagem. Having heard, while meditating on his scheme, a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BIRD\">bird</a> singing on the branches of a tree, the notes of which resembled the word Tikin, which in the Azteca <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> signified \"let us go,\" he took that opportunity to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a> of the people. With this view, he took along with him a respectable person, and made him attend to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> of the bird. \"What can it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> (says he), but that we must leave this country, and find ourselves another? Without doubt it is the warning of some secret <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a> who watches over our welfare: let us obey, therefore, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a>, and not draw his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a> upon us by a refusal.\" Tecpaltzin, for that was the name of his friend, readily agreed to the interpretation; and both of them being persons of great influence, their united persuasions soon gained over to their project the bulk of the nation, and they accordingly set out.\n\nThe Aztecas, when they left their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> habitations, were divided into six tribes; but at Culiacan the of the Mexicans were left with their god * by five of them, viz. the Xochimilcas, Tepanecas, Chalcecs, Thahuicas, and Tlascalans. The cause of this separation is not known, but it was probably occasioned by some disagreement among themselves; for the remaining <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> was divided into two violent factions, which persecuted one another; neither did they afterwards construct any more edifices. However, they always travelled together, in order to enjoy the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> of their imaginary god. At every place where they stopped an altar was erected to him; and at their departure they left behind them all their sick, and probably also some others to take care of them, or such as were not willing to endure the fatigue of farther journeys. They stopped in Tula <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> years, and eleven more in the neighbouring parts. At last, in 1216, they arrived at Zumpanco, a considerable city in the vale of Mexico, where they were received in a very hospitable manner by the lord of that district. He not only assigned them proper habitations, but became very much attached to them; and even demanded from among them a wife for his son Illucatl. This request was complied with; and from this marriage all the Mexican kings descended.\n\nThe Mexicans continued to migrate from one place to another along the lake of Tezcuco. Xolotl, who was then on the throne of the Acolhuans or Chichimecas, allowed them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> in whatever places of his dominions they thought proper; but some of them finding themselves harassed by a neighbouring lord, The Mexi were obliged in 1245, to retire to Chapultepec, a mountain on the western borders of the lake, scarcely cut, two miles distant from the site of Mexico. This took place in the reign of Nopaltzin, when disturbances began to take place in the Acolhuan dominions. The Mexicans, however, did not find themselves any more secure in their new place of residence than formerly: they were persecuted by the neighbouring lords, and obliged to take refuge in a number of small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>, named Acoococo, at the southern extremity of the lake of Mexico. Here for 52 years they lived in the most miserable\nIn this miserable plight the Mexicans continued till the year 1314, when they were reduced to a state of the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SLAVERY\">slavery</a>. This was done by the king of a petty state named Colhuacan, who, it is said, being unwilling to allow the Mexicans to maintain themselves in his territories without paying tribute, made war upon them, subdued and enslaved them. Others affirm that, pretending compassion for their miserable situation, he offered them a more commodious place of residence. The Mexicans readily accepted the offer; but had scarcely set out to take possession of their new place of residence when they were attacked by the Colhuans, made prisoners, and carried off for slaves.\n\nAfter some years a war broke out betwixt the Colhuans and Xochimilcas, in which the latter gained such advantages, that they were obliged to employ their slaves to assist them. They accordingly ordered them to prepare for war, but without furnishing them with arms necessary for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> enterprise; so that the Mexicans were obliged to content themselves with long staves, having their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> hardened in the fire; they also made knives of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> itztili, and shields of reeds woven together. They agreed not to waste their time in making prisoners, but to content themselves with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> off one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EAR\">ear</a> of their enemies, and then leaving them without further injury. They adhered punctually to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a>; and rushing furiously upon the Xochimilcas, cut off an ear from as many as they could, killing those who struggled to such a degree that they could not effect their purpose. In short, so well did the Mexicans acquit themselves in this engagement, that the Xochimilcas fled, and took refuge among the mountains. After the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a>, the Colhuan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> presented themselves before their general with the prisoners they had taken, by the number of which alone they judged of their valour. The Mexicans had taken only four, and these they kept concealed for the abominable purpose of sacrificing them. The Colhuans, therefore, seeing no trophies of their valour, began to reproach them with cowardice; but the Mexicans, producing their baskets of ears, desired them to judge from these how many prisoners they might have taken, had they not been unwilling to retard their victory by taking up time in binding them.\n\nNotwithstanding the valour displayed by the Mexicans in this engagement, it doth not appear that their haughty masters were in the least inclined to afford them easier terms than before. Having erected an altar to their god, they demanded of their lord something precious to offer in sacrifice to him; but he in disdain sent them a dirty cloth, enclosing the filthy carcass of a vile bird. This was carried by Colhuan priests; and without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a> laid upon the altar. The Mexicans, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> unconcern, removed this filthy offering, and put in its place a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a> made of itztili, and an odoriferous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERB\">herb</a>. On the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> of consecration, the Colhuan prince attended with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a>; not with a view to do <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> to the festival, but to make a mockery of the Mexicans. Their derision, however, was soon changed into horror, when the Mexicans, after a solemn dance, brought forth the four Xochimilcan prisoners they had taken; and, after having made them dance a little, cut open their breasts with the knife which lay on the altar, and plucking out their hearts, offered them, while yet palpitating with life, to their diabolical idol. This had such an effect upon the spectators, that both king and subjects desired the Mexicans immediately to quit their territories and go where they pleased. This order was instantly obeyed: the whole nation took their route towards the north, until they came to a place named Acotizsinilhan, situated betwixt two lakes, and afterwards named Mericallisino; but for some reason or other, being discontented with this situation, as indeed they seem very often to have been, they proceeded to Ixtacalco, still nearer to the site of Mexico. Here they formed the image of a little mountain of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, and danced round it a whole night, singing their victory over the Xochimilcas, and returning thanks to their god for having freed them from the yoke of the Colhuans. Clavigero is of opinion, that by this mountain they represented Colhuacan, as in their pictures it was always represented by a hunch-backed mountain; and this is the literal signification of the name.\n\nThe city of Mexico was founded in the year 1325. The city in the most inconvenient situation we can imagine, Mexico viz. on a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> named Tenochtitlan, in the middle of a great lake, without ground to cultivate for their subsistence, or even room sufficient to build their habitations. Their life was therefore as miserable here for some time as it had been when they were on the islands at the end of the lake, and they were reduced to the same shift to maintain themselves. To enlarge the boundaries of their island, they drove palisades into those parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> which were most shallow, terracing them with stones and turf, and uniting to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> island several other smaller ones which lay in the neighbourhood. To procure to themselves afterwards stones, wood, &c. for constructing their habitations, as well as clothing and other necessaries, they instituted a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> with the people who dwelt on the borders of the lake, supplying them with fish, waterfowl, and other more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> inhabitants of the lake and marshes, which they contrived to render eatable; and in return for all this they received the necessaries above mentioned. The greatest effort of their industry, however, was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of floating gardens, by means of bushes and the mud of the lake; and these they brought to such perfection that they produced maize, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEPPER\">pepper</a>, chia, French beans, and gourds.\n\nFor thirteen years that the Mexicans had to struggle with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> difficulty, they remained at peace; but no sooner did they begin to prosper and live comfortably, than the inveterate enmity betwixt the two factions broke out in all its fury. This produced a separation; and one of the parties took up their residence on a small island at a little distance to the northward, which, from a heap of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> found there, they at first named Xaltitlaco, but afterwards Tlatelolco, from a terrace constructed by themselves. This island was afterwards united to that of Tenochtitlan.\n\nAbout this time the Mexicans divided their city into four parts, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> which still subsists; each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> having now its tutelar saint, as it had formerly its tutelar god. In the midst of their city was the sanctuary of their great god Mecitli, whom they constantly preferred to all the rest. To him they daily performed acts...\nacts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADORATION\">adoration</a>; but instead of making any progress in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>, they seem to have daily improved in the most horrible barbarities, at least in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>. The dreadful sacrifices made of their prisoners, could only be exceeded by that which we are now about to relate. Being now on a more respectable footing than formerly, they sent an embassy to the petty king of Colhuacan, requesting him to send them one of his daughters, that she might be consecrated the mother of their protecting god. The unsuspecting prince readily complied with their desire.\u2014The unfortunate princess was conducted in great triumph to Mexico; but no sooner was she arrived, than she was sacrificed in a shocking manner; and, to add to the horror of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEED\">deed</a>, the body was flayed, and one of the bravest young men of the nation dressed in her skin. Her father, ignorant of this dreadful transaction, was invited by the Mexicans to be present at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOTHEOSIS\">apotheosis</a> of his daughter, and went to see the solemnity, and to worship the new divinity. He was led into the sanctuary, where the young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> stood clothed in the bloody skin of his daughter; but the darkness of the place prevented him from seeing what was before him. They gave him a censer in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, and some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COPAL\">copal</a> to begin his worship; but having discovered by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> of the copal the horrible spectacle, he ran out in a distracted manner, calling upon his people to revenge the injury; but this they were not able to do at that time nor ever after.\n\nIn the year 1352 the Mexican government was changed from an aristocracy to a monarchy. At first they were governed by 20 lords, of whom one had an authority superior to the rest. This naturally suggested the idea of monarchy; and to this change they were also induced by the contemptible state in which their nation still continued, thinking that the royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> would confer upon it a degree of splendour which otherwise it could not enjoy; and that by having one leader, they would be better able to oppose their enemies. Proceeding, therefore, to elect a king, the choice fell upon Acamapitzin, a man of great estimation among them, and descended from Opochli, a noble Aztecan, and a princess of the royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> of Colhuacan. As he was yet a bachelor, they attempted to negotiate a marriage, first with the daughter of the lord of Tacuba, and then of the king of Azcapozalco; but these proposals being rejected with disdain, they applied to Acolmiztli lord of Coatlichan, and a descendant of one of the three Colhuacan princes; who complied with their request, and the nuptials were celebrated with great rejoicings.\n\nIn the mean time, the Tlatelolcos, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> rivals of the Mexicans, resolved not to be behind them in anything which had the least appearance of augmenting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> of their state. They likewise, therefore, chose a king; but not thinking proper to choose him from among themselves, they applied to the king of the Tepanecas, who readily sent them his son; and he was crowned first king of Tlatelolco in 1353. In this the Tlatelolcos seem to have had a design of humbling their rivals, as well as rendering themselves more respectable; and therefore it is probable that they had represented the Mexicans as wanting in that respect due to the Tepanecan monarch, as having elected a king without his leave, though at the same time they were tributaries to him. The consequence of this was, that he took a resolution to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> their tribute. Hitherto they had paid only a certain number of fish and waterfowl; but now they were ordered to bring also several thousands of fir and willow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> to be set in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a> and gardens of Azcapozalco, and to transport to the court a great floating garden, which produced vegetables of every kind known in Anahuac. This being accomplished with great difficulty, the king commanded them next year to bring him another garden, with a duck and swan in it both sitting upon eggs; but so, that on their arrival at Azcapozalco the brood might be ready to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HATCH\">hatch</a>. This was also done; and the prince had the satisfaction of seeing the young birds come out of the eggs. The third year they were ordered to bring a live stag along with a garden. This was more difficult than any of the former tasks; because they were obliged, in order to hunt the stag, to go to the mountains of the continent, where they were in danger of falling into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of their enemies; however, this also was accomplished, and the desire of the king gratified.\n\nIn this manner the Mexicans were oppressed for no less than 50 years. They freed themselves, however, from all their difficulties by vigorous exertions, absurdly ascribing to the protection of that malevolent being whom they worshipped the glory of every deliverance. Acamapitzin governed this city, which at that time comprehended the whole of his dominions, for 37 years in peace. His queen being barren, he married another wife, but without abandoning the first; and these two, instead of being rivals to one another, lived together in the utmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a>; the first wife taking upon herself the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of educating Huitzilihuitle, the son of the second. He had, besides, several children by other women, and one named Itzcactl, who afterwards proved one of the best and most renowned kings who sat on the throne of Mexico. He is said also to have conquered four considerable cities; but Clavigero thinks he must in this only have been an auxiliary, it being very improbable, that while he could scarce maintain his own territories, he should think of foreign conquests.\n\nAcamapitzin died in 1389, greatly lamented by the Mexicans, and his death was followed by an interregnum of four months. As the deceased monarch had formerly resigned his authority into the hands of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBLES\">nobles</a>, it was necessary that a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a> should take place; and when this was done, the choice fell upon Huitzilihuitle, the son of Acamapitzin. As he was still unmarried, it was resolved, if possible, to procure him an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> and advantageous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATCH\">match</a>. With this view, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEPUTATION\">deputation</a> of second nobility was sent to the king of Azcapozalco, requesting, in very humble terms, an alliance with one of his daughters. The expressions made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of by these ambassadors are said by our author to have been particularly elegant in the Mexican language; but it is difficult to understand how a speech made among a people ignorant of the art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> could be particularly recorded at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HUNDREDS\">hundreds</a> of years after.

Its surface covers 5700 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> leagues, and it contained in 1823 40,200 inhabitants according to Humboldt. It is fertile, but is believed to be destitute of metallic wealth. It is watered through its whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> by the Rio del Norte, the banks of which are picturesque, and are adorned with beautiful poplars, and other trees peculiar to the temperate zone.\n\nThough under the same latitude with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SYRIA\">Syria</a> and central <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a>, this country has a remarkably <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>. Near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SANTA_FE\">Santa Fe</a>, and a little further north, the Rio del Norte is sometimes covered for a succession of several years with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ICE\">ice</a> thick enough to admit the passage of horses and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARRIAGES\">carriages</a>.

Humboldt informs us that in 1752, the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a> of this river, for more than 30 leagues above and 20 leagues below Passo del Norte, became dry of a sudden, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> having precipitated itself into a newly formed chasm, and only made its re-appearance near the Presidio de San Eleazar; at length, after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAPSE\">lapse</a> of several weeks, the water resumed its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> course, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> doubt because the chasm and the subterraneous conductors had been filled up.

Some commercial intercourse exists however, between the whites and the Indians, and it is carried on in a singular manner.

Having performed his studies at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CAEN\">Caen</a>, he discovered a strong inclination to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a>; but going to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, he, by the advice of one of his friends, applied himself to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of politics and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, and procured the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSARY\">commissary</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, which he held for two campaigns. He then shut himself up in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a> of St. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARBE\">Barbe</a>, in the midst of books and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUSCRIPTS\">manuscripts</a>; and, in 1643, published the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the History of France, in folio; and some years after, the other two volumes. Mezeray in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> surpassed all who had written the history of France before him, and was rewarded by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> with a pension of 4000 livres. In 1668, he published an Abridgement of his History of France, in three volumes 4to, which was well received by the public; but as he inserted in that work the origin of most of the taxes, with very free reflections, M. Colbert complained of it, when Mezeray promised to correct what he had done in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> edition; but those corrections being only palliations, the minister caused half of his pension to be suppressed. Mezeray complained of this in very severe terms; when he obtained <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> other answer than the suppression of the other half. Vexed at this treatment, he resolved to write on subjects that could not expose him to such disappointments; and composed his treatise on the origin of the French, which did him much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a>. He was elected perpetual secretary to the French academy; and died in 1683. He is said to have been a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> extremely negligent in his person, and so careless in his dress, that he might have passed for a begger rather than for what he was.

With regard to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, he affected Pyrrhonism; which however was not, it seems, so much in his heart as in his mouth. This appeared from his last sickness; for having sent for those friends who had been the most usual witnesses of his licentious talk about religion, he made a sort of recantation, which he concluded with desiring them \"to forget what he might formerly have said upon the subject of religion, and to remember, that Mezeray dying was a better believer than Mezeray in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>.\" Besides his history, he also wrote, 1.

The instruments used in this kind of engraving are cradles, scrapers and burnishers.\n\nIn this engraving, the plate must be prepared and polished in the same manner as for other engraving; and afterwards divided equally by lines <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to each other, and traced out with very soft chalk.\u2014The distance of these lines should be about one-third of the length of the face of the cradle which is to be used, and these lines should be marked with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> letters, or strokes of the chalk. The cradle is then to be placed exactly betwixt the two first lines, and passed forwards in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>; being kept as steady as possible, and pressed upon with a moderate force. The same operation must be repeated with respect to all other lines; till the instrument has thus passed over the whole surface of the plate.\u2014Other lines must be then drawn from the extremities of the other two sides, in the same manner; which, intersecting the first at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> with them form squares; and the same operation must be repeated with the cradle as in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of the first. New lines must then be drawn diagonally, and the cradle passed betwixt them as before; and when the first diagonal operation is performed, the lines must be crossed at right angles as the former, and the cradles passed betwixt them in the same manner.\u2014The plate having undergone the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the cradle, according to the disposition of the first order of lines, a second set must be formed, having the same distances from each other as the first. But they must be so placed as to divide those already made into spaces one-third less than their whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>; i.e., every one after the first on each side will take in one-third of that before it, e.g., beginning at A, of which the first third must be left out; a third of B will consequently be taken in, and so of the rest. These lines of the second order must be marked with small letters, or lesser strokes, to distinguish them from the first; and the same treatment of the plate must be pursued with respect to them as was practised for the others. When this second operation is finished, a third order of lines must be made, the first of which, e.g., in A, must omit two-thirds of it, and consequently take in two-thirds of B, &c. By these means, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> spaces will be exactly divided into equal thirds; and the cradle must be again employed betwixt these lines as before.\u2014When the whole of this operation is finished, it is called one turn; but in order to produce a very dark and uniform ground, the plate must undergo the repetition of all these several operations for above twenty times; beginning to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> the cradle again betwixt the first lines, and proceeding in the same manner through all the rest. When the plate is prepared with a proper ground, the sketch must be chalked on it, by rubbing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> on the backside with chalk.\n\nIt is also proper to overtrace it afterwards with black lead or Indian ink. The scraping is then performed, by paring or cutting away the grain of the ground in various degrees; so that none of it is left in the original state except in the touches of the strongest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a>. The general manner of proceeding is the same as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> upon black paper. The masses of light are first begun with; and those parts which go off into light in their upper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a>, but are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> below: the reflections are then entered upon; after which the plate is blackened with a printer's blacking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> made of felt, in order to discover the effect; and then the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> is proceeded with; observing always to begin every part in the places where the strongest lights are to be.\n\nThe art of scraping mezzotintos has been applied to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINTING\">printing</a> with a variety of colours, in order to produce the resemblance of paintings. The inventor of the method of doing this was J. C. Le Blon, a native of Frankfort, and pupil of Carlo Marata, between the years 1720 and 1730. It was established by the inventor on this principle, that there are three primitive colours, of which all the rest may be composed by mixing them in various proportions; that any two of these colours being mixed together, preserve their original power, and only produce a third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> such as their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> must necessarily give; but if transparent colours be mixed, and three primitive kinds compounded together, they destroy each other, and produce black, or a tendency to it, in proportion to the equality or inequality of the mixture; and that if, therefore, these three colours be laid, either separately or upon each other, by three plates, engraved correspondently on these principles to the colouring of the design, the whole variety of teints necessary may be produced. The requisites, therefore, to the execution of any design in this method of printing are as follows:\n\n1. To <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of the colouring to be imitated; showing where the presence of each of the three simple colours is necessary, either in its pure state or combined with some other, to produce the effect required; and to reduce this plan to a painted sketch of each, in which not only the proper outlines, but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of strength should be expressed.\n\n2. To engrave three plates according to this plan, which may print each of the colours exactly in the places where, and proportion in which, they are wanted.\n\n3. To find three transparent substances proper for printing with these three primitive colours. The manner in which M. le Blon prepared the plates was as follows: The three plates of copper were first well fitted with respect to size and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> to each other, and grounded in the same manner as those designed for mezzotinto prints: and the exact <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> and boundary of each of the three primitive colours, conformably to the design, were sketched out on three papers, answering in dimensions to the plate. These sketches were then chalked on the plates; and all the parts of each plate that were not to convey the colour to which it was appropriated to the print, were entirely scraped away, as in forming the light of mezzotinto prints. The parts that were to convey the colours were then worked upon; and where the most light or diluted teints of the colour were to be, the grain in the ground was proportionably taken off; but where the\nfull colour was required, it was left entire. In this regard was had, not only to the effects of the colour in its simple state, but to its combined operation, either in producing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">orange</a>-colour, green, or purple, by its admixture with one alone; and likewise to its forming brown, gray, and shades of different degrees, by its co-operation with both the others. But though the greatest part of the engraving was performed in the mezzotinto manner, yet the graver was employed occasionally for strengthening the shades, and for correcting the outline where it required great accuracy and steadiness. It was found necessary sometimes to have two separate plates for printing the same colour, in order to produce a stronger effect: but the second plate, which was used to print upon the first, was intended only to glaze and soften the colours in particular parts that might require it. With respect to the black and brown tints, which could not be so conveniently produced in a due degree by the mixture of the colours, umber and black were likewise used.\n\nWith respect to the order in which the plates are to be applied, it may be proper to observe, that the colour which is least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> should be laid on first; that which is betwixt the most and least apparent next; and that which predominates last; except where there may be occasion for two plates for the same colour, as was before mentioned; or where there is any required for adding browns and shades.\n\nM. le Blon applied this art to portraits, and showed, by the specimens he produced, the possibility of its being brought, by farther improvements, to afford imitations of painting which might have some value. It is nevertheless much better adapted to the simpler subjects, where there are fewer intermixtures of colours; and where the accuracy of the reflections, and demi-tints, are not so essentially necessary to the truth of the design, from the greater latitude of form, and disposition of the colour, as in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a>, anatomical figures, and some subjects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a>. But perhaps plates engraved or rather finished with the tool, particularly with respect to the outline, would be better accommodated in some of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> than those prepared only by scraping.\n\nM. Cochin remarks at the end of an account he has given of M. le Blon's manner, that though this ingenious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a> confined his method principally to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of three colours; yet, should this invention be again taken up and cultivated, there would be more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> of success in using a greater variety; and that several different kinds might be printed by one plate, provided they were laid on in their respectively proper places by printing-balls, which should be used for that colour only. His hint might however be very greatly improved, by the further assistance of pencils, accommodated to the plates, for laying on the colours in the proper parts.\u2014For the method of taking off mezzotintos prints on glass, see Back-painting.\n\nMiasma, among physicians, a particular kind of effluvia, by which certain fevers, particularly intermittents, are produced.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MICA\">Mica</a>, Muscovy glass, or Glimmer, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of mineral substance.

He is cited by Jeremiah, and prophesied in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah. He censures the reigning vices of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAMARIA\">Samaria</a>, and denounces the judgments of God against both kingdoms. He likewise foretells the confusion of the enemies of the Jews, the coming of the Messiah, and the glorious success of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>.\n\nMichael, or Michel, (i.e. who is like to God?) The scripture account of Michael is, that he was an archangel, who presided over the Jewish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, as other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGELS\">angels</a> did over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENTILE\">Gentile</a> world, as is evident of the kingdoms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>, (Dan. x. 13.) that he had an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> of angels under his command (Rev. xii. 7;) that he fought with the Dragon, or Satan and his angels; and that, contending with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEVIL\">Devil</a>, he disputed about the body of Moses, (Jude 9.) As to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBAT\">combat</a> between Michael and the Dragon, some authors understand it literally, and think it means the expulsion of certain rebellious angels, with their head or leader, from the presence of God. Others take it in a figurative <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>; and refer it, either to the contest that happened at Rome between St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a> and Simon Magus, in which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APOSTLE\">apostle</a> prevailed over the magician, or to those violent persecutions under which the church laboured for three hundred years, and which happily ceased when the powers of the world became Christian. Among the commentators who maintain the former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> is Grotius; and among those who take it in a figurative sense are Hammond and Mede.\n\nThe contest about the body of Moses is likewise taken both literally and figuratively. Those who understand it literally are of opinion, that Michael by the order of God hid the body of Moses after his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>; and that the Devil endeavoured to discover it, as a fit means to entice the people to idolatry, by a superstitious worship of his relics. But this dispute is figuratively understood to be a controversy about rebuilding the temple, and restoring the service of God among the Jews at Jerusalem; the Jewish church being filly enough styled the body of Moses. It is thought by some, that this story of the contest between Michael and the Devil was taken by St Jude out of an apocryphal book called The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSUMPTION\">Assumption</a> of Moses.\n\nThe Romish church celebrates three appearances of Michael, of which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> mention is made in scripture, and which have happened, they say, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> time after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of the apostles. The first appearance of this archangel was at Colosse in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHRYGIA\">Phrygia</a>, but at what time is uncertain. The second is that of Mount Garganus, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPLES\">Naples</a>, about the end of the fifth century. The third is his appearance to Aubert bishop of Avranches, upon a rock called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOMB\">Tomb</a>, where at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABBEY\">abbey</a> of St Michael. This was about the year 766. The first of these festivals is observed on the 6th of September, the second on the 6th of May, and the last on the 16th of October. It has been supposed, that it was Michael the archangel who conducted the Israelites in their journey through the wilderness, (see Exod. xxxii. 20, 23, and xxxiii. 2.) that it was he who appeared to Moses in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> bush; who appeared to Joshua in the fields of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERICHO\">Jericho</a>, and to Gideon and Manoah the father of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAMSON\">Samson</a>; and...\nMichael, and, in a word, to him have been imputed the greatest part of the most remarkable appearances either in the Old or New Testament.\n\nMichael Angelo. See Angelo.\n\nMount Michael, formerly one of the most celebrated state <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-PRISONS\">prisons</a> of France, lies about 20 miles from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANVILLE\">Granville</a>. It is a rock situated in the middle of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a> of Avranches; and is only accessible at low <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">Nature</a> has completely fortified one side, by its craggy and almost perpendicular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a>, which renders it impracticable to mount it by any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> or courage, however consummate. The other parts are surrounded by walls fenced with semilunar towers after the Gothic manner; but sufficiently strong, together with the advantage of its situation, to render it impregnable to any attack. At the foot of the mountain begins a street or town, which winds round its base to a considerable height. Above are chambers where state prisoners are kept, and where there are other buildings intended for residence. On the summit is erected the abbey itself, occupying a prodigious space of ground, and of a strength and solidity equal to its enormous size; since it has for many centuries withstood all the injuries of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, to which it is so much exposed. In an apartment, called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">Sale</a> de Chavalerie, the knights of St Michael used to meet in solemn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONVOCATION\">convocation</a> on important occasions. They were the defenders and guardians of this mountain and abbey, as those of the Temple, and of St John of Jerusalem, were of the holy sepulchre. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HALL\">hall</a> in which they met is very spacious, but rude and barbarous. At one end is a painting of the archangel, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a> of their order; and in this hall <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> XI. first instituted and invested with the insignia of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-KNIGHTHOOD\">knighthood</a> the chevaliers of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> of St Michael. There is a miserable dark apartment, or rather dungeon, in which many eminent persons were formerly confined. In the middle of it is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CAGE\">cage</a>, composed of prodigious bars of wood; and the wicket which gives entrance into it is 10 or 12 inches in thickness. The inside of it comprises about 12 or 14 feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>, and it is nearly 20 in height. Towards the latter end of the 17th century, a newswriter in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, who had presumed to print some very severe and sarcastic reflections on Madame de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAINTENON\">Maintenon</a>, was confined in this place. Some months after his publication, he was induced, by a person sent expressly for that purpose, to make a tour into French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLANDERS\">Flanders</a>. The moment he had quitted the Dutch territories, he was put under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARREST\">arrest</a>; and immediately, by his majesty's express command, conducted to Mount Michael, where he was shut up in this cage. Here he lived upwards of 23 years; and here he at length expired. During the long nights of winter, no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a> or fire was allowed him. He was not permitted to have any book. He <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> face, except the gaoler, who came once every day to present him, through a hole in the wicket, with his little portion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a> and wine. No instrument was given him with which he could destroy himself; but he found means at length to draw out a nail from the wood, with which he engraved, or cut on the bars of his cage, certain fleurs de lis and armorial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARINGS\">bearings</a>, which formed his only employment and recreation. They are very curiously performed considering the rudeness of his instrument.\n\nThe subterraneous chambers in this mountain are said to be so numerous, that the gaolers themselves do not know them. There are certain dungeons called Aubliettes, into which they were accustomed anciently to let down malefactors guilty of very heinous crimes: they provided them with a loaf of bread and a bottle of wine, and then they were totally forgotten, and left to perish by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUNGER\">hunger</a> in the dark vaults of the rock. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>, however, has not been inflicted by any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> in the last or present century.\n\nHere also is a remarkable chamber, in one corner of which is a kind of window: between this and the wall of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> is a very deep space, of near 100 feet perpendicular, at the bottom of which is another window opening to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>. It is called the Hole of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTGOMERY\">Montgomery</a>; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of it is as follows: In the year 1559, Henry II. king of France was unfortunately killed at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOURNAMENT\">tournament</a> by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNT\">count</a> de Montgomery*. He was a Huguenot; and having escaped* See the massacre of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, made head against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> forces in Normandy, supported by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> Elizabeth N\u00b0 149 with arms and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>. Being driven from his fortresses in these parts, he retired to a rock called the Tombe-laine. This is another similar to Mount Michael; only three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a> from it, and of nearly equal dimensions. At that time there was a castle upon it, which has since been demolished, and of which scarce any vestiges now remain. From this fortress, accessible only at low-water, he continually made excursions, and annoyed the enemy, who never dared to attack him. He coined money, hid all the adjacent country under contribution, and rendered himself universally dreaded. Desirous, however, to surprise Mount Michael, he found means to engage one of the monks resident in the abbey; who promised to give him the signal for his enterprise by displaying a handkerchief. The monk having made the signal, betrayed him, and armed all his associates, who waited Montgomery's arrival. The chieftain came, attended by 50 chosen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a>, all desperate, and capable of any attempt. They crossed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>; and having placed their scaling-ladders, mounted one by one. As they came to the top, they were despatched, each in turn, without noise. Montgomery, who followed last, discovered the perfidy, and escaped with only two of his men, with whom he regained the Tombe-laine. They preserve with great care the ladders and grappling irons used on this occasion. The count was at last besieged and taken prisoner, by the mar\u00e9chal de Matignon, in 1574, at Domfront, in Normandy; and Catharine de Medicis, who hated him for having been, though innocently, the cause of her husband's death, caused him to be immediately executed.\n\nThe church of Mount Michael is a great curiosity. It stands on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> pillars of most enormous dimensions, built on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> rock. Each of them appears to be about 25 feet in circumference: besides these, there are two others much inferior in size, on which the centre of the church rests, and over which is the tower. The following is the legendary account of the origin of this church: In the reign of Childibert II. there was a bishop of Avranches named St Aubert. To this holy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> the archangel Michael was pleased to appear one night, and ordered him to go to this rock to build a church. St Aubert treated this as a dream; upon which the angel appeared a second time; and being still disobeyed,\ndisobeyed, he returned a third time, when, by way of imprinting his command upon the saint's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>, he made a hole in his skull by touching it with his thumb. The skull is still preserved in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURY\">treasury</a> of the church. It is enclosed in a little shrine of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>, and a crystal, which opens over the orifice, admits the gratification of curiosity by the minutest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of it. The hole is of a size and shape proportionable to the thumb said to have produced it; but it is impossible to determine whether it has been really made by a knife or any other way. It is not to be supposed that the saint would forget such a sensible mark of the angel's displeasure; he therefore immediately repaired to the rock, and constructed a small church, as he had been commanded. Here, however, true history supplies the place of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FABLE\">fable</a>; and informs us, that it was in 966 when Richard the second <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Normandy began to build the abbey. It was completed about the year 1070, under William the Conqueror, though many other additions were made by succeeding abbots.\n\nIn the treasury of the church are innumerable other relics: among which some few have a real and intrinsic value. There is a fine head of Charles VI. of France, cut in a crystal, and the representation of a cockle-shell in gold, weighing many pounds, given by Richard II. duke of Normandy, when he founded the abbey. There is an arm said to belong to St Richard king of England; but who this saint was it must be very difficult to determine. Such is the history of the prison, abbey, and church of Mount Michael previous to the revolution; they have probably undergone some changes since that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>.","sp":836,"ep":840},{"h":"MICHAELIS","t":"JOHN <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAVID\">DAVID</a>, a celebrated biblical critic, and author of many esteemed works, was the eldest son of Dr Christian Benedict Michaelis, professor in the university of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HALLE\">Halle</a> in Lower <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAXONY\">Saxony</a>, and was born at that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, Feb. 27. 1717.

The next year he obtained a place of secretary to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> there, of which he was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTOR\">director</a> in 1761, and was soon afterwards made aulic counsellor by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HANOVER\">Hanover</a>. In 1764 his distinguished talents, but chiefly a publication relative to a journey to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARABIA\">Arabia</a>, which was undertaken by several literary men, at the expense of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DENMARK\">Denmark</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of his application by means of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> Bernsdorf, procured him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of being chosen a correspondent, and afterwards foreign member of the Academy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-INSCRIPTIONS\">Inscriptions</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, of whom the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> admitted only eight; and in the same year he became a member of the society of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAARLEM\">Haarlem</a>. In 1775, Count Hopkin, who eighteen years before had prohibited the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of his writings at Upsal, when he was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">chancellor</a> of that university, prevailed on the king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a> to confer on him the order of the Polar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAR\">Star</a>, as a national compensation. In 1786 he was raised to the distinguished <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of privy counsellor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> by the court of Hanover; and in 1788 received his last literary honour, by being unanimously elected a fellow of the Royal Society of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>.\u2014His great critical knowledge of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEBREW\">Hebrew</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, which he displayed in a new translation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIBLE\">Bible</a>, and in other works, raised him to a degree of eminence almost unknown before in Germany; and his indefatigable labours were only equalled by his desire of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> the knowledge he acquired to the numerous students of all countries who frequented his admirable lectures, which he continued to deliver on various parts of the sacred writings in half-yearly courses, and on the Hebrew, Arabic, and Syriac languages, to the last year of his life. He was professor in the university of Gottingen 45 years, and, during that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, he filled the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a> with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a>, and usefulness. He died October 22. 1791, aged 74. He is said to have left behind him several valuable MSS. Of the works that were published during his life-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, and which are very numerous, a catalogue, in the order of their publication, is given in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">Gentleman</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGAZINE\">Magazine</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 1792.","sp":840,"ep":840},{"h":"MICHAELMAS","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Feast of St Michael and all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGELS\">Angels</a>, a festival of the Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, observed on the 29th of September.

He was born about the year 1735, and was educated by his father. In his early years his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a> frequently discovered itself; though till the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of 13 he did not show any particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to books. At that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> having accidentally met with Spenser's Faery <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a>, he became enamoured of his manner of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>, and instantly began to imitate him. After the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of his father, he came to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> to reside with his uncle who was a brewer there, and who admitted him into a share of his business; not being qualified to succeed in this line, he went to London about the time of the conclusion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> which began in 1755, with a view to procure a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">marine</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>. Here he was disappointed; but introduced himself to the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Lyttelton, to whom he sent one of his poems. From his Lordship, however, he received <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> other favour than being admitted to several interviews, and encouraged to persevere in his poetical plans.\n\nSo closely did our author cultivate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSES\">muses</a>, that before he was 18 years of age he had written two tragedies and half an epic poem; but all these were committed to the flames. The first of his poems which appeared in print was published in one of the Edinburgh magazines, and entitled, \"On passing through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">Close</a> of Edinburgh at Midnight.\" This was afterwards inserted in A Collection of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">Original</a> Poems by a Scotch gentleman, vol. ii. p. 137.\n\nFrom the time of Mr Mickle's arrival in London till the year 1765, it is not known how he employed his time, though it is probable that he was employed in some branch of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINTING\">printing</a> business; and in 1765 he engaged himself as corrector to the Clarendon press. This year he published the Poem which first brought him into notice, entitled, \"Pollio, an Elegiac Ode, written in the Wood near R\u2014\u2014 (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROSLIN\">Roslin</a>) Castle,\" 4to. This was an elegy written on the death of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>, which, previous to its publication, had been shown to Lord Lyttelton, and received some corrections from him. The latter, in an epistle to the author, spoke of it as equal to any thing of the kind in our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>. In 1767 he published a poem called \"The Concubine, in two cantos, after the manner of Spencer,\" 4to; and in 1769 he published, \"A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">Letter</a> to Mr Harwood, wherein some of his evasive glosses, false translations, and blundering criticisms, in support of the Arian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERESY\">Heresy</a>, contained in his literal translation of the New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a>, are pointed out and confuted,\" 8vo: and next year he published \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a> Queen of Scots, an Elegy;\" \"Hengist and Mary, a ballad;\" and \"Knowledge, an Ode;\" in Peach's Collection of Poems. In 1770 he published \"Voltaire in the Shades, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Dialogues on the Deistical Controversy,\" 8vo. The Elegy on Mary had been submitted to the judgment of Lord Lyttelton, who declined to criticise it, not for its deficiency in poetical merit, but from thinking differently from the author concerning that unfortunate princess.\n\nAbout this time Mr Mickle was a frequent writer in the Whitehall Evening <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POST\">Post</a>; but a more important <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> now engaged his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>. When no more than 17 years of age he had read Castara's translation of the Lusiad of Camoens into French, and then projected the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of giving an English translation of it. From this, however, he was prevented by various avocations till the year 1771, when he published the first book as a specimen: and having prepared himself by acquiring some knowledge of the Portuguese language, he determined to apply himself entirely to this work. With this view he quitted his residence at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a>, and went to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARM\">farm</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> at Forest-hill, where he pursued his design with unremitting assiduity till the year 1775, when the work was entirely finished.\n\nDuring the time that Mr Mickle was engaged in this work, he subsisted entirely by his employment as corrector of the press; and on his quitting that employment he had only the subscriptions he received for his translation to support him. Notwithstanding these difficulties, he adhered steadily to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> he laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>, and completed it in about five years.\n\nWhen his work was finished, Mr Mickle applied to a person of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>, with whom his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> had been connected, for permission to dedicate it to him. Permission was granted, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a> honoured him with a very polite letter; but after receiving a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COPY\">copy</a>, for which an extraordinary price was paid for the binding, he did not think proper to take any notice of the author. At last a gentleman of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> rank in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> world, a firm friend to the author, and who afterwards took him under his protection, waited on the patron, and heard him declare that he had not read the work, but that it had been represented not to have the merit it was at first said to possess. The applause with which the work was received, however, soon banished from the author's mind those disagreeable sensations which had been occasioned by the contemptuous neglect of his patron, as well as some severe criticisms which had been circulated concerning it. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> edition was prepared in 1778, with a plate prefixed to it, executed by the celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a> Mortimer; on whom Mr Mickle wrote an epitaph in 1779. This year also he published a pamphlet, entitled, \"A Candid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">Examination</a> of the Reasons for depriving the East <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">Company</a> of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARTER\">Charter</a>, contained in The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> and Management of the East India Company from its Commencement to the Present Time; together with some Strictures on the Self-Contradictions and Historical Errors of Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADAM\">Adam</a> Smith, in his Reasons for the Abolition of the said Company,\" 4to. About this time some of his friends thought of recommending him to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> as deserving of a pension; but this scheme was never put in execution. Dr Lowth, bishop of London, would have put him into orders, and provided for him in the church; but this was not agreeable to our author's disposition. While he was meditating a publication of all his poems, in which he would most probably have found his account, he was appointed secretary to Commodore <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JOHNSTONE\">Johnstone</a>, who had lately obtained the command of the Romney <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of war. In November 1779 he arrived at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LISBON\">Lisbon</a>, and was named by his patron <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a> for the prizes which were taken. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> and its neighbourhood he resided more than six months, being everywhere received with every mark of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLITENESS\">politeness</a> and attention;\ntention; and during this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> he composed his poem called \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALMADA\">Almada</a> Hill,\" which in 1781 was published in quarto. He collected also many particulars concerning the manners of the Portuguese, which he intended also to have published. During his stay at Lisbon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> Academy was opened; and Mr Mickle, who was present at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a> of its commencement, had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> to be admitted a member under the presidency of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DON\">Don</a> John of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRAGANZA\">Braganza</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAMEGO\">Lamego</a>. His presence being thought necessary in England to attend to the proceedings of the courts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a> respecting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONDEMNATION\">condemnation</a> of some of the prizes, he did not accompany the Commodore in his last expedition, nor did he go any more to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>. In 1782 he published \"The Prophecy of Queen Emma, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Ballad lately discovered, written by Johannes Turgotus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURHAM\">Durham</a>, in the reign of William Rufus;\" to which is added by the Editor, an Account of the Discovery, and Hints towards a Vindication of the Authenticity, of the Poems of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OSSIAN\">Ossian</a> and Rowley,\" 8vo.\n\nIn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> this year Mr Mickle married Miss Tomkins, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of the person with whom he resided at Forest-hill, while engaged in translating the Lusiad. Having received some fortune with this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a>, as well as made some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> himself when in the service of Commodore Johnstone, he now enjoyed a comfortable independence. He afterwards fixed his residence at Wheatley in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OXFORDSHIRE\">Oxfordshire</a>, and devoted his time to the revision of his poetical works, which he proposed to publish by subscription. During the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> years of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> he was employed in writing for the European <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGAZINE\">Magazine</a>. The Fragments of Leo, and some of the most approved reviews of books, in that periodical work, were of his production. He died after a short illness, on the 25th of October 1788, at Wheatley, leaving one son behind him. His poetry possesses much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>, variety, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a> of numbers, and vigour of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>: his life was without reproach; his foibles were few and inoffensive; his virtues many; and his genius very considerable.","sp":840,"ep":842},{"h":"MICROCOSM","t":"a Greek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> signifying the little world; used by some for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, as being supposed an epitome of the universe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> great world.","sp":842,"ep":842},{"h":"MICROGRAPHY","t":"the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of objects viewed with the assistance of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MICROSCOPE\">microscope</a>.

The first telescopic micrometers were only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> contrivances for measuring the image of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FOCUS\">focus</a> of the object-glass. Before these contrivances were thought of, astronomers were accustomed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> the field of view in each of their telescopes, by observing how much of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">moon</a> they could see through it, the semidiameter being reckoned at 15 or 16 minutes; and other distances were estimated by the eye, comparing them with the field of view. Mr Gascoigne, an English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>, however, fell upon a much more accurate method before the year 1641, and had a Treatise on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPTICS\">Optics</a> prepared for the press; but he was killed during the civil wars in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> I, and his manuscript was never found. Micromeeter first invented by Gascoigne.\n\nHis instrument, however, fell into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of Mr R. Townly*, who says, that by the help of it he could mark above 40,000 divisions in a foot.\n\n2. Mr Gascoigne's instrument being shown to Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a>. 25, Hooke, he gave a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of it, and proposed several improvements\u2020. Mr Gascoigne divided Trans. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">Air</a>. the image of an object in the focus of the object-glass, by the approach of two pieces of metal ground to a very fine Posthumous edge, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of which Dr Hooke would substitute Works, two fine hairs stretched <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to one another.\n\n3. Mr Huygens measured the apparent diameters of Phil. the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANETS\">planets</a>, by first determining the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of the field Trams. of view in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TELESCOPE\">telescope</a>; which, he says, is best done hyp. observing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAR\">star</a> takes up in passing over Huygen's it, and then preparing two or three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> and slender microme- <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a> plates, of various breadths, the sides of which are ter. very straight, and converging to a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a>. In using these pieces of brass, he made them slide in two slits, made in the sides of the tube, opposite to the place of the image, and observed in what place it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> covered the diameter of any planet, or any small distance that he wanted to measure\u2021. It was observed, however, by Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Newton, that the diameters of planets, measured in this manner, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be larger than they should be, as all lucid objects appear to be when they are viewed upon dark ones.\n\n4. In the Ephemerides of the Marquis of Malvasia, Marquis of published in 1662, it appears that he had a method of Malvasia's measuring small distances between fixed stars and the microme- diameters of the planets, and also of taking accurate draughts of the spots of the moon by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">net</a> of silver wire, fixed in the focus of the eye-glass. He likewise contrived to make one of two stars <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> along the threads of this net, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> it, or the telescope, as much as was necessary for that purpose; and he counted, by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PENDULUM\">pendulum</a>-clock, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEATING\">beating</a> seconds, the time that elapsed in its passage from one wire to another, which gave him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of minutes and seconds of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> contained between the intervals of the wires of his net, with respect to the focal length of his telescope.\n\n5. In 1666, Messrs Auzout and Picard published Auzout's description of a micrometer, which was nearly the same microme- with that of the Marquis of Malvasia, excepting the method of dividing it, which they performed with more exactness by a screw. In some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> they used threads of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a>, as being finer than silver wires. Dechales also recommends a micrometer consisting of fine wires, or silken threads, the distances of which were exactly known, disposed in the form of a net, as peculiarly convenient for taking a map of the moon.\n\n6. M. de la Hire says, that there is no method more De la Hire's simple or commodious for observing the digits of anter. eclipse than a net in the focus of the telescope. These, he says, were generally made of silken threads; and that for this particular purpose six concentric circles had also been made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of, drawn upon oiled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>; but he advises to draw the circles on very thin pieces of glass with the point of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIAMOND\">diamond</a>. He also gives several particular directions to assist persons in the use of them.\n\n7. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">Construction</a> of Different Micrometers. The first we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">Common</a> shall describe is the common micrometer. Let ABCD microme- be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> of the telescope at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> focus of the object-glass.\nobject-glass, or where the wires are situated, which are placed in a short tube containing the eye-glass, and may be turned into any position by turning that tube; \\( mn \\) is a fine wire extended over its centre; \\( xy \\), two parallel wires well defined, and perpendicular to \\( mn \\); \\( uv \\) is fixed, and \\( xy \\) moves parallel to it by means of a screw, which carries two indexes over a graduated plate, to show the number of revolutions and parts of a revolution which it makes. Now to measure any angle, we must first ascertain the number of revolutions and parts of a revolution corresponding to some known angle, which may be thus done: 1st, Bring the inner edges of the wires exactly to coincide, and set each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">index</a> to \\( o \\); turn the screw, and separate the wires to any distance; and observe the time a star \\( m \\) is in passing along the wire \\( mn \\) from one vertical wire to the other: for that time, turned into minutes and seconds of a degree, will be the angle answering to the number of revolutions, or the angle corresponding to the distance. Thus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> \\( d = \\cos \\) of the star's declination, we have \\( 15' dm \\), the angle corresponding to this distance; and hence, by proportion, we find the angle answering to any other.\n\n2dly, Set up an object of a known diameter, or two objects at a given distance, and turn the screw till the vertical wires become tangents to the object, or till their opening just takes in the distance of the two objects upon the wire \\( mn \\); then from the diameter, or distance of the two objects from each other, and their distance from the glass, calculate the angle, and observe the number of revolutions and parts corresponding.\n\n3dly, Take the diameter of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> on any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, by making the wires tangents to the opposite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a>, and find, from the nautical almanac, his diameter on that day. Here it will be best to take the upper and lower limbs of the sun when on the meridian, as he has then no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> perpendicular to the horizon. If the edges do not coincide when the indexes stand at \\( o \\), we must allow for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>. Instead of making a proportion, it is better to have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> calculated to show the angle corresponding to every revolution and parts of a revolution. But the observer must remember, that when the micrometer is fixed to telescopes of different focal lengths, a new table must be made. The whole system of wires is turned about in its own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a>, by turning the eyetube round with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, and by that means the wire \\( mn \\) can be thrown into any position, and consequently angles in any position may be measured. Dr Bradley added a small motion by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACK\">rack</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PINION\">pinion</a> to set the wires more accurately in any position.\n\n8. But the micrometer, as now contrived, is of use, not only to find the angular distance of bodies in the field of view at the same time, but also of those which, when the telescope is fixed, pass through the field of view successively; by which means we can find the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> ascensions and declinations. Let \\( <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AA\">Aa</a>, Bb, Cc \\), be three parallel and equidistant wires, the middle one bisecting the field of view; \\( HOR \\) a fixed wire perpendicular to them passing through the centre of the field; and \\( Ff, Gg \\), two wires parallel to it, each moveable by a micrometer screw, as before, so that they can be brought up to \\( HOR \\), or a little beyond. Then to find the angular distance of two objects, bring them very near to \\( Bb \\), and in a line parallel to it, by turning about the wires, and bring one upon \\( HOR \\), and by the micrometer screw make \\( Ff \\) or \\( Gg \\) pass through the other; then turn the screw till that wire coincides with \\( HOR \\), and the arc which the index has passed over shows their angular distance. If the objects be further remote than you can carry the distance of one of the wires \\( Ff, Gg \\) from \\( HOR \\), then bring one object to \\( Ff \\) and the other to \\( Gg \\); and turn each micrometer screw till they meet, and the sum of the arcs passed over by each index gives their angular distance. If the objects be two stars, and one of them be made to run along \\( HOR \\), or either of the moveable wires as occasion may require, the motion of the other will be parallel to these wires, and their difference of declinations may be observed with great exactness; but in taking any other distances, the motion of the stars being oblique to them, it is not quite so easy to get them parallel to \\( Bb \\); because if one star be brought near, and the eye be applied to the other to adjust the wires to it, the former star will have gotten a little away from the wire. Dr Bradley, in his account of the use of this micrometer, published by Dr Maskelyne in the Philosophical Transactions for 1772, thinks the best way is to move the eye backwards and forwards as quick as possible; but it seems to be best to fix the eye at some point between, by which means it takes in both at once sufficiently well defined to compare them with \\( Bb \\). In finding the difference of declination, if both bodies do not come into the field of view at the same time, make one run along the wire \\( HOR \\), as before, and fix the telescope and wait till the other comes in, and then adjust one of the moveable wires to it, and bring it up to \\( HOR \\), and the index gives the difference of their declinations. The difference of time between the passage of the star at either of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> moveable wires, and the transit of the other star over the cross fixed wire (which represents a meridian), turned into degrees and minutes, will give the difference of right ascension. The star has been here supposed to be bisected by the wire; but if the wire be a tangent to it, allowance must be made for the breadth of the wire, provided the adjustment be made for the coincidence of the wires. In observing the diameters of the sun, moon, or planets, it may perhaps be most convenient to make use of the outer edges of the wires, because they appear most distinct when quite within the limb; but if there should be any sensible inflection of the rays of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> in passing by the wires, it will be best avoided by using the inner edge of one wire and the outward edge of the other; for by that means the inflection at both limbs will be the same way, and therefore there will be no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> of the relative position of the rays passing by each wire. And it will be convenient in the micrometer to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> at what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> the index stands when the moveable wire coincides with \\( HOR \\); for then you need not bring the wire when a star is upon it up to \\( HOR \\), only reckon from the division at which the index then stands to the above division.\n\n9. With a micrometer thus adapted to a telescope, Mr S. Savery of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXETER\">Exeter</a> proposed a new way of measuring objects the difference between the greatest and least apparent glass diameters of the sun, although the whole of the sun was not visible in the field of view at once. The method we shall briefly describe. Place two object-glasses very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> together, and observe the difference in the appearance of the sun.\ninstead of one, so as to form two images whose limbs shall be at a small distance from each other; or instead of two perfect lenses, he proposed to cut a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LENS\">lens</a> into four parts of equal breadths by parallel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a>, and to place the two segments with their straight sides against each other, or the two middle frustums with their opposite edges together; in either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, the two parts which before had a common centre and axis, have now their centres and axes separated, and consequently two images will be formed as before by two perfect lenses. Another method in reflectors was to cut the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> concave reflector through the centre, and by a contrivance to turn up the outer edges whilst the straight ones remained fixed; by which means the axis of the two parts became inclined, and formed two images. Two images being formed in this manner, he proposed to measure the distance between the limbs when the diameters of the sun were the greatest and least, the difference of which would be the difference of the diameters required. Thus far we are indebted to Mr Savery for the idea of forming two images; and the admirable uses to which it was afterwards applied we shall next proceed to describe.\n\n10. The divided object-glass micrometer, as now made, was contrived by the late Mr John Dollond, and by him adapted to the object-end of a reflecting telescope, and has been since by the present Mr P. Dollond his son applied with equal advantage to the end of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACHROMATIC\">achromatic</a> telescope. The principle is this: The object-glass is divided into two segments in a line drawn through the centre; each segment is fixed in a separate frame of brass, which is moveable, so that the centres of the two segments may be brought together by a handle for that purpose, and thereby form one image of an object; but when separated they will form two images, lying in a line passing through the centre of each segment; and consequently the motion of each image will be parallel to that line, which can be thrown into any position by the contrivance of another handle to turn the glass about in its own plane. The brass-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> carries a vernier to measure the distance of the centres of the two segments. Now let E and H be the centres of the two segments, F their principal focus, and PQ two distant objects in FE, FH, produced, or the opposite limbs of the same object PBQD; then the images of P and Q, formed by each segment, or the images of the opposite limbs of the object PBQD,\n\n(A) If the object is not distant let \\( f \\) be the principal focus; then \\( Ff : FG : FG : FK \\) (FG being produced to meet a line joining the apparent places of the two objects P, Q), \\( \\therefore \\) dividendo, \\( fG : FG : GK : FK \\), and alternando, \\( fG : GK : FG : FK \\) :: (by similar triangles) EH : PQ, hence \\( \\frac{EH}{G} = \\frac{PQ}{GK} \\), therefore the angle subtended by EH at \\( f \\) is the angle subtended by PQ at G; and consequently, as \\( fG \\) is constant, the angle measured at G is, in this case, also <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to EH. The instrument is not adapted to measure the angular distance of bodies, one of which is near and the other at a distance, because their images would not be formed together.\n\n(b) To determine if there be any error in the adjustment of the micrometer scale, measure the diameter of any small well-defined object, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a>'s equatorial diameter, or the longest axis of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SATURN\">Saturn</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a>, both ways, that is, with o on the vernier to the right and left of o on the scale, and half the difference is the error required. This error must be added to or subtracted from all observations, according as the diameter measured with o on the vernier, when advanced on the scale, is less or greater than the diameter measured the other way. And it is also evident, that half the sum of the diameters thus measured gives the true diameter of the object.\nment seems so well adapted, Dr Maskelyne has shown, how it may be applied to find the difference of right ascensions and declinations. For this purpose, two wires at right angles to each other, bisecting the field of view, must be placed in the principal focus of the eye-glass, and moveable about in their own plane.\n\nLet HCR c be the field of view, HR and C c the two wires; turn the wires till the westernmost star, (which is the best, having further to move) run along ROH; then separate the two segments, and turn about the micrometer till the two images of the same star <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> in the wire C c; and then, partly by separating the segments, and partly by raising or depressing the telescope, bring the two innermost images of the two stars to appear and run along ROH, as a, b, and the vernier will give the difference of their declinations; because, as the two images of one of the stars coincided with C c, the image of each star was brought perpendicularly upon HR, or to HR in their proper meridian. And, for the same reason, the difference of their times of passing the wire CO c will give their difference of right ascensions. These operations will be facilitated, if the telescope be mounted on a polar axis. If two other wires KL, MN, parallel to C c, be placed near H and R, the observation may be made on two stars whose difference of meridians is nearly equal to HR the diameter of the field of view, by bringing the two images of one of the stars to coincide with one of these wires. If two stars be observed whose difference of declinations is well settled, the scale of the micrometer will be known.\n\n13. It has hitherto been supposed, that the images of the two stars can be both brought into the field of view at once upon the wire HOR: but if they cannot, set the micrometer to the difference of their declinations as nearly as you can, and make the image which comes first run along the wire HOR, by elevating or depressing the telescope; and when the other star comes in, if it do not also run along HOR, alter the micrometer till it does, and half the sum of the numbers shown by the micrometer at the two separate observations of the two stars on the wire HOR will be the difference of their declinations. That this should be true, it is manifestly necessary that the two segments should recede equally in opposite directions; and this is effected by Mr Dollond in his new improvement of the object-glass micrometer.\n\n14. The difference of right ascensions and declinations of Venus or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">Mercury</a> in the sun's disk and the sun's limb may be thus found. Turn the wires so that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> limb n of the sun's image <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">AB</a>, or the north limb of the image V of the planet, may run along the wire RH, which therefore will then be parallel to the equator, and consequently C c a secondary to it; then separate the segments, and turn about the micrometer till the two images V v of the planet pass C c at the same time, and then by separating the segments, bring the north limb of the northernmost image V of the planet to touch HR, at the time the northernmost limb n of the southernmost image AB of the sun touches it, and the micrometer shows the difference of declinations of the northernmost limbs of the planet and sun, for the reason formerly given (Art. 11.) we having brought the northernmost limbs of the two innermost images V and AB to HR, these two being manifestly interior to v and the northernmost limb N of the image PQ. In the same manner we take the difference of declinations of their southernmost limbs; and half the difference of the two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> (taking immediately one after another) is equal to the difference of the declinations of their centres, without any regard to the sun's or planet's diameters, or error of adjustment of the micrometer; for as it affects both equally, the difference is the same as if there were no error: and the difference of the times of the transits of the eastern or western limbs of the sun and planet over C c gives the difference of their right ascensions.\n\n15. Instead of the difference of right ascensions, the distance of the planet from the sun's limb, in lines parallel to the equator, may be more accurately observed thus: Separate the segments, and turn about the wires and micrometer, so as to make both images V, v, run along HR, or so that the two intersections Fig. 6. I, T of the sun's image may pass C c at the same time. Then bring the planet's and sun's limbs into contact, as at V, and do the same for the other limb of the sun, and half the difference gives the distance of the centre of the planet from the middle of the chord on the sun's disk parallel to the equator, or the difference of the right ascensions of their centres, allowing for the motion of the planet in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> of the observations, without any regard to the error of adjustment, for the same reason as before. For if you take any point in the chord of a circle, half the difference of the two segments is manifestly the distance of the point from the middle of the chord; and as the planet runs along HR, the chord is parallel to the equator.\n\nIn like manner, the distances of their limbs may be measured in lines perpendicular to the equator, by bringing the micrometer into the position already described, (Art. 13.), and instead of bringing V to HR, separate the segments till the northernmost limbs coincide as at V; and in the same manner make their southernmost images to coincide, and half the difference of the two measures, allowing for the planet's motion, gives the difference of the declinations of their centres.\n\nHence the true place of a planet in the sun's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISC\">disc</a> may at any time of its transit be found; and consequently the nearest approach to the centre and the time of ecliptic conjunction may be deduced, although the middle should not be observed.\n\n16. But however valuable the object-glass micrometer undoubtedly is, difficulties sometimes have been found in its use, owing to the alteration of the focus of the object-glass eye, which will cause it to give different measures of the same angle at different times. For instance, in measuring the sun's diameter, the axis of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a> coming through the two segments from the contrary limbs of the sun, as PF, QF, fig. 3. crossing one another in the focus F under an angle equal to the sun's semidiameter, the union of the limbs cannot appear perfect, unless the eye be disposed to see objects distinctly at the place where the images were formed; for if the eye be disposed to see objects nearer to or further off than that place, in the latter case the limbs will\nwill appear separated, and in the former they will appear to lap over (c). This imperfection led Dr Maskelyne to inquire whether some method might not be found of producing two distinct images of the sun, or any other object, by bringing the axis of each pencil to coincide, or very nearly so, before the formation of the images, by which means the limbs when brought together would not be liable to appear separated from any alteration of the eye; and this he found would be effected by the refraction of two prisms, placed either without or within the telescope; and on this principle, placing the prisms within, he constructed a new micrometer, and had one executed by Mr Dollond, which upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> answered as he expected. The construction is as follows.\n\n17. Let \\(AB\\) be the object-glass; \\(a b\\) the image, suppose of the sun, which would have been formed in the principal focus \\(Q\\); but let the prisms \\(PR, SR\\) be placed to intercept the rays, and let \\(EF, WG\\) be two rays proceeding from the eastern and western limbs of the sun, converging, after refraction at the lens, to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\); and suppose the refraction of the prisms to be such, that in fig. 8, the ray \\(EFR\\), after refraction at \\(R\\) by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRISM\">prism</a> \\(PR\\), may proceed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> \\(RQ\\); and as all the rays which were proceeding to \\(a\\) suffer the same refraction at the prism, they will all be refracted to \\(Q\\); and therefore, instead of an image \\(a b\\), which would have been formed by the lens alone, an image \\(Q c\\) is formed by those rays which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> on the prism \\(PR\\); and for the same reason, the rays falling on the prism \\(SR\\) will form an image \\(Q d\\); and in fig. 9, the image of the point \\(b\\) is brought to \\(Q\\), by the prism \\(PR\\), and consequently an image \\(Q d\\) is formed by those rays which fall on \\(PR\\); and for the same reason, an image \\(Q c\\) is formed by the rays falling on \\(SR\\).\n\nNow in both cases, as the rays \\(EFR, WGR\\), coming from the two opposite limbs of the sun, and forming the point of contact of the two limbs, proceed in the same direction \\(RQ\\), they must thus accompany each other through the eye-glass and also through the eye, whatever refractive power it has, and therefore to every eye the images must appear to touch. Now the angle \\(a R b\\) is twice the refraction of the prism, and the angle \\(a C b\\) is the diameter of the sun; and as these angles are very small, and have the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUBTENSE\">subtense</a> \\(a b\\), we have the angle \\(a R b : a C b :: CQ : RQ\\).\u2014Now as \\(CQ\\) is constant, and also the angle \\(a R b\\) being twice the refraction of the prism, the angle \\(a C b\\) varies as \\(RQ\\). Hence the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of the scale for measuring angles becomes the focal length of the object-glass, and the angle measured is in proportion to the distance of the prisms from the principal focus of the object-glass; and the micrometer can measure all angles (very small ones excepted, for the reason given in Art. 19.) which do not exceed the sum of the refractions of the prisms; for the angle \\(a C b\\), the diameter of the object to be measured, is always less than the angle \\(a R b\\), the sum of the refractions of the prisms, except when the prisms touch the object-glass, and then they become equal. The scale can never be out of adjustment, as the point \\(o\\), where the measurement begins, answers to the focus of the object-glass, which is a fixed point for all distant objects, and we have only to find the value of the scale answering to some known angle; for instance, bring the two limbs of the sun's images into contact, and measure the distance of the prisms from the focus, and look in the nautical almanac for the sun's diameter, and you get the value of the scale.\n\n18. In fig. 8, the limb \\(Q\\) of the image \\(Q c\\), is illuminated by the rays falling on the object-glass between \\(A\\) and \\(F'\\); and of the image \\(Q d\\) by those falling between \\(B\\) and \\(G\\); but in fig. 9, the same limbs are illuminated by the rays falling between \\(B\\) and \\(F\\), \\(A\\) and \\(G\\) respectively, and therefore will be more illuminated than in the other case; but the difference is not considerable in achromatic telescopes, on account of the great aperture of the object-glass compared with the distance \\(FG\\).\n\nIt might be convenient to have two sets of prisms, one for measuring angles not exceeding \\(36'\\), and therefore fit for measuring the diameters of the sun and moon, and the lucid parts and distances of the cusps in their eclipses; and another for measuring angles not much greater than \\(1'\\), for the convenience of measuring the diameters of the planets. For as \\(Q c : QR ::\\) sum of the refractions of the prisms : angle \\(a C b\\), the apparent diameter of the object, it is evident that if you diminish the third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a>, you must increase the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> in the same ratio, in order to measure the same angle; and thus by diminishing the refractive angle of the prisms, you throw them further from \\(Q\\), and consequently avoid the inconvenience of bringing them near to \\(Q\\), for the reason in the next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARAGRAPH\">paragraph</a>; and at the same time you will increase the illumination in a small degree. The prisms must be achromatic, each composed of two prisms of flint and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> glass, placed with their refracting angles in contrary directions, otherwise the images will be coloured.\n\n19. In the construction here described, the angle measured becomes evanescent when the prisms come to the principal focus of the object-glass, and therefore \\(o\\) on the scale then begins; but if the prisms be placed in the principal focus they can have no effect, because the pencil of rays at the junction of the prisms would then vanish, and therefore it is not practicable to bring the two images together to get \\(o\\) on the scale. Dr Maskelyne, therefore, thought of placing another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of prisms within, to refract the rays before they came to the other prisms, by which means the two images would be formed into one before they came to the principal focus, and therefore \\(o\\) on the scale could be determined. But to avoid the error arising from\n\n(c) For if the eye can see distinctly an image at \\(F\\), the pencils of rays, of which \\(PF, QF\\) are the two axes, diverging from \\(F\\), are each brought to a focus on the retina, at the same point; and therefore the two limbs appear to coincide; but if we increase the refractive power of the eye, then each pencil is brought to a focus, and they cross each other before the rays come to the retina, consequently the two limbs on the retina will lap over; and if we diminish the refractive power of the eye, then each pencil being brought to a focus beyond the retina, and not crossing till after they have passed it, the two limbs on the retina must be separated.\nthe multiplication of mediums, he, instead of adding another pair of prisms, divided the object-glass through its centre, and sliding the segments a little it separated the images, and then by the prisms he could form one image very distinctly, and consequently could determine on the scale; for by separating the two segments you form two images, and you will separate the two pencils so that you may move up the two prisms, and the two pencils will fall on each respectively, and the two images may be formed into one. In the instrument which Dr Maskelyne had made, on the scale was chosen to be about \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of the focal length of the object-glass, and each prism refracted 27\u00b0. By this means all angles are measured <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to \\( \\circ \\).\n\n20. In the Philosophical Transactions for 1779, Mr Ramsden has described two new micrometers, which he contrived with a view of remedying the defects of the object-glass micrometer.\n\n21. One of these is a catoptric micrometer, which, beside the advantage it derives from the principle of reflection, of not being disturbed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HETEROGENEITY\">heterogeneity</a> of light, avoids every defect of other micrometers, and can have no aberration, nor any defect arising from the imperfection of materials or of execution; as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> simplicity of its construction requires no additional <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-MIRRORS\">mirrors</a> or glasses to those required for the telescope; and the separation of the images being effected by the inclination of the two specula, and not depending on the focus of any lens or mirror, any alteration in the eye of an observer cannot affect the angle measured. It has peculiar to itself the advantages of an adjustment, to make the images coincide in a direction perpendicular to that of their motion; and also of measuring the diameter of a planet on both sides of the zero, which will appear no inconsiderable advantage to observers who know how much easier it is to ascertain the contact of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> edges of two images than their perfect coincidence.\n\n22. A represents the small speculum divided into two equal parts; one of which is fixed on the end of the arm B; the other end of the arm is fixed on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a> axis X, which crosses the end of the telescope C. The other half of the mirror A is fixed on the arm D, which arm at the other end terminates in a socket y, that turns on the axis X; both arms are prevented from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BENDING\">bending</a> by the braces \\( \\alpha \\alpha \\). G represents a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> screw, having one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> e cut into double the number of threads in an inch to that of the part g: the part e having 100 threads in one inch, and the part g 50 only. The screw e works in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NUT\">nut</a> F in the side of the telescope, while the part g turns in a nut H, which is attached to the arm B; the ends of the arms B and D, to which the mirrors are fixed, are separated from each other by the point of the double screw pressing against the stud h, fixed to the arm D, and turning in the nut H on the arm B. The two arms B and D are pressed against the direction of the double screw eg by a spiral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> within the part n, by which means all shake or play in the nut H, on which the measure depends, is entirely prevented.\n\nFrom the difference of the threads on the screw at e and g, it is evident, that the progressive motion of the screw through the nut will be half the distance of the separation of the two halves of the mirror; and consequently the half mirrors will be moved equally in contrary directions from the axis of the telescope C.\n\n23. The wheel V fixed on the end of the double screw had its circumference divided into 100 equal parts, and numbered at every fifth division with 5, 10, &c., to 100, and the index I shows the motion of the screw with the wheel round its axis, while the number of revolutions of the screw is shown by the divisions on the same index. The steel screw at R may be turned by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KEY\">key</a> S, and serves to incline the small mirror at right angles to the direction of its motion. By turning the finger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> T, the eye-tube P is brought nearer or farther from the small mirror, to adjust the telescope to distinct vision; and the telescope itself hath a motion round its axis for the convenience of measuring the diameter of a planet in any direction. The inclination of the diameter measured with the horizon is shown in degrees and minutes by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> and vernier on a graduated circle, at the breech of the telescope.\n\n24. Besides the table for reducing the revolutions and parts of the screw to minutes, seconds, &c., it will require a table for correcting a small error which arises from the eccentric motion of the half mirrors. By this motion their centre of curvature will approach a little towards the large mirror: the equation for this purpose in small angles is insensible; but when angles to be measured exceed ten minutes, it should not be neglected. Or, the angle measured may be corrected by diminishing it in the proportion the versed sine of the angle measured, supposing the eccentricity radius, bears to the focal length of the small mirror.\n\n25. Mr Ramsden preferred Cassegrain's construction of the reflecting telescope to either the Gregorian or Newtonian; because in the former, the errors of one speculum are corrected by those of the other. From a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of the reflecting telescope, not generally known, that the apertures of the two specula are to each other very nearly in the proportion of their focal lengths, it follows, that their aberrations will be in the same proportion; and these aberrations will be in the same direction, if the two specula are concave; or in contrary directions if one speculum is concave and the other convex. In the Gregorian telescope, both specula being concave, the aberration at the second image will be the sum of the aberrations of the two mirrors; but in the Cassegrainian telescope, one mirror being concave and the other convex, the aberration at the second image will be the difference between the two aberrations. By assuming such proportions for the foci of the specula as are generally used in the reflecting telescope, which is about as 1 to 4, the aberration in the Cassegrainian construction will be to that in the Gregorian as 3 to 5.\n\n26. The other is a dioptric micrometer, or one suited to the principle of refraction. This micrometer is applied to the erect eye-tube of a refracting telescope, glass micrometer, and is placed in the conjugate focus of the first eyeglass; in which position, the image being considerably magnified before it comes to the micrometer, any imperfection in its glass will be magnified only by the remaining eyeglasses, which in any telescope seldom exceeds five or six times. By this position also the size of the micrometer glass will not be the part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a> which would be required if it was placed in the object-glass; and, notwithstanding this great disproportion...\nproportion of size, which is of great moment to the practical optician, the same extent of scale is preserved, and the images are uniformly bright in every part of the field of the telescope.\n\n27. Fig. 12 represents the glasses of a refracting telescope; \\(xy\\), the principal pencil of rays from the object-glass \\(O\\); \\(tt\\) and \\(uu\\), the axis of two oblique pencils; \\(a\\), the first eye-glass; \\(m\\), its conjugate focus, or the place of the micrometer; \\(b\\) the second eye-glass; \\(c\\) the third; and \\(d\\) the fourth, or that which is nearest the eye. Let \\(p\\) be the diameter of the object-glass, \\(e\\) the diameter of a pencil at \\(m\\), and \\(f\\) the diameter of the pencil at the eye; it is evident, that the axis of the pencils from every part of the image will cross each other at the point \\(m\\); and \\(e\\), the width of the micrometer-glass, is to \\(p\\) the diameter of the object-glass, as \\(ma\\) is to \\(go\\), which is the proportion of the magnifying power at the point \\(m\\); and the error caused by an imperfection in the micrometer-glass placed at \\(m\\) will be to the error, had the micrometer been at \\(O\\), as \\(m\\) is to \\(p\\).\n\n28. Fig. 13 represents the micrometer; \\(A\\), a convex or concave lens bisected by a plane across its centre; one of these semi-lenses is fixed in a frame \\(B\\), and the other in the frame \\(E\\); which two frames slide on a plate \\(H\\), and are pressed against it by thin plates \\(aa\\); the frames \\(B\\) and \\(E\\) are moved in contrary directions by turning the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUTTON\">button</a> \\(D\\); \\(L\\) is a scale of equal parts on the frame \\(B\\); it is numbered from each end towards the middle with 10, 20, &c. There are two verniers on the frame \\(E\\), one at \\(M\\) and the other at \\(N\\), for the convenience of measuring the diameter of a planet, &c. on both sides the zero. The first division on both these verniers coincides at the same time with the two zeros on the scale, \\(L\\); and, if the frame is moved towards the right, the relative motion of the two frames is shown on the scale \\(L\\) by the vernier \\(M\\); but if the frame \\(B\\) be moved towards the left, the relative motion is shown by the vernier \\(N\\).\u2014This micrometer has a motion round the axis of vision, for the convenience of measuring the diameter of a planet, &c. in any direction, by turning an endless screw \\(F\\); and the inclination of the diameter measured with the horizon is shown on the circle \\(g\\) by a vernier on the plate \\(V\\). The telescope may be adjusted to distinct vision by a screw, which moves the whole eye-tube with the micrometer nearer to or farther from the object-glass, as telescopes are generally made; or the same effect may be produced without moving the micrometer, by sliding the part of the eye tube \\(m\\) on the part \\(n\\), by help of a screw or pinion.\n\n29. Notwithstanding these improvements on micrometers, they are still liable to many sources of error. The imperfections of the wire micrometer, (which was still the most correct instrument for measuring small angles) when employed to determine the distance of close double stars, have been ably pointed out by Dr Herschel.\n\n30. When two stars are taken between the parallel wires the diameters must be included. Dr Herschel* has in vain attempted to find lines sufficiently thin to extend them across the centres of the stars so that their thickness might be neglected. The threads of the silk-worm, with such lenses as he uses, are so much magnified that their diameter is more than that of many of the stars. Besides, if they were much smaller, the deflection of light would make the attempt to measure the distance of the centres this way fruitless; for he has always found the light of the stars to play upon those lines and separate their apparent diameters into two parts. Now since the spurious diameters of the stars thus included are continually changing with the state of the air, and the length of time we look at them, we are, in some respect, left at an uncertainty; and our measures taken at different times, and with different degrees of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, will vary on that account. Nor can we come at the true distance of the centres of any two stars, unless we know the semidiameters of the stars themselves; for different stars have different apparent diameters, which, with a power of 227, may differ from each other as far as two seconds (D).\n\n31. The next imperfection arises from a deflection of light upon the wires when they approach very near to each other; for if this be owing to a power of repulsion lodged at the surface, it is easy to see that such powers must interfere with each other, and give the measures larger in proportion than they would have been if the repulsive power of one wire had not been opposed by a contrary power of the other wire.\n\n32. Another disadvantage of these micrometers is an uncertainty of the real zero. The least alteration in the situation and quantity of light will affect the zero; and a change in the position of the wires will sometimes produce a difference. To remove this difficulty Dr Herschel always found his zero while the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> preserved the situation which it had when his observations were made; but this introduces an additional observation.\n\n33. The next imperfection, is that every micrometer hitherto used requires either a screw, or a divided <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> and pinion, to measure the distance of the wires or the two images. Those acquainted with works of this kind are sensible how difficult it is to have screws perfectly equal in every thread or revolution of each thread; or pinions and bars that shall be so evenly divided as to be depended upon in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a> and tooth to the two or three thousandth part of an inch: and yet, on account of the small scale of those micrometers, these quantities are of the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>; an error of a single thousandth part inducing in most instruments a mistake of several seconds.\n\n34. The greatest imperfection of all is, that the wires require to be illuminated; and when Dr Herschel had double stars to measure, one of which was very obscure, he was obliged to be content with less light than is necessary to make the wires distinct; and several stars on this account could not be measured at all, though not too close for the micrometer.\n\nDr Herschel, therefore, was led to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> his attention to the improvement of these instruments; and the result of his endeavours has been a very ingenious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-LAMP\">lamp</a>-micrometer, which is not only free from the imperfections above specified, but also possesses the advantages of a large scale.\n\n35. It is represented in fig. 14, where \\(ABGCFE\\) is a Dr Herschel's lamp-micrometer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>, upon which a semicircular board is movable upwards or downwards, and is held in its situation by a peg \\(p\\) put into any one of the holes.\n\n(b) These imperfections are remedied in the instrument described in p. 801.\nof the upright piece AB. This board is a segment of a circle of fourteen inches radius, and is about three inches broader than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEMICIRCLE\">semicircle</a>, to give room for the handles r D, e P, to work. The use of this board is to carry an arm L, thirty inches long, which is made to move upon a pivot at the centre of the circle, by means of a string, which passes in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROOVE\">groove</a> upon the edge of the semicircle p g o h q; the string is fastened to a hook at o (not expressed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, being at the back of the arm L), and passing along the groove from o h q is turned over a pulley at q, and goes down to a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARREL\">barrel</a> c, within the plane of the circular board, where a double-jointed handle e P commands its motion. By this contrivance, we see, the arm L may be lifted up to any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ALTITUDE\">altitude</a> from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> position to the perpendicular, or be suffered to descend by its own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> below the horizontal to the reverse perpendicular situation. The weight of the handle P is sufficient to keep the arm in any given position; but if the motion should be too easy, a friction spring applied to the barrel will moderate it at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>.\n\n36. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> of the arm L a small slider, about three inches long, is moveable in a rabbet from the end L towards the centre backwards and forwards. A string is fastened to the left side of the little slider, and goes towards L, where it passes round a pulley at m, and returns under the arm from m, n, towards the centre, where it is led in a groove on the edge of the arm, which is of a circular form, upwards to a barrel (raised above the plane of the circular board) at r, to which the handle r D is fastened. A second string is fastened to the slider, at the right side, and goes towards the centre, where it passes over a pulley n; and the weight w, which is suspended by the end of this string, returns the slider towards the centre, when a contrary turn of the handle permits it to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a>.\n\n37. By a and b are represented two small lamps, two inches high, 1\u00bd in breadth by 1\u00bd in depth. The sides, back, and top, are made so as to permit no light to be seen, and the front consists of a thin brass sliding door. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> in the lamp a is placed three-tenths of an inch from the left side, three-tenths from the front, and half an inch from the bottom. In the lamp b it is placed at the same height and distance, measuring from the right side. The wick of the flame consists only of a single very thin lamp cotton-thread; for the smallest flame being sufficient, it is easier to keep it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> in so confined a place. In the top of each lamp must be a little slit lengthways, and a small opening in one side near the upper part, to permit the air to circulate to feed the flame. To prevent every reflection of light, the side opening of the lamp a should be to the right, and that of the lamp b to the left. In the sliding door of each lamp is made a small hole with the point of a very fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NEEDLE\">needle</a> just opposite the place where the wicks are burning, so that when the sliders are shut down, and everything dark, nothing shall be seen but two fine lucid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of the size of two stars of the third or fourth magnitude. The lamp a is placed so that its lucid point may be in the centre of the circular board where it is fixed. The lamp b is hung to the little slider which moves in the rabbet of the arm, so that its lucid point, in an horizontal position of the arm, may be on a level with the lucid point in the centre. The moveable lamp is suspended upon a piece of brass fastened to the slider by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PIN\">pin</a> exactly behind the flame, upon which it moves as a pivot. The lamp is balanced at the bottom by a leaden weight, so as to remain upright, when the arm is either lifted above or depressed below the horizontal position. The double-jointed handles r D, e P, consist of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> rods, 10 feet long, and the lowest of them may have divisions, marked upon it near the end P, expressing exactly the distance from the central lucid point in feet, inches, and tenths.\n\n38. Hence we see, that a person at a distance of 10 feet may govern the two lucid points, so as to bring them into any required position south or north preceding or following from 0 to 90\u00b0 by using the handle P, and also to any distance from six-tenths of an inch to five or six and twenty inches by means of the handle D. If any reflection or appearance of light should be left from the top or sides of the lamps, a temporary screen, consisting of a long piece of pasteboard, or a wire frame covered with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> cloth, of the length of the whole arm, and of any required breadth, with a slit of half an inch <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> in the middle, may be affixed to the arm by four bent wires projecting an inch or two before the lamps, situated so that the moveable lucid point may pass along the opening left for that purpose.\n\nFig. 15 represents part of the arm L, half the real size; S the slider; m the pulley, over which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CORD\">cord</a> x t y z is returned towards the centre; v the other cord going to the pulley n of fig. 14; R the brass piece moveable upon the pin c, to keep the lamp upright. At R is a wire rivetted to the brass piece, upon which is held the lamp by a nut and screw. Fig. 16. 17. represent the lamps a, b, with the sliding doors open, to show the situation of the wick. W is the leaden weight with a hole d in it, through which the wire R of fig. 15, is to be passed when the lamp is to be fastened to the slider S. Fig. 18. represents the lamp a, with the sliding door shut; l the lucid point; r & the openings at the top, and s at the sides, for the admission of air.\n\n39. The motions of this micrometer are capable of great improvement by the application of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHEELS\">wheels</a> and pinions, and other mechanical resources; but as the principal object is only to be able to adjust the two lucid points to the required position and distance, and to keep them there for a few minutes, while the observer measures their distance, it will be unnecessary to say more upon the subject.\n\n40. It is well known that we can with one eye look into a telescope, and see an object much magnified, while the other eye may see a scale upon which the magnified <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> is thrown. In this manner Dr Herschel generally determined the power of his telescopes; and any one who has been accustomed to make such observations will seldom mistake so much as one in fifty in determining the power of an instrument, and that degree of exactness is fully sufficient for the purpose.\n\n41. When Dr Herschel uses this instrument he puts it at ten feet distance from the left eye, in a line perpendicular to the tube of his Newtonian telescope, and raises the moveable board to such a height that the lucid point of the central lamp may be upon a level with the eye. The handles, lifted up, are passed through two loops fastened to the tube, just by the observer, so as to be ready for his use. The end of tube is cut away,\nso as to leave the left eye entirely free to see the whole micrometer.\n\n42. The telescope being directed to a double star, it is viewed with the right eye, and at the same time with the left it is seen projected upon the micrometer; then, by the handle P, the arm is raised or depressed so as to bring the two lucid points to a similar situation with the two stars; and, by the handle D, the moveable lucid point is brought to the same distance of the two stars, so that the two lucid points may be exactly covered by the stars.\n\n43. With a rule, divided into inches and fourtieth parts, the distance of the lucid points is thus determined with the greatest accuracy; and the measure thus obtained is the tangent of the magnified angle under which the stars are seen to a radius of ten feet; therefore, the angle being found and divided by the power of the telescope, the real angular distance of the centres of a double star is ascertained. On September 25, 1781, Dr Herschel measured a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERCULES\">Hercules</a> with this instrument. Having caused the two lucid points to coincide with the stars, he found the radius or distance of the central lamp from the eye 10 feet 4.15 inches; the tangent or distance of the two lucid points 30.6 fourtieth parts of an inch; this gives the magnified angle 3.5\u00b0, and dividing by the power 460, we obtain 4\u00b0 34' for the distance of the centres of the two stars. The scale of the micrometer at this convenient distance, with the power of 460, is above a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of an inch to a second; and by putting on a power of 932, we obtain a scale of more than half an inch to a second, without increasing the distance of the micrometer; whereas the most perfect micrometers, with the same instrument, had a scale of less than the two thousandth part of an inch to a second.\n\n44. Mr Brewster has lately directed his attention to the improvement of micrometers, and has invented one in particular which appears to be highly deserving of notice in this place. In this instrument a pair of fixed wires is made to subtend different angles by varying the magnifying power of the telescope, by sliding one tube within another; whereas in all other micrometers with wires this effect is produced by mechanical contrivances. Mr Brewster's method of shutting and opening the wires optically is therefore free from all those sources of error to which other micrometers are subject, and renders it particularly useful to the practical astronomer; while the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of changing the magnifying power by the motion of a second object-glass affords a length of scale equal to the local distance of the principal object-glass. The same principle is peculiarly applicable to the Gregorian telescope; for the magnifying power of this instrument can be changed by merely increasing or diminishing the distance of the eye-piece from the large speculum.\n\n45. In the common micrometer, which can manifestly, as well as Mr Cavallo's and Mr Brewster's, be used in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MENSURATION\">mensuration</a> of distances, the focal length of the telescope to which it is attached remains always the same; so that a correction computed from an optical theorem must be applied to every angle that is measured: but in Mr Brewster's telescope and micrometer, the focal length varies in the same proportion as the distance of the object; and consequently no correction of the angles can be necessary. To obviate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of having a stand for the instrument, which would prevent its usefulness at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, Mr Brewster divides the second or moveable object-glass into two, as in the divided object-glass micrometer. By this contrivance two images are formed, and these images are separated or made to form different angles at the eye, by bringing the moveable object-glass nearer to the fixed one. In determining the angle, therefore, we have only to bring the two images of the object into contact; and such contact the eye is capable of ascertaining even during the agitation of a carriage, as the two images retain the same relative position whatever be their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> motion.\n\nThis ingenious instrument, being formed with sliding tubes, is very portable and convenient; and will be found extremely useful to medical gentlemen, and others who may wish to ascertain distances without a more cumbersome apparatus. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIL\">Hail</a>'s Nat. Phil. by Gregory, vol. ii. p. 427.\n\n46. Mr Brewster, we understand, still continues to direct his attention to the subject of micrometers, keeping in view the improvement of these instruments, not only in greater accuracy of construction, but also in their more extensive application to various practical purposes. An account of those uses and improvements is to form the subject of an appropriate publication; and, if we are rightly informed, the author deems them of sufficient importance to secure to himself, by patent, the exclusive right to the advantages which he thinks will arise from using them.\n\n47. A very simple micrometer for measuring small Cavalle's gies with the telescope has been invented by Mr Cavallo*. It consists of a thin and narrow slip of mother-of-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEARL\">pearl</a> micely divided, and situated in the focus of the eye-glass of a telescope, just where the image of the object is formed. It is immaterial whether the telescope be a refractor or a reflector, provided the eye-glass be a convex lens.\n\nThe simplest way of fixing it is to stick it upon the diaphragm, which generally stands within the tube, in the focus of the eye-glass. When thus fixed, the divisions of the micrometrical scale will appear very distinct, unless the diaphragm is not exactly in the focus; in which case, the scale must be placed accurately in the focus of the eye-glass, either by moving the diaphragm, or by interposing any thin substance, such as paper or card between it and the scale. This construction is fully sufficient, when the telescope is always to be used by the same person; but when different persons are to use it, then the diaphragm which supports the micrometer must be constructed so as to be easily moved backwards or forwards, though that motion need not be greater than about \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) or \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of an inch.\n\nThe scale of the micrometer is represented in fig. 19. Fig. 19 which is about four times greater than one which Mr Cavallo has adapted to a three-feet achromatic telescope that magnifies about 84 times. It is something less than the 24th part of an inch broad; its thickness is equal to that of common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> paper; and the length of it is determined by the breadth of the field of view. The divisions are 200ths of an inch, and the lines which form them reach from one edge of the scale to about the middle of it, excepting every fifth and tenth division, which are longer. Two divisions of the scale in the telescope already mentioned are very nearly equal to one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a>; and as a quarter of one of those divisions may be easily distinguished by the eye, an angle of one-eighth part of a minute, or of \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\), may be measured with it.\nIn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> through a telescope furnished with such a micrometer, the field of view appears divided by the micrometer scale, the breadth of which occupies about 4th of the aperture; and as the scale is semitransparent, that part of the object which is behind it may be discerned sufficiently well to ascertain the division, with which its borders coincide. Fig. 20 shows the appearance of the field of the telescope with the micrometer, when directed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> page of the Philosophical Transactions, in which it appears that the thickness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> C is equal to three-fourths of a division, the diameter of the O is equal to three divisions, and so on.\n\n48. After having adapted this micrometer to the telescope, we must then ascertain the value of the divisions. It is hardly necessary to mention in this place, that though those divisions measure the chords of the angles, and not the angles or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a> themselves, and the chords are not as the arches, yet in small angles the chords, arches, sines, and tangents, follow the same proportion so very nearly, that the difference may be safely neglected: so that if one division of this micrometer is equal to one minute, we may conclude that two divisions are equal to two minutes, three divisions to three minutes, and so on. In order to ascertain the value of the divisions of this micrometer, the following simple and accurate method may be adopted,\n\nMark upon a wall the length of six inches, by making two dots or lines six inches asunder, or by fixing a six-inch ruler upon a stand; then place the telescope before it so that the ruler or six-inch length may be at right angles with the direction of the telescope, and just 57 feet 3\u00bd inches distant from the object-glass of the telescope; done, look through the telescope at the ruler or other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of six inches, and observe how many divisions of the micrometer are equal to it, and that same number of divisions is equal to half a degree, or 30', as it may be shown by plane <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIGONOMETRY\">trigonometry</a>.\n\n49. When this value has been once ascertained, any other angle measured by any other number of divisions is determined by simple proportion. Thus, if the diameter of the sun seen through the same telescope, be equal to 12 divisions, say as 11\u00bd divisions are to 30 minutes, so are 12 divisions to \\(\\frac{12' \\times 30'}{11.5}\\) = 31'3, which is the required diameter of the sun.\n\nNotwithstanding the facility of this calculation, a scale may be made answering to the divisions of a micrometer, which will show the angle corresponding to any number of divisions by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> inspection. Thus, for the above-mentioned small telescope, the scale is represented in fig. 21. AB is a line drawn at pleasure; it is then divided into 23 equal parts, and those divisions which represent the divisions of the micrometer that are equal to one degree, are marked on one side of it. The line is then divided again into 60 equal parts, which are marked on the other side of it; and these divisions represent the minutes which correspond to the divisions of the micrometer: thus the figure shows, that six divisions of the micrometer are equal to 15\u00bd minutes, 11\u00bd divisions are nearly equal to 29 minutes, &c. What has been said of minutes may be said of seconds also, when the scale is to be applied to a large telescope.\n\n50. We shall therefore add some practical rules to render this micrometer useful to persons unacquainted with trigonometry and the use of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOGARITHMS\">logarithms</a>.\n\n**<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROBLEM\">Problem</a> I.** The angle, not exceeding one degree, which is subtended by an extension of one foot perpendicular to the axis of the telescope being given, to find its distance from the object-glass of the telescope.\n\nRule 1. If the angle be expressed in minutes, say, as the given angle is to 60, so is 687.55 to a fourth proportional, which gives the answer in inches.\u20142. If the angle be expressed in seconds, say, as the given angle is to 3600, so is 687.55 to a fourth proportional, which expresses the answer in inches.\n\nExample. At what distance is a globe of one foot diameter when it subtends an angle of two seconds?\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2''}{3600''} :: \\frac{687.55}{x} = \\frac{3600 \\times 687.55}{2} = 1237590\n\\]\n\ninches, or 1031325 feet, which is the answer required.\n\n**Problem II.** The angle, not exceeding one degree, which is subtended by any known extension, being given, to find its distance from the object-glass of the telescope.\n\nRule. Proceed as if the extension were of one foot by Problem I. and call the answer B; then, if the extension in question be expressed in inches, say, as 12 inches are to that extension, so is B to a fourth proportional, which is the answer in inches; but if the extension in question be expressed in feet, then you need only multiply it by B, and the product is the answer in inches.\n\nExample. At what distance is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> six feet high, when he appears to subtend an angle of 30\"?\"\n\nBy Problem I., if the man were one foot high, the distance would be 82506 inches; but as he is six feet high, therefore multiply 82506 by 6, and the product gives the required distance, which is 495306 inches, or 41253 feet.\n\nFor greater convenience, especially in travelling, or in such circumstances in which one has not the opportunity of making even the easy calculations required in those problems, the following two tables have been computed; the first of which shows the distance answering to any angle from one minute to one degree, which is subtended by a man, the height of which has been called an extension of six feet; because, at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a>, such is the height of a man when dressed with a hat and shoes on.\n\nThus, if it is required to measure the extension of a street, let a foot ruler be placed at the end of the street; measure the angle it subtends, which suppose to be 36\", and in the table you will have the required distance opposite 36\", which is 95\u00bd feet. Thus also a man who appears to be 49' high, is at the distance of 421 feet.\n\n### Angles subtended by an extension of one Foot at different Distances\n\n| Angles | Distances in Feet | Angles | Distances in Feet |\n|--------|------------------|--------|------------------|\n| Min.   | 3437.7           | Min.   | 312.5            |\n| 1      | 1718.9           | 12     | 286.5            |\n| 2      | 1145.9           | 13     | 264.4            |\n| 3      | 859.4            | 14     | 245.5            |\n| 4      | 687.5            | 15     | 229.2            |\n| 5      | 572.9            | 16     | 214.8            |\n| 6      | 491.1            | 17     | 202.2            |\n| 7      | 429.7            | 18     | 191.0            |\n| 8      | 382.0            | 19     | 180.0            |\n| 9      | 343.7            | 20     | 171.8            |\n\nVol. XIII.

The following is the account of a micrometer invented by Mr Brewster, of the circumstances which led to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>, and of its advantages. We shall give Micrometer in his own words.\n\n\"In the winter of 1825 (he observes), when I was employed in delineating the surface of the moon, Mr Brewster's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MICROSCOPE\">microscope</a> wished to measure the diameter of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LUNAR\">lunar</a> spots by jar mother applying Mr Cavallo's micrometer to a thirty-inch-of-pearl-microchromatic telescope made by Berge. But as the eye-piece was moved by a rack and pinion, and consequently could not turn round its axis, the micrometer must have remained <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a>, and could only measure angles in one direction. This difficulty, indeed, might have been surmounted by a mechanical contrivance for turning the diaphragm about its centre, or more simply by giving a motion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROTATION\">rotation</a> to the tube which contains the third and fourth eye-glasses. Such a change in the eye-piece, however, was both inconvenient and difficult to be made. Mr Cavallo's micrometer, therefore, has this great disadvantage, that it cannot be used in reflecting telescopes, or in any achromatic telescope where the adjustment of the eye-piece is effected by rackwork, unless the structure of these instruments is altered for the purpose. Another disadvantage of this micrometer arises from the slip of mother-of-pearl passing through the centre of the field. The picture in the focus of the eye-glass is broken into two parts, and the view is rendered still more unpleasant by the inequality of the segments into which the field is divided. In addition to these disadvantages, the different divisions of the micrometer are at unequal distances from the eye-glass which views them, and therefore can neither appear equally distinct nor subtend equal angles at the eye.\n\n\"Finding that Mr Cavallo's instrument laboured under these imperfections, I thought of a circular mother-of-pearl micrometer which is free from them all, and has likewise the advantage of a kind of diagonal scale, increasing in accuracy with the angle to be measured. This micrometer, which I got executed by Miller and Adie, optical instrument-makers in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, and which I have often used, both in determining small angles in the heavens and such as are subtended by terrestrial objects, is represented in fig. 27, which exhibits its appearances in the focus of the fourth eye-glass. The black ring, which forms part of the figure, is the diaphragm, and the remaining part is a ring of mother-of-pearl, having its interior circumference divided into 360 equal parts. The mother-of-pearl ring, which appears connected with the diaphragm, is completely separate from it, and is fixed at the end of a brass tube which is made to move between the third eye-glass and the diaphragm, so that the divided circumference may be placed exactly in the focus of the glass next the eye. When the micrometer is thus fitted into the telescope, the angle subtended by the whole field of view, or by the diameter of the innermost circle of the micrometer, must be determined either by measuring a base or by the passage of an equatorial star, and the angles subtended by any number of divisions or degrees will be found by a table constructed in the following manner.\n\n52a. \"Let AmpB, fig. 28, be the interior circumference of the micrometer scale, and let m n be the object to be measured. Bisect the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> m n in p, and draw C m, C p, C n. The line C p will be at right angles to m n, and therefore m n will be twice the sine of half the arch m n. Consequently, AB : m n = rad. sine of\nMicrometer; therefore \\( mn \\times R = \\sin \\frac{1}{2} mpn \\times AB \\), and\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sin \\frac{1}{2} mpn \\times AB}{R} = \\frac{\\sin \\frac{1}{2} mpn}{R} \\times AB;\n\\]\n\na formula by which the angle subtended by the chord of any number of degrees may be easily found. The first part of the formula, viz. \\( \\frac{\\sin \\frac{1}{2} mpn}{R} \\) is constant, while \\( AB \\)\n\nvaries with the size of the micrometer and with the magnifying power which is applied. We have therefore computed the following table, containing the value of the constant part of the formula for every degree or division of the scale.\n\n| Deg. | Constant Part of the Formula | Deg. |

Thus if \\( AB \\) is 30 minutes, as it happens to be in the micrometer which I have constructed, the angle subtended by 1 degree of the scale will be \\( 30' \\times 0.009 = 16.2 \\) seconds, and the angle subtended by 40 degrees will be \\( 30' \\times 0.342 = 10' 15.6'' \\); and by making the calculation it will be found that as the angle to be measured increases, the accuracy of the scale also increases; for when the arch is only 1 or 2 degrees, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> of 1 degree produces a variation of about 16 seconds in the angle; whereas when the arch is between 170 and 180, the variation of a degree does not produce a change much more than one second in the angle. This is a most important advantage in the circular scale, as in Cavallo's micrometer a limit is necessarily put to the size of the divisions.\n\n\"It is obvious, from an inspection of fig. 27, that there is no occasion for turning the circular micrometer round its axis, because the divided circumference lies in every possible direction. In fig. 2, for example, if the object has the direction \\( ab \\) it will be measured by the arch \\( ab \\), and if it lies in the line \\( cd \\) it will be measured by the arch \\( cd \\).\n\n\"In the circular micrometer which I have been in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of using, \\( AB \\), or the diameter of the field of view, is exactly half an inch, the diameter of the brass tube in which it is fixed is one inch, the length of the tube half an inch, and the degrees of the divided circumference \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) of an inch.\n\n54. II. The micrometer has not only been applied to Application telescopes, and employed for astronomical purposes; but of the microscope there have also been various contrivances for adapting it to MICROSCOPICAL observations. Mr Leeuwenhoek's method of estimating the size of small objects was by comparing them with grains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>, of which 100 in a line took up an inch. These grains he laid upon the same plate with his objects, and viewed them at the same time. Dr Jurin's method was similar to this; for he found the diameter of a piece of fine silver wire, by wrapping it as close as he could about a pin, and observing how many rings made an inch; and he used this wire in the same manner as Leeuwenhoek employed his sand. Dr Hooke looked upon the magnified object with one eye, while at the same time he viewed other objects placed at the same distance with the other eye. In this manner he was able, by the help of a ruler, divided into inches and small parts, and laid on the pedestal of the microscope, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> as it were the magnified appearance of the object upon the ruler, and thus exactly to measure the diameter which it appeared to have through the glass; which being compared with the diameter as it appeared to the naked eye, showed the degree in which it was magnified.\n\n55. Mr Martin* recommended such a micrometer for a microscope as had been applied to telescopes: for he advises to draw a number of parallel lines on a piece of glass, with the fine point of a diamond, at the distance of one-fortieth of an inch from one another, and to place it in the focus of the eye-glass. By this method, Dr Smith contrived to take the exact draught of objects viewed by a double microscope; for he advises\nto get a lattice made with small silver wires or squares drawn upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> glass by the stroke of a diamond, and to put it into the place of the image, formed by the object-glass; then by transferring the parts of the object, seen in the squares of the glass or lattice upon similar corresponding squares drawn on paper, the picture may be exactly taken. Mr Martin also introduced into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> microscopes another micrometer, consisting of a screw.\n\n56. The mode of actual admeasurement (Mr Adams observes) is without doubt the most simple that can be used; as by it we comprehend, in a manner, at one glance, the different effects of combined glasses; and as it saves the trouble, and avoids the obscurity of the usual modes of calculation: but many persons find it exceedingly difficult to adopt this method, because they have not been accustomed to observe with both eyes at once. To obviate this inconvenience, the late Mr Adams contrived an instrument called the Needle-Micrometer, which was first described in his Micrographia Illustrata; and of which, as now constructed, we have the following description by his son Mr George Adams in the ingenious Essays above quoted.\n\nThis micrometer consists of a screw, which has 50 threads to an inch; this screw carries an index, which points to the divisions on a circular plate, which is fixed at right angles to the axis of the screw. The revolutions of the screw are counted on a scale, which is an inch divided into 50 parts; the index to these divisions is a flower-de-luce marked upon the slider, which carries the needle point across the field of the microscope. Every revolution of the micrometer screw measures \\( \\frac{1}{50} \\) part of an inch, which is again subdivided by means of the divisions on the circular plate, as this is divided into 20 equal parts, over which the index passes at every revolution of the screw; by which means we obtain with ease the measure of \\( \\frac{1}{1000} \\) part of an inch; for 50, the number of threads on the screw in one inch, being multiplied by 20, the divisions on the circular plate are equal to 1000; so that each division on the circular plate shows that the needle has either advanced or receded \\( \\frac{1}{1000} \\) part of an inch.\n\n57. To place this micrometer on the body of the microscope, open the circular part FKH, fig. 25, by taking out the screw G, throw back the semicircle FK, which moves upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> at K; then turn the sliding tube of the body of the microscope, so that the small holes which are in both tubes may exactly coincide, and let the needle g of the micrometer have a free passage through them; after this, screw it fast upon the body by the screw G. The needle will now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRAVERSE\">traverse</a> the field of the microscope, and measure the length and breadth of the image of any object that is applied to it. But further assistance must be had, in order to measure the object itself, which is a subject of real importance; for though we have ascertained the power of the microscope, and know that it is so many thousand times, yet this will be of little assistance towards ascertaining an accurate idea of its real size; for our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of bulk being formed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of one object with another, we can only judge of that of any particular body, by comparing it with another whose size is known: the same thing is necessary, in order to form an estimate by the microscope; therefore, to ascertain the real measure of the object, we must make the point Micrometer of the needle pass over the image of a known part of an inch placed on the stage, and write down the revolutions made by the screw, while the needle passed over the image of this known measure; by which means we ascertain the number of revolutions on the screw, which are adequate to a real and known measure on the stage. As it requires an attentive eye to watch the motion of the needle point as it passes over the image of a known part of an inch on the stage, we ought not to trust to one single measurement of the image, but ought to repeat it at least six times; then add the six measures thus obtained together, and divide their sum by six, or the number of trials; the quotient will be the mean of all the trials. This result is to be placed in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> of a table next to that which contains the number of the magnifiers.\n\n58. By the assistance of the sectoral scale, we obtain with ease a small part of an inch. This scale is shown at fig. 22, 23, 24, in which the two lines ca, cb, Fig. 22, 23, the side ab, form an isosceles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a>; each of the sides is two inches long, and the base still only of one-tenth of an inch. The longer sides may be of any given length, and the base still only one-tenth of an inch. The longer lines may be considered as the line of lines upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTOR\">sector</a> opened to one-tenth of an inch. Hence whatever number of equal parts ca, cb are divided into, their transverse measure will be such a part of one-tenth as is expressed by their division. Thus if it be divided into ten equal parts, this will divide the inch into 100 equal parts; the first division next c will be equal to \\( \\frac{1}{100} \\) part of an inch, because it is the tenth part of one-tenth of an inch. If these lines are divided into twenty equal parts, the inch will be by that means divided into 200 equal parts. Lastly, if ab, ca, are made three inches long, and divided into 100 equal parts, we obtain with ease the \\( \\frac{1}{1000} \\) part. The scale is represented as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> at fig. 23, but as perforated at fig. 22, and 24, so that the light passes through the aperture, when the sectoral part is placed on the stage.\n\n59. To use this scale, first fix the micrometer, fig. 25, to the body of the microscope; then fit the sectoral scale, fig. 24, in the stage, and adjust the microscope to its proper focus or distance from the scale, which is to be moved till the base appears in the middle of the field of view; then bring the needle point g, fig. 25, (by turning the screw L) to touch one of the lines ca, exactly at the point answering to 20 on the sectoral scale. The index a of the micrometer is to be set to the first division, and that on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIAL\">dial</a> plate to 20, which is both the beginning and end of its divisions; we are then prepared to find the magnifying power of every magnifier in the compound microscope which we are using.\n\n60. Example. Everything being prepared agreeable to the foregoing directions, suppose you are desirous of ascertaining the magnifying power of the lens marked No. 4, turn the micrometer screw until the point of the needle has passed over the magnified image of the tenth part of one inch; then the division, where the two indices remain, will show how many revolutions, and parts of a revolution, the screw has made, while the needle point traversed the magnified image of the one-tenth of an inch; suppose the result to be 26 revolutions.\nMicrometer\n\nMicrometers of the screw, and 14 parts of another revolution; this is equal to 26 multiplied by 20, added to 14; that is, 534,000 parts of an inch. The 26 divisions found on the straight scale of the micrometer, while the point of the needle passed over the magnified image of one-tenth part of an inch, were multiplied by 20, because the circular plate CD, fig. 25, is divided into 20 equal parts; this produced 520; then adding the 14 parts of the next revolution, we obtain the 534,000 parts of an inch, or five-tenths and 3400 parts of another tenth, which is the measure of the magnified image of one-tenth of an inch, at the aperture of the eye-glasses or at their foci. Now if we suppose the focus of the two eye-glasses to be one inch, the double thereof is two inches; or if we reckon on the 1000th part of an inch, we have 2000 parts for the distance of the eye from the needle point of the micrometer. Again, if we take the distance of the image from the object at the stage at 6 inches, or 6000; and add thereto 2000, double the distance of the focus of the eye-glass, we shall have 8000 parts of an inch for the distance of the eye from the object; and as the glasses double the image, we must double the number 534 found upon the micrometer, which then makes 1068; then, by the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a>, we shall obtain the number of times the microscope magnifies the diameter of the object; say, as 240, the distance of the eye from the image of the object, is to 800, the distance of the eye from the object; so is 1068, double the measure found on the micrometer, to 3568, or the number of times the microscope magnifies the diameter of the object. By working in this manner, the magnifying power of each lens used with the compound microscope may be easily found, though the result will be different in different compound microscopes, varying according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of the lenses, their distance from the object and one another, &c.\n\n61. Having discovered the magnifying power of the microscope, with the different object-lenses that are used therewith, our next subject is to find out the real size of the objects themselves, and their different parts: this is easily effected, by finding how many revolutions of the micrometer screw answer to a known measure on the sectoral scale or other object placed on the stage; from the number thus found, a table should be constructed, expressing the value of the different revolutions of the micrometer with that object lens, by which the primary number was obtained. Similar tables must be constructed for each object lens. By a set of tables of this kind, the observer may readily find the measure of any object he is examining; for he has only to make the needle point traverse over this object, and observe the number of revolutions the screw has made in its passage, and then look into his table for the real measure which corresponds to this number of revolutions, which is the measure required.\n\n62. Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COVENTRY\">Coventry</a> of Southwark has favoured us with the description of a micrometer of his own invention; the scale of which, for minuteness, surpasses every instrument of the kind of which we have any knowledge, and of which, indeed, we could scarcely have formed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a>, had he not indulged us with several of these instruments, graduated as underneath.\n\nThe micrometer is composed of glass, ivory, silver, Micrometer &c., on which are drawn parallel lines from the 10th to the 10,000th part of an inch. But an instrument thus divided, he observes, is more for curiosity than use: but one of those which Mr Coventry has sent us is divided into squares, so small that sixteen millions of them are contained on the surface of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> inch, each square appearing under the microscope true and distinct; and though so small, it is a fact, that animalcula are found which may be contained in one of these squares.\n\nThe use of micrometers, when applied to microscopes, is to measure the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> size of the object, and how much that object is magnified. To ascertain the real size of an object in the single microscope, nothing more is required than to lay it on the micrometer, and adjust it to the focus of the magnifier, noticing how many divisions of the micrometer it covers. Suppose the parallel lines of the micrometer to be the 1000th of an inch, and the object covers two divisions; its real size is 500ths of an inch; if five, 200ths, and so on.\n\nBut to find how much the object is magnified, is not mathematically determined so easily by the single as by the compound microscope: but the following simple method (says Mr Coventry) I have generally adopted, and think it tolerably accurate. Adjust a micrometer under the microscope so, say the 100th of an inch of divisions, with a small object on it; if square, the better: notice how many divisions one side of the object covers, suppose 10: then cut a piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> paper something larger than the magnified appearance of the object: then fix one eye on the object through the microscope, and the other at the same time on the paper, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOWERING\">lowering</a> it down till the object and the paper appear level and distinct: then cut the paper till it appear exactly the size of the magnified object; the paper being then measured, suppose an inch square: Now, as the object under the magnifier, which appeared to be one inch square, was in reality only ten hundredths, or the tenth of an inch, the experiment proves that it is magnified ten times in length, one hundred times in superfices, and one thousand times in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUBE\">cube</a>, which is the magnifying power of the glass; and, in the same manner, a table may be made of the power of all the other glasses.\n\nIn using the compound microscope, the real size of the object is found by the same method as in the single: but to demonstrate the magnifying power of each glass to greater certainty, adopt the following method.\u2014Lay a two-feet rule on the stage, and a micrometer level with its surface (an inch suppose, divided into 100 parts): with one eye see how many of those parts are contained in the field of the microscope, suppose 50; and with the other, at the same time, look for the circle of light in the field of the microscope, which with a little practice will soon appear distinct; mark how much of the rule is intersected by the circle of light, which will be half the diameter of the field. Suppose eight inches; consequently the whole diameter will be sixteen. Now, as the real size of the field, by the micrometers, appeared to be only 50 hundredths, or half an inch, and as half an inch is only one 32d part\nMicrometer.\n\npart of 16 inches, it shows the magnifying power of the glass to be 32 times in length, 1024 surfaces, and 32,768 cube (e).\n\n63. Another way of finding the magnifying power of compound microscopes, is by using two micrometers of the same divisions; one adjusted under the magnifier, the other fixed in the body of the microscope in the focus of the eye-glass. Notice how many divisions of the micrometer in the body are seen in one division of the micrometer under the magnifier, which again must be multiplied by the power of the eye-glass.\n\nExample: Ten divisions of the micrometer in the body are contained in one division under the magnifier; so far the power is increased ten times: now, if the eye-glass be one inch focus, such glass will of itself magnify about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> times in length, which, with the ten times magnified before, will be seven times ten, or 70 times in length, 4900 surfaces, and 343,000 cube.\n\n\"If (says Mr Coventry) these micrometers are employed in the solar microscope, they divide the object into squares on the screen in such a manner as to render it extremely easy to make a drawing of it. And (says he) I apprehend they may be employed to great advantage with such a microscope as Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADAM\">Adam</a>'s lucernal; because this instrument may be used either by day or night, or in any place, and gives the actual magnifying power without calculation.\"\n\nThe case with which we have been favoured by Mr Coventry contains six micrometers, two on ivory and four on glass. One of those on ivory is an inch divided into one hundred parts, every fifth line longer than the intermediate ones, and every tenth longer still, for the greater ease in counting the divisions under the microscope, and is generally used in measuring the magnifying power of microscopes. The other ivory one is divided into squares of the 50th and 100th of an inch, and is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> employed in measuring opaque objects.\n\nThose made of glass are for transparent objects, which, when laid on them, show their natural size.\u2014That marked on the brass 100, are squares divided to the 100th of an inch: that marked 1000 are parallel lines forming nine divisions, each division the 1000th of an inch; the middle division is again divided into 5, making divisions to the 5000th of an inch. That marked 10,000 is divided in the same manner, with the middle division divided into 10, making the 10,000th of an inch. Example:\n\nThe glass micrometer without any mark is also divided, the outside lines into 100th, the next into 1000th, and the inside lines into the 4000th of an inch: these are again crossed with an equal number of lines in the same manner, making squares of the 100th, 1000th, and 4000th of an inch, thus demonstrating each other's size. The middle square of the 1000th of an inch (see fig. 26.) is divided into sixteen squares; now as 1000 squares in the length of an inch, multiplied by 1000, gives one million in an inch surface; by the same rule, one of those squares divided into 16 must be the sixteen millionth part of an inch surface. See fig. 26. which is a diminished view of the apparent surface exhibited under the magnifier No 1. of Wilson's microscope. In viewing the smallest lines, Mr Coventry uses No 2. or 3.; and they are all better seen, he says, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a> than by day-light.\n\nMICR\u00d3PUS, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BASTARD\">Bastard</a> Cudweed; a genus of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> belonging to the syngenesia class, and in the natural method ranking under the 49th order, Compositae.

In some notices concerning this subject which we have seen, it is observed that this science is more intimately connected with the Egyptian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HIEROGLYPHICS\">hieroglyphics</a> than is generally thought, and that this connection may help to explain them. In Germany this art has been revived by M. Arein; and a pupil of his, M.

This seems to be a singular, and we may add a silly prohibition. The following account is given of this art in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> in the beginning of 1807.\n\n\"During my residence, says the writer, in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a> I heard a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of a new method of mnemonique, or of a method to assist and fix our memory, invented by Gregor de Feinaigle. Notwithstanding the simplicity with which he announced his lectures in the papers, I could not determine myself to become a pupil of his, as I thought to find a quack or mountebank, and to be laughed at by my friends for having thrown away my cash in such a foolish manner. Perhaps I should hesitate to this moment about the utility of this newly invented method to assist our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> memory, had I not had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> of dining at his excellency's the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNT\">count</a> of Metternich, the Austrian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMBASSADOR\">ambassador</a>, who followed, with all his secretaries, the whole course of lectures; they all spoke very advantageously of it, likewise several other persons of the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> I met there: in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of this I was inserted into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of pupils, and I follow at this moment the lectures. All I can tell you about this method is, it is a very simple one, and easy to be learned, adapted to all ages and sexes: all difficulties in such sciences as require an extraordinary good memory, for instance, the names and epochs in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, are at once overcome and obviated. There is not one branch of science to which this method cannot be applied.

M. Feinaigle, to answer all these critics at once, adopted a method not less public for Paris than the public papers, but less public for the rest of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>: he gave, the 22d of last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>, a public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXHIBITION\">exhibition</a> to about 2000 spectators, in which he did not appear at all, only about 12 or 15 of his pupils: each of them made such an application of the method as his situation in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> required.

Some manufactures of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a> have since been introduced; and, in general, all the manufactures, the finer sorts especially, had increased considerably, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the interruption of foreign <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOBACCO\">Tobacco</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a> are royal manufactures and monopolies; and the former brings in to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> a clear revenue of four millions of dollars annually. The Mexican tradesmen are remarkably skilful in works of plate and jewellery; and, like some of the eastern nations, they have a singular turn for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a>. Very good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARRIAGES\">carriages</a> are made in Mexico, though the best coaches come from England.\n\nThe commerce of New Spain has increased greatly since 1765, and especially since 1778. From the first of these periods to 1789, various new edicts were issued, all tending to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the monopoly which a few opulent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CADIZ\">Cadiz</a> and Mexico had previously enjoyed. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPORTATION\">exportation</a> from Vera Cruz, before the year 1778, when the old system subsisted, was about 617,000 piastres annually; but from\nCommerce, 1787 to 1792; under the new system, it amounted to Revenue, 2,840,000 piastres annually. The commerce of Mexico with the mother country, is almost entirely carried on through Vera Cruz. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of peace, Mr Humboldt estimates the annual value of the exports in that commerce at 22,000,000 piastres, and the imports at 15,000,000. Of the former, about 17,000,000 consists of gold and silver, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COIN\">coin</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BULLION\">bullion</a>, and plate; the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COCHINEAL\">cochineal</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>, flour, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIGO\">indigo</a>, salted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>, tanned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HIDES\">hides</a>, sarsaparilla, vanilla, jalap, &c. Of the imports, 9,000,000 consists of bale goods, including woollens, cottons, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a>, and silk. The other articles are, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, brandy, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CACAO\">cacao</a>, quicksilver, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a>, wine, and bees-wax. This estimate does not include the imports in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRABAND\">contraband</a> trade, which, in time of peace, are supposed to be about a fourth of the whole. The temptations to engage in this trade are very great, as the value of commodities imported in Spanish vessels is increased 35 or 40 per cent. by the duties. Mexico also carries on a considerable trade with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUBA\">Cuba</a>, Porto-Rico, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLORIDA\">Florida</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANILLA\">Manilla</a>. The whole exports are estimated at 31,500,000 piastres, including specie, and the imports at 22,000,000. The demand for foreign merchandise in New Spain and Guatemala, amounts nearly to seven millions <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">sterling</a>.\n\nThe revenue of New Spain has augmented with the progress of industry. In 1712 the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> revenue amounted to 3,668,400 piastres; in 1765 to 6,141,981; in 1780 to 15,010,974; and in 1802 to 20,200,000. It is derived chiefly from the following sources. From the produce of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINES\">mines</a>, consisting of duties, profits on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COINAGE\">coinage</a>, and on the sale of mercury, about 5,500,000 piastres. From the manufacture of tobacco, 4,000,000 to 4,500,000. From the alcavala, or duty on every sale of goods, nearly 3,000,000. From the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITULATION\">capitulation</a>, 1,300,000. From the duty on pulque, 800,000. From the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">net</a> produce of the duty on imports and exports, 500,000. From the sale of papal indulgences, 270,000. From the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POST\">post</a>, net produce 250,000. From the sale of powder, 150,000. From clerical benefices, 100,000. From the sale of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CARDS\">cards</a>, 120,000. Stamp duties, 80,000. From the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARM\">farm</a> of cock-fighting, 45,000. From the farm of snow, 30,000. The expense of collection is estimated by Humboldt, on an average, at 16 or 18 per cent. of the gross receipts. Of this revenue of 20,000,000 piastres, 10,500,000 are consumed by the internal expenses of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>; 3,500,000 are remitted to other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a> to supply deficiencies in their revenues; and the remainder consisting of about 6,000,000, is the clear revenue derived by the mother country from the colony. The value of the specie circulating in Mexico is estimated at fifty-five or sixty millions of piastres, which is nearly ten piastres a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> for the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a>. The national wealth of Mexico is supposed to be equal to two fifths of the whole Spanish continental colonies.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> force of the colony in 1804 consisted of 9,919 regular troops, and 22,277 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITIA\">militia</a>, one half of both being cavalry. The military spirit in the militia <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> is partly kept up by the vanity of some families, who aspire to the titles of colonels and brigadiers. And the distribution of these titles has become a source of revenue to those individuals who have influence with the ministry. Here, as in the United <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">States</a>, merchants in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVINCIAL\">provincial</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> are transformed into colonels and majors. The petty warfare continually carried on Population, with the wandering Indians, in the provincias externas, and the maintenance of the presidios or military posts, require a considerable expense. The state of the eastern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the country, facilitate its defense against any attempt by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARITIME\">maritime</a> power.\n\nIn the year 1776, the old provincial divisions were laid aside, and the country was divided anew into twelve intendancies, to which must be added three districts, very remote from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a>, which have preserved the simple denomination of provinces. The whole of New Spain, in 1803, contained 118,478 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> leagues, and 5,837,100 inhabitants. The population of the twelve intendancies was as follows:\n\n| Intendancy       | Population |\n|------------------|------------|\n| Mexico           | 1,511,000  |\n| Puebla           | 813,300    |\n| Vera Cruz        | 156,000    |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OAXACA\">Oaxaca</a>           | 534,800    |\n| Merida           | 465,800    |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VALLADOLID\">Valladolid</a>       | 467,400    |\n| Guadalajara      | 632,500    |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-ZACATECAS\">Zacatecas</a>        | 153,300    |\n| Guanajuato       | 517,300    |\n| San Luis Potosi  | 230,000    |\n| Old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CALIFORNIA\">California</a>   | 9,000      |\n| New California   | 15,600     |\n\nAdd the population of the Provincias Internas,\n\n| Provincias Internas | 423,000    |\n|---------------------|------------|\n|                     | 5,837,100  |\n\nThis population is distinguished into different classes:\n\n- Whites,\u2014of whom 70,000 are European Spaniards,\n- Indians,\n- Mestizos, or mixed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>,\n- <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NEGROES\">Negroes</a>,\n\nOf all the circumstances in the state of Spanish America, this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of its inhabitants into casts, marked by nature with differences of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, and distinguished in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAW\">law</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> by differences of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> or privilege, is the most adverse to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> and prosperity. The first class is divided within itself. Though the Gachupines, or European Spaniards, and the Creoles, or American Spaniards, have in law equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> to preferment, the former enjoy almost all places of trust or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol6.html#article-EMOLUMENT\">emolument</a>. One cause of this partiality is, that the needy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MADRID\">Madrid</a>, which has been in the practice of raising <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> by the sale of colonial offices, fills up even the most inferior situations. A keen spirit of jealousy is thus kept up between the parties, and the government, by showing favour to the one, has made enemies of the other.\n\nThe Mestizos, or descendants of Spaniards and Indians, form the class next in rank after the whites. In colour they hardly differ from the Creoles; but the scantiness of their beards, the smallness of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> and feet, and a particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> of their eyes, betray their Indian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a>. Some consider them as a superior race of men to the Creoles both in bodily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> and mental endowments. In rank they follow the condition of their fathers. The Creoles and Mestizos...\nMestizoes form by their union, their numbers, and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> force, and the most respectable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the Spanish colonists. As they have the same interests to maintain, and the same grievances to redress, it is probable that in the event of any civil dissensions, they would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> together, whether against Indians or Europeans.\n\nThe fate of the Indians living under the Spanish government, is a striking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the inefficacy of law to afford protection, where those who are the objects of its care have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> control over the persons <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> with its execution. The Indians are fenced by the strictest provisions against the tyranny and injustice of their rulers, and yet no people have suffered more from rapacity and oppression. They are born free, and exempt from all sorts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> service; they are admissible into all incorporated trades, in the same manner as Spaniards; and their caciques have the privileges of Spanish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBLES\">nobles</a>. Those who live in separate villages are governed by alcaldes and regidores of their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, and no Spaniards or mixed races are permitted to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> among them, or encroach on their lands. To prevent their facility from being abused by the fraudulent and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESIGNING\">designing</a>, they cannot dispose of their real property without the intervention of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a>, nor enter into contracts, nor conclude bargains for a greater sum than three dollars. They are exempt from the alcayala, and pay only a moderate tribute,\u2014not exceeding two dollars for every person from 10 to 50 years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>. These anxious provisions for their protection have undoubtedly operated against their progress in civilization. Their living in separate communities deprives them of the means of instruction. The state of papilage in which they are kept destroys the energy of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a>, and detains them in perpetual childhood. The multiplicity of laws in their favour, enables the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a> or magistrate to interfere when he pleases in their concerns, and, on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRETEXT\">pretext</a> of serving them, to become their worst oppressor. The produce of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> lands of their villages, which they are bound to cultivate, is withheld from the beneficial purposes to which it is applicable by law, and openly diverted to other uses in which they have no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> or concern. The privileges of their caciques are almost illusory.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">Climate</a> has little effect on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a> of the Indians. Those who live on the Rio Negro are darker than those who inhabit the banks of the Lower <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORINOCO\">Orinoco</a>, though they enjoy a much cooler temperature. Their children, contrary to the testimony of some authors, have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a> colour at birth. The Indians are a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> lived race, when their days are not shortened by intoxication. Pulque, a fermented liquor from the juice of the agave americana, which is their native liquor, is less prejudicial to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> than rum or brandy, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of which they have learned from Europeans. They have little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a> of body, and suffer less from wounds and injuries than other casts, and they are also less subject to personal deformities. A crooked spine is never seen among them, and very few of them are squint-eyed or lame. In the provinces afflicted with the goitre, the Indians are totally exempt, and even the Mestizoes rarely suffer from that malady. Of all the races in the old world they have the greatest resemblance to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOGULS\">Moguls</a>, but they have a smaller facial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a>, though greater than the negro. Their skull is thicker than that of the European, the frontal bone more depressed, the occiput less protuberant, and the brain smaller. The Mexican Indian is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a>, melancholy, and silent, unless when under the influence of spirituous liquors. He affects an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> of mystery in the most unimportant transactions, and no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> is to be seen in his countenance of the most violent passions that agitate him. He is obstinately attached to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> customs, manners, and opinions. He seems to be destitute of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>, and to have little feeling; but when properly educated, has a clear head, an acute and logical understanding. The Indians are generally excessively <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>, but some of them under an appearance of wretchedness conceal considerable wealth. In every village there are eight or ten individuals who live in idleness at the expense of the others, on pretence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a> of their birth.\n\nThe Toltecas, who first inhabited Mexico, were counted much more polished than those who came after them, insomuch that in after ages it was customary to distinguish people of ingenuity and learning by the name of Toltecas. They always lived in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>, collected into cities, under the government of kings, and had regular laws. They were more addicted to the arts of peace than of war; and it was to them that the succeeding nations owed themselves indebted for their knowledge of the culture of grain, cotton, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEPPER\">pepper</a>, &c. They understood the art of casting gold and silver, and melting them in whatever forms they pleased, acquiring also great reputation from their skill in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> gems of all kinds; and they were besides well versed in the sciences of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHRONOLOGY\">chronology</a>.\n\nAccording to the ancient histories of these people, they observed, about a hundred years before the Christian era, how far the solar year exceeded the civil one; supplying the defect, as we do, by the addition of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> once in four years. In the year 660, while their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONARCHY\">monarchy</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TULA\">Tula</a>, a celebrated astronomer named Huematzin, assembled with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a>'s consent all the wise men of the nation; and with their assistance painted a famous book named Teozomxtli, or \"divine book,\" in which were represented, in very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> figures, the origin of the Indians, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISPERSION\">dispersion</a> after the confusion of tongues at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BABEL\">Babel</a>, their journey in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>, their first settlements in America, the founding of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of Tula, and their progress till that time: but these, and other accounts of their great knowledge and accuracy, savour too much of exaggeration, or perhaps <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>, from both which it is impossible to clear the Spaniards when speaking of American affairs.\n\nThe Chichemecas derived their knowledge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a> from the Toltecas, and of consequence the Mexicans also. Being destitute of ploughs or animals of agriculture sufficient strength to assist them in their labour, they made use of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> of hard copper, which they called coatl or con, but differing in shape either from a spade or mattock. They used copper axes to cut trees, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of which was the same with ours; only that they put the axe into the eye of the handle, instead of putting the handle into the eye of the axe as we do. They had several other instruments of agriculture, but the forms of them are not mentioned by historians. They watered their fields by means of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>.\nrivers and small torrents which came from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>; raising dams to collect them, and forming <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CANALS\">canals</a> to conduct them properly to the places which required moisture. They used enclosures of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, as well as hedges for the fields, using for their hedges the aloe plant, which is well calculated for the purpose; and what reparations were necessary they gave in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a>. They dibbled their maize: a method of sowing more slow indeed than the ordinary one, but which certainly repays the trouble by a vastly larger crop, as well as by saving a very considerable quantity of seed. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">Close</a> to the newly sown fields they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> erected a small tower of wood, where a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> kept watch, in order to drive away the birds that came to feed upon the grain; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> still preserved among the Spaniards.\n\nIn the cultivation of their gardens, the Mexicans were extremely skilful and magnificent; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTING\">planting</a> in them not only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KITCHEN\">kitchen</a> herbs, but fruit trees, medicinal herbs, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a>, with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> and regularity. Some of the royal gardens excited the admiration of the Spaniards so much, that Cortes, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> V. informed him that the garden at Huaxtepec was the most extensive, the most beautiful, and most delightful, that had ever been beheld. It was for many years preserved by the Spaniards.\u2014The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> most cultivated, next to maize, were cotton, cocoa, and aloe; which last served a great many useful purposes. See ALOE.\n\nThough they had not the advantage of the larger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRUPEDS\">quadrupeds</a>, as horses, oxen, or sheep, they bred up an immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of quadrupeds unknown in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. Private persons brought up the small quadrupeds already mentioned, resembling little dogs; as well as turkeys, quails, geese, ducks, and other kinds of fowl. In the houses of the great men were bred fish, deer, rabbits, and a variety of birds; and in the royal palaces, almost all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of quadrupeds and winged animals to be found in these kingdoms were kept, as well as a great number of aquatic animals and reptiles. According to Clavigero, Montezuma II. surpassed all the kings in the world in this kind of magnificence; and there never was a nation equal to the Mexicans in the care they took in taming animals.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAINTING\">Painting</a> was an art in great request among the Mexicans, and one of very great use; as it was only by means of paintings that they recorded their histories. This art they derived, like others, from the Toltecas. Some of these paintings were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> images of their gods, kings, heroes, or terrestrial objects. Others were historical, containing an account of particular events; others mythological, of which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> is preserved in the great library of the order of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOLOGNA\">Bologna</a>: others were codes of law, civil and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a>; while some were chronological, astronomical, or astrological; in which were represented their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-CALENDAR\">calendar</a>, the position of the stars, changes of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>, eclipses, and prognostications and variations of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>. Great numbers of these were burned by the superstitious Spaniards, who imagined that they contained some emblems of heathen worship. They had likewise geographical paintings, which served not only to show the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> and boundaries of their possessions, but likewise the situation of places, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of the coasts, and the course of the rivers. In his first letter to Charles V. Cortes says, that having made inquiries <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> there was any secure harbour for vessels on the Mexican coast, Montezuma presented him with a painting of the whole coast, from the port of Vera Cruz, at that time called Chalchiuhuecan, to the river Coatzaucalco. Another author informs us also, that Cortes, in a long and difficult voyage which he made to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONDURAS\">Honduras</a>, made use of a chart presented to him by the lords of Coatzaucalco, in which all the places and rivers were marked from the coast of Coatzaucalco to Huejacallan.\n\nThe cloth on which paintings were done was made of the thread of the aloe or a kind of palm; or they painted on sheep's skins or upon paper. This last was made of the leaves of a certain kind of aloe, steeped like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEMP\">hemp</a>, and afterwards washed, stretched, and smoothed. They used also the bark of other trees, prepared with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUM\">gum</a>: but we are ignorant of the method they used in the manufacture. This paper is similar in thickness to the European pasteboard, but softer, smoother, and more easy for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>. In general it was made up in very long sheets, which they preserved in rolls, or folded like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a>-screens. The volume of Mexican paintings, preserved in the library of Bologna, is a thick skin, ill dressed, composed of different pieces painted all over, and folded up in that manner. The beautiful colours which they employed both in their paintings and in their dyes, were obtained from wood, leaves, and the flowers of different plants, as well as from various animal substances. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> was made from a kind of stone which burns into a fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLASTER\">plaster</a>; or from a mineral, which after being made into a paste worked like clay, and formed into small balls, turns white in the fire like Spanish white. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> was got from another mineral, which has a disagreeable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a>, or from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOOT\">soot</a> of a kind of pine collected in small earthen vessels. They obtain blue and azure colours from indigo; but their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of obtaining these was very different from that used by the moderns. They put the branches of the plant into hot, or rather lukewarm, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>; and after having stirred them about for a sufficient time with a stick or ladle, they passed the water, when impregnated with the dye, into certain pots or cups, in which they let it remain until the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> part of the dye was deposited; after which they poured off the water. This sediment was first dried in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, and afterwards put between two plates before a fire until it grew hard. They had another plant which likewise afforded a blue colour, but inferior to the indigo. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">Red</a> was obtained from the seeds of the achiot or rocon, and purple from cochineal. Their yellows were ochre, and a colour extracted from the beautiful flower of a plant resembling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTEMISIA\">artemisia</a>. With nitre these flowers afforded a fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">orange</a> colour; and by means of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALUM\">alum</a> they extracted other colours.","sp":826,"ep":829},{"h":"NETTLE-RASH","t":"Febris urticata, Vog. 40.\nUredo, Lin. 8.\nPurpura urticata, Junck. 75.\nScarlatina urticata, Sauv. sp. 2.\nErysipelas <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> altera, Sydenham, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">sect</a>. vi. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>. 6.\nFebris scarlatina, et febris urticata, Meyerey, Mal. des arm\u00e9es, 291 et seq.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">Description</a>. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> has its English name of nettle-rash from the resemblance of its eruption to that made by the stinging of nettles. These little elevations upon the skin in the nettle-rash often appear instantaneously, especially <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the skin be rubbed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> scratched, and seldom stay many hours in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, and sometimes not many minutes. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the body is exempt from them; and where many of them rise together, and continue an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> or two, the parts are often considerably swelled; which particularly happens in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a>, arms, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>. These eruptions <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> continue to infest the skin, sometimes in one place and sometimes in another, for one or two hours at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, two or three times every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, or perhaps for the greatest part of the 24 hours.\u2014In some persons they last only a few days, in others many months; nay, sometimes the disease has lasted for years with very short intervals.\n\nBut though the eruption of the urticaria resembles, as already observed, that produced by the stinging of nettles,\nwill produce something like this effect on the parts Urticaria, which they touch; and undoubtedly from the same cause.\n\nDr Heberden asks, Is it impossible that the nettle-rash should arise from the same causes, or from others similar, which we miss by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> too deeply for them in the blood and humours? Such, says he, may have been its origin in some instances, where it has lasted only a few days; but where this affection has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> for some years, in persons who change their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> every day, and who bathe frequently all the time, it can hardly be ascribed to such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> cause. He has observed it frequently to arise from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CANTHARIDES\">cantharides</a>: but though it has continued many weeks after the removal of the blister, yet it might be suspected that this arose from the fine spicules of the cantharides sticking all this time about the skin; it being customary to strew much of the dry powder of the cantharides over the blister-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLASTER\">plaster</a>, whence it may readily be carried to other parts of the body. But it is certain that similar effects will sometimes follow the internal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of wild valerian root, or the eating of fish not sufficiently dressed; muscles, shrimps, and even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a>, and the kernels of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>, will also sometimes produce symptoms of a similar kind. But whatever be its cause, Dr Heberden never <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> any reason to suppose that the nettle-rash had in any way vitiated the humours to such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> as to require the use of internal remedies; and if the itching could be certainly and expeditiously allayed, there would be no occasion for any farther cure. He concludes this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of the disorder with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> communicated to him by Dr Monsey, physician of Chelsea <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">College</a>, and in which the disease appeared with uncommon violence.\n\nW. A., aged near 30, of a thin spare <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a>, was seized with a disorder attended with symptoms of a very uncommon kind. Whenever he went into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> shined bright, he was seized with a tickling of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> on those parts exposed to the sun: this tickling, by his continuing in the air, increased to a violent itching, attended with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> and pain: the skin would then be almost as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> as vermillion, and thicken like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a>; and this remained till he went out of the open air, and then abated in about 15 or 20 minutes. This happened only when the sun was above the horizon; at other times he was what he called quite well.\u2014But it was not owing to the heat of the sun; for the sun in winter affected him full as much, if not more, and the heat of the fire had no such effect. Thus he was confined to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> for 10 years. He tried several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOSPITALS\">hospitals</a>, and had advices from many physicians, without the least abatement of his complaints. At last it was agreed by a consultation of physicians, that he should try <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIPPING\">dipping</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>; which he did at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-YARMOUTH\">Yarmouth</a> for 13 weeks, without any visible amendment. One hot day, having pulled off his clothes and gone into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> in the middle of the day, the heat diffused itself so violently all over his body, that, by the time he had put on his clothes, his eyesight began to fail, and he was compelled to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> upon the ground to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> himself from falling. The moment he lay down, the faintness went off; upon this he got up again; but had no sooner arisen, than he found himself in the former condition; he therefore lay\nHaving arrived at Aberdeen, he was quartered in a damp, ill-aired, under-ground apartment. He then complained of sickness at stomach, great oppression about the precordia, headache, lassitude, and weariness, on the least exertion; with stiffness and rigidity of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-KNEES\">knees</a> and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a>. The surgeon of the regiment visited him: he was purged, but with little benefit. About ten days before, he observed on the inside of his thighs a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of very small, distinct, red spots, a little elevated above the surface of the skin, and much resembling the first appearance of smallpox. This eruption gradually spread itself over his whole body, and the pustules continued every day to increase in size.\n\nUpon being received into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">hospital</a>, he complained of headache, sickness at stomach, oppression about the precordia, thirst, sore throat, with difficulty of swallowing; his tongue was foul, his skin felt hot and feverish; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULSE\">pulse</a> from 110 to 122, rather depressed; belly costive; eyes dull and languid, but without delirium. The whole surface of his skin was interspersed with vesicles, or phlyctenes, of the size of an ordinary walnut; many of them were larger, especially on the arms and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>. In the interstices, between the vesicles, the appearance of the skin was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a>, nor was there any redness round their base; the distance from one to another was from half an inch to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>-breadth or more. In some places two or three were joined together, like the pustules in the confluent smallpox. A few vesicles had burst of themselves, and formed a whitish scab or crust. These were chiefly on the neck and face; others showed a tolerably laudable pus. However, by far the greatest number were perfectly entire, turgid, and of a bluish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>. Upon opening them, it was evident that the cuticle elevated above the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTIS\">cutis</a>, and distended with a thin, yellowish, semipellucid serum, formed this appearance. Nor was the surface of the cutis ulcerated or livid; but of a red florid colour, as when the cuticle is separated by a blister, or superficial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a>. No other person laboured under a similar disease, either in the part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> from which he came, or when he resided in Aberdeen.\n\nThis case was treated in the following manner. The largest of the vesicles were snipped, and dressed with unguent, lap. calaminarii. In the evening he was vomited with a solution of tartar emetic, given in small quantities and at intervals. This also procured two loose stools. And he was ordered for drink, water-gruel acidulated with lemon juice.\n\n\"April 16. He still complained of sickness, some oppression about his breast, and sore throat; he had slept little during the night; his tongue was foul and blackish; his skin, however, was not so hot as the preceding day; his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-URINE\">urine</a> was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>-coloured, but had the appearance of separation; his pulse go, and soft; most of the sores on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a> of the body looked clean. Others, particularly where the vesicles were confluent, seemed beginning to ulcerate, and to have a bluish sublivid appearance. They were dressed afresh with cerate, and he was ordered the following medicines:\n\nR Decoet. Cort. Peruvian, 3vj. Vini rubri. Lusitan. 3ijj. M. Hujus mixture capiat 3f. teria quaque hora.\"\nHis acidulated drink was continued; and on account of the very offensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a> on approaching near him, some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VINEGAR\">vinegar</a> was placed in a basin before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a>, and sprinkled on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a>; and the room was kept properly aired.\n\nApril 17. His sores looked tolerably clean, unless on his arms and thighs; where they were livid, a little ulcerated, and discharged a bloody ichor.\n\nHis headache, sickness, &c. were almost gone; his tongue was rather cleaner; pulse 68, and soft. As the decoction of the bark sat easily on his stomach, the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRESCRIPTION\">prescription</a> was ordered:\n\nRe Pulv. subtiliss. Cort. Peruv. 3S. Vini rubri Lusitan. Aq. fontan. 3S. M. ft. Haust. tertia quaque hora repetend.\n\nThe acidulated drink was continued, and fresh dressings applied to the sores.\n\nApril 18. The little ulcers in his arms and thighs still discharged a bloody ichor, and looked ill; his other complaints were better; pulse 82. The bark had not nauseated him, and it was continued as well as his former drink.\n\nApril 19. His sores looked much cleaner and better; the fever was gone, his pulse natural, and he had no complaint but weakness and a troublesome itching of the skin: The Peruvian bark, &c. were continued.\n\nApril 20. Some of the ulcers still poured forth a bloody ichor; most of them, however, looked well, and had begun to heal\u2014fever gone\u2014medicines continued.\n\nFrom the 21st of April, he went on gaining strength, and his sores appeared to heal fast; he was desired to take only four doses every day; and by the 27th his sores, &c. were totally dried up\u2014he had no complaint, and was dismissed cured.\"\n\nSince the publication of this case of pemphigus by Dr Stuart, observations on this disease have been published by Dr Stephen Dickson of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUBLIN\">Dublin</a>, in the Transactions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> Irish Academy. In these observations, an account is given of six different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> which Dr Dickson has had an opportunity of seeing. Judging from these, Dr Dickson thinks that Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CULLEN\">Cullen</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> of this disease requires correction; and that it ought to be defined, \"a fever accompanied with the successive eruption, from different parts of the body, internal as well as external, of vesicles about the size of an almond, which become turgid with a faintly yellowish serum, and in three or four days subside.\"\n\nFrom the cases which have fallen under Dr Dickson's observation, he concludes, that the disease varies considerably as to its mildness or malignity. In three of the cases which he has seen, the symptoms were extremely mild, but in the other three strong symptoms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUTREFACTION\">putrefaction</a> were manifested, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> of the patient was in great danger. With respect to the method of cure, he is of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that the general symptoms of weakness, and tendency to putrefaction, obviously point out the proper treatment. Nourishment must be supplied, and the Peruvian bark and wine carefully administered; and when vesicles appear on internal parts, irritation must be guarded against by opiates, demulcents, and gentle laxatives.\n\nSome additional observations on the subject of pem-\n\nphigus have lately been published in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> Medical Journal by Mr Thomas Christie. From a case which Mr Christie describes, he is disposed to agree with Mr Dickson in thinking that sometimes at least pemphigus is not contagious. He remarks, however, that the pemphigus described by some foreign writers was extremely infectious; which he thinks may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of the disease into two species, the pemphigus simplex and complicatus: both of which, but especially the last, seem to vary much with respect to mildness and malignity.\n\nGENUS XXXV.

Febris aphthosa, Vog. 44.\n\nThe only idiopathic species is the thrush to which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANTS\">infants</a> are subject; (Aphtha lactucimen, Sauv. sp. 1.)\n\nThe aphthae are whitish or ash-coloured pustules, invading the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UVULA\">uvula</a>, fauces, palate, tonsils, inside of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEEKS\">cheeks</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUMS\">gums</a>, tongue, and lips. They for the most part begin at the uvula, sending forth a glutinous mucus, and the pustules covering all or the greatest number of the parts above mentioned, with a thick whitish crust adhering most tenaciously. This crust does not induce an eschar on the parts on which it lies by eating into them, but comes off in whole pieces after the pustules have arrived at maturity. This will often happen in a short time, so that the throat and internal parts of the mouth are frequently observed to be clean, which a few hours before were wholly covered with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> crusts. Neither is this disease confined to the throat and fauces, but is said to affect the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OESOPHAGUS\">oesophagus</a>, stomach, and all parts of the alimentary canal. Of this indeed there is no other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a>, than that, after a great difficulty of swallowing, there is sometimes an immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of aphthae evacuated by stool and vomiting, such as the mouth could not be thought capable of containing.\n\nCauses, &c. The aphthous fever seems to be produced by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> and moisture, as it is found only in the northern countries, and especially in marshy places; and in them the aphthae often appear without any fever at all.\n\nPrognosis. There is no symptom by which the coming out of aphthae can be foretold, though they are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> in many fevers; but they themselves are in general a bad symptom, and always signify a very tedious disorder: the danger denoted by them is in proportion to the difficulty of deglutition; and a diarrhoea accompanying them is likewise bad. This indeed generally carries off old people when they become affected with aphthae. The dark-coloured aphthae also are much more dangerous than such as are of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> or ash colour; but it is a good sign when the appetite returns, and the dark-coloured ones are succeeded by others of a whiter colour. Neither are those which are unaccompanied with fever so dangerous as the other kind.\n\nCure. As the aphthae are seldom a primary disease, we must generally endeavour to remove the disorder upon which they depend, after which they will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> off;\nORDER IV.

The milder species of this hemorrhage comes on more frequently in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> than in winter, and for the most part without giving any warning, or being attended with any inconvenience; but the less benign kind is preceded by several remarkable symptoms. These are, congestions of the blood sometimes in one part, and sometimes in another, and which are often very troublesome in the sides of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>: there is a redness of the cheeks; an inflation of the face, and of the vessels of the neck and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a>; a tinnitus aurium; a heavy pain of the eyes, with a prominence, dryness, and sparks; there is a vertiginous affection of the head, with an itching of the nostrils, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>, especially about the root of the nose. In some the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a> is disturbed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DREAMS\">dreams</a> about blood, fire, &c. Frequently the belly is costive, there is a diminution of the quantity of urine, a suppression of sweat, coldness of the lower extremities, and tension of the hypochondria, especially the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> one.\n\nCauses, &c. This hemorrhage may occur at any time of life; but most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> happens to young persons, owing to the peculiar state of the system at that time. Sometimes, however, it happens after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> and during the state of manhood, at which time it is to be imputed to a plethoric state of the system; to a determination of the blood, by habit, to the vessels of the nose; or to the particular weakness of these vessels.\n\nIn all these cases the disease may be considered as an arterial hemorrhage, and depending upon an arterial plethora; but it sometimes occurs in the decline of life, and may then be considered as the sign of a venous plethora in the vessels of the head. It often happens at any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of life in certain febrile diseases, which are altogether or partly of an inflammatory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, and which show a particular determination of the blood to the vessels of the head. As by this evacuation, other diseases are often removed, it may on these occasions be deemed truly critical. It happens to persons of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEMPERAMENT\">temperament</a>; but most frequently to the plethoric and sanguine, and more commonly to men than women.\n\nPrognosis. In young people, the bleeding at the nose may be considered as a slight disease, and scarce worth notice. But, even in young persons, when it recurs frequently and in great quantity, it is alarming; and is to be considered as a mark of an arterial plethora, which in the decline of life may give the blood a determination to parts from which the hemorrhage would be more dangerous; and this will require more particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, as the marks of plethora and congestion preceding the hemorrhage are more considerable, and as the flowing of the blood is attended with a more considerable degree of febrile disorder. These consequences are more especially to be dreaded, when the epistaxis happens to persons after their age, returning frequently and violently. Even in the decline of life, however, it may be considered as in itself very salutary; but at the same time it is a mark of a dangerous state of the system, i.e., of a strong tendency to venous plethora in the head, and it has accordingly been often followed by apoplexy, palsy, &c. When it happens in febrile diseases, and is in pretty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> quantity, it may generally be considered as critical and salutary; but it is very apt to be too profuse, and thus becomes dangerous. It sometimes occurs during the eruptive fever of some exanthemata, and is in such cases sometimes salutary; but if these exanthemata be accompanied with any putrid disposition, this hemorrhage, as well as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> bloodlettings, may have a very bad tendency.\n\nCure. The treatment in cases of epistaxis may be referred to two heads. 1st, The treatment during the time of the discharge; and, 2dly, The treatment after the discharge is stopped, with the view of preventing the return of it. During the former of these periods, it is necessary in the first place to consider whether the discharge should be left to its natural course, or stopped by artificial means. In determining this question, regard must be paid to the quantity of the discharge; the appearance of the blood; the constitution with which epistaxis occurs; the former habit of the patient; and the consequences which result from the discharge. When, from due consideration of these circumstances, there is reason to fear that further evacuation would be attended with bad consequences, though this disease has been generally thought very slight, it should seldom be left to the conduct of nature; and in all cases it should be moderated by keeping the patient in cool air, by giving cold drink, by keeping the body and head erect, by avoiding any blowing of the nose, speaking, or other irritation; and if the blood has flowed for some time without showing any tendency to stop, we are to attempt the suppression of the hemorrhage, by pressing the nostril from which the blood flows, washing the face with cold water, or applying this to some other parts of the body. These <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> Dr Cullen judges to be proper even on the first attacks, and even in young persons where the disease is in the least hazardous; but they will still be more requisite if the disease frequently recurs without any external violence; if the returns happen to persons not disposed\ndisposed to a plethoric habit; and more particularly if no signs of plethora appear in the symptoms preceding the discharge.\n\nWhen the bleeding is so profuse that the pulse becomes weak and the face <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a>, every means must be used to put a stop to it, and that whether the patient be young or old. Besides those methods above mentioned, we must use astringents both internal and external; but the latter are the most powerful, and the choice of these may be left to the surgeon. The internal astringents are either vegetable or fossil; but the vegetable astringents are seldom powerful in the cure of any hemorrhages except those of the alimentary canal. The fossil astringents are more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a>, but differ considerably in strength from one another.\u2014The chalybeates appear to have little strength: the preparations of lead are more powerful; but cannot be employed, on account of their pernicious qualities, unless in cases of the utmost danger. The tinctura saturnina, or antiphtilisica, is a medicine of very little efficacy, either from the small quantity of lead it contains, or from the particular state in which it is. The safest and at the same time the most powerful astringent, seems to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALUM\">alum</a>.\n\nFor suppressing this and other hemorrhages, many superstitious remedies and charms have been used, and said to have been employed with success. This has probably been owing to the mistake of the bystanders, who have supposed that the spontaneous cessation of the hemorrhage was owing to their remedy. At the same time Dr Cullen is of opinion, that such remedies have sometimes been useful, by impressing the mind with horror or dread. Opiates have sometimes proved successful in removing hemorrhages; and when the fulness and inflammatory diathesis of the system have been previously taken off by bleeding, they may, in Dr Cullen's opinion, be used with safety and advantage. Ligatures have been applied upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a>, for retarding the return of the venous blood from the extremities; but their use seems to be ambiguous. In the case of profuse hemorrhages, no care is to be taken to prevent the patient from fainting, as this is often the most certain means of stopping them.\n\nGENUS XXXVII.

On this subject much has been written at almost every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of medicine. And we may refer those readers who wish for a full and extensive view of this interesting subject to a very elaborate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> lately published by Sir John Sinclair, Bart. entitled the Code of Health and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONGEVITY\">Longevity</a>. Here we cannot propose to give even an abridged view of this extensive inquiry; but must content ourselves with offering only a very few general observations.\n\nI. Rules for the Management of Valetudinarians.\n\nThat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the medical system which lays <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> rules for the preservation of health, and prevention of diseases, termed Hygiene, is not to be strictly understood as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> it respected only those people who enjoy perfect health, and who are under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> apprehensions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>, for such seldom either desire <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> attend to medical advice; but is rather considered as relating to valetudinarians, or such as, though not actually sick, may yet have sufficient reason to fear that they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> soon become so: hence it is that the rules must be applied to correct morbid dispositions, and to obviate various particulars which were shown to be the remote or possible causes of diseases.\n\nFrom the way in which the several temperaments are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> mentioned by systematic writers, it should seem as if they meant that every particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> might be referred to one or other of the four; but this is far from being the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, since by much the greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of people have temperaments so indistinctly marked, that it is hard to say to which of the temperaments they belong.\n\nWhen we actually meet with particular persons who have evidently either,\n\n1. Too much strength and rigidity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIBRE\">fibre</a>, and too much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a>;\n2. Too little strength, and yet too much sensibility;\n3. Too much strength, and but little sensibility;\n4. But little sensibility joined to weakness;\n\nwe should look on such persons as more or less in the valetudinary state, who require that these morbid dispositions be particularly watched, lest they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> into preserving those diseases which are connected with the different temperaments.\n\nPeople of the first-mentioned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEMPERAMENT\">temperament</a> being liable to suffer from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> fevers, especially of the inflammatory species, their scheme of preserving health should consist in temperate living, with respect both to diet and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a>: they should studiously avoid immoderate drinking, and be remarkably cautious lest any of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> discharges be checked. People of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> bear evacuations well, especially bleeding: they ought not, however, to lose blood but when they really require to have the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> lessened; because too much of this evacuation would be apt to reduce the constitution to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>-mentioned temperament, in which strength is deficient, but sensibility redundant.\n\nPersons of the second temperament are remarkably prone to suffer from painful and spasmodic diseases, and are easily ruffled; and those of the softer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEX\">sex</a> who have this delicacy of habit, are very much disposed to hysterical complaints. The scheme here should be, to strengthen the solids by moderate exercise, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATHING\">bathing</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CINCHONA\">cinchona</a>, and chalybeate waters; particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> should constantly be had to the state of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGESTIVE\">digestive</a> organs, to prevent them from being overloaded with any species of saburra which might engender flatus, or irritate the sensible membranes of the stomach and intestines, from whence the disorder would soon be communicated to the whole nervous system. Persons of this constitution should never take any of the drastic purges, or strong emetics; neither should they lose blood but in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> of urgent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a>. But a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> share of management, in these extremely irritable constitutions, consists in avoiding all sudden changes of every sort, especially those with respect to diet and clothing, and in keeping the mind as much as possible in a state of tranquillity: hence the great advantages which people of this frame derive from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of medicinal waters drank on the spot, on account of that freedom from care and serious business of every kind, which generally obtains in all the places planned for the reception of valetudinarians.\n\nThe third-mentioned temperament, where there is an excess of strength and but little sensibility, does not seem remarkably prone to any distressing or dangerous species of disease; and therefore it can hardly be supposed that persons so circumstanced will either of themselves think of any particular scheme of management, or have recourse to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> for their instructions: such constitutions, however, we may observe, bear all kinds of evacuations well, and sometimes require them to prevent an over-fullness, which might end in an oppression of the brain or some other organ of importance.\n\nBut the fourth temperament, where we have weakness joined to want of sensibility, is exceedingly apt to fall into tedious and dangerous diseases, arising from a defect of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSORBENT\">absorbent</a> power in the proper sets of vessels, and from languor of the circulation in general; whence corpulency, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DROPSY\">dropsy</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JAUNDICE\">jaundice</a>, and different degrees of scorbutic affection. In order to prevent these, or any other species of accumulation and deprivation of the animal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a>, the people of this constitution should use a generous course of diet, with brisk exercise,\nMeans of exercise, and be careful that none of the secretions be preserving interrupted, nor any of the natural discharges suppressed.\n\nThese constitutions bear purging well, and often require it; as also the use of emetics, which are frequently found necessary to supply the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of exercise, by agitating the abdominal viscera, and are of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> to prevent the stagnation of bile, or the accumulation of mucous humours, which hinder digestion, and clog the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a>. The free use of mustard, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>-radish, and the like sort of stimulating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIETETICS\">dietetics</a>, is serviceable in these torpid habits.\n\nWhen the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of fluids is increased beyond what is conducive to the perfection of health, there arises what the writers <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TERM\">term</a> a plethora, which may prove the source of different diseases; and therefore, when this overfulness begins to produce languor and oppression, care should be taken in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> to reduce the body to a proper standard, by abridging the food and increasing the natural discharges, using more exercise, and indulging less in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a>.\n\nBut in opposite circumstances, where the fluids have been exhausted, we are to attempt the prevention of further waste by the use of strengthening stomachics, nourishing diet, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a> from fatigue of body or mind.\n\nVitiated fluids are to be considered as tainted either with the different kinds of general acrimony, or as betraying signs of some of the species of morbid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> which give rise to particular diseases, such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CALCULUS\">calculus</a>, scurvy, &c.\n\nDuring the state of infancy, we may sometimes observe a remarkable acidity, which not only shows itself in the first passages, but also seems to contaminate the general mass of fluids. As it takes its rise, however, from weak bowels, our views, when we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> to prevent the ill consequences, must be chiefly directed to strengthen the digestive organs, as on their soundness the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> of good chyle depends; and hence small doses of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-RHUBARB\">rhubarb</a> and chalybeats (either the natural chalybeate waters mixed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>, or the murias ammoniae et ferri) in doses of a few grains, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of the child), are to be administered; and the diet is to be so regulated as not to add to this acid tendency: brisk exercise is likewise to be enjoined, with frictions on the stomach, belly, and lower extremities.\n\nWhere the fluids tend to the putrescent state, which shows itself by fetid breath, sponginess and bleeding of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUMS\">gums</a>, a bloated look and livid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a>, the diet then should be chiefly of fresh vegetables and ripe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>, with wine in moderation, due exercise, and strengthening bitters.\n\nWhere acrimony shows itself by itching eruptions, uncommon thirst, and flushing heats, nothing will answer better than such sulphureous waters as the Harrogate and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOFFAT\">Moffat</a>, at the same time using a course of diet that shall be neither acid nor heating.\n\nSo far with respect to those kinds of morbid matter, which do not invariably produce a particular species of disease; but there are others of a specific <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, some of which are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> in the body spontaneously, and seem to arise from errors in diet, or other circumstances of ill management with respect to the animal economy; and hence it is sometimes possible, to a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> if not altogether, to prevent the ill consequences. Thus, there are instances where returns of the gout have been prevented by adhering strictly to a preserving milk diet.\n\nThe rheumatism has also been sometimes warded off by wearing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FLANNEL\">flannel</a> shirt, or by using the cold bath without interruption.\n\nCalculus may be retarded in its progress, and prevented from creating much distress, by the internal use of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOAP\">soap</a> and lime-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, by soap-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LICE\">lice</a> taken in milk or in veal-broth, or by the use of aerated alkaline water, which may perhaps be considered as being both more safe and more efficacious, and at the same time more pleasant than any of the other practices.\n\nThe scurvy may be prevented by warm clothing and perseverance in brisk exercise, by drinking wine or cider, and eating freely of such vegetable substances as can be had in those situations where this disease is most apt to show itself.\n\nIn constitutions where there is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> disposition to the scrophula, if early precautions be taken to strengthen the solids by cold bathing, a nourishing course of diet, and moderate use of wine, the constitution which gives rise to the disease will probably be prevented from producing any very bad effects.\n\nThe other kinds of morbid matter, which are of the specific nature, are received into the body by infection or contagion.\n\nThe infection of a putrid fever or dysentery is best prevented by immediately taking an emetic on the first attack of the sickness or shivering; and if that do not completely answer, let a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> blister be applied between the shoulders: by this method the nurses and other attendants on the sick in the naval hospitals have often been preserved. As to other infectious morbid matter, we must refer to what has already been said when treating of hydrophobia, poisons, gonorrhoea, &c.\n\nThe ill effects which may arise from the different species of saburra, are to be obviated, in general, by the prudent administration of emetics, and carefully abstaining from such kinds of food as are known to cause the accumulation of noxious matters in the first passages.\n\nCrude vegetables, milk, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a>, and other oily substances, are to be avoided by persons troubled with a sourness in the stomach; brisk exercise, especially riding, is to be used, and they are to refrain from fermented liquors: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> drink should be pure water; or water with a very little of some ardent spirit, such as rum or brandy. Seltzer or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYRMONT\">Pyrmont</a> waters are to be drunk medicinally; and aromatic bitters, infusions, or tinctures, acidulated with sulphuric acid, will be found serviceable, in order to strengthen the fibres of the stomach, and promote the expulsion of its contents, thereby preventing the too hasty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERMENTATION\">fermentation</a> of the alimentary mixture. In order to procure immediate relief, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNESIA\">magnesia</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALBA\">alba</a>, or creta praeparata, will seldom fail; the magnesia, as well as the chalk, may be made into lozenges, with a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a> and mucilage; and in that form may be carried about and taken occasionally by people afflicted with the acid saburra.\n\nIn constitutions where there is an exuberance or stagnation of bile, and a troublesome bitterness in the mouth, it is necessary to keep the bowels always free, by taking occasionally small doses of pure aloes, oleum ricini,\nWhen there is a tendency to the empyreumatic and rancid saburra, people should carefully avoid all the various kinds of those oily and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>-seasoned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of diet generally termed made-dishes, and eat sparingly of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> meat, without rich sauces or much gravy; and in these cases the most proper drink is pure water.\n\nII. Rules for those who enjoy perfect Health.\n\nThere can be no doubt, that, in general, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEMPERANCE\">temperance</a> is the true foundation of health; and yet the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> physicians, as we may see in the rules laid down by Celsus, did not scruple to recommend indulgence now and then, and allowed people to exceed both in eating and drinking; but it is safer to proceed to excess in drink than in meat; and if the debauch should create any extraordinary or distressing degree of pain or sickness, and a temporary fever should ensue, there are two ways of shaking it off, either to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a> and encourage perspiration, or to get on horseback, and by brisk exercise restore the body to its natural state. The choice of these two methods must always be determined by the peculiar circumstances of the parties concerned, and from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> which they may before have had which agrees best with them.\n\nIf a person should commit excess in eating, especially of high-seasoned things, with rich sauces, a draught of cold water, acidulated with sulphuric acid, will take off the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> at the stomach, and assist digestion by moderating and keeping within bounds the alimentary fermentation, and thus preventing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a> of too much flatus. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a> of ices may be here of real service at the tables of the great, as producing similar effects with the cold water acidulated. Persons in these circumstances ought not to lay themselves down to sleep, but should keep up and use gentle exercise until they are sensible that the stomach is unloaded, and that they no longer feel any oppressive weight about the precordia.\n\nIf a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> be obliged to fast, he ought, if possible, during that time, to avoid laborious work: after suffering severe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUNGER\">hunger</a>, people ought not at once to gorge and fill themselves; nor is it proper, after being overfilled, to enjoin an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> fast: neither is it safe to indulge in a state of total rest immediately after excessive labour, nor suddenly fall hard to work after having been long without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>: in a word, all changes should be made by gentle degrees; for though the constitution of the human body be such that it can bear many alterations and irregularities without much danger; yet, when preserving the transitions are extremely sudden, there is a great risk of producing some degree of disorder.\n\nIt is also the advice of Celsus to vary the scenes of life, and not confine ourselves to any settled rules: but as inaction renders the body weak and listless, and exercise gives vigour and strength, people should never long omit riding, walking, or going abroad in a carriage. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FENCING\">Fencing</a>, playing at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TENNIS\">tennis</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DANCING\">dancing</a>, or other similar engagements, which afford both exercise and amusement, as each shall be found most agreeable or convenient, are to be used in turn, according to the circumstances and tendency to any particular species of disease. But when the weakness of old age shall have rendered the body incapable of all these, then dry frictions with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRUSH\">brush</a> will be very requisite to preserve health, by accelerating the flow of humours through the smallest orders of vessels, and preventing the fluids from stagnating too long in the cellular interstices of the fleshy parts.\n\nSleep is the great restorer of strength; for, during this time, the nutritious particles appear to be chiefly applied to repair the waste, and replace those that have been abraded and washed off by the labour and exercise of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>; but too much indulgence in sleep has many inconveniences, both with respect to body and mind, as it blunts the senses, and encourages the fluids to stagnate in the cellular membrane; whence corpulency, and its necessary consequences languor and weakness.\n\nThe proper time for sleep is the night, when darkness and silence naturally bring it on: sleep in the daytime, from noise and other circumstances, is in general not so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> or refreshing; and to some people is really distressful, as creating an unusual giddiness and languor, especially in persons addicted to literary pursuits. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">Custom</a>, however, frequently renders sleep in the day necessary; and in those constitutions where it is found to give real refreshment, the propensity to it ought to be indulged, particularly in very advanced age.\n\nWith regard to the general regimen of diet, it has always been held as a rule, that the softer and milder kinds of aliment are most proper for children and younger subjects: that grown persons should eat what is more substantial; and old people lessen their quantity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> food, and increase that of their drink both of the diluent and cordial kind.

The SCARLET FEVER with Ulcerated Sore Throat.\n\nScarlatina anginosa. Withering on the Scarlet Fever.\n\nThe mild scarlet fever is described by Sydenham, who tells us that he can scarce account it a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>; and indeed nothing more seems to be necessary in the treatment of it than an antiphlogistic regimen, avoiding the application of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> and cold drink. The disease, however, often runs epidemically, and is attended with very alarming symptoms, in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> it is called scarlatina anginosa.\u2014The best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of this distemper has been published by Dr Withering in the year 1778. This disease made its appearance, we are told, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BIRMINGHAM\">Birmingham</a> and the neighbouring villages, about the middle of May 1778. It <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> in all its force and frequency to the end of October; varying, however, in some of its symptoms, as the air grew colder. In the beginning of November it was rarely met with; but towards the middle of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>, when the air became warmer, it increased again, and in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> resumed those appearances it possessed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> months, but which it had lost during the cold winds in October.\n\nIt affected children more than adults; but seldom occurred in the former under two years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> in the latter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they had passed their fiftieth year.\n\nDescription. With various general symptoms of fever, the patient at first complains of a dejection of spirits, a slight soreness or rather stiffness in the neck, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of straitness in the muscles of the neck and shoulders, as if they were bound with cords. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> of the fever this soreness in the throat increases, and the patients find a difficulty in swallowing; but the difficulty seems less occasioned by the pain excited in the attempt, or by the straitness of the passage, than by an inability to throw the necessary muscles into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>. The skin feels hot and dry, but not hard; and the patients <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> frequent, small pungent pains, as if touched with the point of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NEEDLE\">needle</a>. The breath is hot and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> to the lips, and thirst makes them wish to drink; but the tendency to sickness, and the exertions necessary in deglutition, are so unpleasant, that they seldom care to drink much at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>. They have much uneasiness also from want of rest during the night. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> of the third day, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a>, neck, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>, appear redder than usual; in a few hours this redness becomes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a>; and increases to such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of intensity, that the face, body, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a>, resemble a boiled lobster in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, and are evidently swollen. Upon pressure the redness vanishes, but soon returns again. The skin is smooth to the touch, nor is there the least appearance of pimples or pustules. The eyes and nostrils partake more or less of the general redness; and in proportion to the intensity of this colour in the eyes, the tendency to delirium prevails.\n\nThings continue in nearly this state for two or three days longer, when the intense scarlet gradually abates, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> colour succeeds, and the skin becoming rough, peels off in small scales. The tumefaction subsides at the same time, and the patients gradually recover their strength and appetite.\n\nDuring the whole course of the disease, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULSE\">pulse</a> is quick, small, and uncommonly feeble, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-URINE\">urine</a> small in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a>; the sub-maxillary glands somewhat enlarged and painful to the touch. The velum <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PENDULUM\">pendulum</a> palati, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UVULA\">uvula</a>, the tonsils, and gullet, as far as the eye can reach, partake of the general redness and tumefaction; but although collections of thick mucus, greatly resembling the specks or sloughs in the putrid sore throat, sometimes occur, yet these are easily washed off; and real ulcerations of those parts were never observed.\n\nThese are the most usual appearances of this disorder; but it too frequently assumes a much more fatal form. In some children the delirium commences in a few hours after the first attack; the skin is intensely hot; the scarlet colour appears on the first or second day, and they die very early on the third. Others again, who survive this rapid termination, instead of recovering, as is usual about the time the skin begins to get its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> colour, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> into a kind of lingering, and die at last in the course of six or eight weeks.\n\nIn adults, circular livid spots were frequently observed about the breast, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-KNEES\">knees</a>, and elbows; also <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> blotsches of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>, and others of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> intermixed, and often changing places.\n\nIn the month of October, when the air became colder, the scarlet colour of the skin was both less frequent and less permanent. Many patients had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> appearance of it at all; while others, especially adults, had a few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> red pimples, crowned with white pellucid heads. The inside of the throat was considerably tumefied; its colour a dull red, sometimes tending to a livid. The pulse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> in general 130 or 140 strokes in a minute; was small, but hard, and sometimes sufficiently so to justify the opening of a vein; and the blood thus taken away, in every instance, when cool, appeared sify, and the whole crustamentum firm.\n\nHappy would it be, Dr Withering observes, if the baneful influence of this disorder terminated with the febrile symptoms. But in ten or fifteen days from the cessation of the fever, and when a complete <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a> might be expected, another train of symptoms occurs, which at last frequently terminate fatally. The patients, after a few days amendment, feel a something that prevents their farther approach to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>.\nExanthemata; an unaccountable languor and debility prevail; a stiffness in the limbs, an accelerated pulse, disturbed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a>, disrelish to food, and a scarcity of urine. These symptoms, we are told, are soon succeeded by swellings of a real dropsical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, forming sometimes an anaesareca, and on other occasions an ascites; and not unfrequently scarlatina has proved fatal, from supervening hydrothorax in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EFFUSION\">effusion</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEST\">chest</a>. It is unnecessary to remark, that when this happens, a fatal termination is more sudden than from any other modification of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DROPSY\">dropsy</a>.\n\nDr Withering, after examining the accounts given of this disease by different authors, proceeds to the diagnosis. It may be distinguished, he observes, from the petechial fever, by the eruption in the latter appearing seldom before the fourth day, by the regularity and distinctness of the spots, and by its principally occupying the neck, the back, and the loins. On the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, in the scarlet fever, the eruption generally appears about the third day; and consists either of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> blotches, or else one continued redness, which spreads over the face and the whole body.\n\nIn the fever called purpura, the pustules are prominent, keep their colour under pressure, and never appear early in the disease; whereas in the scarlet fever, the eruption appears more early, is not prominent, but perfectly smooth to the touch, and becomes quite white under pressure.\n\nAlthough the purple fever and scarlatina may be connected by some general cause, yet our author takes occasion to observe, that they cannot be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> modifications of the same eruption: for examples occur, he says, of the same person being first seized with one of these disorders, and afterwards with the other; but he never met with an instance of the same person having the scarlet fever twice; and he believes it to be as great an improbability as a repetition of the smallpox.\n\nThis disorder is particularly distinguished from the measles, we are told, by the want of that cough, watery eye, and running at the nose, which are known to be the predominant symptoms in the early state of the measles, but are never known to exist in the scarlatina.\n\nFrom the erysipelas this disease is distinguishable, by the limited seat of the former; together with its not being contagious.\n\nThe cynanche maligna, however, is, according to Dr Withering, more difficult to distinguish from this disease than any other; and yet the distinction is, he thinks, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of the greatest importance, as the method of treatment, according to him, ought to be extremely different.\u2014Although, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of circumstances, these two diseases bear a very great resemblance, yet, with a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, the one may in general, he thinks, be distinguished from the other. From Dr Fothergill's account of the sore throat attended with ulcers, our author has made out the following characteristic circumstances of the two diseases, contrasted to one another.\n\n| Scarlatina Anginosa. | Angina Gangrenosa. |\n|---------------------|-------------------|\n| Season. Summer . . Autumn. | Season. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">Spring</a> . . Winter. |\n\nIt is not pretended, Dr Withering remarks, that all the above contrasted symptoms <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be met with in every case. It is enough, he observes, that some of them appear; and that if, conjoined with the consideration of the prevailing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>, they enable us to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of treatment which will most contribute to the relief of the sick.\n\nBut notwithstanding the attention which Dr Withering has bestowed upon this subject, we are still decidedly of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that the disease which he has so accurately described under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of scarlatina anginosa, is in reality the same affection with the malignant ulcerous sore throat of Huxham and Fothergill. During different epidemics, this disease, like smallpox and measles, in different seasons, is considerably varied in its appearance. But still there occurs such a similarity as clearly marks the sameness of the affection. And indeed this; as in the case of the smallpox, is abundantly demonstrated by infection from one contagion giving protection against succeeding ones, although the appearances be much varied. This has particularly appeared at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, where the disease has of late prevailed as an epidemic on five different years, viz. 1774-75, 1782-83, 1789-92, 1797-98, and 1804-5. During the first of these occasions, in the greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of patients, the sore throats were of a very gangrenous and malignant nature: during the second, the disease more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> appeared under the form of what might be called simple scarlatina: and during the other epidemics, the contagion was, if we may be allowed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>, of an intermediate nature. But it is farther to be remarked, that during every one of those epidemics, when several children of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> were at the same time subjected...\nsubjected to the infection, in one the disease would have been attended with almost all the symptoms mentioned in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> of *scarlatina anginosa*, with respect to skin, eyes, throat, breath, bowels, termination of the affections, &c. In another, would have occurred all the symptoms with respect to those particulars which he has mentioned under the column of *angina gangrenosa*. While at the same time, in numberless instances, even in the same patient, the disease at its commencement has shown evident marks of an inflammatory, and at its termination of a putrid tendency. And there cannot be a doubt, that both the *scarlatina anginosa* of Withering, and the *cyanche maligna*, as described by Fothergill and Huxham, have occurred in every season and situation, and have affected persons of every age and constitution not before subject to either disease.\n\n**Causes.**\n\n1. Dr Withering affirms, that the immediate cause of this disease is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POISON\">poison</a> of a peculiar kind communicable by contagion.\n\n2. That this poison first takes possession of the mucous membrane lining the fauces and the nose; and either by its action upon the secretory glands, or upon the mucus itself, assimilates that mucus to its own nature.\n\n3. That it is from this beginning, and from this only, that it spreads to the stomach, &c., and at length acts upon the system at large.\n\n4. That its first action upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NERVES\">nerves</a> is of a sedative or debilitating nature.\n\n5. That in consequence of certain laws of the nervous system, when the debilitating effects operate upon the sensorium commune, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REACTION\">reaction</a> takes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>; and that this reaction is, *ceteris paribus*, proportioned to the debilitating power.\n\n6. That, in consequence of this reaction of the nervous system, the vibratory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CAPILLARY\">capillary</a> blood-vessels dependant thereon is greatly increased; an unusually large quantity of blood is accumulated in those vessels; the heart and large blood-vessels are deprived of their customary proportion; and hence, though stimulated to more frequent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a>, the pulse must necessarily be feeble.\n\n7. That as violent exertions are followed by debility, upon the cessation of the fever, the capillary vessels, which had acted with such unusual violence, are left in a state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> debility, and are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> in recovering their tone; hence it is that so many patients afterwards become dropsical.\n\nDr Withering next proceeds to the consideration of the different remedies which either are at present in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>, or have been recommended as proper in this disease:\n\n**Cure.**\n\nBlood-letting has been recommended by authors; but such was the state of the pulse in this disorder, at least during the summer months, that it was not in any instance thought advisable to take away blood. In some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, indeed, where the fiery redness of the eyes seemed to demand the use of leeches, they were had recourse to, but never with any advantage. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARVEST\">harvest</a> months, when the pulse was more firm, and when suffocation seemed to be threatened from the swelling in the fauces, blood-letting was sometimes advised; but still with less advantage than one would have expected in almost any other situation.\n\n**Vomiting.** This, Dr Withering observes, seems to be the remedy of nature; and he is surprised how it should have been omitted by several authors who have gone before him. Vomiting, he says, most amply fulfils the indications arising both from a consideration of the cause and of the effects; and a liberal use of the remedy he holds forth as the true foundation for successful practice in scarlet fever and sore throat. His common form of emetic is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of tartar emetic and ipecacuanha, given in pretty smart doses; and these are to be repeated at least once in 48 hours, and in the worst cases so often as twice in 24 hours.\n\n**Purgings.** The action of purgatives is considered by Dr Withering as altogether repugnant to the curative indications in this disease: for the poisons, as formerly remarked, being received into the system by the fauces, the operation of a purge, instead of discharging it, can only promote its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFUSION\">diffusion</a> along the alimentary canal; and, in fact, we are told, that when even a spontaneous purging supervenes in this disease, the patients sink so amazingly fast, that it is not within the reach of art to support them. When, however, a considerable quantity of acrid matter passing from the fauces into the stomach, makes its way to the rectum, a considerable degree of looseness often takes place. And although evacuations from the system in general by means of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHARTICS\">cathartics</a> may be hurtful, yet patients often obtain great relief from a free discharge of this matter; and by discharging it, purgatives have the effect even of preventing an evacuation from the system, which would otherwise take place.\n\n**Sudorifics. Cordials. Alexipharmics.** None of these remedies were found beneficial. With respect to cordials, Dr Withering observes, that although they seem to be indicated by the great loss of strength and feeble pulse, yet the certain consequence of their use always was, an increase of restlessness, of the delirium, and of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>.\n\n**Diuretics.** These were found very beneficial. The vegetable fixed alkali is recommended as the most proper article of this kind: a dram or two may be easily swallowed every 24 hours, by giving a small quantity in every thing the patient drinks. Diuretics, however, have been found principally serviceable, by practitioners in general, in those cases where the urine is observed to be scanty, and where dropsical symptoms have taken place.\n\n**<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CINCHONA\">Cinchona</a>.** No medicine, we are told, ever had a fairer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> in any disease than the Peruvian bark had in this epidemic; for the feeble pulse, great prostration of strength, with here and there a livid spot, were thought to be such undeniable evidences of a putrid tendency, that cinchona was poured <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> not with a sparing hand. But this was only at first; for these livid spots and the sloughs in the throat being found to be the effects of inflammation instead of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUTREFACTION\">putrefaction</a>, and the bark instead of diminishing, rather increasing these symptoms, it was at last entirely laid aside by Dr Withering in his practice. But although cinchona may not have been successful with a particular epidemic at a particular place; yet from the concurring testimony of many practitioners, it is very commonly\nExanthemata are found to be productive of good effects; and there is perhaps no remedy on which greater dependence is in general put, particularly in the advanced periods of the disease, where the fever is considerable.\n\nUpon the same principles that cinchona was prescribed, fixable air was at first likewise advised, but with no evident effects either way or another. Dulcified <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a> were also had recourse to, but with no advantage.\n\nOpiates.] These, although recommended by some authors for the removal of inquietude and watchfulness, yet in this epidemic, instead of effecting these purposes, always increased the distress of the patient.\n\nBlisters.] In the summer appearance of the disease, blisters were universally detrimental; they never failed to hasten the delirium; and if the case was of the worst kind, they too often confirmed its fatal tendency. But although this may have been the case during the epidemic which Dr Withering describes, it has by no means been generally observed. On the contrary, by the early application of blisters to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> fauces, both the glandular swellings and likewise the discharge from the mouth and fauces have been much diminished; and practitioners have believed, not without probable reason, that the after-affections of the throat were less considerable than would otherwise have been the case.\n\nInjected gargles of contrayerva decoction, sweetened with oxymel of squills, &c. were found very beneficial in bringing always large quantities of viscid ropy stuff from the fauces.\n\nThe immersion of the feet and legs in warm water, although it did no harm, yet did not either procure sleep or abate the delirium, as it frequently does in other kinds of fever.\n\nAs in summer it was found difficult to keep the patients sufficiently cool, they were ordered to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> upon a mattress instead of a feather-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a>; a free circulation of air was kept up; and where the patients strength would admit of it, they were ordered frequently out of doors. Animal food and fermented liquors were denied them, and nothing allowed but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEA\">tea</a>, coffee, chocolate, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILK\">milk</a> and water, gruel, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-BARLEY_WATER\">barley-water</a>, and such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a>.\n\nWith respect to the dropsical disorder which so frequently succeeds to this complaint, it was never observed, Dr Withering remarks, when the preceding symptoms had been properly treated.\n\nWhen called upon to patients in the dropsical state, he began his practice by a dose of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CALOMEL\">calomel</a> at night, and a purgative in the morning. When a febrile pulse attended the other symptoms, emetics were useful, as well as the saline draughts and other neutral salts. When great debility, comatose or peripneumonic symptoms occurred, blisters were found very serviceable: but when dropsical symptoms were the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> cause of complaint, small doses of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-RHUBARB\">rhubarb</a> and calomel were advised; recourse was also had to diluted solutions of fixed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALKALIES\">alkalies</a>, squills, Seltzer waters, and other diuretics.\n\nWhen the urine flows freely, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a> and other tonics are recommended; together with gentle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>-seasoned food, wine, and the wearing of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FLANNEL\">flannel</a> in contact with the skin.\n\nDr Withering concludes his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSAY\">essay</a> with an enumeration of several cases, treated according to the principles above laid down. The successful termination of these cases demonstrates the propriety of the practice which he has recommended; at least for the epidemic under the form in which it then appeared.\n\nSince Dr Withering's publication, two other practices have obtained considerable celebrity in this disease. The one is dashing cold water on the surface of the body in the manner recommended by Dr Currie in proper fevers. It is, however, very certain that although this may obviate symptoms, and particularly diminish the heat when very urgent, yet it never produces an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> termination of the disease as some have alleged. When the contagion of scarlatina is introduced into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> body, never before subjected to the disease, it must, like smallpox and measles, run a certain course, and the attention of the practitioner must merely be employed in endeavouring to render that course as mild as he can, principally by obviating urgent symptoms.\n\nThe other remedy lately introduced, and highly commended in scarlatina anginosa, is the oxygenated muriatic acid. This has been particularly extolled by Mr John Ayrey Braithwaite, surgeon at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANCASTER\">Lancaster</a>. One dram of the oxygenated muriatic acid is mixed with eight ounces of distilled water. This quantity he directs to be taken by a patient at the age of puberty every day. But the quantity must be regulated by the age and situation of the patient. This remedy also is very useful as obviating symptoms, particularly the affection of the throat. But with this intention we have often employed it with great advantage.\n\nGENUS XXXIII. URTICARIA.","sp":385,"ep":388},{"h":"SCOLIUM","t":"66.

When the lever is rectilineal and with equal arms, we have \\(AF = FB = AJ = BF\\); and also \\(m = n = 0\\), so that, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the last formula is suited to these conditions, we shall have the formula of \u00c6pinus.\n\nPROP. VI.\n\n67. If a power and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> acting upon the arms of any lever be in equilibrio, and if the whole be put in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, the velocity of the power is to the velocity of the weight as the weight is to the power.\n\nLet \\(AFB\\) be any lever whose fulcrum is \\(F\\), and let the power \\(P\\) and weight \\(W\\) be applied to its extremities \\(A, B\\), so as to be in equilibrio. Draw \\(FM, FN\\) perpendicular to \\(<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-AD\">AD</a>, BE\\) the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of the forces \\(P, W\\). Then suppose an uniform angular motion to be given to the lever, so as to make it describe the small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> \\(AFA'\\), the position of the lever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> now be \\(A'FB'\\), and the directions of the forces, \\(P, W\\) will be \\(A'D', B'E'\\), <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to \\(AD, BE\\) respectively, since the angle \\(AEF\\) is exceedingly small. Join \\(<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AA\">AA</a>', BB'\\), and from \\(A'\\) and \\(B'\\) draw \\(A'x, B'y\\) perpendicular to \\(AD\\) and \\(BE\\). Now it is obvious, that though the point \\(A\\) has moved through the space \\(AA'\\) in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> that the point \\(B\\) has described the space \\(BB'\\), yet \\(A'x\\) is the space described by \\(A\\) in the direction \\(AD\\), and \\(B'y\\) the space described by \\(B\\) in the direction \\(BE\\).\n\nFor if we suppose a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> passing through \\(A\\) at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> to \\(AD\\), and another through \\(P\\) parallel to the former plane, it is manifest that \\(A'x\\) <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> the approach of the point \\(A\\) to the plane passing through \\(P\\); and for the same reason \\(B'y\\) measures the approach of the point \\(B\\) to a plane passing through \\(W\\) at right angles to \\(WB\\). Therefore \\(A'x, B'y\\) represent the spaces uniformly and simultaneously described by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> \\(A, B\\), and may therefore be taken to denote the velocities of these points (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DYNAMICS\">Dynamics</a> \u00a7 14); consequently the velocity of \\(A\\): the velocity of \\(B = A'x : B'y\\).\n\nNow, in the triangles \\(AxA', FMA'\\), the exterior angle \\(xAF = A'MF + mF\\), \\(A\\) (Euclid, B. I. Prop. 32.) and \\(A'AF = AMF\\), because \\(AFA'\\) is so exceedingly small that \\(A'A\\) is sensibly perpendicular to \\(AF\\); consequently \\(xAA' = AE.m\\); and as the angles at \\(x\\) and \\(m\\) are right, the triangles \\(AA'x, AMF\\) are similar (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">Geometry</a>, Theor. XX. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">Sect</a>. IV.).\n\nTherefore, \\(A'x : AA' = FM : FA\\), and in the similar triangles \\(AFA', BFB', AA': BB' = FA : FB\\); and in the similar triangles \\(BB'x, BFm, BB': Bx = FB : FM\\), therefore by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> we have \\(A'x : Bx = FM : FM\\).\n\nBut by Proposition II. \\(P : W = FM : FM\\), consequently \\(A'x : Bx = W : P\\), that is, the velocity of the power is to the velocity of the weight as the weight is to the power. Q. E. D.\n\n68. COR. Since \\(A'x : Bx = W : P\\) we have \\(A'x \\times P = Bx \\times W\\), that is, the momenta of the power and weight are equal.\n\nSECT. II. On the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-INCLINED_PLANE\">Inclined Plane</a>.\n\n69. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-DEFINITION\">DEFINITION</a>. An inclined plane is a plane surface \\(<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">AB</a>\\), supported at any angle \\(ABC\\) formed with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> plane \\(BC\\). The inclination of the plane is the angle which one line in the plane \\(AB\\) forms with another in the horizontal plane \\(BC\\), both these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> being at right angles to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> intersection of the two planes.\u2014The line \\(BA\\) is called the length of the plane, \\(AC\\) its height, and \\(BC\\) the length of its base.\n\n70. In order to understand how the inclined plane acts as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> power, let us suppose it necessary to elevate the weight \\(D\\) from \\(C\\) to \\(A\\). If this weight is lifted by the arms of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> to the point \\(A\\), he must support the whole of the load; but when it is rolled up the inclined plane, a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of its weight is supported upon the plane, and therefore a much smaller force is capable of raising it to \\(A\\).\n\nPROP. I.\n\n71. When any weight \\(W\\) is kept in equilibrio upon an inclined plane by a power \\(P\\), the power is to the weight as the sine of the plane's inclination is to the sine of the angle which the direction of the power makes with a line at right angles to the plane.\n\nLet \\(MN\\) be the inclined plane, \\(<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">NO</a>\\) a horizontal line, and \\(MNO\\) the inclination of the plane, and let the weight \\(W\\) be sustained upon \\(MN\\) by means of the power \\(P\\) acting in the direction \\(AE\\). From the point \\(A\\), the centre of gravity of the weight, draw \\(AB\\) perpendicular to the horizontal plane \\(ND\\), and \\(AF\\) perpendicular to \\(MN\\); produce \\(EA\\) till it meets the plane in \\(C\\), and from the point \\(F\\) where the body touches the plane draw \\(FM\\) at right angles to \\(AC\\), and \\(FN\\) at right angles to \\(AB\\). Then, since the whole body may be considered as collected in the centre of gravity \\(A\\), \\(AB\\) will be the direction in which it tends to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> the direction of the weight, and \\(EA\\) is the direction of the power; but \\(AF\\) is a lever whose fulcrum is \\(F\\), and since it is acted upon by two forces which are in equilibrio, we shall have (Art. 59.) \\(P : W = FM : FM\\), that is, as the perpendiculars drawn from the fulcrum to the direction in which the forces <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a>. Now \\(FA\\) being radius, \\(FM\\) is the sine of the angle \\(FAB\\), and \\(FN\\) is the sine of the angle \\(FAC\\); but \\(FAB\\) is equal to \\(MNO\\) the angle of the plane's inclination, on account of the right angles at \\(F\\) and \\(B\\) and the vertical angles at \\(D\\); and \\(FAC\\) is the angle which the direction of the power makes with a line perpendicular to the plane; therefore \\(P : W\\).\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MECHANICS\">Mechanics</a>.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">Theory</a>. As the sine of the plane's inclination, is to the sine of the angle formed by the direction of the power with a line at the right angles to the plane.\n\n72. Cor. 1. When the power acts parallel to the plane in the direction AE', P is to W as EA to EN; that is, as radius is to the sine of the plane's inclination, or on account of the similar triangles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAN\">FAN</a>, MNO, as the length of the plane is to its height. In this case the power acts to the greatest advantage.\n\n73. Cor. 2. When the power acts in a vertical line A', FM becomes equal to or coincides with FN, and we have P : W = FN : FN, that is, the power in this case sustains the whole weight.\n\n74. Cor. 3. When the power acts parallel to the base of the plane in the direction AC, P : W = FN : FN = FN : AN.\n\n75. Cor. 4. When the power acts in the direction AF' perpendicular to the plane, it has no power to resist the gravity of the weight; for the perpendicular from the fulcrum F, to which its energy is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a>, vanishes.\n\n76. Cor. 5. Since the body W acts upon the plane in a direction AF perpendicular to the plane's surface, (for its force downwards may be resolved into two, one parallel to the plane, and the other perpendicular to it), and since the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REACTION\">reaction</a> of the plane must also be perpendicular to its surface (Dynamics \u00a7 149.), that is, in the direction FA, then, when the direction of the power is AE parallel to the horizon, the power, the weight, and the pressure upon the plane, will be respectively as the height, the base, and the length of the plane. The weight W is acted upon by three forces; by its own gravity in the direction AN, by the reaction of the plane in the direction AF', and by the power P in the direction AF. Therefore, since these forces are in equilibrio, and since AF' is parallel to FN, and FN to AN, the three sides AF', AF', FN, will represent the three forces (Dynamics \u00a7 144.). But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a> AFN is similar to ANF, that is, to MNO, for it was already shewn that the angle nAF is equal to MNO, therefore, since in the triangle AFN, AF represents the pressure on the plane, AF the weight of the body, and FN the energy of the power, these magnitudes will also be represented in the similar triangle MNO by the sides MN, MO, NO.\n\n77. Cor. 6. If a power P and weight W are in equilibrio upon two inclined planes, AB, AC; P : W = AB : AC. Let p be the power, which acting on the weight W in a direction parallel to the plane would keep it in equilibrio, then we have p : W = AD : AC; but since the string is equally stretched at every point, the same power p will also sustain the power P, consequently P : p = AB : AD, and by composition P : W = AB : AC.\n\nProp. II.\n\n78. If a spherical body is supported upon two inclined planes, the pressures upon these planes will be inversely as the sines of their inclination, while the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> weight of the body is represented by the sine of the angle formed by the two planes.\n\nLet AC, BC be the two inclined planes, and F the spherical body which they support. The whole of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> being supposed to be collected in its centre of gravity F, its tendency downwards will be in the vertical line FO. The reaction of the planes upon F is evidently in the direction MF, NF perpendicular to the surface of these planes, and therefore we may consider the body F as influenced by three forces acting in the directions FC, FM, FN; but these forces are represented by the sides of the triangle ABC perpendicular to their directions, (Dynamics \u00a7 144.), consequently the absolute weight of the body F, the pressure upon the plane AC, and the pressure upon the plane BC, are respectively as AB, AC, and BC, that is, as the sines of the angles ACD, ABC, BAC, for in every triangle the sides are as the sines of the opposite angles, or to express it in symbols, W being the absolute weight of the body, w the pressure on AC, and w' the pressure on BC,\n\n\\[ W : w : w' = AB : AC : BC, \\text{ or} \\]\n\n\\[ W : w : w' = \\sin \\angle ACB : \\sin \\angle ABC : \\sin \\angle BCA. \\]\n\nBut on account of the parallels AB, DF, the angle ABC = BCF, and BAC = ACD, therefore the pressures upon the planes are inversely as the sines of their inclination, the absolute weight of the body being represented by the sine of the angle formed by the surfaces of the two planes.\n\n79. Cor. 1. Since the two sides of a triangle are greater than the third, the sum of the relative weights supported by the two planes is greater than the absolute weight of the body.\n\n80. Cor. 2. If the inclination of each plane is 60\u00b0, then ACB must also be 60\u00b0, and the triangle ABC equilateral, consequently the pressure upon each plane is equal to the absolute weight of the body.\n\n81. Cor. 3. When the inclination of each plane increases, the pressure which each sustains is also increased; and when their inclination diminishes till it almost vanishes, the pressure upon each plane is one half of the absolute weight of the body F.\n\nProp. III.\n\n82. If a body is raised with an uniform motion along an inclined plane, the velocity of the power is to the velocity of the weight as the weight is to the power.\n\nLet the weight W be drawn uniformly up the inclined plane AB, from B to D, by a power whose direction is parallel to DH. Upon DB describe the circle BFEDN, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> BC in E, and having produced HD to F, join FP, FB, FE, and draw DC perpendicular to BD. Now the angles BFD, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">BED</a> are right (Geometry, Sect. II. Theor. 17.), and therefore, though the power moves through a space equal to BD, yet its velocity in the direction DH is measured by the space FD uniformly described; and for the same reason, though the weight W describes the space BD, yet its velocity in the direction in which it acts, that is, in a vertical direction, is evidently measured by the space DE uniformly described. Then because the triangle DBE is equal to DEF, (Geometry, Sect. II. Theor. 15.) and DBE = DCH, (Geometry, Sect. IV. Theor. 23.) and FDE = DHC, (Geometry, Sect. I. Theor. 21.)\nthe triangles DFE, DHC are similar, and (Geometry, Sect. IV, Theor. 20.) DF : DE = DH : HC.\n\nBut DH : HC = sin. DCH : sin. HDC, that is, (art. 71.) DF : DE, or the velocity of the power to the velocity of the weight, as W : P. Q. E. D.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCHOLIUM\">Scholium</a>.\n\n83. The inclined plane, when combined with other machinery, is often of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> in the elevation of weights. It has been the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of some writers, that the huge masses of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> which are found at great altitudes in the splendid remains of Egyptian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a>, were raised upon inclined planes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, with the aid of other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICAL_POWERS\">mechanical powers</a>. This supposition, however, is not probable, as the immense blocks of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANITE\">granite</a> which compose the pyramids of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a> could not possibly have been raised into their present situation by any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of the mechanical powers with which we are acquainted.\u2014The inclined plane has been very advantageously employed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Bridgewater's canal. After this canal has extended 40 miles on the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a>, it is joined to a subterraneous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a> about 12 miles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> by means of an inclined plane, and this subterraneous portion is again connected by an inclined plane with another subterraneous portion about 106 feet above it. This inclined plane is a stratum of stone which slopes one foot in four, and is about 453 feet long. The boats are conveyed from one portion of the canal to another by means of a windlass, so that a loaded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a> descending along the plane turns the axis of the windlass, and raises an empty boat.\u2014A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of stairs, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> that is not level, may be regarded as inclined planes; and hence it is a matter of great importance, in carrying a road to the top of a hill, to choose such a line that the declivity may be the least possible. The additional length, which, in order to effect this purpose, must sometimes be given to the line of road, is a trifling inconvenience, when compared with the advantages of a gentle declivity.\n\nSect. III. On the Rope Machine.\n\n84. Definition. When a body suspended by two more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROPES\">ropes</a>, is sustained by powers which act by the assistance of these ropes, this assemblage of ropes is called a rope machine.\n\nProp. I.\n\n85. If a weight is in equilibrium with two powers acting on a rope machine, these powers are inversely as the sines of the angles which the ropes form with the direction of the weight.\n\nLet the weight W be suspended by the point B, where the ropes AB, BC are joined, and let the powers P, p acting at the other extremities of the ropes which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> over the pulleys A, C, keep this weight in equilibrium, we shall have \\( P : p = \\sin. DBE : \\sin. ABD \\).\n\nProduce WB to F, and let BD represent the force exerted by W; then by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> DE parallel to AB, the sides of the triangle BDE will represent the three forces by which the point B is solicited (Dynamics, \u00a7 144.), for AB, CB are the directions of the forces P and p. We have therefore \\( P : p = DE : BE \\); but\n\nDE : BE = sin. DBE : sin. BDE, and on account of the parallels DE, AB, the angle BDE = ABD, consequently \\( P : p = \\sin. DBE : \\sin. BDE \\).\n\nCor. 1. When the line joining the pulleys is horizontal, as AC, then \\( P : p = FC : FA \\), for FC and FA are evidently the sines of the angles DBE, BDE.\n\nCor. 2. Any of the powers is to the weight, as the sine of the angle which the other makes with the direction of the weight, is to the sine of the angles which the powers make with one another. For since DB represents the weight, and BE the power P, we have \\( BE : BD = \\sin. BDE : \\sin. BED \\); but on account of the parallels DE, AB, the angle DEB = ABC, the angle made by the direction of the powers, consequently \\( BE : BD \\), that is, \\( p : W = \\sin. ABF : \\sin. ABC \\).\n\nIn the same way it may be shown that \\( P : W = \\sin. CBF : \\sin. ABC \\). Hence we have \\( P + p : W = \\sin. CBF + \\sin. ABF : \\sin. ABC \\), that is the sum of the powers is to the weight, as the sum of the sines of the angles which the powers make with the direction of the weight is to the sine of the angle which the powers make with one another.\n\nCor. 3. The two powers P, p, are also directly proportional to the cosecants of the angles formed by the direction of the powers with the direction of the weight. For since \\( P : p = \\sin. DBE : \\sin. BDE \\), and by the principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIGONOMETRY\">trigonometry</a>, \\( \\sin. DBE : \\sin. DBE = \\csc. BDE : \\csc. DBE \\), we have \\( P : p = \\csc. ABF : \\csc. CBF \\). It is also obvious that \\( P : p \\) as the secants of the angles which these powers form with the horizon, since the angles which they make with the horizon are the complements of the angles which they form with the direction of the weight, and the cosecant of any angle is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECANT\">secant</a> of its complement, therefore \\( P : p = \\sec. BAF : \\sec. BCF \\).\n\nChap. II. On <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">Compound</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACHINES\">Machines</a>.\n\n89. Definition. Compound machines are those which are composed of two or more simple machines, either of the same or of different kinds. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of compound machines is unlimited, but those which properly belong to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a>, are, 1. The wheel and axle; 2. The pulley; 3. The wedge; 4. The screw; and, 5. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a>.\n\nSect. I. On the Wheel and Axle.\n\n90. The wheel and axle, or the axis in peritrochion, fig. 10, is represented in fig. 9, and consists of a wheel AB, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a> CD, having the same axis, and moving upon pivots E, F, placed at the extremity of the cylinder. The power P is most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> applied to the circumference of the wheel, and acts in the direction of the tangent, while the weight W is elevated by a rope which coils round the cylinder CD in a plane perpendicular to its axis.\u2014In this machine a winch or handle EH is sometimes substituted instead of the wheel, and sometimes the power is applied to the levers S, S fixed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIPHERY\">periphery</a> of the wheel; but in all these forms the principle of the machine remains unaltered.\u2014That the wheel and axle is an assemblage of levers will be obvious, by considering that the very same effect would be produced if a number of levers were to ra-\nTheory. diate from the centre C, and if a rope carrying the power P were to pass over their extremities, and extricate itself from the descending levers when they come into a horizontal position.\n\n91. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-AXIOM\">Axiom</a>. The effect of the power to turn the cylinder round its axis, is the same at whatever point in the axle it is fixed.\n\nProp. I.\n\n92. In the wheel and axle the power and weight will be in equilibrium, when they are to one another reciprocally as the radii of the circles to which they are applied, or when the power is to the weight as the radius of the axle is to the radius of the wheel.\n\nLet AD be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> of the wheel, and BE a section of the axle or cylinder, and let the power P and weight W act in the directions AP, WP, tangents to the circumferences of the axle and wheel in the points A, B; by means of ropes winding round these circumferences. As the effect is the same according to the axiom, let the power and weight act in the same plane as they appear to do in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, then it is obvious that the effort of the power P and weight W will be the same as if they were suspended at the points A, B; consequently the machine may be regarded as a lever AFB, whose centre of motion is F. But since the directions of the power and weight make equal angles with the arms of the lever, we have (Art. 36.) \\( P : W = FB : FA \\), that is, the power is to the weight as the radius of the axle is to the radius of the wheel.\n\nCorollaries.\n\n93. Cor. 1. If the power and weight act obliquely to the arms of the lever in the directions AP, BW, draw FM Fn perpendicular to AP and BW, and as in the case of the lever (Art. 51.) there will be an equilibrium when \\( P : W = FM : Fn \\). Hence the tangential direction is the most advantageous one in which the power can be applied, for FA is always greater than FM, and the least advantageous direction in which the weight can be applied, for it then opposes the greatest resistance to the power.\n\n94. Cor. 2. If the plane of the wheel is inclined to the axle at any angle \\( x \\), there will be an equilibrium when \\( P : W = \\text{semidiameter of the axle} : \\sin x \\).\n\n95. Cor. 3. When the thickness of the rope is of a sensible magnitude, there will be an equilibrium when the power is to the weight as the sum of the radius of the axle, and half the thickness of its rope, is to the sum of the radius of the wheel and half the thickness of its rope; that is, if T be the thickness of the rope of the wheel, and t the thickness of the rope of the axle, there will be an equilibrium when \\( P : W = FB + \\frac{t}{2} : FA + \\frac{T}{2} \\).\n\n96. Cor. 4. If a number of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHEELS\">wheels</a> and axles are so combined that the periphery of the first axle may act on the periphery of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> wheel, either by means of a string or by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a> fixed in the peripheries of each, and the periphery of the second axle on the periphery of the third wheel, there will be an equilibrium when the power is to the weight as the product of the radii of all the axles is to the product of the radii of all the wheels. This corollary may be demonstrated by the same reasoning which is used in Art. 63. for the combination of Levers.\n\n97. Cor. 5. In a combination of wheels, where the motion is communicated by means of teeth, the axle is called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PINION\">pinion</a>. Since the teeth therefore must be nearly of the same size, both in the wheel and pinion, the number of teeth in each will be as their circumferences, or as their radii; and consequently in the combination mentioned in the preceding corollary, the power will be to the weight, in the case of an equilibrium, as to the product of the number of teeth in all the pinions is to the product of the number of teeth in all the wheels.\n\nProp. II.\n\n98. In the wheel and axle the velocity of the weight is to the velocity of the power as the power is to the weight.\n\nIf the power is made to rise through a space equal to the circumference of the wheel, the weight will evidently describe a space equal to the circumference of the axle. Hence, calling V the velocity of the power, v that of the weight, C the circumference of the wheel, and c that of the axle, we have \\( V : v = C : c \\). But by the proposition \\( P : W = c : C \\) therefore \\( P : W = v : V \\).\n\nScholium.\n\n99. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of the main-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> box of the fusee of a watch round which the chain is coiled, is a beautiful illustration of the principle of the wheel and axle. The spring-box may be considered as the wheel, and the fusee the axle or pinion to which the chain communicates the motion of the box. The power resides in the spring wound round an axis in the centre of the box, and the weight is applied to the lower circumference of the fusee. As the force of the spring is greatest when it is newly wound up, and gradually decreases as it unwinds itself, it is necessary that the fusee should have different radii, so that the chain may act upon the smallest part of the fusee when its force is greatest, and upon the largest part of the fusee when its force is least, for the equable motion of the watch requires that the inequality in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the spring should be counteracted so as to produce an uniform effect. In order to accomplish this, the general outline of the surface of the fusee must be an Apollonian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPERBOLA\">hyperbola</a>, in which the ordinates are inversely as their respective abscissae. For further information on this subject, see Recherches des Mathemat. par M. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">Parent</a>, tom. ii. p. 678.; Trait\u00e9 d'Horlogerie, par M. Berthoud, tom. i. chap. 26.; and Trait\u00e9 de M\u00e9canique, par M. de la Hire, prep. 72.\n\nSect. II. On the Pulley.\n\n100. Definition.\u2014The pulley is a machine composed of a wheel with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GROOVE\">groove</a> in its circumference, and a rope which passes round this groove. The wheel moves on an axis whose extremities are supported on a kind of frame called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLOCK\">block</a>, to which is generally suspended the weight to be raised. A system of pulleys is called a machine, which is either fixed or moveable according as the block which contains the pulley is fixed or moveable.\n101. In a single pulley, or system of pulleys where the different portions of the rope are parallel to each other, and where one extremity of it is fixed, there is an equilibrium when the power is to the weight as unity is to the number of the portions of the rope which support the weight.\n\n102. Case 1. In the single fixed pulley AA let the power P and weight W be equal, and act against each other by means of the rope PBAW, passing over the pulley AA; then it is obvious that whatever force is exerted by P in the direction PBA, the same force must be exerted in the opposite direction WBA, consequently these equal and opposite forces must be in equilibrium; and as the weight is supported only by one rope, the proposition is demonstrated; for \\( P : W = 1 : 1 \\).\n\n103. Case 2. In the single moveable pulley, where the rope, fastened at H, goes beneath the moveable pulley D and over the fixed pulley C, the weight to be raised is suspended from the centre of the pulley D by the block p, and the power is applied at P in the direction PE. Now it is evident that the portions CFp, HGD of the rope sustain the weight W, and as they are equally stretched in every point, each must sustain one half of W; but (Case 1.) in the single pulley C the rope CEP sustains a weight equal to what the rope CFp sustains; that is, it sustains one-half of W. Consequently \\( P = \\frac{1}{2} W \\), or \\( W = 2P \\), when there is an equilibrium; and since the weight W is supported by two strings, we have \\( P : W = 1 : 2 \\).\n\n104. Case 3. When the same rope passes round a number of pulleys, the ropes which support the weight W are evidently equally stretched in every part, and therefore each of them sustains the same weight. Consequently if there be ten ropes supporting the weight, each sustains \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\)th part of the weight, and therefore \\( P = \\frac{1}{10} W \\), or \\( W = 10P \\), which gives us \\( P : W = 1 : 10 \\).\u2014The pulley in fig. 15. is the patent pulley invented by Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">White</a>, in which the lateral friction and shaking motion is considerably removed.\n\nProp. II.\n\n105. In a system of n moveable pulleys suspended by separate and parallel ropes, there is an equilibrium when \\( P : W = 1 : 2^n \\); that is, if there are 4 pulleys \\( n = 4 \\), and \\( P : W = 1 : 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\), or \\( P : W = 1 : 16 \\).\n\nThis system is represented in fig. 17. where the rope which carries the power P passes over the fixed pulley M, and beneath the moveable pulley A, to the hook E, where it is fixed. Another rope fixed at A passes over B and is fixed at F, and so on with the rest. Then by Art. 103.\n\n\\[\nP : \\text{the weight at } A = 1 : 2 \\\\\n\\text{The weight at } A : \\text{the weight at } B = 1 : 2 \\\\\n\\text{The weight at } B : \\text{the weight at } C = 1 : 2 \\\\\n\\text{The weight at } C : \\text{the weight at } D \\text{ or } W = 1 : 2^3 \\text{ and therefore by composition} \\\\\nP : W = 1 : 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\text{ or } P : W = 1 : 16. Q. E. D.\n\\]\n\nProp. III.\n\n106. In a system of moveable pulleys whose number is n, suspended by separate and parallel ropes, whose extremities are fixed to the weight W, there is an equilibrium when \\( P : W : 1 : 2^n - 1 \\).\n\nIn this system of pulleys, the rope which sustains the power P passes over the pulley C, and is fixed to the weight at D. Another rope attached to the pulley C passes over the pulley B and is fixed to the weight at E, and a third rope fastened to B passes over A and is fixed at F. Then it is manifest that the rope CD sustains a weight equal to P; and since the pulley C is pulled downward with a weight equal to \\( 2P \\), the rope BC must support a weight equal to \\( 2P \\), and the rope B the same weight; consequently the rope AB sustains \\( 4P \\). The whole weight therefore is \\( P + 2P + 4P \\), and hence \\( P : W = P + 2P + 4P \\), or \\( P : W = 1 : 1 + 2 + 4 + \\ldots + n \\) terms, so that \\( P : W = 1 : 2^n - 1 \\).\n\nProp. IV.\n\n107. In the system of pulleys represented in fig. 19. fig. 19. and called a Spanish barton, in which two pulleys are supported by one rope, there is an equilibrium when \\( P : W = 1 : 4 \\).\n\nIn this combination of pulleys, the rope AB which supports the power P passes over the moveable pulley A, and beneath C towards H, where it is fixed. Another rope, attached to the pulley A, passes over the fixed pulley B, and is fastened at E to the pulley C, which supports the weight W. Then, since the rope AP supports 1 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a>, the rope AC also supports 1 pound, and therefore the pulley A, or the rope BA, is pulled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> with a force of 2 pounds. But the rope BDE is equally stretched with BA, consequently the pulley C, to which DE is attached, is pulled upwards with a force of 2 pounds. Now the rope AC supporting 1 pound, the rope GH must likewise support 1 pound, consequently, since DE sustains 2 pounds, AC 1 pound, and HG 1 pound, they will together sustain W = 4 pounds, and therefore \\( P : W = 1 : 4 \\).\n\nProp. V.\n\n108. In the system of pulleys represented in fig. Fig. 20. called a Spanish barton, where two pulleys are supported by one rope, there is an equilibrium when \\( P : W = 1 : 5 \\).\n\nIn this system the rope PB passes over B round C, and is fixed at E. Another rope attached to B passes round AF and is fixed at I to the pulley CD, which carries the weight W. Now the rope BP being stretched with a force of 1 pound, the ropes BGC, CDE are also stretched with a force of 1 pound each, and the pulley CD is pulled upwards with a force of 2 pounds. But since the three ropes BP, ED, and GC, are each stretched with a force of 1 pound, the pulley B and the rope BA, upon which they all act in one direction, must be pulled down with a force of 3 pounds. Now the rope FI is equally stretched with BA, consequently it will draw the pulley CD upwards with a force of 3 pounds.\nMechanics.\n\nTheory. pounds, and since it is drawn upwards by the ropes CG, DF, with a force of two pounds, the whole force will sustain W = 5 pounds; but this force of 5 pounds is by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> in equilibrium with P or 1 pound, consequently P : W = 1 : 5.\n\nProp. VI.\n\nPlate CCCXIX. fig. 1.\n\n109. When the ropes are not parallel, and when two powers are in equilibrium with a weight by means of a pulley, and have their directions at equal angles to the direction of the weight, each of these powers is to the weight as the radius of the pulley is to the chord of that portion of the pulley's circumference with which the rope is in contact.\n\nLet the weight W suspended from C be sustained in equilibrium by two powers, P, p, which act by a rope PCFE, passing over the pulley CHEF, and touching the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> CFE of its circumference. Then since the angles PWD, pWD are equal, and the powers P, p in equilibrium, P must be equal to p; and making WA = WB, and drawing AI parallel to PW, and BI parallel to pW; WB, BI, WI will respectively represent the forces P, p, W or P : p : W = WB : BI : WI.\n\nDynamics, Art. 144. Now the triangles WBI, BDE having their respective sides at right angles to each other, are similar; consequently WB : BI : WI = CD : DE : EC, that is, P : p : W = CD : DE : EC; but CD, DE are equal to radius, and EC is obviously the chord of the arch CFE, therefore P : W or p : W as radius is to the chord of the arch with which the rope is in contact.\n\n110. Cor. 1. Any of the powers is also to the weight as radius is to twice the cosine of the angle which either rope makes with the direction of the weight. For since CG is the cosine of DCG, and since CE is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> of CG, CE is equal to 2 cosine DCG = 2 Cos. PWD; but P : W = CD : CE, hence we have by substituting the preceding value of CE, P : W = CD or radius : 2 Cos. PWD.\n\nScholium.\n\n111. By means of this proposition and corollary, the proportion between the powers and the weight in the various systems of pulleys, represented in figs. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, when the ropes are not parallel, may be easily found.\n\nProp. VII.\n\n112. In a system of moveable pulleys, where each has a separate rope, and where the ropes are not parallel, there is an equilibrium when the power is to the weight as radius is to the cosines of half the angles made by the rope of each pulley, multiplied into that power of 2 whose exponent is the number of pulleys.\n\nLet the power P sustain the weight W by means of the pulleys A, B, C; let P, p, \u03c0 be the different powers which support the pulleys, A, B, C, and let MAP, NBA, RCB be the angles formed by the ropes. Then, by the last proposition,\n\n\\[ P : p = \\text{rad.} : 2 \\cos. MAP \\]\n\\[ p : \\pi = \\text{rad.} : 2 \\cos. NBA \\]\n\\[ \\pi : W = \\text{rad.} : 2 \\cos. RCB, \\text{ consequently} \\]\n\\[ P : W = \\text{rad.} : 2 \\cos. MAP \\times 2 \\cos. NBA \\times 2 \\cos. RCB, \\]\n\nor, which is the same thing,\n\n\\[ P : W = \\text{rad.} : 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times \\cos. MAP \\times \\cos. NBA \\times \\cos. RCB. \\]\n\nProp. VIII.\n\n113. In a single pulley, or in a combination of pulleys, the velocity of the power is to the velocity of the weight as the weight is to the power.\n\n114. Case 1. In the single fixed pulley, it is obvious, that if the weight W is raised uniformly one inch, the power D will also describe one inch, consequently velocity of P : velocity of W = W : P.\n\n115. Case 2. In the single moveable pulley, when the weight W is raised one inch, the ropes become one inch shorter; and since the rope has always the same weight, the power must describe two inches, therefore velocity P : velocity W = W : P.\n\n116. Case 3. In the combination of pulleys, in figs. 14, 15, 16, when the weight rises one inch, each of the four strings becomes an inch shorter, so that P must describe four inches, as the length of the rope is invariable; consequently velocity P : velocity W = W : P.\n\n117. Case 4. In the system exhibited in fig. 17, it is evident, that when the weight W rises one inch, the rope DC is lengthened two inches, the rope CB four inches, the rope BA eight inches, and the rope AFP, to which the power is suspended, 16 inches; so that since the power of this pulley is as 16 to 1, we have velocity P : velocity W = W : P.\n\n118. Case 5. In the combination of pulleys, represented in fig. 18, when the weight W rises one inch, all the three ropes CD, BE, AF are each shortened one inch. But while CD shortens one inch, CP becomes one inch longer; while BE shortens one inch, BC becomes one inch longer, and CP two inches longer (art. 110.); and while AF shortens one inch, AB becomes one inch longer, BC two inches longer, and CP four inches longer; therefore CP is lengthened altogether <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> inches, and as the power of the pulley is as 7 to 1, we have, as before, velocity P : velocity W = W : P.\n\n119. Case 6. In the system of pulleys called the Spanish barton, fig. 19, when the weight W rises one inch, the three ropes AC, DE, HG are each shortened one inch. By the shortening HG, CA one inch each, the rope AP is lengthened two inches; and by the shortening of DE one inch, BA is lengthened one inch, and AP two inches (art. 115.); consequently since AP is lengthened in all four inches, and since the power of the pulleys is four, we have velocity P : velocity W = W : P.\n\n120. Case 7. In the other Spanish barton, in fig. 20, when the weight is elevated one inch, the three ropes DE, IF, CG are each one inch shorter. While ED, and CG shorten one inch each, BP is lengthened two inches,","sp":69,"ep":74},{"h":"SPITTING OF BLOOD","t":"H\u00e6moptysis, Sauv. gen. 240. Lin. 179. Vog. 84. Sag. gen. 175.

Sometimes, however, at the very first, the blood comes up with coughing, or at least somewhat of coughing, and accompanies the hawking above mentioned.\n\nThe blood is often at first in very small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a>, and soon disappears; but in other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, especially when it frequently recurs, it is in greater quantity, and often continues to appear at times for several days together. It is sometimes profuse, but rarely in such quantity as either by its excess or by a sudden suffocation to prove immediately mortal.\n\nIt is not always easy to discover whether the blood evacuated by the mouth proceeds from the internal surface of the mouth itself, from the fauces or adjoining cavities of the nose, from the stomach, or from the lungs. It is, however, very necessary to distinguish these different cases; and for this Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CULLEN\">Cullen</a> offers the following considerations.\n\n1. When the blood proceeds from some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the internal surface of the mouth, it comes out without any hawking or coughing; and generally, upon inspection, the cause is evident.\n\n2. When blood proceeds from the fauces, or adjoining cavities of the nose, it may be brought out by hawking, and sometimes by coughing. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, there may be a doubt concerning its real source, and the patient may be allowed to please himself with the thoughts that the blood does not come from the lungs. But the physician must remember that the lungs are much more frequently the source of a hemorrhage than the fauces. The latter seldom happens but to persons who have before been liable to a hemorrhage from the nose, or to some evident cause of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EROSION\">erosion</a>; and in most cases, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> into the fauces, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTILLATION\">distillation</a> of the blood from thence <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be perceived.\n\n3. When blood proceeds from the lungs, the manner in which it is brought up will commonly show from whence it comes; but, independent of that, it may also be known from the causes of h\u00e6moptysis from the lungs, to be afterwards mentioned, having preceded.\n\n4. When vomiting accompanies the throwing out of blood from the mouth, we may generally know the source from whence it proceeds, by considering that blood does not proceed so frequently from the stomach as from the lungs: that blood proceeding from the stomach commonly appears in greater quantity than from the lungs. The pulmonary blood also is usually of a florid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, and mixed with a little frothy mucus.\nmucus only; but the blood from the stomach is of a darker colour, more grumous, and mixed with the other contents of the stomach. The coughing or vomiting, as the one or the other happens first to arise, may sometimes point out the source of the blood; and this has also its peculiar antecedent signs and causes.\n\nCauses, &c. A haemoptysis may be produced at any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> by external violence; and, in adult persons, while the arterial plethora prevails in the system, i.e., from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of 16 to 35, a haemoptysis may at any time be produced merely by a plethoric state of the lungs. More frequently, however, it arises from a faulty proportion between the capacity of the lungs and that of the rest of the body. Thus it is often an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>, which implies a peculiar and faulty conformation.\n\nThis disease especially happens to persons, who discover the smaller capacity of their lungs by the narrowness of their chest, and by the prominence of their shoulders; which last is a mark of their having been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> liable to a difficulty of respiration. In such cases, too, the disease very frequently happens to persons of a sanguine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEMPERAMENT\">temperament</a>, in whom particularly the arterial plethora prevails. It happens also to persons of a slender delicate make, of which a long neck is a mark; to persons of much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRRITABILITY\">irritability</a>, and therefore of quick parts; to persons who have formerly been liable to hemorrhages from the nose; to those who have suffered a suppression of any usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HAEMORRHAGE\">haemorrhage</a>, the most frequent instance of which is in females who have suffered a suppression of their menstrual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLUX\">flux</a>; and, lastly, to persons who have suffered the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AMPUTATION\">amputation</a> of a limb.\n\nAll this constitutes the predisponent cause of haemoptysis; and the disease may happen merely from the predisponent cause arising to a considerable height. But in those who are already predisposed, it is often brought on by the concurrence of various occasional and exciting causes. One of these, and perhaps a frequent one, is external heat; which, even when in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> great degree, brings on the disease in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>, and the beginning of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, while the heat rarefies the blood more than it relaxes the solids, which had before been contracted by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> of winter. Another exciting cause is a sudden diminution of the weight of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>, especially when concurring with any effort in bodily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a>. The effort alone, may often be the exciting cause in those who are already predisposed; and more particularly any violent exercise of respiration. In the predisposed, also, the disease may be occasioned by any degree of external violence.\n\nPrognosis. Haemoptysis may sometimes be no more dangerous than a haemorrhage from the nose; as when it happens to females, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of a suppression of their menses; when, without any marks of predisposition, it arises from external violence; or, from whatever cause it may proceed, when it leaves no cough, dyspnoea, or other affection of the lungs, behind it. But, even in these cases, a danger may arise from too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> a wound being made in the vessels of the lungs, from any quantity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> blood being led to stagnate in the cavity of the bronchiae, and particularly from any determination of the blood being made into the vessels of the lungs, which by renewing the haemorrhage may have these consequences.\n\nCure. In the treatment of this disease, with a view of stopping the discharge, it is first necessary to have recourse to those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> which tend to diminish the impetus by which the blood is expelled. This is to be effected by a removal of plethora when it exists; by diminishing the general impetus of circulation; by diminishing local increased <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> when it takes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in the vessels of the lungs; and by producing a determination of blood to other parts of the system remote from the lungs. But besides practices diminishing impetus, it is often also necessary to employ such as augment the resistance to the passage of blood through the ruptured vessels of the lungs. With these views a variety of practices may be employed, particularly blood-letting, refrigerants, sedatives, astringents, and the like.\n\nOn this subject Dr Cullen differs from those who prescribe chalybeates and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CINCHONA\">cinchona</a> in the cure of haemoptysis. Both of these, he observes, contribute to increase the phlogistic diathesis then prevailing in the system, and the haemoptysis from predisposition is always accompanied with such a diathesis. Instead of these, therefore, he recommends blood-letting in greater or smaller quantity, and more or less frequently repeated as the symptoms shall <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a>. At the same time cooling purgatives are to be employed, and every part of the antiphlogistic regimen is to be strictly enjoined. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> Medical Observations, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of nitre is greatly recommended by Dr Dickson, to whom its efficacy was made known by Dr Letherland, physician to St Thomas's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">Hospital</a>. The most commodious method of exhibiting it he found was in an electuary. Four ounces of conserve of roses were made into an electuary with half an ounce of nitre; of which the bulk of a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NUTMEG\">nutmeg</a> was directed to be given, four, six, or eight times a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, according to the urgency of the case. The good effects of this, he tells us, have often astonished him: and when given early in the disease, he says he can depend as much upon it for the cure of an haemoptysis, as on cinchona for the cure of an intermittent. He agrees with Dr Cullen, however, that in those cases where there is any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULSE\">pulse</a>, and which almost always happens, there is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> for venesection. A cool regimen, and quiet of body and mind, are certainly useful; but Dr Cullen observes that some kinds of gestation, such as sailing, and travelling in an easy carriage on smooth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a>, have often proved a remedy. When the cough is very troublesome, it is absolutely necessary to exhibit frequently a small dose of an opiate. Dr Dickson also informs us, that the nitre joined with spermaceti, or pulv. tragacanth. comp., has produced equally good effects with the electuary above mentioned; in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of which he at first considered the conserve only as a vehicle for the nitre, though he means not to insinuate that the former is totally destitute of efficacy.\n\nWhen this haemorrhage has resisted other modes of cure, and there is reason to apprehend, even from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> quantity of blood evacuated, that the patient may sink under the discharge, blisters, particularly when applied to the breast, are often had recourse to with great advantage; and the sulphuric acid, properly diluted,","sp":393,"ep":394},{"h":"ST MICHAEL'S","t":"a borough town of Cornwall, between St Columb and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRURO\">Truro</a>, 247 miles from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>.

From the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, which the waters of\ncertain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a> possess, of depositing a large earthy sedi-\nment, either in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AQUEDUCTS\">aqueducts</a> through which they are\nconveyed, or in the vessels in which they are boiled or\npreserved, it was conjectured, that in passing through\nthe kidneys, and especially whilst retained in the blad-\nder, they would let <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> their grosser particles, which\nby the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPOSITION\">apposition</a> of fresh matter, connected\nby the animal gluten, and compacted by the muscular\naction of that organ, would in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> form a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CALCULUS\">calculus</a> suf-\nficiently large to produce a train of the most excruciat-\ning symptoms. And this reasoning a priori has been\nsupposed to be confirmed by facts and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>; for\nnot to mention the authority of Hippocrates, Dr Lister\nhas observed, that the inhabitants of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> are peculiar-\nly subject to the stone in the bladder. Nicholas de Bleg-\nny has related the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of one who was dissected at\nParis, in whom the pylorus, a great part of the duode-\nnum, and the stomach itself, were found incrustated\nwith a stony matter, to the thickness of a finger's\nbreadth. And it is well known, that the water of the\nriver <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEINE\">Seine</a>, with which that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> is supplied, is so im-\npregnated with calcareous matter, as to incrustate, and\nin a short time to choke up, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PIPES\">pipes</a> through which\nit runs. But on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> it is objected, that the\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> calculus is of animal origin, and by chemical\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a> appears to bear very little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> to the stony\nconcretions of water; and though it be allowed, that\nmore persons are cut for the stone in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOSPITALS\">hospitals</a> at\nParis than in most other places; yet upon inquiry it is\nfound, that many of those patients come from different\nprovinces, and from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> and villages far distant from\nthe Seine.\n\nDr Percival conjectures, that though this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> may\nchiefly depend upon a peculiar disposition to concrete\nEpitheses in the animal fluids, which in many instances is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a>, and in no instance can with certainty be imputed to any particular cause; yet hard water is at least negatively favourable to this diathesis, by having no tendency to diminish it. The urine of the most healthy person is generally loaded with an apparently terrous matter, capable in favourable circumstances of forming a calculus; as is evident from the thick crust which it deposits on the sides of the vessels in which it is contained. And it seems as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> intended by this excretion to discharge all the superfluous salts of the blood, together with those earthy particles, which are either derived from our aliment, and fine enough to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LACTEALS\">lacteals</a>, though insuperable by the powers of circulation, or which arise from the abrasion of the solids, or from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> globular part of our fluids. Now water, whether used as nature presents us with it, or mixed with wine, or taken under the form of beer or ale, is the great diluter, vehicle, and menstruum, both of our food, and of the saline, earthy, and excrementitious parts of the animal juices. And it is more or less adapted to the performance of these offices, in proportion to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of purity. For it must appear evident to the most ordinary understanding, that a menstruum already loaded, and perhaps saturated with different contents, cannot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> so powerfully as one which is free from all sensible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-IMPREGNATION\">impregnation</a>. Nor is this reasoning founded upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> alone; for it is observed, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALVERN\">Malvern</a> water, which issues from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORCESTERSHIRE\">Worcestershire</a>, remarkable for its uncommon purity, has the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of dissolving the little salubrious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> which are often voided in nephritic complaints. And the solution too, which is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of its being complete, is perfectly colourless. Hence this water is drunk with great advantage in disorders of the urinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a>. And during the use of it, the patient's urine is generally limpid, and seldom deposits any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a> sediment. Yet notwithstanding this appearance of transparency, it is certainly at such times loaded with impurities, which are so diluted and dissolved as not to be visible. For it is attended with a strong and fetid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a>, exactly resembling that of asparagus. Hoffman mentions a pure, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, simple water in the principality of Henneberg, in Germany, which is remarkable for its efficacy in the stone and gravel; and a water of similar virtues was discovered not many years ago in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK_FOREST\"><a class=\"xr</a>ef\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">Black</a> forest, near Osterod, which upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> did not afford a single grain of mineral matter. Indeed it is worthy of observation, that most of the springs which were formerly held in great esteem, and were called holy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELLS\">wells</a>, are very pure, and yield little or no sediment.\n\nDr Percival informs us that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANCHESTER\">Manchester</a>, who had been long subject to nephritic complaints, and often voided small stones, was advised to refrain from his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PUMP\">pump</a>-water, which is uncommonly hard, and to drink constantly the soft water of a neighbouring spring; and that this change alone, without the use of any medicine, has rendered the returns of his disorder much less frequent and painful. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a> also, much affected with the gravel, was induced by the perusal of the first edition of Dr Percival's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a>, to try the effect of soft water; and by the constant use of it remained two years entirely free from her disorder.\n\nIn nephritic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, distilled water would be an excellent substitute for Malvern water, as the following experiment evinces.\n\nTwo fragments of the same calculus nearly of equal weight, were immersed, the one in three ounces of distilled water, the other in three ounces of hard pump-water. The phials were hung up <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> together in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KITCHEN\">kitchen</a>-chimney, at a convenient distance from the fire. After 14 days maceration, the calculi were taken out, and carefully dried by a very gentle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>. The former, viz. that which had been immersed in distilled water, was diminished in its weight a grain and a half; the latter had lost only half a grain.\n\nIt is the passage of these calculi from the kidneys <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> into the bladder, which occasions the pain, vomiting, and other symptoms, that constitute what is usually termed a fit of the gravel or stone.\n\nWhen an inflammation is actually raised, the disease is known by the name of nephritis, and has been already treated of.\n\nAs soon as the stone passes through the ureter, and falls into the bladder, the pain and other nephritic symptoms cease; and every thing will remain quiet, either till the stone be carried into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-URETHRA\">urethra</a>, or until it has remained long enough in the bladder to acquire weight sufficient to create new distress.\n\nIf a stone happen to be smooth and of a roundish form, it may lie in the bladder and acquire considerable bulk before it can be perceived by the patient; but when it is angular, or has a rugged surface, even though it may be small in size, yet it seldom fails to raise pain, and occasion bloody urine, or the discharge of a slimy fluid, with tenesmus, and difficulty in making water.\n\nThere have been various attempts made to dissolve the stone; and there are certainly some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> which have this effect when applied to them out of the body; but the almost total impossibility of getting these conveyed to the kidneys, renders it extremely doubtful whether a solvent ever will be discovered. Of all the articles employed for this purpose, no one perhaps has had greater reputation than fixed alkaline <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> in its caustic state, particularly under the form of the lixivium causticum, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AQUA\">aqua</a> potassae, as it is now called: but this being of a very acrid nature, it requires to be well sheathed by means of some gelatinous or mucilaginous vehicle. Veal-broth is as convenient as any for this purpose; and accordingly it is used by those who make a secret of the caustic alkali as a solvent of calculus.\n\nMr Blackrie, who has taken much pains in this inquiry, has proved very satisfactorily, that Chitrick's nostrum is no other than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOAP\">soap</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LICE\">lice</a> given in veal-broth, which the patients send every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a>, who returns it mixed up with the medicine, in a close vessel secured by a lock.\n\nIt is not every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, however, that either requires or will bear a course of the caustic alkali. Some calculi are of that soft and friable nature, that they will dissolve even in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> water; and there are cases wherein it appears that the constant use of some very simple decoction or infusion of an insignificant vegetable, has brought away large quantities of earthy matter, in flakes which apparently have been united together in layers to form a stone. Dr Macbride assures\nEposes us, that a decoction of raw coffee, only 30 berries in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUART\">quart</a> of water, boiled till it acquired a deep greenish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, taken <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> and evening to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of eight or ten ounces, with ten drops of sweet spirit of nitre, had the powerful effect of bringing away, in the course of about two months, as much earthy matter in flakes as filled a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEA\">tea</a>-cup. The patient was far advanced in years; and, before he began this decoction, had been reduced to great extremities by the continuance of pain and other distressing symptoms: he was purged occasionally with oleum ricini.\n\nVery lately the alkali in a mild state, and in a different form, has been much used by many calculous patients, and with great advantage, under the form of what is called alkaline aerated water, the aqua supercarbonatis potassae of the present edition of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> Pharmacopoeia. For the introduction of this medicine, or at least for its extensive use, we are chiefly indebted to the ingenious physician Dr William Falconer of Bath. He has lately published an account of the Aqua Mephitica Alkalina, or solution of fixed alkaline salt, saturated with fixable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, in calculous disorders; which contains a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of cases strongly supporting the benefit to be derived from it. But whether the good effects obtained in these instances are to be explained from its operating as a solvent of calculi, seems to be extremely doubtful. There are indeed cases in Dr Falconer's treatise, of patients in whom, after using it for a considerable time, no stone could be detected by sounding, although it had been discovered in that way before they began the employment of it. But in many instances, the relief has been so sudden, that it may be concluded, that notwithstanding the ease obtained, the calculus still remained. In such cases, it probably removed from the urine that quality by which it gives to the calculus fresh accretions, producing that roughness of its surface by which it is chiefly capable of acting as a stimulus. For the distressing symptoms resulting from stone are chiefly to be attributed to the inflammatory and spasmodic affections which it induces; and when its surface is least capable of operating as a stimulus, these of course will be least considerable. It is therefore not improbable, that this remedy produces relief, by preventing fresh additions being made to the calculus.\n\nAn infusion of the seeds of daucus sylvestris sweetened with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a>, is another simple and much celebrated remedy; it has been found to give considerable ease in cases where the stomach could not bear any thing of an acrid nature. The leaves of the uva ursi were strongly recommended by the late celebrated De Haen; and this, whatever its way of operating may be, seems to have been productive of good effects in some instances. There is no reason to believe that it has any influence in dissolving calculi; and indeed it seems to be chiefly useful in these instances where ulcerations take place in the urinary passages.\n\nIn the Edinburgh Medical Commentaries, vol. iii., we have an account of a method used by the inhabitants of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARABIA\">Arabia</a> Petraea for curing the stone, to which they are very much subject, and which the author (an English gentleman of experience and candour) affirms he has seen frequently performed with success. By means of a catheter, they inject into the bladder a weak ley of alkali with the purified fat of a sheep's tail, and Dysuria, a proper quantity of opium, all put together. Their catheters are made of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>; and in performing the operation they introduce them quite into the bladder; so that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> is safely conveyed to the stone without hurting any other part. But when a stone is situated in the kidney, they have no method of cure.\n\nIf this method of curing by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INJECTION\">injection</a> could be safely practised, it would no doubt have the advantage over that of taking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALKALIES\">alkalies</a> by the mouth, where the medicine is not only much weakened, but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of the patient runs the risk of being greatly injured. But from some experiments mentioned in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the Medical Transactions, and still more from the chemical analysis of urinary concretions, lately published by Fourcroy and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> chemists, it appears that the human calculi are very different from one another in their natures. Some, for instance, will easily yield to an alkaline menstruum, and very little to an acid; while others are found to resist the alkali, and yield to the acid; and some are of such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a> nature, that they yield neither to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a> nor alkalies. An <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, however, to the fragments, scales, or films, which the stone may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> off, and also to the contents and sediment of the urine, may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> to the discovery of what solvent is proper, or whether the stone can be dissolved by any. To use either alkalies or acids improperly may be hurtful; though there may be such kinds of calculi as demand the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> use of acids and alkalies; nay, there may be found calculi of opposite kinds in the same subject.\n\nIn such cases as will not allow us to think of dissolving the stony concretions, and where the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> is to palliate and procure ease from time to time, little more can be done than to keep the bowels open occasionally by some gentle cathartic, and wash off as much of the loose gravelly matter and slime as can be removed by such mild diuretic infusions and decoctions as shall be found to pass freely and sit well on the stomach. Persons afflicted with the stone should be careful in respect of their diet, and studiously avoid all heavy and flatulent food, as well as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> sauces that are apt to turn rancid. For the same reason, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a> and acids are to be shunned; for these often create heartburning, and every thing that offends the stomach raises the nephritic pain; such is the sympathy that obtains between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIGESTIVE\">digestive</a> and the uropoietic organs.\n\nThere have been surgeons bold enough to entertain an idea of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> even into the kidney, in order to extract a stone: this, however, except in cases where an abscess has been formed, and nature <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> out the way, is both very uncertain and very hazardous. But cutting into the bladder for the same purpose, is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> and well known operation, and often crowned with success. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>, however, of this operation belongs to the article <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SURGERY\">Surgery</a>, to which we refer; and here shall only make this remark, that a surgeon should never begin his operation, until he and his assistants are perfectly satisfied, from actually feeling the stone, that there is one in the bladder; because it has sometimes happened, that when the incision has been made, no stone could be found: and the patient having died in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the operation, and the\nWhen a dysuria proceeds from any acrimonious matter thrown into the blood, it may be readily cured by bleeding, emollient oysters, cooling and diluting drinks with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUM\">gum</a> arabic or gum tragacanth, linseed tea, or the warm bath. When it arises from inflammations of the bladder or parts adjoining to it, we are to regard it only as a symptomatic affection; and the remedies used to remove the primary disease will also remove the dysuria. Sometimes it may arise from an ulcer of the bladder; in which case it is generally incurable; a mild nutritious diet will, however, protract the patient's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>; and even render that life tolerable, by alleviating symptoms.\n\n**GENUS CXXV.

The last case it is very difficult, or even impossible, to cure; as proceeding from scirrhus, or other indissoluble tumors of the verumontanum, or the neighbouring parts. It is also, in general, incurable. In some it proceeds merely from too violent an erection; in which case emollient and relaxing medicines will be of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>; and we have an example of a cure performed by means of these in the first volume of the Edinburgh Medical Essays.\n\n**GENUS CXXVI. AMENORRHOEA.**\n\n*Suppression of the Menses.*\n\nAmenorrhoea, *Vog.* 130.\nDysmenorrhoea, *Lin.* 168. *Sag.* 218.\n\nThis obstruction, with many other symptoms, as dyspepsia, yellowish or greenish colour of the skin, unusual appetites, &c., constitutes the chlorosis already treated of; a disease which seldom, or never appears without a suppression of the menses. In Dr Home's Clinical Experiments we find the virtues of several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EMENAGOGUES\">emenagogues</a> set forth in the following manner. Chalybeates seldom or never succeeded; they were always found more useful in diminishing the evacuation when too violent, than in restoring it when deficient. The tincture of black hellebore proved successful only in one of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> or ten cases, though given to the length of four tea-spoonfuls a day, which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> the quantity recommended by Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAD\">Mead</a>. Compression of the crural artery, recommended by Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAMILTON\">Hamilton</a> in the Physical and Literary Essays, vol. ii. proved successful only in one of six cases. From the effects produced by this compression, it has the strongest appearance of loading the uterus with blood; from the sensations of the patient it produces the same effects as the approach of the menses, and has every appearance in its favour; yet does not succeed. Dr Home supposes that the uterus is most frequently in too plethoric and inflammatory a state; in which case, this remedy will do more hurt than in a state of imanition; however, he owns, that in the case in which it did succeed, the patient was plethoric and inflammatory. Venesection is recommended as an excellent remedy; the doctor gives three instances of its success, and says he could give many more. It acts by removing the plethoric state of the uterus, relaxing the fibres, and giving the vessels full play; so that their action overcomes all resistance, and the evacuation takes place. It is of no great moment from whence the blood is taken: the saphenous vein has been supposed to empty the uterus most; but it is difficult to get the proper quantity from it, and the quantity of the discharge cannot be so well measured. The powder of savine is a most powerful remedy; and proved successful in three cases out of four in which it was tried. It was given to the quantity of half a dram twice a-day. It is a strong topical stimulus, and seems improper in plethoric habits. Madder-root, according to Dr Home, is a very powerful medicine in this disease; and proved successful in 14 out of 19 cases in which it was tried, being sometimes exhibited in the quantity of two scruples, or a dram, four times a-day. It has scarcely any sensible effects; never quickens the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULSE\">pulse</a>, or excites inflammatory symptoms; on the contrary, the heat, thirst, and other complaints abate; and sometimes these symptoms are removed, though the disease be not cured; but when it succeeds, the menses appear from the third to the 12th day.\n\nWe have now considered all those diseases enumerated in Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CULLEN\">Cullen</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOSOLOGY\">Nosology</a>, the cure of which is to be attempted chiefly by internal medicines. The other genera either require particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANUAL\">manual</a> operations, or a very considerable use of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> applications; and therefore more properly fall under the article Surgery. To this, therefore, we shall refer the genera which fall under the three last orders of the class of locales, viz. the tumores, ectopias, and dialyses; and we shall add, by way of Appendix, a few observations on some important affections to which Dr Cullen has not given a place in his system, or which practitioners in general are not agreed in referring to any one particular genus which he has mentioned.","sp":498,"ep":502},{"h":"SUPPRESSION OF URINE","t":"Ischuria, Sauv. gen. 293.

Ischuria renalis, or a suppression of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-URINE\">urine</a> from an affection of the kidneys, happens but rarely; however, Dr Home in his Clinical Experiments describes such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>. In the end of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> 1774, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of a full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a>, aged 35, was seized with shivering, coldness, and severe cough. Three days after, his urine appeared <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>-coloured, was passed with pain, and in small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a>. About the 8th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1775, he was attacked with violent pains in the small of his back, over the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ABDOMEN\">abdomen</a>, and in the ankles, with pain in the region of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIVER\">liver</a> when pressed. A general swelling was afterwards observed all over the body, but chiefly in the ankles and abdomen, which last was tense and hard. These were attended with vomiting, bad appetite, and considerable thirst. When he entered the clinical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARD\">ward</a> (January 21st), the cough, sickness, and vomiting, had gone off, but the suppression of urine remained. The little which he made was passed with his stools, so that Dr Home <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> it but once; and then it was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a>, and had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> powder at bottom. The pains and swellings which retained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> of the finger, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>; he had a headache, and a very slow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULSE\">pulse</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEATING\">beating</a> only 48 strokes in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a>. He had taken a great many diuretic medicines before his admission. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> after his reception, he was seized with a spontaneous diarrhoea, which continued during the remainder of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. Crystals of tartar were exhibited in doses of half an ounce each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>; at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> he took 20 drops of tincture of opium with a scruple of nitre, and continued this course for eight days without any increase of urine. The stronger and heating diuretics were then tried, as an infusion of juniper berries and pills of garlic; but they were attended with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> manifest advantage. Whenever the pulse became so strong that he could bear bleeding, eight ounces of blood were taken away, which was sify. This was thrice repeated; he appeared easier after each bleeding, his pulse bore it well, and the swellings and other symptoms abated. The heating diuretics, in this state, were given up, and a mixture of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VINEGAR\">vinegar</a> and nitre was substituted in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, in each dose of which, taken every two hours, there was a scruple of nitre. Fermentations were applied to the region of the kidneys, and camphorated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> was afterwards rubbed on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a>. He was ordered the semicinium, which, from a deficiency of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">hospital</a> at that time, he got only once; and which then seemed to have a good effect, as he passed a gill of urine when he was in it. Notwithstanding this, however, the disease continually gained ground; he became comatose, delirious, and died ten days after his admission. On dissection, the kidneys were found of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> form; some watery vesicles appeared on their surface, containing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> gritty particles like fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>; and the lower part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> kidney was considerably inflamed. The pylorus, part of the duodenum, and a considerable part of the small intestines, were much inflamed. In the abdomen were found about five pounds of fluid, and in the cavities of the thorax about half a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a>.\nThe lungs were a little inflamed, and full of small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TUBERCLES\">tubercles</a> on their surface and in their substance; the heart was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>, and a polypus in each ventricle. About six ounces of fluid were found in the pericardium; in the brain nothing preternatural appeared, except about an ounce of water in each ventricle.\n\nDr Home seems to have been at a loss for the remote cause of this suppression of urine, which manifestly had its immediate origin from the kidneys having lost the power of performing their functions. He thinks the inflammation which appeared in the right kidney was scarce sufficient to have occasioned the distemper, as the other would have supplied its place; for which reason also he thinks that the ischuria was owing to a general affection of the system; and that it was of an arthritic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, the patient having been troubled with complaints of that kind for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> time before.\n\n2. The ischuria ureterica is also a rare disease, unless the obstruction proceeds from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> or clot of blood stopping up the passage. Gravel or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, indeed, are very frequently formed in the kidneys; and, by falling into the ureters, occasion an ischuria, with violent pain, and symptoms more or less urgent in proportion to the size and shape of the stones. Sometimes it is attended with coldness of the extremities, nausea, vomiting, and spasmodic constriction of the precordia, a difficulty of making water, constipation of the belly, difficulty of breathing, stupor of the thigh, retraction of the testicle, inquietude, loss of strength, syncope, and convulsion fits. When the violent pain has continued for several days and nights without intermission, and has brought the patient exceeding low, and the suppression of urine is complete, with coldness of the extremities and convulsions of the tendons, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> is at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>. Nor is it a good sign when the stone continues long in the ureter; for then the appetite decays, a nausea and retching to vomit supervene, and the patient is consumed with a hectic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>. Sometimes the pain is attended with an inflammation of the stomach and intestines; and sometimes the disease ends in a dropy of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETHARGY\">lethargy</a>, which soon carry off the patient.\n\nThe indications of cure are, to exclude the stone as easily as possible, and prevent the breeding of others. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> the patient be of a sanguineous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEMPERAMENT\">temperament</a>, Sydenham recommends to take away ten ounces of blood from the affected side; and then to give the patient a gallon of posset-drink in which two ounces of marshmallow roots have been boiled, injecting at the same time an emollient glyster. After the posset drink has been vomited up, and the clyster returned, give a pretty large dose of an opiate. But if the patient be old or weak, or subject to nervous affections, bleeding may be omitted, especially if his urine at the beginning of the fit be coffee-coloured, and mixed with gravel; but as to the other things, the cure is the same. Huxham highly recommends an emollient bath prepared of a decoction of marshmallow root, lintseed, fenugreek seed, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a> of chamomile, to which may be added a few white poppy seeds. By the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of this bath he says he has seen the most cruel fit of the gravel suddenly ended, when neither copious bleeding nor opiates had the least effect. Mild diuretics are also of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>. Hoffman recommends dulcified spirit of nitre as proper to relax the spastic stricture. It is to be taken with suitable distilled waters and syrup of poppies; or in broth, with a few spoonfuls of oil of sweet almonds. Turpentine glysters are also accounted very serviceable; and may be prepared with ten ounces of a decoction of chamomile, with half an ounce of turpentine dissolved in the yolk of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGG\">egg</a>, and about as much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a>. The sal diureticus, or acetic potassae, is much esteemed by some, when taken along with an opiate. But when the stone is too big to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a>, Arbuthnot recommends a cool and diluent diet to hinder the further growth of it. Whey, infusion of lintseed, decoction of marshmallows, and gently resolving diuretics, are also proper. To put a stop to the vomiting, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> tincture of benzoin, formerly named balsamum traumaticum, has sometimes been used with success, when almost every other means have failed.\n\n3. The ischuria vesicalis may arise from a stone in the bladder; and this indeed is the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> cause of it; but there are certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, in which, though the usual quantity of urine, or perhaps more, be passed, the patient dies from the retention of a still greater quantity in the bladder. Of this Dr Hume gives the following instances. A man of 58 years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, of a strong spare habit, and never subject to the gravel, had, during the winter of 1777, a cough with expectoration, which went off in the beginning of 1778. About the 17th of February 1778 he felt some difficulty in passing his urine, and much pain about the region of the bladder. He continued in this way for ten days, after which he became easier on application of some medicines. The abdomen then swelled, and he had pains in his loins and thighs. On the 3d of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> he was admitted into the clinical ward; his abdomen was then swelled and tense; and an evident fluctuation was felt, which some that touched him thought was somorous and produced by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>. A tumor was discovered between the navel and spine of the os ilium on the left side, which gave him much pain, especially when pressed. This tumor became more easily felt after the swelling of the abdomen decreased, seemed round, and very near as large as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of a child. It appeared very much on the left side, even when the patient lay on the right, and it then became dependent. He passed urine frequently, and rather more than in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, as it was computed at four pints a day. It was always clear, and of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>. His body had a strong disagreeable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a>; his skin was dry, belly bound, and his appetite entirely gone, so that he had hardly taken any food for 12 days. His legs swelled slightly for some days in the evening. His pulse was generally regular, sometimes slower than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a>, and sometimes a little quicker; being once felt at 64, and another time at 92. He was often seized, especially after eating or drinking, with hiccough; which increased and lasted till his death. On the 22th day of his disease, after some doses of squills, the general swelling of his abdomen fell, became much softer, and more distinctly discovered the swelling of the left side. The next day a vomiting came on; he became delirious, and died the day following. The body being opened, it appeared that the tumor which was so distinctly felt on the left side of the abdomen, was owing to a distention of the bladder with urine. Its fundus reached to about the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of the norta into the\nEpispistes, the iliacs; it entirely filled the pelvis, and contained between five and six pounds of urine of a pale colour.\n\nOn examining the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> surface, its neck, and the beginning of the urethra, were found to be surrounded with a scirrhus, which impeded the evacuation of the urine. The bladder itself was much thickened, but not more in one part than another. The ureters entered naturally; but were much thickened in their upper half near the kidney. The kidneys were somewhat enlarged; particularly the left, which had several watery vesicles on its external surface. These organs were not in their usual situation; but lay <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> on each side of the spine, and very near the aorta; so that the renal vessels were very short. What was very singular, the lower end of each arose over the spine, and they were united together by their membranes, the aorta passing beneath the union. The bladder had pressed considerably on this part; and the peritoneum covering them was considerably thicker than natural. The lungs adhered everywhere to the pleura, and in some places very firmly; they were of a loose texture and black colour; and the veins of the lower extremities were turgid with blood. It does not appear that this patient got any medicines farther than a few dried squills, which diminished the swellings and brought off much wind. He also got a mixture of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MUSK\">musk</a>, and afterwards of opium, for his hiccup; but without success. His disease was mistaken for an ascites; and the catheter was not tried; but in another case the use of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> was apparently of more service than any internal medicines. This last patient was about 90 years of age, and laboured under symptoms very similar to those already mentioned. When admitted into the clinical ward, he had the hypogastric region swollen, and difficulty of passing his water; but without pain, vomiting, or hiccup. He had lost all appetite; was thirsty, and constive. His pulse was 110, and weak. In the evening about three English pints of pale clear urine were drawn off by means of the catheter: the next day all the symptoms were gone off or abated. After this he continued to pass some urine, sometimes voluntarily, sometimes involuntarily and insensibly; but so much always remained behind, that his bladder was constantly full, unless when the urine was drawn off, which was done twice every day. The urine was sometimes pale, sometimes of a deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> colour; and once there was some blood mixed with it, which perhaps might have been occasioned by the catheter. About the sixth day the urine was very putrid, with much purulent like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> at the bottom, and was passed with more pain. About the 11th, the putrid smell went off. The next day all the urine passed insensibly except what was drawn off; and an hiccup, though not very severe, had come on. In this way he continued without fever, though frequently troubled with the hiccup, especially during those nights in which the urine had not been drawn off. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> after admission, the bladder, with the assistance of the catheter, was almost entirely, though insensibly evacuated, and the hiccup had left him; he had no other complaint but that of voiding his urine insensibly, the natural effect of a scirrhus bladder, and which was probably incurable. With this patient the hot bath and mercurials were tried, in order to soften the scirrhus of the bladder, but without effect.\n\n4. The ischuria urethralis arises from some tumor obstructing the passage of the urethra, and thus hindering the flow of the urine. It is no uncommon distemper, and often follows a gonorrhoea. Dr Home gives us an example of this also.\u2014The patient was a man of 60 years of age, who had laboured under a gonorrhoea six months before, and which was stopped by some medicines in two or three days. He felt soon afterwards, a difficulty in passing his urine, which gradually increased. About 10 days before his admission into the clinical ward, it was attended with pains in the glans, and ardor urinis; he had passed only about eight ounces the day before his admission, and that with very great difficulty; and the hypogastric region was swollen and pained. On introducing the catheter, three pounds of urine were drawn off, by which the pain and swelling were removed. The instrument required force to make it pass the neck of the bladder, and blood followed the operation: and the finger, introduced into the anus, felt a hard tumor about its neck. He was treated with mercurial pills and ointment, by which the swelling about the neck of the bladder soon began to decrease; but at the same time a swelling of the right testicle appeared. He was vomited with four grams of turbithe-mineral, the subulphas hydrargyri flavus of the present pharmacopoeia, which operated gently; and here Dr Home observes, that though these vomits are little used, from a mistaken notion of their severity, he never saw them operate with more violence than other vomits, or than he could have wished. The swelling diminished in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the emetic and some external applications; and the cure was completed by bleeding and a decoction of mezereon root.\n\nGENUS CXXIV.

Coins of Alexander the Great and his successors. About the time of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERO\">hero</a> the Greek coins began to attain to perfection, and were struck of uncommon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>. It is remarkable, that on the coins of this monarch his own image seldom occurs. The only one yet found of Alexander with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PORTRAIT\">portrait</a> upon it, and struck during his reign, is a silver hemidrachm in Dr Hunter's cabinet, which is represented Plate CCCXXXI. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a>. 3. After his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> many coins bear his portrait. Trebellius Pollio informs us, that some coins, particularly those of Alexander, used to be worn as amulets; and many medals are met with in cabinets, bored seemingly with that intention.\n\n8. Coins of the Successors of Alexander.\u2014Those of the Syrian monarchs almost equal the coins of Alexander himself in beauty. Those of Antiochus VI. are supposed to be the most perfect patterns of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> beauty to be met with anywhere. The Egyptian Ptolemies are somewhat inferior.\n\n9. The coins of the Arsacidae of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PARTHIA\">Parthia</a> done by Greek workmen.\n\n10. The Greek imperial coins, being such as have the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> or empress: such as have not these impressions being classed with the civic coins, though struck under the Roman power. None of the imperial coins occur in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>. Of silver there are those of Antioch, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRE\">Tyre</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIDON\">Sidon</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TARSUS\">Tarsus</a>, Berytus, Cesarea, Egyptian silver coins of base metal, Syrian silver coins, which sometimes bear on the reverse the club of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERCULES\">Hercules</a>, or the Tyrian shell-fish. Those of Sidon bear the image of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GODDESS\">goddess</a> Astarte, or her chariot. Those of Cesarea in Cappadocia of better <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> than the Syrian. Lycian coins of good workmanship: on the reverse two harps and an owl sitting upon them. Silver coins of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GELON\">Gelon</a> in Sarmatia resembling the Syrian. The situation of this town is very much unknown. It seems to have been situated on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> of the Euxine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, where some Sarmatic or Scyavonic tribes were mingled with the Scythians or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOTHS\">Goths</a>. The Greek imperial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a> coins are very numerous. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of almost all the emperors may be had from those of Antioch, with a Latin legend on the obverse and Greek on the reverse. Those of Bithynia and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHRYGIA\">Phrygia</a> remarkable for good workmanship. The coins of Tarsus remarkable for their curious views of objects, almost in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSPECTIVE\">perspective</a>. The Egyptian coins, from the time of Augustus to Nero, are worse executed than afterwards. From Nero to Commodus they are frequently of admirable workmanship, and in a peculiar style, distinct both from the Greek and Roman. From the time of Commodus they decline, and are lost after the reign of Constantius I. The Egyptian brass coins of the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> are likewise of excellent workmanship, especially in the time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANTONINUS_PIUS\">Antoninus Pius</a>.\n\n**TABLE II. Roman Coins.**\n\nI. The consular coins, called also the coins of families, and arranged alphabetically in cabinets, according to the names of the families which appear on them. They are,\n\n1. Brass Coins.\u2014These consist chiefly of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> pieces of rude workmanship without any interesting imagery. In cabinets they are generally kept in boxes apart by themselves. The as bears the head of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JANUS\">Janus</a>; the semis of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a> with S; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIENS\">triens</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINERVA\">Minerva</a> with four cyphers; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRANS\">quadrans</a> of Hercules with three cyphers; the sextans of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">Mercury</a> with two cyphers; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNCIA\">uncia</a> bears the head of Rome with one cypher. In all these pieces the prow of a ship is constantly the figure on the reverse, with very few exceptions. Sometimes indeed they have a shell, two heads of barley, a frog, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANCHOR\">anchor</a> or a dog, on the reverse. About the time of Julius Caesar both the obverses and the reverses of the coins began to be altered.\n\n2. Silver.\u2014Of this the denarius was the first and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COIN\">coin</a>. It was stamped originally with X, denoting that the value was ten asses. On the reverse was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASTOR\">Castor</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLLUX\">Pollux</a>, or a chariot of Victory. Afterwards the busts of various deities make their appearance; and in the seventh century of Rome the portraits of illustrious persons deceased are met with; but till the time of Julius Caesar no figure of any living person is to be met with; Julius himself being the first who assumed that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a>. The workmanship on the best and worst silver is much the same. The reverses are very curious, and point out many remarkable events in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROMAN_HISTORY\">Roman <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>; but none of these occur till about a century before the Christian era. The large denarii, with ROMA, are the most ancient; and some of these bear the Pelasgic A, not the Roman. The silver sestertii have a head of Mercury, with a caduceus on the reverse. The quinarii have always a head of Jupiter, with a Victory on the reverse.\n\n3. Gold.\u2014Most of these are of great value. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of these exceeds not 100; those of brass 200; and of silver 2000. The aureus is the general gold coin; but two or three gold semisses of families likewise occur.\n\nII. Roman imperial coins.\n\n1. Brass.\u2014This is of three sizes; large, middle, and small. The first forms a most beautiful series, but very expensive. The various colours of the patina have the finest effect. It is the most important of all the Roman coins, and exceeds even the gold in value.\n\nThe middle brass is next in value to the former; and in it are many rare and curious coins, particularly interesting to Britons, as elucidating the history of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>. Of these are the triumphal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> of Claudius; the EXERC. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITANNICUS\">BRITANNICUS</a> of Adrian; the coins of Antoninus Pius, Commodus, Severus, with a Victory, VICTORIA BRITAN.: but especially those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONIFYING\">personifying</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> BRITANNIA. \"The number of Roman coins relating to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> (says Mr Pinkerton) is remarkable, more than 20 having been struck at various times: while those personifying <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAUL\">Gaul</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>,\nSpain, and other regions of the empire, exceed not four or six at most for each country.\" Only one country vies with Britain, and that is Dacia on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> north-east of the empire, as Britain on the extreme north-west. No doubt this circumstance of remoteness in these two countries recommended them to this particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, as more expressive of the Roman power.\n\nThe small brass series abounds also with curious coins. They are scarce till the time of Valerian and Gallienus, but very common afterwards. Mr Pinkerton recommends, therefore, to form a series in silver as well as brass; both being the cheapest of all the Roman coins. \"In this series (says he), it is a common fault to arrange many coins which have been plated with gold or silver, the forgeries of ancient times, but which time has worn off either wholly or in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a>.\" All real brass coins have the s. c. till the time of Gallienus; as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a> alone had the power of striking brass, while the emperor himself had that of gold and silver. When the s. c. therefore, is wanting, the coin was certainly once plated; as, in general, the different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYPE\">type</a> and fabric, being those of gold and silver, sufficiently show themselves. With <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERTINAX\">Pertinax</a>, A.D. 192, there is a temporary cessation of small brass; nor after him do any princes occur in that series till Valerian, A.D. 254, excepting Trajanus Decius, A.D. 250 only. After Valerian the series is continuous and common. The brass coinage gradually declined in size from the time of Severus; so that parts of the as could not be struck, or at least it was held unnecessary to strike them. Trajanus Decius attempted in vain to restore the coinage; and Valerian and Gallienus were forced to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> denarii scrii and small assaria. The series of large and of middle brass are of two fixed and known sizes; the former about that of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>, the latter of the half crown: though after Severus they gradually lessen. But the small brass takes in all parts of the as; and every brass coin not larger than our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SHILLING\">shilling</a> belongs to this series. The minimi, indeed, or very smallest, it is proper to keep apart. The coins of Julius Caesar in this size are of peculiarly fine workmanship. They bear his portrait reverse of Augustus, or the reverse has a crocodile EGYPTO CAPTA. There are several with Mark Antony, and some with Cleopatra; but the more common pieces are those with only numerals on the obverse, which go the length of XIII.; probably tickets for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATHS\">baths</a>. A great many occur in the time of Nero; of which Mr Pinkerton particularizes one which has \"on the reverse a table ornamented with griffins and other devices. Upon it is placed a wreath of laurel and a beautiful vase, of which the embossed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> figures are so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a>, and finished so surprisingly, as to stamp these coins the most exquisite productions of the ancient mint.\" From the time of Nero to that of Vespasian no small brass occurs; but there are many of this emperor, and of his son Titus; while Domitian has as many as Nero, and Domitia his wife has almost as many. Succeeding emperors to the time of Pertinax have also many brass coins; but from his time to that of Valerian there are no real small brass excepting those of Trajanus Decius. After Gallienus there are a great many coins of this kind; and Mr Pinkerton mentions one in Dr Hunter's cabinet, of an unknown person named Nigrianus. The coin seems to have been struck at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARTHAGE\">Carthage</a>; and our author concludes that he was an African usurper, father to Nigrianus.\n\n2. Silver.\u2014This series is very complete, and the cheapest of any; especially as the small brass becomes a fine supplement to it: the latter being had in plenty when the silver becomes scarce, and the silver being plentiful when the brass is scarce.\n\n3. Gold.\u2014The Roman imperial gold coins form a series of great beauty and perfection; but on account of their great price, are beyond the purchase of private persons.\n\n4. The colonial coins occur only in brass; none, excepting that of Nemausus, having a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to coin silver. They begin in Spain with Julius Caesar and Antony, and cease with Caligula, who took away the privilege of coinage from the Spanish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a>. The most beautiful are those of Corinth. The other remarkable colonial coins are those of Emerita, Illice, Terraqua, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CASSANDRA\">Cassandra</a>, Babba, Berytus, Cesarea, Patrae, Emisa, Helio-polis or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALBEC\">Balbec</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMAIS\">Ptolemais</a>, Sidon, Tyre, Deultum, Dium, Trons, Rhesaina, Neapolis of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAMARIA\">Samaria</a>, which bears a representation of Mount Gerizzim with the temple on it, Hippo in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>, &c. On many of these coins we meet with fine representations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a>, triumphal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a>, gods, goddesses, and illustrious persons. But coins with those representations are by no means common; the colonial coins till the time of Trajan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> only a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLOUGH\">plough</a>, or some other simple badge of a colony. Camelodunum is the only colony in Britain of which we have any coins.\n\n5. The minimi.\u2014This includes the smallest coins of all denominations, most of which do not exceed the size of a silver <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PENNY\">penny</a>. They are the most curious of all; but no series of them was ever formed by any person except the abbe Rothelin, whose collection, formed of all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a>, passed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a> of Spain. The reason of the scarcity of these small coins is probably their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIMINUTIVE\">diminutive</a> size; by reason of which they are mostly lost.\n\nIt is surprising that numbers of Roman coins are found through all countries once subject to that powerful people. Some have been met with in the Orkneys, and many in the most remote parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>, and Africa, known to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>.\n\nTABLE III. Coins of other Ancient Nations.\n\n1. The Lydians appear to have invented coinage; though, perhaps, this honour may be disputed with them by the Greeks.\n\n2. The Assyrians, Medes, Babylonians, Phoenicians, and Egyptians, had no coins. In the mouths of the mummies, are only thin, unstamped, and round pieces of gold, to pay <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARON\">Charon</a>'s fare.\n\n3. No <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> or Chinese coins are to be met with till a very late period; and even then so rude as scarce to be worth notice. Voltaire mentions a collection of ancient Chinese and Indian coins made by the emperor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHINA\">China</a> in 1700; but Mr Pinkerton supposes it to have consisted only of the Greek and Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> which had been introduced into these countries.\n\n4. The Lydian coins have no legends; so that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> conjecture only determines the ancient coins of electrum\nand silver found in Asia, and different from the Persian, to belong to Lydia. Croesus coined gold into a form which he called staters; and Mr Pinkerton mentions a very ancient gold coin in Dr Hunter's cabinet, which he supposes to have been one of these. It has a globous figure, with indented marks on one side, and on the other a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> kneeling, with a fish held out in the left <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a> depending in the right. It weighs four drachms; which Josephus tells us was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of the Lydian gold coins. In the same collection are other gold coins little inferior in antiquity; the most ancient of which, our author supposes, may have been coined by the cities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASIA_MINOR\">Asia <a cl</a>ass=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINOR\">Minor</a>, as coinage passed through them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>. They are of admirable workmanship, and as much superior to the best Sicilian coins, as the latter are to all the rest in the world. These gold coins are all extremely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a>; owing to the want of knowledge in refining gold.\n\n5. Persian coins.\u2014These were first struck by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DARIUS\">Darius</a> Hystaspes, whence they had the name of darics. They are of gold, and generally have the figure of an archer; they weigh about four drachms; and some occur with the indented mark on one side, while others have figures upon both. The silver coins have generally a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">king</a> in a chariot of two horses, with a charioteer, and sometimes another figure on foot behind, on the obverse; while the reverse presents a ship, sometimes a ram, bull, or other animal. The gold coins, which only had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of darics, are extremely scarce, having been melted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>, as is supposed, and recurred by Alexander, the Great on his conquest of Asia.\n\nThere is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> series of Persian coins beginning with Artaxares, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTAXERXES\">Artaxerxes</a>, who overthrew the Parthian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONARCHY\">monarchy</a> about the year 210. These are large and thin, with the king's bust on one side, and the altar of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MITHRAS\">Mithras</a> on the other; generally with a human figure on each side. These coins continue till the year 636, when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a> was conquered by the Saracens. These have only Persian letters upon them, which have never been explained by any antiquaries. Mr Pinkerton says that they seem to partake of the ancient Greek, Gothic, and Alanic.\n\n6. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEBREW\">Hebrew</a> shekels, originally didrachms, but after the times of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACCABEES\">Maccabees</a> tetradrachms, are almost all forgeries of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> Jews, as well as the brass coins with Samaritan characters upon them. They have all a sprig upon one side and a vase on the other. Mr Pinkerton says, that the admission of one of them into a cabinet would almost be a disgrace to it.\n\n7. Phoenician and Punic coins are very interesting on account of the great power and wealth of these nations. The alphabets have been cleared by their relation to the Hebrew and Syriac languages.\n\n8. The coins of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PALMYRA\">Palmyra</a> come under the same denomination with the former, Palmyra being a Syrian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a>.\n\n9. The Etruscan coins have the characters of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, which have been explained by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> to the Pelasgic, or oldest Greek and Latin.\n\n10. The Spanish coins are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSCRIBED\">inscribed</a> with two or three alphabets allied to the old Greek or Punic; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-INSCRIPTIONS\">inscriptions</a> have not been sufficiently explained.\n\n11. Gaulish coins.\u2014These are numerous, but the most ancient have no legends; and even after the Greek letters were introduced into Gaul by a colony at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARSEILLES\">Marseilles</a>, the legends are very difficult to be explained.\n\n12. British coins.\u2014From a passage in Caesar's Commentaries, it has been inferred that the Britons used some kind of coins even in his time. Mr Pinkerton informs us, that some rude coins of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a> very much mingled with tin are frequently found in England; which, he supposes, may be some of the ancient British money. They are of the size of a didrachm, the common form of the nummus aureus among the ancients. After the time of Caesar, coinage increased among the Britons; and there are many found of Cunobelinus mentioned in the Roman history. Most of these have on one side cuno, with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EAR\">ear</a> of wheat, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>, a kind of head of Janus, or other symbol; and have frequently also the letters camu; supposed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> Camelodunum. Sometimes the word Tascia occurs; the meaning of which has not yet been explained.\n\n13. Gothic coins of France, Italy, and Spain, to the time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> the Great. These have the Roman characters upon them. The Italian coins are mostly of the size of small brass; and in this way we meet with coins of Athalaric, Theodobat, Witigez, and other Gothic princes. Many others occur, the inscriptions of which, though meant for Roman, are so perverted as to be illegible.\n\n**Table IV. Modern Coins.**\n\n1. Of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JAPAN\">Japan</a>.\u2014These are thin plates of gold and silver, of an oval figure, with small marks or figures stamped on them.\n\n2. China.\u2014These are only copper, about the size of a farthing, with a square hole in the middle to put them on strings. The inscriptions on them do not express the name of the sovereign, but the year of his reign; as the happy year, the illustrious year, &c.\n\n3. The Tartarian coins are rude, having only inscriptions upon them; and they are all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POSTERIOR\">posterior</a> to the time of Jenghiz khan.\n\n4. Coins of Thibet, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PEGU\">Pegu</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIAM\">Siam</a>, are much the same, presenting only inscriptions without any figures. They are also of late <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a>.\n\n5. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>.\u2014Some old coins have been found in the neighbourhood of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CALCUTTA\">Calcutta</a>, of gold, silver, copper, and tin, all mixed together. These have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WARRIOR\">warrior</a> with a sword on one side, and an Indian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> idol on the other, of the same form with the celebrated sculptures in the island of Elephanta; but it is impossible to tell what antiquity they are of. The modern coins are the pedoga of gold, worth little more than six shillings; the roupee of silver upwards of two shillings; and the cash, of copper. There is a remarkable set of roupees, which show the twelve signs; a lion on one, a bull on another, &c. but the occasion on which they were struck is unknown. The other coins of India have generally Persian inscriptions upon them.\n\n6. Persia.\u2014The Persic coins since its conquest by the Arabs continue on the Arabian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODEL\">model</a>.\n\n7. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARABIA\">Arabia</a>.\u2014Some coins of the petty princes of Arabia are met with as old as the imperial ages of Rome; but till the time of Haroun Alrashid, no regular\ngular coinage appears in the vast empire of the Saracens. Even then the reverse has only an inscription, and the obverse is copied from any Greek or Syrian coin which happened to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> in the moneyer's way. The later Arabian coins are mostly silver, with the name and titles of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> on one side, and some inscription from the Koran on the other. The more modern coins of this country are in the shape of a fishhook, with Arabic inscriptions.\n\n8. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TURKEY\">Turkey</a>.\u2014No regular coinage was formed by the Turks till they became masters of Constantinople. They resemble those of Persia and Arabia, having merely inscriptions on both sides.\n\n9. The coins of the African <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, at least such as profess the Mohammedan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, have merely inscriptions without any figures; those of the internal parts are unknown; and no coinage was used among the Mexicans and Peruvians, the only civilized nations in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>; but La Hontan mentions an American <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> who had a square medal of copper depending from his neck. Mr Pinkerton supposes it to have come from Japan.\n\n10. Modern Italic coins. Besides the Gothic princes mentioned in the former table, the exarchs of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAVENNA\">Ravenna</a> coined money with the inscription Felix Ravenna, &c. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOMBARDS\">Lombards</a> issued no coins, but there are some still extant of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CHARLEMAGNE\">Charlemagne</a>. The following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIST\">list</a> shows the origin of the coinage in various Italian states.\n\nRome.\u2014Papal coinage originates with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HADRIAN\">Hadrian</a> I. Size of silver pennies, with the Pope's name on one side, and Scos Petrus on the other. No coins appear from 975 to 1099, excepting of Leo IX. In 1303 appear pennies of the senate and people of Rome, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a> on the one side and Paul on the other. There are groats of Clement V. with his portrait three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> length; but the side-head begins with Sixtus V. in 1472. Gold was first coined by John XXII. in 1316. The coins of Alexander VI., Julius II., and Leo X., are remarkable for beauty and elegance.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILAN\">Milan</a>. Coinage began with Charlemagne. The first coin of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> of Visconti occurs in 1330, under Azo. The set finishes with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> XII.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPLES\">Naples</a>. Coinage begins in 840 and 880, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUKE\">Duke</a> Sergius and Bishop Athanasius. The next coins are of Roger of Sicily, and Roger II. in 1130, William I., II., and Tancred. Naples and Sicily were subdued in 1194 by the emperor of Germany; in 1255 Manfred appears; in 1266 Charles of Provence; and others till Joan in 1414: after which follow the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of Arragon, and later kings.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a> begins in the 10th century. The first coins are silver pennies marked Veneci. Then follow the coins of Henrico Dandulo in 1192, of Ziani in 1205, &c. Gold was first coined at Venice in 1280, and copper in 1471; but the silver groats are as old as 1192.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLORENCE\">Florence</a>. Silver was coined here in the 12th century, or before; but in 1252 the first gold coins struck in Europe after the 8th century made their appearance, and were named florins from the flower of the lily upon them. They were imitated by the popes, by France, and England. They have on one side St John the Baptist standing, on the other a large fleur de lis, and it is not doubted that the French fleurs de lis took their origin from these coins. They weigh a drachm, and are no less than 24 carats fine, according to Italian writers, and are worth about 12 shillings.\n\nGenova first began to coin money in 1129, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONRAD\">Conrad</a>. Those of the dukes of Savoy began in the same century.\n\nAquilia. Coins were issued from this city by the patriarchs from 1204 to 1445.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERRARA\">Ferrara</a>. Coins of the marquises from 1340.\n\n11. French coins. During the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of Clovis, from 490 till 751, the coins are chiefly gold tricentes, with some solidi and semisses. The former are of good workmanship, with the heads of kings. The reverse has a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a>, with the name of the town where they were struck.\n\nThe coins of the second race begin with Pepin in 751, and continue till Hugh Capet in 987. The coins of the first race are elegant, but those of the second entirely the reverse, being almost all silver pennies, and seldom bearing the portrait of the king. Those of Charlemagne have only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAROLUS\">Carolus</a> in the field; while the reverse bears R. R. or some such inscription; though one piece struck at Rome has a rude bust of him. The coins of Louis le Debonnaire are better done.\n\nThe third race begins with Hugh Capet in 987, and extends to this time. The coinage did not begin to improve till 1226 under St Louis, when the groat appears. Its name in Italian is grosso, in French gros, in English groat, or great coin; so called from its size in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> with the penny; and it passed from Italy to France, to Germany, and to England. After the conquest of France by the English, base coins of many kinds were introduced; and in the year 1574, in the time of Henry III., copper was first introduced into the French coinage. Besides these, the other remarkable coins of France are, the blancs or billion groats first issued in 1348; the ecus a la couronne, or crowns of gold, so called from the crown on one side, and begun by Charles VI. in 1384; those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANN\">Ann</a> of Bretagne in 1498; the teston, or piece with the king's head, of Louis XII.; the Henri of Henry II., with Gaul sitting in armour, and a Victory in her hand. There are many coins of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARDINAL\">Cardinal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOURBON\">Bourbon</a>, elected king in 1589; and in 1642, Louis XIV. takes the title of Catalonie Princeps. The first louis d'or made its appearance in 1640; but such was the poverty of France, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> we believe certain authors, that in 1719 the duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORLEANS\">Orleans</a> regent struck copper for silver.\n\n12. Spanish coins. The most early series of these consists almost entirely of tricentes, finely done. On one side they have the head of the king with his name, and on the other a cross, with the name of the town, commonly in Baetica, or the south part of Spain, where there were a great many Roman colonies, and which was fertile to a proverb. The Moresque coins of Spain, like those of the rest of the Mohammedan states, present us only with insipid inscriptions on both sides. Indeed the Mohammedan religion by its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> refusal to allow the representation of any living creature, has prevented the progress of coinage in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> throughout those regions which it has over-\nThe inscription on the ancient Spanish coins are in the Cufic or old Arabic characters.\n\n13. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PORTUGAL\">Portugal</a>. No <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of the coins of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> has yet appeared.\n\n14. Germany. No account of the German coins has been published; though it is well known that not only the emperors, but many of the cities, particularly those called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANSE\">Hanse</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>, issued money; and many of the coins issued by the cities were superior in elegance even to those issued by the emperors.\n\n15. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DENMARK\">Denmark</a>. Here the coinage begins with Canute the Great in 1014. The pieces are at first extremely rude, ornamented only with rings and Runic characters. These are succeeded by copper pieces, some of which have a cross, others a pastoral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAFF\">staff</a>, on one side, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> A on the other. Later coins have strokes IIII, &c., all round them; but those of Harold, Hardicanute, and Magnus Bonus, in 1041, are of neat workmanship, and have the portraits of the princes at half length. The coins of Nicolas, or Niels, as he is called by the Danes, are rude, as well as those of Waldemar I. and the celebrated Margaret. In 1376 Olaf caused money to be struck with a grinning full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a>, with a crowned O upon the other side. \"The Swedes (says Mr Pinkerton) took these coins extremely ill, as they thought they grinned at them.\" Silver was first coined in Denmark by Philippa queen of Eric, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> to Henry IV. of England.\n\n16. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a>. The coinage of this kingdom began in 818 under Bjorn, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of Charlemagne. The coins are marked with a cross. Next follow those of Olaf in 1019: which Mr Pinkerton supposes to have been the first true Swedish coins; and that the art of coining first passed from England into Denmark in the time of Canute the Great, and from Denmark into Sweden. These coins were struck on the English model. During the time that Sweden was subject to Denmark, or miserably harassed by the Danes, the coins of both kingdoms were the same; but after the time of Gustavus Vasa, many elegant pieces appear. In 1634, dollars were coined with the portrait of Gustavus Adolphus, who was killed two years before; on the reverse they have the arms of Sweden, with the chemical marks of mercury and sulphur. In 1716, 1717, and 1718, Charles XII. being in extreme want of money, issued small copper coins with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SATURN\">Saturn</a>, Jupiter, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARS\">Mars</a>, &c., upon them, to go for dollars; and on account of this scheme, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARON\">Baron</a> Goertz, the suggestor of it, was brought to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLOCK\">block</a>.\n\n17. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORWAY\">Norway</a>. The coins of this country begin with Olaf in 1066; after which time there are various coins of other princes; but copper was not coined till the year 1343.\n\nBesides the coins already mentioned, there are ecclesiastic coins of France, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, &c. Those of Denmark and Sweden are numerous, but the Norwegian coins of this denomination are rare. Mr Pinkerton describes a silver one in his possession as having arms and a mitre, with the inscription on one side, Sanctus Olaws Rex Norvey; on the reverse, Olaws Dei Gra. Arcep. Nid'sen, meaning Nidrosiensis, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> of Nidros, now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DRONTHEIM\">Drontheim</a>.\n\n18. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOHEMIA\">Bohemia</a>. The coinage of this kingdom appears at a very early date, viz. in the year 909, under Duke Boleslaus I. These coins are followed by others of Boleslaus II. and Emma his wife in 970; of Boleslaus III. in 1002; Jaromir in 1020; Udalrich in 1030, and other princes. The bracteate money of Otoclar I. was coined in 1197.\n\n19. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POLAND\">Poland</a>. The coinage of this country is nearly as ancient as that of Bohemia. The coins are on the German model, but no particular account of them has been published.\n\n20. Russia. None of the Russian money appears to be more ancient than the 13th century. The first are the kopecks or silver pennies, which have upon them rude figures of animals on one side, and a man standing with a bow or spear on the other. There are likewise coins of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOSCOW\">Moscow</a> struck by Aristotes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARCHITECT\">architect</a> in 1482. The roubles or dollars and their halves. There are some of the impostor Demetrius in 1605, which are very scarce.\n\n21. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUSSIA\">Prussia</a>. The first Prussian coins were struck at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CULM\">Culm</a> by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEUTONIC\">Teutonic</a> knights in 1230. They were silver pennies, and upon the German plan. In the next century were struck shillings, groats, and schots; the last were the largest, and are extremely rare. They have the Prussian shield, an eagle surmounting a cross, with a rose-shaped border, MONETA DOMINORUM PRUSSIAE: on the reverse is a cross fleurie, within a border of a similar kind, having the inscription HONOR MAGISTRI, JUSTITIAM DILIGET.\u2014Gold coins were struck in the same century. In the time of Copernicus the money was so debased, that 12 or 13 marks were worth but one of pure silver.\n\n22. England. The English coins are of various kinds.\n\n1st. Heptarchic. These are only of two sorts, viz. the skeatta or penny of silver, and the styca of copper. Few of the pennies appear till after the year 700; though some are met with which bear the name of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-ETHELBERT\">Ethelbert</a> I. king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KENT\">Kent</a>, as old as 560. At first they had only rude figures of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERPENTS\">serpents</a>, but in latter times legends were likewise added. Most of these pennies have pagan symbols upon them. The styca was only coined in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTHUMBERLAND\">Northumberland</a>, and was a very small piece, about the value of half a farthing.\n\n2nd. Coins of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> monarchs of England. Mr Pinkerton denies that an end was put to the heptarchy by Egbert in 832, as is commonly supposed; though he owns that he was chief monarch of the country, as several others had been before him. Edgar, who reigned in 959, according to him, was the first king of England; and the coins of the chief monarchs form almost a complete series from the time of Egbert to Edgar. The only chief monarch of whom there are no coins is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-ETHELBALD\">Ethelbald</a>, who reigned in 857. Most of these coins bear rude portraits; but the reverses are sometimes curious and interesting. Some have views of cathedrals and other buildings; particularly one of Edward the Elder in 900; which has the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHEDRAL\">cathedral</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a> with three rows of windows, round arched as the other Saxon and Norman buildings: the Gothic arch being quite unknown till after the 12th century. Some coins of Anlaf king of Northumberland have the famous raven, the Danish ensign: and\nthose of other princes have frequently very curious reverses.\n\n3d. Ecclesiastic coins appear of the archbishops of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CANTERBURY\">Canterbury</a>, Wulfred in 804; Ceolnoth, in 830; and Plegmund in 889.\n\n4th. Coins of the kings of England. The silver penny, which had begun during the heptarchy, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to be the general coin after the kingdom had been united under one head; and extends in a continued series from Egbert almost to the present reign. The only kings wanting are Edmund Ironside, Richard I., and John. At first the penny weighed 22\u00bd grains; but towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of the reign of Edward III. it fell to 18 grains; and in that of Edward IV. to 12. In the time of Edward VI. it was diminished to 8 grains; and in Queen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a>'s reign to 7\u00bd; at which it still continues.\n\nHalfpennies and farthings were first struck in silver by Edward I. in 1280; the former continued to the time of the commonwealth, but the latter ceased with Edward VI. The groat was introduced by Edward III. in 1354, and continues to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, though not in common circulation. The half-groat or two-pence is of the same date, and also continues to the present time.\n\nShillings were first coined by Henry VII. in 1503. At first it was called testoon, from the teste, tete, or head of the king upon it; the name shilling being derived from the German schelling; under which appellation coins had been struck at Hamburgh in 1407. The crown was first coined in its present form by Henry VIII. Formerly it had appeared only in gold, whence the phrase of crowns of gold; though these indeed were the largest gold coins known for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> time in France and other countries on the continent, being worth about 10s. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">sterling</a>. They had their name from the crown stamped on one side, and were first coined by Charles VI. in 1384, and continued till the time of Louis XIV. The half-crown, sixpence, and threepence, were coined by Edward VI. In 1558 Queen Elizabeth coined three halfpenny, and in 1561 three farthing pieces; but they were discontinued in 1582. From the year 1601 to the present time the coins of England remain the same.\n\nGold was coined in England by Henry III. in 1257; the piece was called a gold penny, and was larger than the silver one; and the execution is by no means bad for the time. The series of gold coinage, however, commences properly from Edward III. In 1344, this monarch first struck florins, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of those in Italy; and it is remarkable, that though these coins at the time they were first issued bore only six shillings value, they are now intrinsically worth 10s.; so much has the value of gold increased since that time. The half and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLORIN\">florin</a> were struck at the same time, but only the last has been found. The florin, however, being found inconvenient, gave <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> to the noble of 6s. 8d. value, and exactly half a mark. The latter had its name from being a limited sum in accounts; and was eight ounces in weight, two thirds of the money <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a>. It is sometimes also called sellibra, as being one-half of the commercial pound of 16 ounces. The noble had its name from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a> of the metal; the gold of which it was coined being of the finest sort. Sometimes it was called rose noble, from both sides being impaled in an undulating circle. It continued with the half and quarter noble to be the only gold coin till the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGELS\">angels</a> of Edward IV. appeared in 1465. These had their name from being stamped with the image of Michael and the dragon. The angels of 3s. 4d. value were substituted in their place. In 1527 Henry VIII. added to the gold coined the crown and half-crown at their present value; and the same year he gave sovereigns of 22s. 6d. and ryals of 11s. 3d. angels at 7s. 6d. and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBLES\">nobles</a> at their old value of 6s. 8d. In 1546 he caused sovereigns to be coined of the value of 20s. and half-sovereigns in proportion. His gold crown is about the size of our shilling, and the half-crown of six-pence, but thin. All his coins, however, gold as well assilver, are much debased; and it was not without much labour and trouble that Edward VI. brought it back to its former standard. On the union of the two crowns, James gave the sovereign the name of unite; the value continuing of 20s. as before. He coined also rose-ryals of 3os. value, spuryals of 15s. angels of 10s. and angels of 5s. Under the commonwealth, the sovereign got the name of the twenty-shilling piece, and continued current till the coinage of guineas. These were so called from their being coined of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUINEA\">Guinea</a> gold, and were at first only to go for 20s. though by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> but tacit consent they always passed for 21s. Half-guineas, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> guineas, and five guinea pieces, were also coined during the same reign; which still continue, though the two latter are not in common circulation. Quarter guineas were coined by George I. and likewise by his present majesty; but they were found so troublesome on account of their small size, that they were stopped within a year or two, when received at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a> of England, and thus are not to be met with at present. A few pieces of 7s. value have likewise been coined, and are known by the lion above the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HELMET\">helmet</a>; but none have been issued. In 1688 the guinea rose to 21s. 6d. and continued to increase in value till 1696, when it was as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> as 30s.; but after the recoinage in 1697 and 1698 it fell by degrees, and in 1717 was at its old standard of 21s. and at that time silver was fixed at its present standard value, viz. as 1 to 15\u00bd in weight.\n\nThough the first money coined in Britain, as we have already observed, was copper, yet, excepting the Northumbrian stycas, no copper coin was found in England from the time of the Saxon conquest till the year 1672. An aversion to a copper coinage it seems was prevalent throughout the nation; and Queen Elizabeth, who without hesitation used base money for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>, yet scrupled at coining copper for England. This want of small coin occasioned such an increase of private tokens for halfpennies and farthings that it became a serious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> to government; and in 1594 a copper coinage was seriously thought of. This year a small copper coin was struck about the size of a silver twopence, with the queen's monogram on one side, and a rose on the other; the running legend on both sides being, THE PLEDGE OF A HALFPENNY. Of this there are patterns both in copper and silver, but both of them soon fell into disuse. On the 16th of May 1613, King James by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROCLAMATION\">proclamation</a> issued farthing tokens. They are generally of the same size with the two pence, with two sceptres in saltier surmounted\nwith a crown, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARP\">harp</a> upon the other; with an intention, as it would seem, that if they were refused in England, they might <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> in Ireland. In 1635 Charles I. coined those with the rose instead of the harp; but the circulation of these was entirely stopped by the vast number of counterfeits which appeared, and by the king's death in 1648. After this the private tokens began again to be circulated, till put a stop to by the coinage of farthings in 1672. The workmanship of the tokens is quite contemptible. In 1672 the halfpence as well as the farthings which had been struck two years before began to circulate. They were of pure Swedish copper, the dies engraved by Roettier; and they continued till the year 1684, when some disputes arose about the copper lately obtained from the English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINES\">mines</a>. Tin farthings were coined with a stud of copper in the centre, and inscribed round the edge as the crown pieces, with NUMMORUM FAMILUS. 1685 or 1686. In 1686 halfpence of the same kind were coined; and the tin coinage continued till the year 1692, to the value of more than 65,000l.; but next year the tin was all called in by government, and the copper coinage recommenced. The farthings of Queen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANNE\">Anne</a> are all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> pieces, excepting those of 1714, the last year of her reign. \"They are (says Mr Pinkerton) of exquisite workmanship, exceeding most copper coins either ancient or modern, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> do honour to the engraver Mr Croker to the end of time.\" The one, whose reverse is Peace in a car, Pax Missa Per Orbem, is the most esteemed; and next to it the Britannia under a portal. The other halfpence and farthings are less valuable.\n\n23. Scotland. Silver pennies of Alexander I. who reigned in 1107, are believed to exist; and there certainly are some of Alexander II. in 1214. There are likewise coins of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAVID\">David</a> in 1124; but perhaps none of Malcolm IV., his successor, whose reign was very short. There are many coins of William I. in 1165; and a large hoard of his pennies was found at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERNESS\">Inverness</a> in 1780.\n\nThe money of Scotland continued to be of the same value with that of England till the country was drained by the vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RANSOM\">ransom</a> of David II. after which it became necessary to reduce its size; and so much did this diminution affect England, that Edward III. found himself obliged to lessen the English coin also. The diminution of the Scottish coin, however, continued still to go on until it became impracticable to keep par with that of England. In the first year of Robert III. it passed only for one half of its nominal value in England: in 1393, Richard II. ordered it only to go for the weight of the genuine metal it contained. In 1600 it had sunk to such a degree as to pass only for a twelfth part of the English money, and continued at that low ebb till the coinage of Scotland was entirely cancelled by the union of the two kingdoms.\n\nOf silver coins we have only pennies till the year 1293, when Edward I. having coined halfpence and farthings, Alexander III. of Scotland coined also halfpence, of which we have a few, but no farthings are to be met with; but there are silver farthings of Robert I. and David II. The latter introduced the groat and half-groat, which completed the set of Scottish silver. It continued unaltered till the time of Queen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>, when they all ceased to be coined in gold, silver, on account of the high price of that metal. In 1555 shillings were first coined, with the bust of the queen on one side and the arms of France and Scotland on the other. The silver crown was first coined in 1565, which went for 3s. Scots; lesser pieces of 2s. and 1s. having likewise been struck, and marks of silver, worth 3s. 4d. English, were also coined about the same time. These coins have upon them the marks xxx., xx., x., to denote their value. They are commonly called Cruickstone dollars, from the palm-tree upon them, mistaken for a remarkable yew at Cruickstone near Glasgow, where Henry Darnley resided. It is described, however, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> as a palm, with a \"shell-podoc\" (a tortoise) crawling up. This alludes to Darnley's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> with the queen, as the motto from Propertius DAT GLORIA VIRES also implies. The motto NEMO ME IMPUNE LACESSET first appears on the Scottish coins in 1578, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> is given to the celebrated Buchanan. In 1582, the crown of an ounce weight went for 40s. Scots, and was accordingly marked XL.; in 1597 the mark was L., the Scottish money being then only one-tenth of the English: the mark was LX., in 1601, the value being then reduced to one-twelfth, at which it has ever since continued. In the time of Charles I. half marks, 40 and 20 penny pieces, were coined. In 1675 the Scottish dollars first appeared, in value 56s. Scots, with halves and quarters of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> value. In 1686, James VII. coined 6cs., 4cs., 2cs., 1cs., and \u00bds. pieces; but only those of 4cs. and 1cs. are known, with these numbers under the bust. At the union of the kingdoms all the Scottish coins were called in, and recoinied at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, with the mark E. under the bust to distinguish it: since which there has been no coinage in Scotland. The Scottish silver coins are in general equal, if not superior, in the workmanship to the English.\n\nGold was first issued by Robert II. about 30 years after Edward III. of England had coined the same metal in that country. The pieces were at first called St. Andrews, from the figure of that tutelar saint upon the cross, and who appears on the obverse with the arms of Scotland, and on the reverse a lion in a shield. The lion was another name for the largest gold coin in Scotland, from the arms of the kingdom upon it. The next was the unicorn, under James III.; which were followed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BONNET\">bonnet</a>-pieces of James V. These last are of admirable workmanship, being almost equal to the ancient coins in this respect. In imitation of the French, the monarch we speak of diminished the size of the coin without lessening its weight; an improvement not adopted by the English for a whole century. The last gold coined in Scotland was the pistole and half pistole, of twelve and six pounds Scots. These coins have the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> under the head. The gold coins of Scotland fell in the same proportion with the silver.\n\nThe copper coinage of Scotland is of more early date than that of England. It was preceded by money of billon, or copper washed with silver, called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> money. James III. first coined black farthings in 1466; and this is recorded by historians as one of his greatest faults. This kind of coinage, however, continued as late as the reign of James VI. In his time\nthe true copper coinage began; but as the value of Scottish money had now declined almost to the utmost, the pieces suddenly assumed a form almost resembling that of the French coins. The bodle, so called from Bothwell the mintmaster, being equal in size to the liard, and worth two pennies Scottish, was struck. The billon coin, formerly called bas piece, and worth six pennies Scots, was now coined in copper, and termed the baw-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BEE\">bee</a>. Thus it corresponded with the French half sol and English halfpenny, the Scots penny being now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DENIER\">denier</a>. Some pieces named Atkinsons were coined by James VI. in 1582, when the Scottish money was to the English as 1 to 3; but on its being still farther reduced, they went for 8 pennies, a third more than the value of the baw-bee. Besides these there were the hardie and plack, the former being worth three and the latter four pennies Scots. This coinage continued through the reigns of Charles I. and II., but Scottish coins of the former are, perhaps, the rarest of any.\n\n24. Ireland. The first coins introduced into this kingdom seem to have been those of the Danes, and which have only a number of strokes around them instead of letters. In the tenth century, however, this coinage had been considerably improved; and in 930 and 994 there are pennies struck in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DUBLIN\">Dublin</a>, with the inscription on Dyfli or Dyfli, Dublin or Dublin being the Danish name of that city. There are likewise coins of the Irish princes themselves, and of the English monarchs, struck in Ireland as early as the ninth century; and it is asserted by some, that Ireland even in those days had been conquered by England; of which, indeed, these coins seem to be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a>. None of the Irish coins of Henry II. are to be met with, but we have some of the coins of John; and from his time to that of Henry V., the Irish coins are known by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a> enclosing the king's head, which appears also upon the coins of other nations at this period. The harp does not appear upon the Irish coins till the time of Henry VIII. Till the time of this monarch, the English and Irish coins are the same; but the same debasement of the coin which at that time took place in England extended also to Ireland; but in 1601 copper halfpence and farthings were coined also for this kingdom. These circulated in Ireland when James VI. issued his farthing-tokens of copper, the latter being of two sizes, that if they failed in England they might be sent to Ireland as pennies and halfpence. In 1635 a mint was established in Dublin by Charles I., but it was stopped by the Irish massacre, and the many disturbances which followed; since which time the scheme has not been resumed. After the massacre, St Patrick's halfpence and farthings were coined by the Papists, bearing the legends Floreat Rex, and on the reverse Ecce Grex; on the farthing Quiescat Plebs. Copper tokens were struck by towns and tradesmen, as in England and Scotland. In 1680, halfpence and farthings were issued by authority, with the harp and date. In 1689, James II., having invaded Ireland, instituted a mint, and coined shillings and half crowns of all the refuse metal he could find, particularly some brass guns were employed, whence the coinage is commonly called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUN\">gun</a>-money. Even this metal, however, soon became so scarce, that a diminution in its size is quite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 1689 to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> 1690; and as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of their mintage is marked upon them, this decrease is easily perceived. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 1690, pennies of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> mixed with tin were issued; and on the 15th of June the same year, crowns of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> metal were coined; but these are now very scarce. In 1722, the patent for coining halfpence and farthings was given to William Wood, which excited such discontent in Ireland. From the small size allowed by the patent to these pieces, it was supposed that the patentee would have gained 60,000l.; but as he caused them to be struck of a size still smaller, his gains were estimated at 100,000l. The coins, however, are of admirable workmanship, and very fine copper, bearing the best portrait of King George I., to be found anywhere. Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Newton, at that time at the head of the mint, declared that they were superior to the English coins in every thing except the size. In 1737 the Irish halfpence and farthings, with the harp on the reverse, were coined, and continue to the present time. In 1760, there was such a scarcity of copper coin, that some private persons applied for leave to coin halfpence, which appeared with a very bad portrait of George II., and the words Voce Populi around it. No gold or silver has been coined in Ireland since the massacre of 1641.\n\nTable V. Modern Medals, properly so called.\n\n1. Scottish medals. These take the lead in the present article, the first modern medals of gold being those of David II., struck between the years 1330 and 1370. Only two of them are known to exist; one in the collection of Mr Barker of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BIRMINGHAM\">Birmingham</a>, and the other in that of Dr Hunter. In 1487, there is a medal of James III., sent to the shrine of St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMBOISE\">Amboise</a> in France. It is described as of two inches and a third in diameter; the weight near two ounces; having on the obverse a beardless king, with long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>, sitting on a throne, holding in one hand a naked sword; in the other a shield, with the Scottish arms. On the borders of the canopy above the throne is an inscription in Gothic letters, IN MI DEFEN, being corrupt French for In my defense; a common motto in the Scottish arms. Above the canopy is Villa Berwichi; the reverse bears St Andrew and his cross, SALVUM FAC POPULUM TUUM DOMINE. There is also a medal of James IV., in the collar of St Michael, having on the reverse a Doric pillar surmounted by a young Janus, standing on a hill, beyond which is the sea, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LAND\">land</a> on either side. This, however, is by some suspected to be a forgery.\n\nThe most remarkable Scottish medals are those of the unfortunate Mary. The first is properly French, having been issued at her coronation as queen of France, along with her husband King Francis II. On the obverse of this piece there are portraits of Francis and Mary, face to face, with three legends around them, the outermost containing their titles; the middle one the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a>: HORA <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NONA\">NONA</a> DOMINUS J. H. S. EXPIRavit HELLI CLAMANS; the innermost the name of the city (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>). On the reverse are the arms of France and Scotland. Fine testoons were also coined upon the same plan, and are now so rare that Dr Hunter gave ten guineas for one.\nwhich is in his collection. The same portraits appear on the fine crown of Mary and Henry, in 1565, which is so rare as to be esteemed a medal of the highest value; and Mr Pinkerton imagines, that if offered to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a> it would bring 40 or 50 guineas.\n\nAnother remarkable medal of Mary represents her full-faced and weeping, with the inscription, O God <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRANT\">GRANT</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PATIENCE\">PATIENCE</a> IN THAT I SUFFER VRAING. The reverse has in the centre, QUHO CAN COMPARE WITH ME IN GRIEF, I DIE AND DAI NOCH SEEK RELIEF; with this legend around, HOUET NOT THE (figure of a heart) QUHAIS JOY THOU ART. There are also many counters of this unfortunate princess, being thin silver pieces of the size of a shilling. \"They all appear (says Mr Pinkerton) to have been done in France, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of Mary, who was fond of devices. Her cruel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTIVITY\">captivity</a> could not debar her from intercourse with her friends in France, who must with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> have executed her orders, as affording her a little consolation.\"\n\nThe coronation medal of Charles II. struck at Edinburgh for his inauguration, June 13, 1663, is remarkable as being the only one ever coined of Scottish gold, and the first in Britain struck with a legend on the edge. With respect to the workmanship, it is inferior to Simon's. Of these medals only three are known to exist, of which one is in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSEUM\">Museum</a>. It is not uncommon in silver; in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> it sometimes wants the legend on the edge.\n\n2. Italian medals. These appear in the 15th century, and from that time successively in most European countries. Vittore Pisano, a painter of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERONA\">Verona</a>, is celebrated as the restorer of the art, but it remains to be accounted for how the medals of King David, already mentioned, came to exist so long before. Mr Pinkerton considers this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a> rather as an inventor than a restorer, his medals having no resemblance to the ancient coins, as being large, and all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAST\">cast</a>. They were first modelled in wax, then a mould taken from the model in fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> and other ingredients. After a good cast was procured, it was touched up, and made a model for the rest. These medals of Pisano, are almost always inscribed Opus Pisanii Pictoris. The portraits of a great number of illustrious men were done by him in this manner; and in the British Museum is a large brass medal of Pisano by himself.\u2014Other artists were Boldu, Maruscotto, Matthaeus de Pastos, Sperandius, Misaldone, &c. Towards the end of the century, however, the medals began to assume a more elegant appearance; and the papal ones are not only the most elegant but the most ancient series of all the modern medals. The improvement began in the reign of Alexander VI. so famous for his own crimes, and those of his nephew Caesar Borgia. His successors, Julius II., Leo X., Hadrian VI., and Clement VII., had many of their medals designed by Raphael, Julio Romano, and other eminent painters, and the engraving executed by artists of equal merit. Among these were the celebrated Cellini, and the noted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PADUAN\">Paduan</a> forgers of Roman coins, Cavino and Bassiano. In 1644, Cormanni, a medallic artist, was imprisoned on account of a piece which represented the Pope upon one side, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OLYMPIA\">Olympia</a> Maidalchina, the relation of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLINESS\">holiness</a>, on the other. The unfortunate Cormanni poisoned himself. About this time the family of the Hamerani, originally from Germany, began to engrave the papal medals; which they did with surprising merit for several generations. Each of the daughters did a fine medal, as we are informed by Venuti.\n\nBesides the papal medals, many have been issued by the various states of Italy. There are medals of Frederic II. of Sicily in 1501, of several Venetian generals in 1509, of Alfonso duke of Ferrara in 1511, and of the celebrated Andrew Doria in 1528.\n\n3. French medals. Till the reign of Louis XIV., the medals of this country are neither fine nor numerous; but this monarch exceeds all modern princes in this way. Many of his pieces are well designed and executed, though objectionable on account of their falseness.\n\n4. Danish medals. These appear of Christian II. in 1516, of Frederic and Sophia in 1532, of Frederic I. and Christian III. in bonnets worn in the 16th century. The elephant of the house of Oldenburg is frequent upon Danish medals.\n\n5. Swedish medals. These begin with Gustavus Vasa; and several of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHRISTINA\">Christina</a> are likewise to be met with. There are also some curious ones of Charles XII.\n\n6. Dutch medals. These begin in 1566; and many of them are remarkable for maps and plans, which must be very interesting to posterity. \"Had the Greeks and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> (says Mr Pinkerton) given us maps and plans, what a fine system of ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">geography</a> and topography a cabinet of medals must have been!\"\n\n7. Medals of Spain, Portugal, and Germany. The Spanish medals began with Gonsalo in 1503, many of which are curious and interesting. Under Charles V., there are many curious Spanish medals; but those of Germany begin with Frederic in 1453. They are extremely numerous; as we may easily suppose from the greatness of the empire, and various states which compose it. There is a famous medal of Sebastian king of Portugal, famous for his unfortunate expedition into Africa in 1578; with his bust, full face, and three quarters in length. On the reverse is a shell-fish in the sea, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOON\">moon</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> stars, bearing the inscription SERENA CALSA FAVENT. There is also a curious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LOZENGE\">lozenge</a>-shaped coin of the same, with the arms of Portugal, and the king's name and title: On the reverse is a cross with the inscription IN HOC SIGNO VINCES, 1578.\n\n8. Satiric medals. These began almost as soon as the knowledge of the art of coining medals was revived. They seem to have been almost unknown to the ancients. One indeed of the emperor Gallienus is supposed to have been satiric. It has on the front the emperor's bust, with the inscription GALLIENVS AVG. the reverse is Peace in a car, PAX UBIQUE; but this has been proved to be only a blundered coin. Some other ancient medals, however, are not liable to this objection. The first modern satiric medal published was that of Frederic king of Sicily in 1501, against his antagonist Ferdinand king of Spain. It has on one side the head of Ferdinand, with the inscription FERDINANDUS R. AR. VETUS VULPES ORBIS; on the reverse a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WOLF\">wolf</a> carrying off a sheep, JVGVM MEVM SVAVE EST ET ONVS MEVM LEVE. Many others have been struck, of which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WIT\">wit</a> would now perhaps be difficult\ndifficult to be found out; but of all nations the Dutch have most distinguished themselves in this way; and paid very dear for their conduct, as they brought upon themselves by one or two satiric medals the whole power of France under Louis XIV.\n\n9. English medals. The first of these is in the duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DEVONSHIRE\">Devonshire</a>'s collection. It is of a large size, and done on the plan of the early Italian medals. It has on the reverse the arms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KENDAL\">Kendal</a>, with the inscription TEMPORIS OBSIDIONIS TURCORUM, MCCCLXXX. On the other side is a portrait with IO KENDAL RHODI TVRCYPPELLERIVS. It was found last century in Knaresborough forest; but Mr Pinkerton has no doubt of its having been done in Italy. The next is that of Henry VIII. in 1545, and is of gold, larger than the crown-piece, with the king's head upon the obverse, and three legends within each other, including his titles, &c. The reverse contains two inscriptions, declaring him to be the head of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>; the one in Hebrew, the other in Greek. It was imitated exactly by Edward VI. whose coronation medal is the first we have. There are two medals of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a> and Mary, whose execution is tolerably good; but those of Elizabeth are very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>. There are good medals of James I. and his queen; with a fine one of Charles I. and Henrietta, though the workmanship is much inferior to the antique. There are many good medals of Charles, with various devices upon their reverses. Under the commonwealth the celebrated Simon produced medals which are deservedly reckoned the most admirable pieces of modern workmanship. There are many good medals of Charles II., James II., and William III. Some are also found of James after his abdication. Some fine gold, silver, and copper medals, were issued in the time of Queen Anne; the two last affording a series of all the great actions of the duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARLBOROUGH\">Marlborough</a>. About the year 1740, a series of medals was engraved in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> by Dassier, a native of Geneva, containing all the kings of England; being 36 in number. They are done upon fine copper, and executed with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>. There are besides many medals of private persons in England; so that it may justly be said, that this country for medals exceeds almost every other in Europe.\n\nTo this account of modern coins and medals we shall add that of another set called siege-pieces, and which were issued during the time of a siege in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> of urgent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a>. These were formed of any kind of metal; sometimes of no metal; and Patin mentions a remarkable one struck at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LEYDEN\">Leyden</a> in 1574, when the place was besieged by the Spaniards. It was of thick <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> or pasteboard, having a lion rampant, with this inscription, PVGNO PRO PATRIA, 1574; and on the reverse, LVGDVNVM BATAVORVM. There are various siege-pieces of Charles I., both in gold and silver, some of the latter being of the value of 20 shillings.\n\nThe nummi bracteati are a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of modern coins somewhat between counters and money; and have their name from the word BRACTEA, a spangle or thin bit of metal. They are commonly little thin plates of silver, stamped as would seem with wooden dies up-\n\non one side only, with the rude impression of various figures and inscriptions. Most of them are ecclesiastic, and were struck in Germany, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWITZERLAND\">Switzerland</a>, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and a few in Poland. They continued to be in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> in Germany till the end of the 18th century; and some are still used in Switzerland at this day.\n\nTable of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABBREVIATIONS\">Abbreviations</a> used in the Legends of Medals; from Mr Pinkerton.","sp":209,"ep":219},{"h":"THESE WERE THE ONLY","t":"e were the only means recommended by the practitioners mentioned above for opposing this formidable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>: but Dr Smyth of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a> has, we are told, discovered that it may be certainly cured by issues, of which Dr Macbride gives the following instance.\n\n\"A. B. a tall well-made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>; rather <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> than otherwise; of healthy parents, except that there had been a little gout in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>; temperate; being very attentive to the business of his trade (that of a watchmaker), led a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> uncommonly sedentary; had, from his boyhood upwards, been remarkably subject to alarming inflammations of his throat, which seized him, at least, once in the course of the year; in all other respects well.\n\n\"In 1767, (then 48 years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>), he was taken, without any evident cause, with a sudden and very dispiriting throbbing under the sternum. It soon afterwards increased, and returned upon him every third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> fourth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>, accompanied with great anxiety, very laborious breathing, choking, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a> of fulness and distention in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, a bloated and flushed countenance, turgid and watery eyes, and a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> and unequal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULSE\">pulse</a>. The paroxysm in-\nvaded, almost constantly, while he was sitting at dinner; now and then he was seized with it in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, when walking a little faster than usual; and was then obliged to stop, and rest on any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>. Once or twice it came on in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a>; but did not oblige him to sit up, as it was then attended with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> great difficulty in breathing. In the afternoon fits, his greatest ease was from a supine posture; in which he used to continue motionless for some hours, until quite spent and worn out with anguish, he dropt into a slumber. In the intervals between these attacks, which at length grew so frequent as to return every fourth or fifth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, he was to appearance in perfect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>.\n\nThus matters <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> for more than two years; and various antispasmodics were ineffectually tried for his relief. In 1769, there supervened a very sharp constrictory pain at the upper end of the sternum, stretching equally on each side, attended with the former symptoms of anxiety, dyspnea, choking, &c., and with an excruciating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CRAMP\">cramp</a>, as he called it, that could be covered with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>-piece, in each of his arms, between the elbow and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WRIST\">wrist</a>, exactly at the insertion of the pronator teres; the rest of the limb was quite free. The fits were sometimes brought on, and always exasperated, by any agitation of mind or body. He once attempted to ride on horseback during the paroxysm; but the experiment was near proving fatal to him. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of season or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> made no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> upon him. Still, in the intervals, his health was perfectly good; except that his eyes, which before his illness were remarkably strong and clear, were now grown extremely tender: and that his sight was much impaired. He had no flatulency of stomach, and his bowels were regular.\n\nIn this situation, February 22, 1770, he applied to me for assistance. I had seen, I believe, eight or ten of these frightful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> before. Two of the patients dropt dead suddenly. They were men between 40 and 50 years of age, and of a make somewhat fleshy. The fate of the others I was not informed of; or, at least cannot now recollect.\n\nHaving found the total inefficacy of blisters and the whole class of nervous medicines in the treatment of this anomalous spasmo, I thought it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to attempt the correcting or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-DRAINING\">draining</a> off of the irritating fluid in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> now before us. To this purpose, I ordered a mixture of lime-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> with a little of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> juniper-water, and an alterative proportion of Huxham's antimonial wine: I put the patient on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, perspirable diet; and restrained him from all viscid, flatulent, and acrimonious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a>. By pursuing this course, he was soon apparently mended; but after he had persisted regularly in it for at least two months, he kept for some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> at a stand. I then ordered a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> to be opened on each of his thighs. Only one was made. However, as soon as it began to discharge, his amendment manifestly increased. The frequency and severity of the fits abated considerably; and he continued improving gradually, until, at the end of 18 months he was restored to perfect health: which he has enjoyed, without the least interruption, till now, except when he has been tempted (perhaps once in a twelvemonth) to transgress rules, by making a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAL\">meal</a> on salted meat, or indulging himself in ale or rum-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNCH\">punch</a>, each of which never failed to disorder him from the beginning of his illness: and even on these occasions, he has felt no more than the slightest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of his former sufferings; insomuch that he would despise the attack, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> it did not appear to be of the same stock with his old complaint. No other cause has had the least ill effect on him.\n\nThough rum was constantly hurtful, yet punch made with a maceration of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> currants in our vulgar corn-spirit, is a liquor that agrees remarkably well with him.\n\nHe never took any medicine after the issue began to discharge; and I have directed that it shall be kept open as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> as he lives. The inflammations of his throat have disappeared for five years past; he has recovered the strength and clearness of his sight; and his health seems now to be entirely re-established.\"\n\nDr Macbride, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to Dr Duncan, published in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> Medical Commentaries, gives the following additional observations on this disease.\n\nWithin these few weeks I have, at the desire of Dr Smyth, visited, three or four times, a very ingenious man who keeps an academy in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, of about 34 years of age, who applied to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a> for his advice in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> last.\n\nI shall give you his symptoms as I had them from his own mouth, which appear to me to mark his case to be an angina pectoris, and as deplorable as any that I have read of. It was strongly distinguished by the exquisite constrictory pain of the sternum, extending to each of his arms as far as the insertion of the deltoid muscle, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> anxiety, laborious breathing, strangling, and violent palpitation of the heart, with a most irregular pulse. The paroxysms were so frequent, that he scarcely ever escaped a day, for six or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> years, without one. They were usually excited by any agitation of mind or body, thought slight. He had clear intervals of health between the fits. The distemper seems <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> in him, as he says his father was affected in the same manner some years previous to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. He has a strong gouty taint, which never showed itself in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a>; and he has led a life of uncommon sedentariness, from intense application to mathematical studies, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of mind, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>, even from his boyish years. These circumstances may, perhaps, account for his having been taken with this disease at so early an age as 17.\n\nA large issue was immediately opened in each of his thighs. In a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> afterwards he began to mend, and has gone on improving gradually. He can now run up stairs briskly, as I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> him do no later than yesterday, without hurt; can bear agitation of mind; and has no complaint, excepting a slight oppression of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>, under the sternum, which he feels sometimes in a morning, immediately after dressing himself; and which he thinks is brought on by the motion used in putting on his clothes; though for a complete week preceding the day on which I saw him last, he told me that he had been entirely free from all uneasiness, and was exulting that he had not had such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> of ease for these last seven years.\n\nDoctor Smyth also showed me, in his adversaria, the case of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> who had been under his care in 1769, which he had forgotten when my book went\nPuerperal went to the press, and which he was reminded of the Fever other day by a visit from his patient. It was a genuine angina pectoris, brought on by a very sedentary life, and great vexation of mind, clearly marked by the exquisite pain under the sternum, that extended acutely to the upper extremities, particularly along the left arm, together with the other symptoms of dyspnoea, anxiety, palpitation of the heart, &c. recited in the case above. The disorder went off in 1762, by large spontaneous discharges from the piles, but returned upon him severely in 1765. Issues in his thighs were then recommended to him, but not made. But, whether it was by the persuasion of some friend, or of his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCORD\">accord</a>, he went into a course of James's powder, in small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ALTERNATIVE\">alternative</a> doses, combined with a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASTOR\">castor</a> and asafoetida. This he persisted in for about six weeks; in the meanwhile, he had large acrimonious gleecings from the scrotum, and a plentiful discharge of ichor from the anus.\u2014From this time he began to find his complaints grow less and less distressing, and he has now been totally free from them for six years past.\n\nThe PUERPERAL or CHILDBED FEVER.\n\nThis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of fever, as its name imports, is peculiar to women in childbed; and is usually the most fatal of all the disorders to which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEX\">sex</a> is liable. But, notwithstanding the prevalence of it in all ages, its real <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> has remained, to the present time, a subject of much dispute and uncertainty. The critical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of its invasion, when febrile comotions are apt to be excited by various accidents, and the equivocal symptoms which accompany it, have even afforded room for questioning whether it be a primary or a secondary disease. Some writers have considered it as proceeding entirely from an inflammation of the uterus; others have imagined it to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of an obstruction to the secretion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>; while the greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> has been inclined, for reasons equally if not more plausible, to impute it to a suppression of the lochia. If we examine this fever attentively, however, according to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> course, and independently of all the accidental concomitant symptoms with which it is not essentially connected, we may safely pronounce it to be a primary disease of a particular nature, and perhaps not the necessary consequence of any of the causes above mentioned.\n\nThis fever is most generally incident to women within 48 hours after delivery, though it may supervene on the fourth or fifth day, and sometimes considerably later. It is preceded, like other fevers, by a rigor, which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> violent; and when happening during the time of labour, may be confounded with the pains of parturience. In its earlier stage it is attended with the signs of inflammation. A great pain is felt in the back, hips, and the region of the uterus; which, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> last mentioned, is accompanied with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> and throbbing. A sudden change in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of the lochia now also takes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>; the patient is frequently troubled with a tenesmus; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-URINE\">urine</a>, which is very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>-coloured, is discharged in small quantity and with pain. At the first attack of the fever, the woman is generally seized with a vomiting of perraceous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, as in the cholera morbus, to which disease it then bears a strong resemblance.\u2014But instead of this symptom, there is sometimes only a nausea, or loathing at the stomach, with a disagreeable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> in the mouth. The belly swells to a considerable bulk, and becomes susceptible of painful sensations from the slightest impression. The tongue is generally dry, though sometimes moist, and covered with a thick brownish fur. When the fever has continued a few days, the symptoms of inflammation usually subside, and the disease acquires a more putrid form. At this period, if not at the very beginning of the disorder, a bilious or putrid diarrhoea, of a dangerous and obstinate nature, supervenes, and accompanies it through all its future progress; each motion to stool being preceded by a temporary increase, and followed by an alleviation of pain. The patient usually nauseates all kind of food and drink, except what is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> and acidulated. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> or blackish sordes, the consequence of putrid exhalations, adheres to the edges of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>; a troublesome hiccup is at length produced, which greatly exasperates the pains of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ABDOMEN\">abdomen</a>; petechiae or vibices also appear, with sometimes a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> eruption, but which produces no mitigation of the disease. Through the whole course of the fever, the patient is affected with great anxiety and dejection of spirits.\n\nSuch in general is the course of the puerperal fever: the symptoms of which, however, may be often varied, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of the patient, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of the disease, and its earlier or later invasion. When the woman is naturally weak, or her strength has been greatly reduced by immoderate evacuations after delivery; when the disease is violent, and immediately follows that period; its progress and termination are proportionally rapid and fatal. In such unfortunate circumstances, many have been known to expire within 24 hours from the first attack of the disease; nay, there are some instances where the rigor has concluded the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a>. The catastrophe, however, is most generally suspended for some days; and the number of these is variable, though the 11th from the commencement of the fever may justly be fixed as the period which is usually decisive. In whatever stage of the disease an unfavourable termination may happen, it would seem as if the commencement of the patient's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a> were not marked by any critical revolution of the fever, as depending on an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> of the humours; but that the cure is gradually effected, either by a spontaneous vomiting, or a long-continued discharge by stool of that perraceous matter, the existence of which in the stomach is usually evinced at the first attack of the disease. The most unfavourable prognostic, therefore, arises from such a weakness of the patient as renders her unable to support so tedious an evacuation as that by which the fever is overcome. When the lochia return to their former state, when the swelling and tenderness of the abdomen abate, and there is a moisture on the skin, we have reason to hope for a happy termination of the disease.\n\nThough the puerperal fever may generally be ascertained from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> which has been given, and chiefly by that remarkable tenderness of the abdomen which particularly distinguishes it; yet, as some of its symptoms may be confounded with those arising from other diseases, and which require a different method\nThe pains of the abdomen, attending the childbed fever, may be distinguished from those called after-pains, by their uninterrupted continuance through the course of the disease, though sometimes they suffer exacerbations; whereas, in the latter, they often totally intermit. They are also distinguished by the absence of fever with concomitant symptoms in the one, and their evident existence in the other.\n\nMany circumstances evince a dissimilarity between the puerperal and miliary fevers, notwithstanding the symptoms of anxiety and oppression are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> to both; insomuch that the nature of the approaching disease may be ascertained at the very commencement of its attack. In the puerperal fever the rigor is more violent, of longer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>, and not interrupted, as it is in the other. The pulse is fuller and stronger; the skin is more hot; and the tongue, whether moist or dry, though generally the latter, is not of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>, but brownish appearance; and the urine is also higher coloured. Eruptions, which are critical in miliary fevers, procure no mitigation of the puerperal fever, and cordials generally increase it.\n\nWhen the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> attack of the puerperal fever happens to coincide with the febrile commotion which is excited in childbed women by the milk, the nature of it may at first be misapprehended; but the concomitant symptoms, and greater violence of the disease, must in a short time dissipate such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>.\n\nFrom all the most accurate accounts of this disease, and from the period at which it generally commences, there seems reason to conclude, that it owes its rise more immediately to accidents after delivery. For it is allowed that it may follow a labour under the best and most favourable circumstances, though endeavours to dilate the os internum are supposed frequently to produce it. The more immediate causes generally assigned by authors are a stoppage of perspiration, the too free <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of spices, and the neglect of procuring stools after delivery; sudden frights, too hasty a separation of the placenta, and binding the abdomen too tight. The putrid appearance, however, which this disease so soon assumes, affords ground to suspect that the predisposing cause of it is a vitiated state of the humours; for it is generally observed to be most prevalent in an unhealthy season, and among women of a weakly and scorbutic constitution. But from its prevalence in some particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOSPITALS\">hospitals</a>, while others in the same city are entirely free from it, there can be little doubt that it is often communicated by contagion from one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> to another. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> is corroborated also by many other circumstances; particularly by the means by which it has been removed from hospitals. It would seem, however, that this contagion does not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> on the female system without a certain predisposition, and that this predisposition is induced by those changes to which the female <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> is subjected in consequence of delivery.\n\nWithin these few years this fever has been treated of by several writers, most of whom have differed from each other in their sentiments of the nature of the disease. The first in the order of publication is Dr Denman, who seems to be of opinion, that it may derive its origin either from a redundancy or too great acrimony of the bile, the secretion of which appears to be much interrupted in the time of gestation. In Dr Manning's treatise on this fever, he mentions its being highly probable that such a cause contributes greatly to produce the disease, especially where the putrid tendency of the humours is increased by unwholesome <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> and diet.\n\nIt has likewise been the fate of the puerperal fever, that no disease has more divided the sentiments of physicians in regard to the method of cure. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> indications and contra-indications of bleeding, and other remedies, arising from the complication of inflammatory and putrid symptoms; the equivocal appearance of the vomiting and purging, as whether they be critical or symptomatical; and the different causes whence symptoms similar to each other may arise in pregnant women; all these circumstances concur to involve the subject in great obscurity and indecision. If we carefully attend to the several characteristics of the disease, however, so as to be able to distinguish it from every other puerperal complaint, and observe at the same time the usual manner of its declension, our judgment may be guided in the method of cure by the salutary efforts of nature. But, in order to obtain a clearer view of the genuine indications, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be proper to consider them under the several lights in which they have been generally agitated by authors.\n\nOne of the most essential <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> to be ascertained in the care of the childbed fever, respects the propriety of bleeding. A free use of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LANCET\">lancet</a> has been generally regarded as the most successful expedient in practice; and there are some instances of critical hemorrhages which would seem to confirm its utility. But Dr Denman thinks we may safely affirm from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, that for one who will be benefited by large bleeding, a much greater number will be injured, and that even almost irretrievably. Nor can this seem surprising, when we consider the situation of childbed women. In most, the evacuations consequent upon delivery are sufficient to diminish any undue superabundance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a>; and if, as frequently happens, the disease be produced by too hasty a separation of the placenta, the consequence of which is generally a very copious discharge of blood, we can never suppose that nature will be assisted in overcoming the febrile commotion, by the farther evacuation of the vital fluid, through the defect of which she is now rendered unequal even to the ordinary support of the animal economy. We may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> to every practical physician, how much he has known the pulse to sink, and what a train of nervous symptoms he has observed to succeed an excess of the discharge above mentioned. Besides, it is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-AXIOM\">axiom</a> in physic, that a remedy which cures any disorder, will always prove sufficient to prevent it; and therefore, if bleeding were the proper cure in the childbed fever, the disease ought to have been prevented by a large evacuation of blood, when that happened previous to its attack. Experience, however, in this, as in all other diseases, is the only unerring guide we can follow; and whoever regulates his practice by fact and observation, will be convinced that bleeding, especially in a large quantity, is, in general, very far from being attended with success. Bleeding\nPuerperal is seldom proper, except in women of plethoric constitutions, and in whom the signs of inflammation rise high. Nor even in such patients ought it to be repeated without great caution, and the existence of strong indications. Bleeding, when used in proper circumstances, may unquestionably palliate the fever; but that it often shortens the duration of it, appears to be a matter of much doubt. On this account the practice becomes still more suspicious and exceptionable, when we consider that by venesection improperly used the patient's strength may be so far reduced as not to support the tedious looseness by which the disease is generally carried off. Though bleeding, however, ought in general to be used with great caution, there are certainly many cases in which it is both necessary and advantageous.\n\nThe genuine nature and effects of the looseness in this disease, is another controverted point of the highest importance, and which merits the most attentive inquiry. Physicians, observing that women who die of the puerperal fever are generally molested with that evacuation, have been induced to consider this symptom as of the most dangerous and fatal tendency; and what, therefore, we should endeavour by every means to restrain. In this opinion, however, they would seem to have been governed by too partial an observation of facts. For experience certainly authorises the assertion, that more women appear to have recovered of the childbed fever, through the intervention of a diarrhoea, than have been destroyed by that cause. If it also be considered, that purging is usually almost the only sensible evacuation in the more advanced state of the disease, and is that which accompanies it to its latest period, we shall have the strongest reason to think that it is critical rather than symptomatical, and ought therefore to be moderately supported, instead of being unwarily restrained. Nay, the advantage which is found to attend vomiting as well as purging in the earlier stages of the disease, would seem to evince that the matter discharged by these evacuations is what chiefly foments the disease. Emetics and purgatives, therefore, in the opinion of Dr Manning, are the only medicines on which any rational dependence is to be placed in this fever; at least, they are certainly such as are found the most successful. It is an established rule in practice, to prescribe a vomit at the beginning of every fever attended with any nausea or loathing of the stomach, and where there is not any reason to apprehend an inflammation of that organ. Nor does the state of childbed women afford the smallest ground for prohibiting our recourse to the same expedient in answering a similar indication.\n\nIt is so seldom a physician is called during the rigor preceding the puerperal fever, that he has few opportunities of trying the effects of remedies in that early state of the disease. When such occur, however, we should endeavour as much as possible to abate and shorten that period, as the succeeding fever is generally found to bear a proportion to the violence and duration of it. For this purpose, warm diluting drinks should be plentifully used, with a small quantity of volatile spirits or brandy. When Dr Manning apprehended such an accident, he sometimes ordered the nurse to give immediately a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISH\">dish</a> or two of warm sack-whey; taking care that it was not too strong, which is a caution that ought always to be remembered; for though a free use of the more cordial and spirituous kinds of liquors might perhaps soon abate the rigor, there is danger to be feared from their influence on the approaching fever, especially in women of a strong and healthy constitution. In all cases, warm applications to the extremities, such as heated bricks, towels, or toasted grains in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> bag, may be used with perfect safety, and some advantage.\n\nWhen the hot fit is advanced, the first thing Dr Manning orders is some emollient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INJECTION\">injection</a>, as chicken-water, or water and milk, which ought to be frequently repeated through the course of the disease. These prove beneficial, not only by promoting the discharge from the intestines, which seems in fact to be the solution of the disease; but also by acting as a kindly fomentation to the uterus and adjacent parts. With this intention they are particularly serviceable when the lochia are suppressed. Great care, however, is requisite in administering them, on account of the tenderness and inflammatory disposition, which at that time render the parts in the pelvis extremely susceptible of pain.\n\nThe next step in the method of cure ought to be to promote the discharge of the morbid matter both by the stomach and intestines. This intention may be answered by a remedy prescribed by Dr Denman\u2014Two grains of tartrate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTIMONY\">antimony</a> rubbed up with a scruple of the powder of lapilli canerarum.\n\nOf a powder thus prepared, Dr Denman gives from two to six grains, and repeats it as circumstances require. If the first dose do not procure any sensible operation, he repeats it in an increased quantity at the end of two hours, and proceeds in that manner; not expecting any benefit but from its sensible evacuation.\n\nShould the disease be abated, but not removed, (which sometimes happens), by the effect of the first dose, the same medicine must be repeated, but in a less quantity, till all danger be over. But if any alarming symptoms remain, he does not hesitate one moment to repeat the powder, in the same quantity as first given; though this be seldom necessary, if the first dose operates properly.\n\nIt is to be observed, says Dr Denman, that as the certainty of cure depends upon the proper repetition of the medicine, the method of giving it at stated hours does not appear eligible. If the first dose produce any considerable effect by vomiting, procuring stools, or plentifully sweating, a repetition of the medicine in a less quantity will seldom fail to answer our expectations; but great judgment is required in adapting the quantity first given to the strength of the patient and other circumstances. We are not to expect that a disease which from the first formation carries so evident marks of danger, should instantly cease, even though a great part of the cause be removed.\n\nFrequent doses of the saline draughts ought also to be given, which not only promote the evacuation by the intestines, but likewise increase the salutary discharges of urine and perspiration. These medicines are particularly serviceable in subduing the remains of the fever, after its violence has been broken by the more efficacious remedies above mentioned; but when they are used even in the decline of the disease, gentle laxatives of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-RHUBARB\">rhubarb</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAGNESIA\">magnesia</a>, as advised by Dr Denman,\nAlthough the discharge by the intestines appears to have the most salutary effect in this disease; yet when the stomach has not been properly unloaded of offensive matter, though a great nausea and sickness had indicated the expediency of such an evacuation at the beginning of the fever, the continuance of the looseness is sometimes so long protracted as in the end to prove fatal. In this alarming state of the disease, when the stools are very frequent and involuntary, and all appearances threaten danger, Mr Denman says, that a clyster of chicken-water injected every one, two, or three hours, or as often as possible without fatiguing the patient too much, with a cordial diaphoretic draught taken every six hours, has produced better effects than could be expected.\n\nWhile these medicines are employed, we should endeavour to mitigate the pains of the belly by relaxing applications. During the course of the disease, the patient ought to drink freely of diluting liquors, and abstain from every thing of a heating quality, unless great faintness should indicate the use of a small quantity of some cordial medicine.\n\nSuch is the practice recommended in this disease by Dr Denman. We shall now take a cursory view of the sentiments of succeeding writers on this subject.\n\nAccording to Dr Hulme, the proximate cause of the puerperal fever is an inflammation of the intestines and omentum; for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> of which opinion he appeals to dissections. He supposes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> predisposing cause of the disease to be the pressure of the gravid uterus against the parts above mentioned. The omentum, says he, in the latter stage of pregnancy, must either be flat, which is its natural situation, or be rumpled or carried up by the gravid uterus in folds or doublings. When the latter is the case, which he observes is probably not seldom, the danger of a strangulated circulation will be greater.\n\nMr White, who has also written on this disease, judiciously remarks, that were Dr Hulme's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> well founded, the disorder ought rather to take place before delivery, and be immediately removed at that period: That it would likewise most generally happen to women at their first labour, when the abdominal muscles are less yielding, and the pains more violent; the contrary of which is most frequently experienced to be the case.\n\nIt also deserves to be remarked, that, upon Dr Hulme's supposition, we cannot account for the disease being more common and fatal in large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> and in hospitals, than in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> and private practice, while other inflammatory disorders are more endemic among those who live in the latter than the former situation. Even admitting the friction of the intestines and omentum against the uterus to be as violent as Dr Hulme supposes, is it not highly improbable, that any inflammation could be occasioned by the pressure of such soft substances upon each other? Or, were this effect really produced, ought not the puerperal fever to be more common and fatal after the most laborious deliveries? But this observation is not supported by experience.\n\nDr Hulme, in favour of his own hypothesis, alleges that it gives a satisfactory answer to the question, \"Why all lying-in women have been, and ever will be, subject to this disease?\" In this proposition, however, the doctor supposes such an universality of the disease as is not confirmed by observation. It is affirmed upon undoubted authority, that in many parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> the puerperal fever is hardly known; whereas, were it really produced by the causes he assigns, it would be equally general and unavoidable.\n\nBut how peculiarsoever this author's sentiments are in respect of the proximate cause of this disease, they have not led him to any method of cure different from the established practice. On this subject Dr Hulme divides his observations into two parts; comprehending under the former the more simple method of treatment, and under the latter the more complex. He sets out with remarking, that the patient being generally costive at the beginning of the disease, an emollient opening clyster will often give immediate relief; but if this should not prove effectual, recourse must be had to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHARTICS\">cathartics</a>. Those which he found answer his purpose best, were the sal catharticus amarus, the oleum ricini, emetic tartar, and antimonial wine. When the bowels have been sufficiently cleared and the pain abates, he advises encouraging a gentle diaphoresis by medicines which neither bind the body nor are heating; such as small doses of ipecacuan, emetic tartar, and antimonial wine, combined with an opiate in a moderate dose, and given once or twice in the course of 24 hours; administering the saline draughts in the intermediate spaces. If preceding or during this course, a sickness at stomach or vomiting attend, he advises assisting the efforts of nature, by drinking plentifully of chamomile <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEA\">tea</a>, warm water, or any other diluting liquor. He concludes with recommending a cooling regimen, rest of body, and tranquillity of mind; prohibiting all kinds of bandage upon the abdomen, and enjoining particular attention to the state of the bowels, which ought to be kept gently open for some time, even after the disorder seems to be gone off, till the patient be quite out of danger.\n\nSo much for the simple treatment: we now proceed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> part, where he describes the method of practice when the disease is in its more irregular and complicated state.\n\nWhen a diarrhoea accompanies the disease, he observes that it ought by no means to be checked, but supported, by ordering the patient to drink plentifully of mild aperient liquors. If the pain of the hypogastric region be attended with stitches in the sides or over the pit of the stomach, and a pulse that resists the finger pretty strongly, he remarks that bleeding would then be highly necessary: declaring, however, his opinion, that, in the puerperal fever, bleeding is to be considered only as a secondary means of relief, though the first in point of time; and it ought to be advised with great caution; and that the greatest dependence is always to be placed upon evacuations by stool.\n\nMr White imputes the puerperal fever to a putrescent disposition of the humours, contracted during pregnancy, and fomented by the hot regimen commonly used by women in childbirth. In conformity to this opinion, the chief means which he recommends for preventing the disease is a cool regimen and free circula-\nPuerperal fever, which he evinces to be of the greatest importance. In respect of bleeding, he informs us, that, upon the strictest inquiry, he cannot find that those who have bled the most copiously have had the greatest success, either in private or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">hospital</a> practice. He even seems to question the propriety of this evacuation in any case; but approves of emetics, cathartics, and elixirs, for cleansing the prime viva, and likewise of such medicines and diets as will correct the putrid humours: adding, that an upright posture and free ventilation are at all times useful, and absolutely necessary, both for the prevention and cure of the disease.\n\nAnother writer who treats of the childbed fever is Dr Leake, who has published the result of his observations on this disease from April 1768 to the autumn of the year 1770; but chiefly from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> 1769 to May 1770, during which period the childbed fever prevailed much about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>.\n\nDr Leake tells us that this fever generally commenced the evening of the second or morning of the third day after delivery, with a rigor or shivering fit. Sometimes it invaded soon after delivery; and at other times though rarely, it has seized so late as the fifth or sixth day. Now and then it seemed to be occasioned by catching cold, or by errors in diet; but oftener by anxiety of mind. Sometimes the thirst was great; though the tongue had, in general, a better appearance at the beginning than is common in other fevers. It was seldom ever black or very foul: but, as the disease advanced, became white and dry, with an increase of thirst; and at last was of a brownish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> towards the root, where it was slightly covered with an inspissated mucus. The loss of strength was so great and sudden, that few of the patients could turn in bed without assistance, even so early as the first or second day after the attack. The lochia, from first to last, were not obstructed, nor deficient in quantity; neither did the quality of this discharge seem to be in the least altered from its natural state; a presumption, says the author, that the uterus was not at all affected. Of this he was convinced by making a considerable pressure above the pubes with the hand, which did not occasion pain; but when the same degree of pressure was applied higher, between the stomach and umbilical region, it became almost intolerable. A perfect crisis seldom if ever happened in this fever, which he imputes to the great oppression of the vital powers, whereby they were rendered unable to produce such an event. When the disease proved mortal, the patient generally died on the 10th or 11th day from the first attack. In those who died of the fever, the omentum was found suppurated; an inflammation of which part, or of the intestines, Dr Leake concludes to be the proximate cause of the disease.\n\nIn consequence of this idea of the cause of the disease, Dr Leake affirms that venesection is the only remedy which can give the patient a chance for life. But, though it be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> resource to be depended upon at the beginning of the fever, he observes that it will seldom prove of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> after the second or third day; and if directed yet later, will only weaken and exhaust the patient; when, matter having begun to form in the omentum, the progress of the disease can no longer be prevented by that evacuation. At this period the blood begins to be tainted by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSORPTION\">absorption</a> of the purulent fluid; and the fever, from being inflammatory, is changed into a putrid nature.\n\nAfter bleeding in such a quantity as the symptoms require, he advises that the corrupted bile be evacuated and corrected as soon as possible; that the diarrhoea, when excessive, be restrained by emollient antidysesthetics and gentle sudorifics, or even by opiates and mild astringents, when the patient's strength begins to sink under the discharge; and, lastly, that where the signs of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUTREFACTION\">putrefaction</a> or intermission take place, antiseptics and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CINCHONA\">cinchona</a> may be administered.\n\nThe great uniformity of the symptoms in all Dr Leake's patients might authorise an opinion, that the fever which he describes was in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> a disease sui generis, and depended much upon the constitution of the air preceding and during the period in which the fever prevailed.\n\nDr Kirkland has also made judicious observations on this subject. He rejects the opinion that the puerperal fever is a disease sui generis, and arises always from the same cause. The particular situation of childbed women, he acknowledges, occasions a similarity in the appearance of all the febrile symptoms: but he affirms that the same kind of fever may be produced by various causes; for instance, by an inflammation of the uterus or abdomen, by putrid blood or other matter, and putrid miasms. The symptoms, he observes, will vary according to the time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEIZURE\">seizure</a>. If the fever happen in three or four days after delivery, all the symptoms usual to the situation of the patient will make their appearance; but if it do not invade till the milk has been secreted, and the lochial discharge be nearly finished, the symptoms, if the breasts are properly drawn, will, for the most part, be those only which are common to that kind of disorder by which the fever has been produced.\n\nWith respect to the cure of puerperal fevers, Dr Kirkland advises the antiphlogistic method when they arise from inflammation; but when this method fails of success, and a diarrhoea supervenes, the disease has changed its nature, having become more or less putrid, and requires a very different treatment.\n\nHis observations relative to the management of the diarrhoea merit attention. No one, says he, would purge and bleed to cure the colliquative fever arising from the absorption of matter in large wounds; and yet the only difference is, that in the puerperal fever the matter absorbed from the uterus, &c., acts with more violence, because the blood is commonly thinner and the habit in a more irritable state. We see, continues he, that absorbed matter purges as effectually as if any purging medicine had been given by the mouth; and may we not therefore do harm by additional purging, when there has been a large evacuation, especially as purges in this case are incapable of entirely removing the fomes morbi?\n\nHe considers cinchona as the principal remedy, as soon as the pulse sinks, the heat is lessened, and the stomach will bear it. If this increase the diarrhoea beyond moderation, he joins with it small doses of laudanum; but if the diarrhoea should entirely stop without the fever going off, in place of laudanum he advises a proper quantity of rhubarb. Should the diarrhoea, notwithstanding the use of the medicines proposed, be\nOf this disease also, as it appeared in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DERBYSHIRE\">Derbyshire</a> and some of the adjacent provinces, an account has been published by Dr. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">Butter</a>. Concerning the causes and nature of the disease, he observes, that pregnancy seems to add much to the natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a> of the female constitution; because at this period women are often subject to a train of nervous symptoms, which never molest them at other times. During gestation likewise, the appetite is for the most part keen, while the digestion appears to be impaired; and this weakness is increased not only by improper food, of which the woman is frequently desirous, but also by the inactivity attending her situation. To these circumstances, it is added, that the intestinal passage being interrupted by the uterine pressure, costiveness generally prevails.\n\nFrom the several observations here enumerated, Dr. Butter concludes, that the proximate cause of the puerperal fever is a spasmodic affection of the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a>, with a morbid accumulation in their cavity; and upon this supposition he endeavours to account for the various symptoms of the disease.\n\nIn treating of the method of cure, he lays <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> two indications; the former of which is to promote two, three, or four stools daily, in a manner suited to the strength of the patient, till such time as they resume a natural appearance. The second indication is to relieve all uneasy symptoms, such as heat, thirst, headache, &c.\n\nWith respect to the opinion entertained by Dr. Butter of the cause of the puerperal fever, it nearly coincides with that of Mr. White. But however plausible it may appear, we are not entirely satisfied that a disease attended with so peculiar symptoms as the puerperal fever can depend principally upon an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRRITABILITY\">irritability</a>, which is not restricted either to the pregnant or puerperal state.\n\nThe late Dr. Thomas Young professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MIDWIFERY\">midwifery</a> in the university of Edinburgh, although he published nothing on the subject of the puerperal fever, wrote a very ingenious dissertation respecting it, which was read in the Philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> of Edinburgh. In that dissertation, after giving a very accurate account of the symptoms of the disease, which coincides very nearly with the account given by others, he endeavours to show, that the puerperal fever, strictly so called, is in every instance the consequence of contagion; but he contends, that the contagious matter of this disease is capable only of producing its effect, in consequence of a peculiar predisposition given by delivery and its consequences. In support of this doctrine, he remarks, that for many years the disease was altogether unknown in the lying-in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARD\">ward</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> Infirmary at Edinburgh; but that after it was once accidentally introduced into the hospital, almost every woman was in a short time after delivery attacked with it; although <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> to delivery, she may have lain, even for weeks together, not only in the same ward with the infected, but even in the very next bed. He remarks, that it was only eradicated from the hospital in consequence of the wards being entirely emptied, thoroughly ventilated, and new painted. After these processes, puerperal females in the hospital remained as free from this disease as formerly. The puerperal fever, according to Dr. Young, has very generally a strong tendency to the typhoid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYPE\">type</a>; although he allows, that in the beginning it is not unfrequently attended with inflammatory symptoms, and even with topical inflammation, particularly in the intestinal canal. On this idea, he considers the puerperal fever as admitting of the same variety of treatment with other affections depending on contagion, in which sometimes an inflammatory, sometimes a putrescent tendency, prevails; such, for example, as smallpox or erysipelas. But from the prevailing putrescent tendency in this affection, he considers the free access of cool air, with the liberal use of antiseptics, as being very generally requisite.\n\nIt deserves to be remarked, that though the several writers who treat of this subject have conducted their method of cure conformably to their particular idea of the cause of the disease, respecting which their sentiments are very different, they seem to have been equally successful in the treatment of their patients. Indeed the several writers differ less from each other in their method of cure than might be expected, where so great an opposition of theoretical sentiment prevails. For after endeavouring to establish indications correspondent to their particular systems, those who contend for the expediency of promoting the intestinal discharge, dissuade not from having recourse to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHLEBOTOMY\">phlebotomy</a> when the disease is attended with inflammatory symptoms; while, on the other hand, the most strenuous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a> for bleeding admit the utility of the former evacuation. It appears, therefore, that a due regulation of the alvine discharge is necessary through the whole course of the fever, but venesection only sometimes.","sp":504,"ep":511},{"h":"WHEN THE PATIENT CAN BY NO OTHER","t":"n the patient can by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> other means be relieved, the operation of paracentesis must be had recourse to, which is described under the article <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SURGERY\">Surgery</a>.\n\nGENUS LXXX.

It seldom attacks children till they are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> months, nor after they are two years old; but it frequently happens in the intermediate space between these two periods. The disease shows itself by a flaccid tumor of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FACE\">face</a>, a loose flabby skin, a swelling of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-ABDOMEN\">abdomen</a>, and falling away of the other parts, especially of the muscles. There are protuberances of the epiphyses of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a>; the jugular veins swell, while the rest decrease; and the legs grow crooked. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> the child has begun to walk before he be seized with this disease, there is a slowness, debility, and tottering in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, which soon brings on a constant desire of sitting, and afterwards of lying <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>; insomuch that nothing at last is moveable but the neck and head. As they grow older, the head is greatly enlarged, with ample sutures; the thorax is compressed on the sides, and the sternum rises up sharp, while the extremities of the ribs are knotty. The abdomen is protuberant, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> and carious. In such patients as have died of this disease, all the solids appear soft and flaccid, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a> dissolved and mucous.\n\nCauses. The rickets may proceed from scrophulous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> venereal taints in the parents, and may be increased by those of the nurse. It is likewise promoted by feeding the child with aqueous and mucous substances, crude <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>, fish, uncleaned farinaceous aliment, and too great a quantity of sweet things.\u2014Sometimes it follows intermittent fevers and chronic disorders; and in short, is caused by anything which tends to debilitate the body, and induce a viscid and unhealthy state of the juices.\n\nPrognosis. The rickets do not usually prove fatal by themselves, but if not cured in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, they make the person throughout <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> deformed in various ways; and often produce very pernicious disorders, such as carious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a> in different parts of the body.\n\nCure. This is to be effected by mild <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHARTICS\">cathartics</a>, alteratives, and tonics, such as are used in other diseases attended with a debility of the system and a vitiated state of the blood and juices. In the Western <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a> of Scotland, the medicine used for the cure of the rickets is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> extracted from the liver of the skate-fish. The method of application is as follows: First, the wrists and ankles are rubbed with the oil in the evening: this immediately raises a fever of several hours <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>. When the fever from the first rubbing subsides, the same parts are rubbed again the night following; and repeatedly as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> as the rubbing of these parts continues to excite the fever.\u2014When no fever can be excited by rubbing the wrists and ankles alone, they are rubbed again along with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-KNEES\">knees</a> and elbows. This increased unction brings on the fever again; and is practised as before, till it no longer has that effect. Then the vertebrae and sides are rubbed, along with the former parts; and this unction, which again brings on the fever, is repeated as the former. When no fever can be any longer excited by this unction, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FLANNEL\">flannel</a> shirt dipped in the oil is put upon the body of the patient: this brings on a more violent and sensible fever than any of the former unctions; and is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> till the cure be completed, which it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> is in a short time.\n\nA German physician, Dr Strack, has lately published a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, in which he recommends the filings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> as a certain remedy in the rickets. This disease, he observes, in general begins with children when they are about 16 months old. It is seldom observed with children before they be one year old, and seldom attacks them after they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> two; and it is very generally worse where it begins early than where it begins late.\nFor effecting a cure, it is, he affirms, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of the utmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> to be able to distinguish, very early, whether a child <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be afflicted with rickets or not. And this, he assures us, may be determined by the following symptoms: Paleness and swelling of the countenance; and in that part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEEKS\">cheeks</a> which should naturally be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> approaching to that of sulphur. When that is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, he directs that a medicine should be immediately had recourse to which will retard the further progress of the disease, and remove what has already taken <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>. For this purpose, he advises that five grains of the filings of iron, and as much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-RHUBARB\">rhubarb</a>, should be rubbed up with ten grains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>, and given for a dose every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> fasting, and every evening an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> before <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SUPPER\">supper</a>. But if considerable looseness should be produced, it will be necessary, at first, to persist in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of one dose only every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>.\n\nAfter a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>'s continuance in this course, according to Dr Strack, there in general ensues a keen appetite for food, quick digestion, and a copious flow of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-URINE\">urine</a>; by means of which the fulness of the face and yellowness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a> are by degrees removed, while the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> colour of the countenance and firmness of the body in general are gradually restored. This practice, he assures us, has never failed of success in any one instance; not even in those children born of parents greatly afflicted with the rickets.\n\nIn addition to the use of chalybeates, great benefit is often also obtained in this disease from the use of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> bath; which under prudent administration, is perhaps one of the most effectual remedies for this complaint with which we are yet acquainted.\n\nMr Bouhme of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, in a late treatise on the subject of rachitis, has endeavoured to prove, that the disease arises from a peculiar acid, and in the cure he particularly recommends phosphate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SODA\">soda</a>, phosphate and muriate of lime; but above all other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> alkaline lotions. The efficacy of these remedies, however, is not yet confirmed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>. And we may conclude with observing, that both in the prevention and cure nothing has been found so successful as cold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BATHING\">bathing</a>.\n\nWhen the bones of rickety children begin to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEND\">bend</a>, they may sometimes be restored to their natural shape by compresses, bolsters, and proper supports. See the article SURGERY.\n\nORDER III. IMPETIGINES.\n\nImpetigines, Sauv. Class X. Ord. V. Sag. Class III. Ord. V.\n\nGENUS LXXXIV. SCROPHULA.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-KING\">King</a>'s Evil.\n\nScrophula, Sauv. gen. 285. Vog. 397. Sag. 121. Struma, Lin. 284.\n\nDescription. This disease shows itself by hard, scirrhouss, and often indolent tumors, which arise by degrees in the glands of the neck, under the chin, armpits, and different parts of the body, but most commonly in the neck, and behind the ears. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of time, the cellular substance, ligaments of the joints, and even the bones themselves, are affected. In scrophula the swellings are much more moveable than those of the scirrhouss kind; they are generally softer, and seldom attended with much pain; they are tedious in coming to suppuration; are very apt to disappear suddenly, and again to rise in some other part of the body. We may likewise mention as characteristic circumstances of this disease, a remarkable softness of the skin, a kind of fulness of the face, generally with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> eyes, and a very delicate complexion.\n\nCauses. A variety of causes have been mentioned as tending to produce scrophula, viz. a crude indigestible food; bad <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>; living in damp, low situations; its being an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> disease, and in some countries endemic, &c. But whatever may in different circumstances be the exciting or predisposing causes of the scrophula, the disease itself either depends upon, or is at least much connected with, a debility of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> in general, and probably of the lymphatic system in particular, the complaint always showing itself by some affections of the latter. And that debility has at least a considerable influence in its production is probable, not only from the manifest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of some of the causes said to be productive of scrophula, but likewise from such remedies as are found most serviceable in the cure, which are all of a tonic invigorating nature.\n\nPrognosis. The scrophula is a distemper which often eludes the most powerful medicines, and therefore physicians cannot with any certainty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> a cure. It is seldom, however, that it proves mortal in a short time, unless it attacks the internal parts, such as the lungs, where it frequently produces <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TUBERCLES\">tubercles</a> that bring on a fatal consumption. When it attacks the joints, it frequently produces ulcers, which continue for a long time, and gradually waste the patient; while in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time the bones become foul and corroded, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> ensues after a long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of misery. The prognosis in this respect must be regulated entirely by the nature of the symptoms.\n\nCure. It was long supposed that scrophula depended upon an acid acrimony of the fluids; and this, it is probable, gave rise to the use of burnt sponge, different kinds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOAP\">soap</a>, and other alkaline substances, as the best remedies for acidity. But although a soreness of the stomach and pruritus does no doubt frequently occur in these complaints, yet this symptom seems to be entirely the consequence of that general relaxation which in scrophula so universally prevails, and which does not render it in the least necessary to suppose a general acceescency of the fluids to take place; as the one very frequently, it is well known, even in other complaints, occurs without the least suspicion of any acid acrimony existing in the other. This is also rendered very probable from the indolent nature of scrophulous tumors, which have been known to subsist for years without giving any uneasiness; which could not have been the case, if an acid, or any other acrimony, had prevailed in them.\n\nIn the treatment of scrophula, different morbid conditions, existing in different parts, require, according to circumstances, various means of cure: but, upon the whole, the remedies directed may be considered as used with a view either to the tumors, to the ulcerations, or to the general state of the system.\nGentle mercurials are sometimes of use as resolvents in scrophulous swellings; but nothing has such considerable influence as a frequent and copious use of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CINCHONA\">cinchona</a>. Cold bathing too, especially in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, together with frequent moderate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a>, is often of singular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> here; as is likewise change of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, especially to a warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>.\n\nIn the scrophulous inflammation of the eyes, or ophthalmia strumosa, the cinchona has also been given with extraordinary advantage; and we meet with an instance of its having cured the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUTTA\">gutta</a> rosacea in the face; a complaint which it is often difficult to remove, and which is extremely disagreeable to the fair <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEX\">sex</a>.\n\nFrom the various cases related of tumefied glands, it appears, that when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> is relaxed and the circulation weak, either from constitution or accident, cinchona is a most efficacious medicine, and that it acts as a resolvent and discutient. It will not, however, succeed in all cases; but there are few in which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> can be attended with much detriment. Dr Fothergill observes, that he has never known it avail much where the bones were affected, nor where the scrophulous tumor was so situated as to be accompanied with much pain, as in the joints, or under the membranous coverings of the muscles; for when the disease attacks those parts, the periosteum seldom escapes without some injury, by which the bone will of course be likewise affected. Here cinchona is of no effect: instead of lessening, it rather increases the fever that accompanies those circumstances: and, if it do not really aggravate the complaint, it seems at least to accelerate the progress of the disease.\n\nVarious are the modes in which cinchona is administered: Dr Fothergill makes use of a decoction, with the addition of some aromatic ingredients and a small quantity of liquorice-root, as a form in which a sufficient quantity may be given without exciting disgust. But where it is easily retained in the stomach in substance, perhaps the best form of exhibiting it is that of powder; and in this state it is often advantageously conjoined with powder of cicuta, an article possessing very great deobstruent powers.\n\nThe powder, however, soon becomes disagreeable to very young patients; and the extract seems not so much to be depended upon as may have been imagined. In making the extract, it is exposed to so much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, as must have some effect upon its virtues, perhaps to their detriment. In administering it, likewise, if great care be not taken to mix it intimately with a proper vehicle, or some very soluble substance, in weak bowels it very often purges, and thereby not only disappoints the physician, but injures the patient. A small quantity of the cortex Winteranus added gives the medicine a grateful warmth; and a little liquorice, a few raisins, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUM\">gum</a> arabic or the like, added to the decoction before it be taken from the fire, by making the liquor viscid enables it to suspend more of the fine particles of the bark; by which process the medicine is not only improved in efficacy, but at the same time rendered less disagreeable.\n\nIn indolent swellings of the glands from viscid humours, sea-water has been strongly recommended by Dr Russell.\n\nDr Fothergill also acquaints us, that the cicuta even by itself is not without a considerable share of efficacy in removing scrophulous disorders. He mentions the case of a gentlewoman, about 28 years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, afflicted from her infancy with scrophulous complaints, severe ophthalmies, glandular swellings, &c., cured by the extractum cicutea taken constantly for the space of a year. He observes, however, that when given to children, even in very small doses, it is apt to produce spasmodic affections; for which reason he rarely exhibits it to them when very young, or even to adults of very irritable habits.\n\nDr Fothergill gives several other instances of the success of cicuta in scrophulous cases, and even in one which seemed to be not far removed from a confirmed phthisis; but owns that it seldom had such good effects afterwards: yet he is of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that where there are symptoms of tubercles forming, a strumous habit, and a tendency to phthisis, the cicuta will often be serviceable. It is anodyne, corrects acrimony, and promotes the formation of good matter. With regard to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of the medicine, he observes, that the extract prepared from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-HEMLOCK\">hemlock</a> before the plant arrives at maturity, is much inferior to that which is made when the hemlock has acquired its full vigour, and is rather on the verge of decline: <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JUST\">just</a> when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a> fade, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> of the seeds become observable, and the habit of the plant inclines to yellow; this, he thinks, is the proper time to collect the hemlock. It has then had the full benefit of the summer heat; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> that grow in exposed places will generally be found more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> than those that grow in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a>. The less heat it undergoes during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a>, the better. Therefore, if a considerable quantity of the dry powder of the plant gathered at a proper season be added, less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> will be necessary, and the medicine will be the more efficacious. But let the extract be prepared in what manner soever it may, provided it be made from the genuine plant, at a proper season, and be not destroyed by boiling, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> observable in using it is, that a larger quantity of one kind is required to produce a certain effect than of another. Twenty grains of one sort of extract have been found equal in point of efficacy to thirty, nay near forty, of another; yet both of them made from the genuine plant, and most probably prepared with equal fidelity. To prevent the inconveniences arising from this uncertainty, it seems always expedient to begin with small doses, and proceed step by step till the extract produces certain effects, which seldom fail to arise from a full dose. These effects are different in different constitutions. But, for the most part, a giddiness affecting the head, and motions of the eyes, as if something pushed them outwards, are first felt; a slight sickness, and trembling agitation of the body; a laxative stool or two. One or all of these symptoms are the marks of a full dose, let the quantity in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> be what it will. Here we must stop till none of these effects be felt; and in three or four days advance a few grains more. For it has been supposed by most of those who have used this medicine to any good purpose, that the cicuta seldom procures any benefit, though given for a long time, unless in as large a dose as the patient can bear without suffering any of the inconveniences above mentioned. There is however reason to believe, that its effects, as a discutient, are in no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> dependent on its narcotic powers; and\nand we are inclined to think, that recourse is often had to larger doses than are necessary; or at least that the same benefit might be derived from smaller ones continued for an equal length of time.\n\nPatients commonly bear a greater quantity of the extract at night than at noon, and at noon than in the morning. Two drams may be divided into thirty pills. Adults begin with two in the morning, two at noon, and three or four at night, with directions to increase each dose, by the addition of a pill to each, as they can bear it.\n\nBut, after all, the best form under which the cincta can, we think, be exhibited, is that of powder from the leaves. This, either under the form of powder or made into pills, may be given at first to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of four or five grains, and the dose gradually rising till it amount to 15 or 20 grains twice or thrice a day. Given to this extent, particularly when conjoined with cinchona, it has often been found of great service in scrophulous cases. At the same time it must be allowed, that such patients, after resisting every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of cure, will have in some instances a spontaneous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a> in the progress of life, probably from the system acquiring additional vigour.\n\nDifferent mineral waters, particularly the sulphureous ones, as those of Harrogate, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOFFAT\">Moffat</a>, and Gillsland, have been much recommended in scrofula, and sometimes productive of benefit. Recourse has sometimes also been had with advantage to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZINC\">zinc</a>, iron, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARYTES\">barytes</a>, particularly muriate of barites. But as well as in rachitis, no remedy has been found more efficacious in scrofula than cold bathing, especially sea-bathing.\n\nGENUS LXXXV. SYPHILIS.\n\nLues Venerea, or French Pox.\n\nSypilis, Sauv. gen. 3086. Lin. 6. Vog. 319. Sag. 126.\nLues venerea, Boerh. 1440. Hoffm. III. 413. Junck. 96. Astruc de Lue Venerea.\n\nDr Astruc, who writes a very accurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of the lues venerea, is fully convinced that it is a new disease, which never appeared in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> till some time between the years 1494 and 1496, having been imported from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a> by the companions of Christopher Columbus; though this opinion is not without its opponents. Dr Sanches in particular has contended with much learning and ability, that it appeared in Europe at an earlier <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>: But it is at least certain that it was altogether unknown to the medical practitioners of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a> and Rome, and that it was a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> disease in America when the Europeans first visited that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. But at whatever period it may have been introduced into Europe, or from whatever source it may have been obtained, there can be no doubt that, as well as smallpox or measles, syphilis depends on a peculiar specific contagion; on a matter sui generis, which is alone capable of inducing this disease.\n\nThe venereal infection, however, cannot, like the contagious miasmata of the smallpox and some other diseases, be carried through the air, and thus spread from place to place: for unless it is transmitted from the parents to the children, there is no other way of contracting the disease but from actual contact with the infectious matter. Thus, when a nurse happens to labour under the disease, the infant that she suckles will receive the infection; as, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, when the child is infected, the nurse is liable to receive it; and there have even been instances known of lying-in women being infected very violently, from having employed a person to draw their breasts who happened to have venereal ulcers in the throat. It may be caught by touching venereal sores, if the cuticle be abraded or torn: and in this way accoucheurs and midwives have sometimes been infected severely. Dr Macbride says, the most inveterate pox he ever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> was caught by a midwife, who happened to have a whitlow on one of her fingers when she delivered a woman ill of the lues venerea.\n\nBut by far the most ready way of contracting this disease is by coition, the genital parts being much more bibulous than the rest of the body. When the disorder is communicated, the places where the morbific matter enters are generally those where it first makes its appearance; and as coition is the most usual way of contracting it, so the first symptoms commonly appear on or near the pudenda.\n\nThe patient's own account will, for the most part, help us to distinguish the disease: but there are sometimes cases wherein we cannot avail ourselves of this information, and where, instead of confessing, the parties shall conceal all circumstances; while, on the other hand, there are now and then people to be met with, who persuade themselves that symptoms are venereal, which in reality are owing to some other cause: and therefore it is of the utmost importance to inform ourselves thoroughly of the nature of those symptoms and appearances which may be considered as pathognomic signs of lues venerea.\n\nIn the first place, when we find that the local symptoms, such as chancres, buboes, phymosis, and the like, do not give way to the usual methods; or when these complaints, after having been cured, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> out again without a fresh infection; we may justly suspect that the virus has entered the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of fluids: but if at the same time ulcers break out in the throat, and the face is deformed by callous tubercles, covered with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> or yellow scab, we may be assured that the case is now become a confirmed lues, which will require a mercurial course.\n\nWhen eruptions of the furfuraceous and superficial kind are venereal, they are not attended with itching; and the scale being picked off, the skin appears of a reddish brown, or rather <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a> colour, underneath; whereas leprous eruptions are itchy, throw off a greater quantity of scales, and rise in greater blotches, especially about the joints of the knees and elbows. Venereal tubercles or pustules are easily distinguished from carbuncles of the face, by not occupying the cheeks or the nose, nor as having a purulent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APEX\">apex</a>, but are covered at top, either with a dry branny scurf like the superficial eruptions just now mentioned, or else with a hard dry scab of a tawny yellow hue; they particularly break out among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> or near to it, on the forehead or on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a>.\n\nVenereal ulcers affecting the mouth are distinguishable from those which are scorbutic, in the following manner: 1. Venereal ulcers first affect the tonsils, fau-\nces and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UVULA\">uvula</a>; then the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GUMS\">gums</a>, but these very rarely: on the contrary, scorbutic ulcers affect the gums first of all; then the fauces, tonsils, and uvula. 2. Venereal ulcers frequently spread to the nose; scorbutic ones almost never. 3. Venereal ulcers are callous in the edges; scorbutic ones are not so. 4. Venereal ulcers are circumscribed, and, for the most part, are circular, at least they are confined to certain places; scorbutic ones are of a more regular form, spread wider, and frequently affect the whole mouth. 5. Venereal ulcers are for the most part hollow, and generally covered at bottom with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> or yellow slough; but scorbutic ones are more apt to grow up into loose fungi. 6. Venereal ulcers are red in their circumference, but scorbutic ones are always livid. 7. Venereal ulcers frequently rot the subjacent bones, the scorbutic ones seldom or never. 8. And lastly, Venereal ulcers are generally combined with other symptoms which are known to be venereal; scorbutic ones with the distinguishing signs of the scurvy, such as difficult breathing, listlessness, swelling of the legs, rotten gums, &c.\n\nAnother strong sign of the confirmed lues is often afforded from certain deep-seated nocturnal pains, particularly of the shins, arms, and head. As for any superficial wandering pains that have no fixed seat, and which affect the membranes of the muscles, and ligaments of the joints, they, for the most part, will be found to belong to the gout or rheumatism, and can never be considered as venereal, unless accompanied with some other evident signs; but with regard to the pains that are deeply-seated, and always fixed to the same place, and which affect the middle and more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> part of the ulna, tibia, and bones of the cranium, and rage chiefly and with greatest violence in the forepart of the night, so that the patient can get no rest till morning approaches, these may serve to convince us that the disease has spread itself throughout the whole habit, whether they be accompanied with other symptoms of the lues or not. Gummata in the fleshy parts, nodes in the periosteum, ganglia upon the tendons, tophi upon the ligaments, crostoses upon the bones, and fisti at the verge of the anus, are all of them signs of the confirmed lues: these are hard indolent swellings; but as they sometimes arise independently of any venereal infection, and perhaps may proceed from a scrophulous taint, unless they be accompanied or have been preceded by some of the more certain and evident symptoms of the lues, we must be cautious about pronouncing them venereal. When these swellings are not owing to the siphilitic virus, they are very seldom painful, or tend to inflame and suppurate, whereas those that are venereal usually do, and if they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> upon a bone generally bring on a caries.\n\nThese curious ulcers are most commonly met with upon the ulna, tibia, and bones of the cranium; and when accompanied with nocturnal pains, we can never hesitate about declaring their genuine nature. Frequent abortions, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXCLUSION\">exclusion</a> of scabby, ulcerated, half-rotten, and dead foetuses, happening without any manifest cause to disturb the fetus before its time, or to destroy it in the womb, may be reckoned as a sign that at least one of the parents is infected.\n\nThese then are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> and most evident signs of the confirmed lues. There are others which are more equivocal, and which, unless we can fairly trace them back to some that are more certain, cannot be held as signs of the venereal disease: Such are, 1. Obstinate inflammations of the eyes, frequently returning, with great heat, itching, and ulceration of the eyelids. 2. A singing and hissing noise in the ears, with ulcers or caries in the bones of the meatus auditorius. 3. Obstinate headaches. 4. Obstinate cutaneous eruptions, of the itchy or leprous appearance, not yielding to the milder methods of treatment. 5. Swellings of the bones; and, 6. Wandering and obstinate pains. None of these symptoms, however, can be known to be venereal, except they happen to coincide with some one or other of the more certain signs.\n\nIt may, perhaps, be considered as a singularity in this disease, that the diagnosis is often more difficult in the advanced than in the early periods of the affection. That is, with those who have been certainly subjected to syphilis, it is often very difficult to say whether certain symptoms, remaining after the ordinary modes of cure have been employed, be siphilitic or not. Very frequently, as appears from the sequel, nocturnal pains, ulcerations, and the like, remaining after a long course of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a> has been employed, are in no degree of a venereal nature, but are in reality to be considered as consequences rather of the remedy than the disease; and are accordingly best removed by nourishing diet, gentle exercise, and tonics. But as long as any symptoms of any kind remain, it is often impossible to convince some patients that they are cured; and it is often impossible for a physician with certainty to affirm that the disease is altogether overcome.\n\nUpon the whole, we are first to distinguish and consider the several symptoms apart; and then, by comparing them with each other, a clear judgment may be formed upon the general review.\n\nPrognosis. Being thoroughly convinced that the case is venereal, we are to consider, first of all, whether it be of a longer or shorter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a>; for the more recent it is, it will, ceteris paribus, be less difficult to remove. But there are other circumstances which will assist us in forming a prognostic as to the event. As,\n\n1. The age of the patient. This disorder is more dangerous to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANTS\">infants</a> and old people, than to such as are in the flower and vigour of life, in whom some part of the virus may be expelled by exercise, or may be subdued in some degree by the strength of the constitution.\n\n2. The sex. Though women are for the most part weaker than men, and therefore should seem less able to resist the force of any disease, yet experience shows that this is easier borne by them than by men; perhaps owing to the menstrual and other uterine discharges, by which a good portion of the virus may be carried off immediately from the parts where it was first applied; for it is observable, that whenever these discharges are obstructed, or cease by the ordinary course of nature, all the symptoms of this disease grow worse.\n\n3. The habit of body. Persons who have acid juices will be liable to suffer more from the venereal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-POISON\">poison</a> than such as have their blood in a milder state; hence, when people of a scorbutic or scrophulous habit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> venereal disorders, the symptoms are always remarkably violent, and difficult to cure. And\nfor the same reasons, the confirmed lues is much more to be dreaded in a person already inclined to an asthma, phthisis, dropsy, gout, or any other chronic distemper, than in one of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> and healthy constitution. For as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> disease is increased by the accession of the venereal poison, so the lues is aggravated by being joined to an old disorder. The more numerous the symptoms, and the more they affect the bones, the more difficult the cure. Of all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a> the union of syphilis with scrofula is perhaps the most difficult to overcome; but if the acrimony should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> on the nobler internal parts, such as the brain, the lungs or the liver, then the disease becomes incurable, and the patient will either go off suddenly in an apoplectic fit, or sink under a consumption.\n\nCurr. Viewing this disease as depending on a peculiar contagious matter introduced into the system, and multiplied there, it is possible to conceive that a cure may be obtained on one of three principles; either by the evacuation of the matter from the system, by the destruction of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a>, or by counteracting its influence in the system. It is not impossible that articles exist in nature capable of removing this complaint on each of these grounds: but we may venture at least to assert, that few such are yet discovered. Notwithstanding numbers of pretended infallible remedies for syphilis, mercury is perhaps the only article on which dependence is placed among European practitioners; and with regard to its mode of operation, all the three different opinions pointed out have been adopted and supported by different theorists.\u2014But although many ingenious arguments have been employed in support of each, we are, upon the whole, inclined to think it more probable that mercury operates by destroying the activity of the venereal virus, than that it has effect either by evacuating it, or by exciting a state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> by which its influence is counteracted. Some practitioners have affirmed, that the disease may be totally extirpated without the use of mercury; but, excepting in slight cases, it appears from the most accurate observations, that this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> specific is indispensible; whether it be introduced through the pores of the skin, in the form of ointments, plasters, washes, &c.; or given by the mouth, disguised in the different shapes of pills, troches, powders, or solutions.\n\nFormerly it was held as a rule, that a salivation ought to be raised, and a great discharge excited. But this is now found to be unnecessary: for as mercury probably acts by some specific power in subduing and correcting the venereal virus, all that is required is to throw in a sufficient quantity of the medicine for this purpose: and if it can be diverted from the salivary glands so much the better, since the inconveniences attending a spitting are such as we should always wish to avoid.\n\nMercury, when combined with any saline substance, has its activity prodigiously increased; hence the great variety of chemical preparations which have been contrived to unite it with different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a>.\n\nCorrosive sublimate, or the murias hydrargyri corrosivus, is one of the most active of all the mercurial preparations, insomuch as to become a poison even in very small doses. It therefore cannot safely be given in substance; but must be dissolved in order to render it capable of a more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a>. We may see, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> into Wiseman, that this is an old medicine, though seldom given by regular practitioners. How it came to be introduced into so remote a part of the world as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SIBERIA\">Siberia</a>, is not easily found out; but Dr Clerc, author of the Histoire Naturelle de l'Homme Malade, assures us, that the sublimate solution has been in use there time out of mind.\n\nIt appears to have been totally forgotten in other places, until of late years, when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARON\">Baron</a> Van Swieten brought it into vogue; so that at one period, if we may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> Dr Locker, they used no other mercurial preparation at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIENNA\">Vienna</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of patients cured by this remedy alone in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">hospital</a> of St Mark, which is under the care of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>, from 1754 to 1761 inclusive, being 4885.\n\nThe method of preparing the solution is, to dissolve as much sublimate in any kind of ardent spirit (at Vienna they use only corn brandy) as will give half a grain to an ounce of solution. The dose to a grown person is one spoonful mixed with a pint of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> pisan or barley water, and this is to be taken morning and evening: the patients should keep principally in a warm chamber, and lie in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BED\">bed</a> to sweat after taking the medicine; their diet should be light; and they ought to drink plentifully throughout the day, of whey, pisan, or barley water. If the solution does not keep the belly open, a mild purge must be given from time to time; for Locker observes, that those whom it purges two or three times a-day, get well sooner than those whom it does not purge: he also says, that it very seldom affects the mouth, but that it promotes the urinary and cutaneous discharges. This course is not only to be continued till all the symptoms disappear, but for some weeks longer. The shortest time in which Locker used to let the patients out was six weeks; and they were continued on a course of decoction of the woods for some weeks after they left off the solution.\n\nThis method has been introduced both in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>, though by no means to the exclusion of others; but it appears, that the solution does not turn out so infallible a remedy, either in these kingdoms, or in France, as they say it has done in Germany. It was seldom if ever found to perform a radical cure, and the frequent use of it proved in many cases highly prejudicial. It has therefore been succeeded in practice, even at Vienna, by mercury exhibited in other forms; and, among these, by a remedy first recommended by Dr Plenck, and since improved by Dr Saunders; consisting of mercury united with mucilage of gum arabic, which is said to render its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXHIBITION\">exhibition</a> perfectly mild and safe. For particulars, we refer to Dr Saunders's treatise.\n\nBut a late French writer, supposed to be Dr Petit, in a small book, entitled, A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> of the different methods of treating the venereal disease, insists, that there is neither certainty nor safety in any other method than the repeated frictions with mercurial ointment.\n\nIf, therefore, it is determined to have recourse to the mercurial frictions, the patient may with advantage be prepared by going into the warm bath some days successively; having been previously blooded if of a plethoric habit, and taking a dose or two of some proper cathartic.\nThe patient being fitted with the necessary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> of flannels, is then to enter on the course.\n\nIf he be of a robust habit and in the prime of life, we may begin with two drams of the unguentum hydrargyri fortius, (Ph. Lond.) which is to be rubbed in about the ankles by an assistant whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> are covered with bladders: then having intermitted a day, we may expend two drams more of the ointment, and rest for two days; after which, if no soreness of the mouth comes on, use only one dram; and at every subsequent friction ascend till the ointment shall reach the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a> of the body; after which the rubbings are to be begun at the wrists, and from thence gradually extended to the shoulders. In order to prevent the mercury from laying too much hold of the mouth, it must be diverted to the skin, by keeping the patient in a constant perspiration from the warmth of the room, and by drinking plentifully of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-BARLEY_WATER\">barley-water</a>, whey, or pisan; but if, nevertheless, the mercury should tend to raise a spitting, then, from time to time, we are either to give some gentle cathartic, or order the patient into a vapour or warm bath; and thus we are to go on, rubbing in a dram of the ointment every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, third, or fourth night, according as it may be found to operate; and on the intermediate days either purging or bathing, unless we should choose to let the salivation come on; which, however, it is much better to avoid, as we shall thus be able to throw in a larger quantity of mercury.\n\nIt is impossible to ascertain the quantity of mercury that may be necessary to be rubbed in, as this will vary according to circumstances: but we are always to continue the frictions, for a fortnight at least, after all symptoms of the disease shall have totally disappeared; and when we have done with the mercury, warm bathing, and sudorific decoctions of the woods, are to be continued for some time longer.\n\nThis is a general sketch of the methods of treatment for the confirmed lues; but for a complete history of the disease, and for ample directions in every situation, we refer to Astruc, and his abridger Dr Chapman.\u2014We have to add, however, that a method of curing this disease by mercurial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUMIGATION\">fumigation</a> has been lately recommended in France, but it seems not to meet with great encouragement. One of the most recent proposals for the cure of the venereal disease is that of Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLARE\">Clare</a>, and consists in rubbing a small quantity of mercury under the form of the submuriac hydrargyri, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CALOMEL\">calomel</a> as it is commonly called, on the inside of the cheek; by which means it has been supposed that we will not only avoid the inconveniences of unction, but also the purgative effects that are often produced by this medicine when taken into the stomach. But after all, the introduction of mercury under the form of unction, as recommended by the latest and best writers in Britain on the venereal disease, Dr Swediaar, Mr John Hunter, and others, is still very generally preferred to any mode that has yet been proposed.\n\nWhere, after a long trial of mercury, distressing symptoms still remain, particularly obstinate ulcerations and severe pains, benefit has often been derived from the use of opium: but there is little reason to believe, as has been held by some, that of itself it affords an infallible cure of this disease; at least we are inclined to think, that all the facts hitherto brought in support of the cure of syphilis by opium are at the utmost very doubtful.\n\nThe same observation may perhaps be made with regard to another remedy which has of late been highly extolled in syphilis, viz. the nitric acid. This article seems to have been first introduced both against affections of the liver and venereal complaints by Dr Scott of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BOMBAY\">Bombay</a>. It has since been highly extolled by Dr Beddoes and other writers in Britain. And there are many well authenticated cases on record in which it has produced a cure. But it is very rarely preferable to mercury; and it is chiefly useful when, from some peculiarity of constitution, mercury cannot be exhibited.\n\nIn obstinate ulcerations, remaining probably after the venereal virus has been overcome, and resisting the use of mercury, a complete cure has in many instances been obtained from the use of the root of the mezereon, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DAPHNE\">daphne</a> mezereum of Linn\u00e6us. This article has been chiefly employed under the form of decoction; and it now appears that it is the basis of an article at one time highly celebrated in venereal complaints, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LISBON\">Lisbon</a> diet drink. But, upon the whole, these sequelae of this disease are perhaps more readily overcome by country air, gentle exercise, and nourishing diet, particularly a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILK\">milk</a> diet, than by the use of any medicine whatever. It must indeed be allowed, that for combating different sequelae, various practices accommodated to the nature of these will on particular occasions be requisite. But into the consideration of these we cannot here propose to enter.\n\nGENUS LXXXVI. SCORBUTUS.","sp":465,"ep":471},{"h":"WHETHER THERE BE ANY OTHER","t":"r there be any other means of radically curing the gout, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">Doctor</a> is not able to say. There are histories of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> of the gout, in which it is said, that by great emotions of mind, by wounds, and by other accidents, the symptoms have been suddenly relieved, and never again returned; but how far these accidental cures might be imitated by art, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> would succeed in other cases, is at least extremely uncertain.\n\nThe practices proper and necessary in the treatment of the gout, are to be considered under two heads: First, As they are to be employed in the intervals of paroxysms; or, secondly, As during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of these. In the intervals of paroxysms, the indications are, to prevent altogether the return of paroxysms; or at least to render them less frequent and more moderate. During the time of paroxysms, the indications are, to moderate the violence and shorten the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> of them as much as can be done with safety.\n\nIt has been already observed, that the gout may be entirely prevented by constant bodily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a>, and by a low diet; and Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CULLEN\">Cullen</a> is of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that this prevention may take <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> even in persons who have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> disposition to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>. Even when the disposition has discovered itself by several paroxysms of inflammatory gout, he is persuaded that labour and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTINENCE\">abstinence</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WILL\">will</a> absolutely prevent any returns of it for the rest of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. These, therefore, are the means of answering the first indication to be pursued in the intervals of paroxysms.\n\nExercise in persons exposed to the gout, in Dr Cullen's opinion, operates by answering two purposes: One of these is the strengthening of the tone of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> vessels; and the other, the guarding against a plethoric state. For the former, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> exercise be employed early in life, and before intemperance has weakened the body, a very moderate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of it will answer the purpose; and, for the latter, if abstinence be at the same time observed, less exercise will be necessary.\n\nWith respect to exercise, this in general is to be observed, that it should never be violent; for if violent, it cannot be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>, and must always endanger the bringing on an atony in proportion to the violence of the preceding motions.\n\nIt is also to be observed, that the exercise of gestation, though considerable and constant, will not, if it be entirely without bodily exercise, answer the purpose of preventing the gout. For this end, therefore, the exercise must be in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> that of the body; and must be moderate, but at the same time constant and continued through life.\n\nIn every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> and circumstance of the gout in which the patient retains the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a>, bodily exercise, in the intervals of paroxysms, will be always useful; and in the beginning of the disease, when the disposition to it is not yet strong, exercise may prevent a paroxysm which otherwise would have come on. In more advanced <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> of the disease, however, when there is some disposition to a paroxysm, much walking will bring it on; either as it weakens the tone of the lower extremities, or as it excites an inflammatory disposition in them; and thus it seems to be that sprains or contusions often bring on a paroxysm of the gout.\n\nAbstinence, the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the regimen for preventing the gout, is of more difficult application. If an abstinence from animal food be entered upon early in life, while the vigour of the system is yet entire, Dr Cullen has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> doubt of its being both safe and effectual; but if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a> for this diet shall not have occurred till the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> has been broken by intemperance, or by the decline of life, a low diet may then endanger the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDUCTION\">induction</a> of an atonic state.\n\nFurther, If a low diet be entered upon only in the decline of life, and be at the same time a very great change from the former manner of living, the withdrawing of an accustomed stimulus of the system may readily throw it into an atonic state.\n\nThe safety of an abstemious course will be greater or less according to the management of it. Animal food especially disposes to the plethoric and inflammatory state, and that food is to be therefore especially avoided; but on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, vegetable aliment of the lowest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> is in danger of weakening the system too much by not affording sufficient nourishment, and more particularly of weakening the tone of the stomach by its acescence. It is therefore a diet of a middle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> that is to be chosen; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MILK\">milk</a> is precisely of this kind, as containing both animal and vegetable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>.\n\nAs approaching to the nature of milk, and as being a vegetable matter containing the greatest portion of nourishment, the farinaceous seeds are next to be chosen, and are the food most proper to be joined with milk.\n\nWith respect to drink, fermented liquors are useful only when they are joined with animal food, and that by their acescence; and their stimulus is only necessary from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>. When, therefore, animal food is to be avoided, fermented liquors are unnecessary; and by increasing the acescence of vegetables, these liquors may be hurtful. The stimulus of fermented or spirituous liquors is not necessary to the young and vigorous, and when much employed impairs the tone of the system. These liquors, therefore, are to be avoided, excepting as custom and the declining state of the system may have rendered them necessary. For preventing or moderating the regular gout, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> is the only proper drink.\n\nWith respect to an abstemious course, it has been supposed, that an abstinence from animal food and fermented liquors, or the living upon milk and farinacea alone for the space of one year, might be sufficient for a radical cure of the gout: and it is possible that, at a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of life, in certain circumstances of the constitution, such a measure might answer the purpose. But this is very doubtful: and it is more probable, that the abstinence must, in a great measure, be continued, and the milk diet be persisted in, for the remainder of life. It is well known, that several persons who had entered on an abstemious course, and had been thereby delivered from the gout, have, however, upon returning to their former manner of full living, had the disease return upon them with as much violence.\nviolence as before, or in a more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> and more dangerous form.\n\nIt has been alleged, that, for preventing the return of the gout, blood-letting or scarifications of the feet, frequently repeated, and at stated times, may be practised with advantage; but of this Dr Cullen tells us he has had no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>; and the benefit of the practice is not, as far as we know, confirmed by the observation of any other practitioner.","sp":365,"ep":366}]
